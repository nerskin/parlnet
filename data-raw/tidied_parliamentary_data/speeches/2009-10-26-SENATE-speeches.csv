"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2009-10-26,"—My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. On average, every day in Australia 35 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and seven women die from the disease. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare predicts more than 15,000 Australian women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015. In light of the statistics released today, national breast cancer day, will the national breast cancer screening program be expanded to include the recommended age groups of 45 to 49 and 70 to 74 and invite them to participate in the program?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Breast Cancer</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2009-10-26,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2009-10-26,"—Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. The first $10 million of the $120 million that has been allocated for new digital mammography machines is due to be expended this financial year. Has any of this money yet been spent on new machines? If not, when is this going to start?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Breast Cancer</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I thank Senator Adams for her question. If you look at the statistics, BreastScreen Australia is one of the best breast cancer screening programs in the world. The program reduced the mortality rate in the 50 to 69 age group by between 21 and 28 per cent. In addition, participation rates increased from 51.4 per cent in 1996-97 to 56.2 per cent in 2004-05. Estimated spending on breast cancer screening by all governments was $133.9 million. It is an important program and BreastScreen Australia is one of the best breast cancer screening programs in the world. Since 1991, the Commonwealth has been working with the states and territories to provide free biennial mammograms to women aged between 50 and 69, with women aged from 40 to 49 years and over 70 also eligible to attend.
Going to the issues raised in the question, an important study led by Dr Helen Zorbas from the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre demonstrates the effectiveness and value of BreastScreen Australia. Dr Zorbas and her team of local and international experts conducted the first comprehensive evaluation in the world of a population based breast screening program. The report found that the program was well accepted by women, was broadly accessible and was cost effective. On the issue of participation, the report found that the program was well accepted by women and that participation by women in the target group increased from 51.4 per cent in 1996-97 to 56.2 per cent in 2004-05.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I thank Senator Adams for the supplementary question. The Rudd government have moved to address some of these capacity issues highlighted by the report and areas where the program can be improved, such as increasing the participation of Indigenous women. It is not only about ensuring that we get more participation. On radiographers and capacity issues, there is the $120 million investment in this year’s budget to replace BreastScreen’s outdated equipment with state-of-the-art mammography equipment. We are about ensuring that we have up-to-date equipment for use by BreastScreen Australia and to that extent $120 million has been invested. The expert committee provided us with 19 recommendations to improve, better target and expand the program. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-26,"—As I indicated, the expert committee provided us with 19 recommendations to improve, better target and expand the program. On the broader issue of how much has been spent to date, this is a question I will need to take on notice to refer to the Minister for Health and Ageing.
From February of this year, the government introduced Medicare rebates for MRI scans for women under 50 at risk of breast cancer with no symptoms. The federal, state and territory governments are jointly considering the options presented in the report that I mentioned earlier. Of course, the recommendations will be discussed further at the Australian Health Ministers Conference in November. BreastScreen is an important program and I can assure all senators it will continue—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The $120 million was a budget measure, and I ask the minister: has any of this money been spent on the new machines and, if not, when is it going to start?
—I draw the minister’s attention to the question.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-10-26,"—I move:
That—
the Senate take note of the minister’s response; and
there be laid on the table no later than 27 October 2008, the answers to questions on notice nos 2043 and 2044.
The questions I asked are directly relevant to one of the budget cuts which the Senate will have to deal with this week, specifically in relation to the Rudd government’s announce-ment on budget night that the government would cut the rebate for cataract surgery by 50 per cent. It is a very ill considered and short sighted budget cut. It is one which will hurt patients and will force those in need of access to this particular surgery into the public system. It is a budget cut that will lead to terrible health outcomes.
We went through this issue in some detail during Senate estimates last week. I asked questions of the health department officials as to whether the department had consulted any ophthalmologists and whether there had been any attempts to work through how this MBS rebate cut would work through the system. Mr Kingdom, from the Department of Health and Ageing, took the question and said:
I will take this. It was a budget decision, Senator. But since then the minister invited the ophthalmologists to put alternative views up if they felt that this was an incorrect approach—
Which of course they have. But Mr Kingdom told the Senate estimates committee—
… and they have failed to really negotiate or discuss any alternative—which is really in contrast to what happened with assisted reproductive technology, where we did have a very productive negotiation with the people there …
A lot of the ophthalmologists took serious offence at this particular statement. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, has tried, in her usual way, to demonise a group of Australians while trying to sell a particular agenda of the Rudd government. She has been out there pointing at the ‘rich’ ophthalmologists who, in her view, are making too much money and saying that that is the reason to cut this particular rebate. We have an official of the Department of Health and Ageing who says nobody came forward with any suggestions as to how we could achieve savings in a particular, more sensible, way. But the reality is that those ophthalmologists who have contacted me over the last few days have pointed out that they actually made three very specific and very constructive suggestions. One of them relates to a proposal to save, in their view, about $100 million a year through allowing Avastin to be covered under the 42740 item number on the MBS schedule to allow patients to get a reimbursement for treatment of macular degeneration, and I understand that this proposal was discussed both with the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and the Minister for Health and Ageing.
As it turns out, I actually asked a whole series of questions in relation to exactly that particular proposition, all the way back on 28 and 29 July. That is nearly 90 days ago. This is an issue which has serious implications for a vulnerable, mostly elderly, group of Australians who need access to this sort of treatment to help prevent falls, hip breakings and a whole series of other negative health consequences that could be prevented with access to proper treatment. All the minister can do is pursue this cold hearted budget cut. While the Rudd government are increasing spending everywhere else, they are cutting spend-ing in the health portfolio. In particular they are cutting spending in relation to healthcare services accessed by those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs through the private system. Seventy per cent of this cataract surgery across Australia is provided through the private system, which is of course why this ideologically driven government is so enthusiastic about pursuing this particular budget cut.
I asked a series of questions that deserve some answers before we have to deal with this and I will just take the Senate through them. Bear in mind that this cataract rebate cut is due to take effect this weekend on 1 November. At this point those regulations have not been tabled in the Senate. They were tabled in the House of Representatives last week, but here we are talking about a 50 per cent cut in the rebate that is payable to Austudy-ralians in need of access to this particular treatment. We are four days from when that particular budget cut is due to take effect and still the government has not tabled those regulations here in the Senate. That is a disgrace. The government still has not answered questions which go directly to an alternative proposal on how some savings could perhaps be made and which it seems the gov-ernment does not appear to have pursued at all. Some of the questions that I asked included whether the minister could confirm that her:
… department received a Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists working party recommendation that it is clinically appropriate to use medications such as Avastin and Triamcinolene to treat blinding conditions as part of an intravitreal injection 42740...
That is the MBS item number. Then I asked what the government minister is doing about it. Why does it take the minister more than the 30 days allocated under our standing orders to provide an answer to a very simple question like that? Can somebody explain to me why the minister cannot answer a very specific question such as, ‘Have you received that advice; if you have received that advice, what are you doing about it?’ That is pretty straightforward.
The next day, on the 29 July, I put in a series of further more detailed questions. I was interested to know whether it was true that the government had allocated $200 million per year for Lucentis in the 2009-10 budget and that each injection for treating macular degeneration using that particular drug costs around $2,000 per vial. How hard is it to answer that question? Either it is allocated in the budget or it is not allocated in the budget. Either it does cost $2,000 per vial or it does not cost $2,000 per vial. I asked:
Is the Minister aware of research and international clinical practice that indicates Lucentis and Avastin provide an equivalent clinical outcome for patients with macular degeneration.
I suspect the minister is aware. Why doesn’t she just say yes. Why does it take 90 days to provide a yes—full stop—answer? I asked:
Has the department, the Therapeutic Goods Administration or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) considered this international experience and research, or done any other investigation as to whether Avastin would deliver an equivalent clinical outcome for patients with macular degeneration as Lucentis at a lower cost; if not, why not.
I suspect that this is where it is starting to get more complicated for this minister because she is quite happy to go for the easy, lazy budget cut—reducing an MBS rebate item by 50 per cent and accusing doctors of earning too much money, even though she is not proposing to do anything about doctors’ fees. All she is proposing is to reduce the rebate for the patient while doctors’ fees will continue to do whatever they do—increasing the out-of-pocket expenses for patients in need of access to this particular service, making it harder for them to get access to this and pushing them into the public system that is already overburdened. She is pushing them into the public system where this particular procedure costs more than $3,500 to provide. Here we have a Rudd Labor government which is happy to save $313 by cutting a particular rebate in half, pushing it into the state and territory run public system where the same procedure costs taxpayers $3,500-plus to provide free of charge. What is the logic in that? The minister is not even prepared to answer questions on an alternative savings approach which has been put forward in good faith by the ophthalmologist profession. I will go through some more questions:
Is the Minister aware that Avastin was recommended by New Zealand’s Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC) for use in patients with macular degeneration.
That is an easy one again. I am sure the minister could just say yes—full stop. Why does it take 90 days to answer that question? The next part of the question is:
Has the department examined the experience in the United States of America (US), and specifically, is it correct that in the US Avastin is now used twice as often as Lucentis to treat macular degeneration.
The minister should know these sorts of things, and if she does not know these sorts of things she should give her job away. She should go to the Prime Minister and say: ‘I am not up to it. Every time a budget cut is pushed through by the big boys—you, the Prime Minister; the Minister for Finance and Deregulation; and the Treasurer—and I am sent out there to sell the line, I am hung out there to dry. I am not able to stand up for the patients across Australia in their need to get timely and affordable access to quality health care. I am not up to it and I cannot answer very simple and specific questions, so please give somebody else my job’. The next question is:
What would be the cost (per vial) for an injection of Avastin for the treatment of macular degeneration in Australia.
All somebody in the department would have to do is pick up the phone and they will be told that it is about $20. I can get that answer now, but I would like to know what the minister knows. Here we have one drug which costs about $2,000 and another drug which on the face of it—according to practice and research in other parts of the world—delivers the same clinical outcome and costs $20. This is the basis on which ophthalmologists have argued that there is scope here to save about $100 million per annum.
Instead of responding to these questions, we had officers of the department as late as last Wednesday telling a Senate estimates committee, ‘Oh well, sadly those ophthalmologists did not come forward with any constructive suggestions on how we could achieve savings in a more responsible way’. It seems to me that they did, but it seems as if the minister is sitting on her hands yet again and not doing anything to achieve efficiencies in a way that does not hurt patients. Of course, she has form on that. The next question which remains unanswered is:
Has the department or the PBAC considered the savings that could be made through the use of Avastin to treat macular degeneration; if not, why not.
That is again a simple yes or no answer. If it is yes and they have considered it, that is great. If it is no, then clearly we would like a one-sentence explanation as to why that is. Next:
Is the Minister, the department or the PBAC aware of claims that savings of approximately $100 million per year could be made to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) expenditure by encouraging the use of Avastin, whilst delivering an equivalent clinical outcome to products already listed on the PBS which are more expensive than Avastin; and
what is the view of the Minister, the department and/or the PBAC of this claim.
These are questions that were legitimately put forward on 28 and 29 July. It is nearly 90 days later and still, to this day, the minister has not come back with a proper response to these questions.
We are four days away from a savage budget cut which will hurt elderly Australians in need of access to cataract surgery—four days from it coming into effect—and the Senate is about to make a decision as to what should happen with that particular cut, yet the minister still has not provided us with an answer in relation to these questions. I think that that is just not good enough.
What do we have instead? Instead, the government is pressing ahead with the 50 per cent cut in rebates for cataract surgery. As I have already mentioned, that cut does nothing to reduce doctors’ fees. The government actually conceded in Senate estimates last week that the government does not have the power to direct doctors in terms of their fees. It does not. All the minister is proposing to do is to push up the cost for patients, many of whom, of course, will no longer be able to afford access to this life-changing procedure through the private system.
The Managing Director of Medibank Private, last week at Senate estimates, told us, ‘Oh, well, as a result of these cuts to these MBS items, our rebate will reduce by $290 as well.’ That is because health funds link their rebate arrangements to the MBS schedule. Here we have a $313 reduction in the government’s rebate and a $290 reduction in the health fund rebate—by the government-owned private health fund, mind you—so here we have a $600 additional out-of-pocket expense for a procedure which right now does not cost 85 per cent of privately insured Australians anything and which will be more expensive to deliver through the public system.
It does not make sense from a health economics point of view. It does not make sense from a patient outcome point of view. It only makes sense if you consider that this is a government that pursues its health policy with a serious ideological bent, if you consider that this is a government that pursues a longstanding ideological crusade against private health and does not really care what the implications for patients are. That is the only circumstance in which you can understand the purpose of this particular budget cut.
While I am at it, here are some of the things to consider in this whole context. Seventy per cent of nearly 200,000 cataract surgery procedures are performed in the private system—70 per cent. In the public system, as it turns out, ophthalmology procedures have some of the longest waiting periods of any specialty group. I suspect that the government thinks: ‘If we make it unaffordable for Australians to get access to this service, they just won’t use it. They just won’t seek access to it.’ We will have an increase in falls and hip fractures. We will have an increase in depression, an increase in social isolation, an increase in the loss of independence, an increase in the loss of driving licences, an increase in early institutionalisation and an increase in the general loss of quality of life for our senior Australians.
Why would the minister not be prepared to proactively and positively engage and pursue a proposition that has been put forward, at least to assess whether Avastin can be used in a similar way as it has been in some other jurisdictions? I am told that it has been used in the Brisbane public hospital system for the last two years for exactly that purpose. Here we are, probably 24 hours away from having to make a decision about the Rudd government’s misguided budget cut to cataract rebates.

Senator Ludwig interjecting—

—This is an important issue.
—Yes, this is a very important issue, Senator Parry, absolutely. I think that last week during Senate estimates Senator Ludwig was treating this very serious issue with the same sort of level of contempt and lack of seriousness as he is doing now, quite frankly. We should have had an answer to these questions from the minister. We should have an answer to these questions a long time ago.
I will just talk about a few other issues that came up last week. The government has made decisions on cataract surgery rebates without having any idea how much time that surgery actually takes in Australia. The minister has gone out there with a whole heap of assertions, but we have asked specific questions: ‘Okay, you say that this surgery now takes 15 to 20 minutes, so how many of those 200,000 surgery procedures performed across Australia took between 15 and 20 minutes? How many took more than 20 minutes? How many took more than 25 minutes?’ Do you know what the answer was from the official? It was: ‘We don’t know. We don’t have access to that information. We don’t collect that data.’ This is the evidence based decision making of the Rudd government—yes, sure!
What we did have, though, was the AMA survey of ophthalmologists. Three hundred and thirty-four ophthalmologists participated in the survey. What did it find? Seventy per cent of them take between 25 and 40 minutes for this cataract surgery. I asked the department to comment. I asked the department to point out the flaws. I said, ‘Tell me: what are your thoughts about it?’ The department, the government, refused to make any comment whatsoever. They certainly did not dispute the findings of the AMA survey. The invitation still stands. Tell us if you think it is flawed. Tell us if you think that the AMA survey is not an accurate reflection of what actually happens with cataract surgery, and tell us on what basis you make that assertion. I certainly gave the health department official the opportunity last week, and she declined to criticise the outcomes of that survey.
This issue is another demonstration of the absolute failure of the Rudd government in the health portfolio. They came in, they promised the world and they have delivered next to nothing. They said they had a plan to fix public hospitals by the middle of 2009 and said that, if they had not, they would move for Canberra to take over the running of public hospitals. We have not heard much of that lately.
Instead, we have had a 20-month review followed by a review into the review and a whole series of photo opportunities across Australia, but no actions and no decisions. On the other hand, we have budget cut after budget cut, targeted at those Australians who access their health care through the private health system or those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own health care needs by taking out private health insurance.
Before the last election, this government promised that they had learned from their inglorious past, that they would not make the same mistake of pursuing an ideological crusade against Australians with private health insurance or those who access services through the private health system. Here they are, back at it, and it is worse than it has ever been. Before any cut to the health portfolio, the impact of the cut on Australians accessing health care through the private system should be looked at. Invariably, they are the targets of the cuts. It is not just rich people who access those services in the private system. Invariably, working families access those services through the private system. The reason they go into the private system is that they can access it when they need it and they do not have to join the lengthy waiting queues.",SENATE,<title>PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME</title>,<title>Order</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I indicate at the outset that I will not be taking the 20 minutes that Senator Cormann took in his contribution, which can only be described as an incoherent rant. Let me outline some of the facts. First, in relation to the question on notice, I did indicate that it is an important question and that we would be providing an answer to that question shortly. Second, in relation to the facts, as outlined by Senator Cormann in respect of Minister Roxon not answering the question, I did indicate that the question would be answered shortly. Third, in relation to the facts, if you could loosely call what Senator Cormann went through ‘facts’, they are: savings of $98 million over four years—the cataract MBS rebate issue. It is an area where the MBS fee for the most commonly performed cataract service, item No. 42702, has reduced from $831.60 to $416. What we are also doing, something Senator Cormann failed to indicate, is that we are introducing a new complex item for $850. The ophthalmology MBS spend is $317 million in this area. This proposal will save $7.7 million from the total. The average ophthalmologist receives $585,000 from Medicare each year. They earn an average of $154,000 from cataract procedures alone. After this measure comes into effect, they will continue to earn $508,000 through Medicare alone. On average, ophthalmologists conduct 243 cataract operations per year per full-time equivalent—100 per cent of the MBS schedule fee, 75 per cent fee through MBS rebate and 25 per cent covered by PHI.
Can I also say that back at budget time—and I did not hear this in Senator Cormann’s response during his incoherent dissertation—the shadow Treasurer made clear the opposition would support our responsible and sensible reforms in health with the exception of PHI rebate changes—all of them with the exception of PHI. The regulations that introduce this new fee structure will be tabled shortly today. It is time for the opposition to stop siding with the specialists and start supporting cataract patients who are being slugged with unreasonable fees.
—We are saving patients.
—I listened to you in silence, Senator Cormann. I ask that you respect that. In refusing to support the savings measure, the opposition are stepping away from a clear undertaking to support all budget measures, except the PHI. When you look at the issue in detail, the campaign by the ophthalmologists centres on the fee for one common procedure that takes 15 or 20 minutes. Currently, the fee is $831.60 and in the future it will be $416. Fees for cataracts are being adjusted to better reflect the time and complexity of the procedure. The government have negotiated with the profession to set a new higher fee for complex cataract procedures to fairly reflect when the procedure is more complex. This new item will be set at $850. This fee, which is more than double the fee for normal cataract procedures, appropriately rewards specialists for the additional time they invest in longer procedures. The revised fees will be introduced from 1 November. We do expect that (1) we will provide an answer to the question taken on notice shortly and (2) the opposition live up to their commitment to support these measures.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2009-10-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) and the Special Minister of State (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked by Senators Fierravanti-Wells and Johnston today relating to border protection.
I note there are quite a few Western Australian senators in the chamber. I noticed in Senator Evans’s answers that he appeared to be in complete denial about the pull factors in terms of the changes in the policies. I reflected on what he was saying and recalled this. I had a drink in a pub about 30 years ago called the Broad Arrow pub, just outside of Kalgoorlie. A great characteristic of the pub was that it would always be raining inside. There were bowls of water everywhere to catch the drips. We were all impressed one day when the proprietor decided he was going to get the roof fixed. The roof was fixed, but it did not rain for a fair while. They had an extension put on as well. I remember the first night it rained, and there was a fair bit of rain, and they realised that the guttering had actually been redesigned so it flowed into the back of the Broad Arrow pub. I am not sure which senators from Western Australia have enjoyed a beer there. I can tell you the difference between the government and the proprietor of the pub: the proprietor was absolutely in no doubt that it was the reengineering of the building that ensured that far more water got in—not just the fact that it was raining. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President Ferguson, that everybody around Australia now understand that the changes in policies by those opposite have caused much of the people movement.
If we look back to October 2007—we are coming up to the second anniversary of this government—we see that there were around 15 million refugees looking for a refugee outcome and around 150,000 places available. In two years, not much has changed. The principal circumstances have not changed. With regard to pull factors, if we look at the circumstances of an individual who, through the UNHCR process, quite tragically has to wait nine years to get a refugee outcome, we can understand that when a country says, ‘If you come to our country the new rules are that you have to wait for 90 days and then you can be guaranteed permanent residence,’ that individual would decide that is a comprehensive and very tempting option. It is the option that is being touted by those people who traffic in human misery—of course, they would put their spin on it—and I have absolutely no doubt that that is the principal reason people are now coming to this country in far greater numbers than we have seen before.
Unfortunately, the government have not been too transparent about releasing details, in general terms, about the circumstances of these individuals. Anecdotally, and I have seen it reported in the media, it appears that some of these individuals have already been living in areas that you would say are relatively safe havens—certainly not in the country in which they were being persecuted and in which they were afraid.
We need to understand that we have two types of families. We have the families who arrive in these vessels quite legitimately seeking an asylum outcome in Australia because of the changes in this government’s policy. They have been able to afford up to $15,000 per member to contribute to this international criminal activity in seeking a better outcome for their lives. You do not blame them for that. Then we have the other type of family, who are currently living in camps that are characterised by hunger, fear, rape, murder and the most abhorrent life you could possibly imagine. The UNHCR, in which we proudly participate, makes it very clear that we absolutely need to ensure that we prioritise those issues. On the one hand we have somebody who is obviously doing relatively well, but those opposite are not only placing in danger that type of family; they are also no longer taking into consideration the families most in need, who are in the most horrific circumstances. Those on the other side stand condemned because they remain in denial and, whilst they remain in denial, the boats will continue to come and the people on those boats will continue to put their lives in danger.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I think it is quite sad that this important area of public policy is being used by the coalition to whip up fear of and ill will towards people who are genuine asylum seekers and who often turn out to be genuine refugees living in our country. I thought the analogy that the senator opposite used—that this is somehow comparable to fixing the leaky roof of a pub that he visited—was pretty abhorrent.
I would like to put to rest once and for all the notion that, under the Rudd Labor government’s humane approach to asylum seekers and refugees who come here by boat, numbers have increased. We know full well—it has been mentioned time and time again—that during the period of the Howard government nearly 250 boats arrived on our shores, bringing almost 15,000 people. But I do not particularly want to get into a war of statistics, because I think that is a cheap way to deal with a very important humanitarian program.
I am proud to say that one of the first things the Rudd Labor government did when it came to office was to reverse some of the appalling attitudes to genuine asylum seekers and refugees that we saw from the opposition. We got rid of the dreaded temporary protection visas; we stopped locking women and children up behind barbed wire; in my own state we got rid of the abomination that was Baxter; and we got rid of the so-called Pacific solution, which saw people interned on Manus Island and Nauru, in many cases for inordinately long periods.
I think it is really important in this debate to remember the people that we are talking about. An asylum seeker is someone who has come to another country because they are looking for a better life for themselves and, more importantly, for their children. Not all asylum seekers are found to be genuine refugees, as we know, but it is the case in the history of Australia that the vast majority of people who have come here as asylum seekers have been found to be genuine refugees. That is the case under this government and it was the case under the former government.
A person can be found to have refugee status if: they are found to have a well-founded fear of persecution if they return to their homeland; they fear persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because they hold a particular political opinion; they have fled their homeland and sought sanctuary elsewhere; and they are unwilling or unable to seek protection in their own country. The people who come here by boat, of course, are risking much, but what they risk by staying in their own country, if they are genuine refugees, is something much, much worse.
As I said, the people who do come here by boat are, in the main, found to be genuine refugees, and the kind of rhetoric we are getting from the opposition in this debate makes it even more difficult for those people who are found to be genuine refugees to finally settle in Australia. Those of us who work closely with refugee organisations in our own states know the difficulties that those people face in settling into Australia—in finding accommodation and, in particular, in finding jobs—because unfortunately there are persistent attitudes in the community, fostered by the kind of rhetoric that we have heard from the opposition, that make it very difficult for those people to settle in our country. There is no reason for that. Australia, as we know, is a very wealthy nation, well able to take the refugees that we do. We accept, I think, about 13½ thousand refugees under the UNHCR program. Personally, I wish we could take a lot more. I wish we would stop demonising the people who come to this country seeking a better life for their children and I wish the opposition would get out of the gutter in this debate about legitimate asylum seekers and refugees, whom we should be welcoming.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2009-10-26,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Evans. In commenting on the previous speaker, I ask the Senate to reflect on the fact that Australia, on a per capita basis, is the second most generous country in the world when it comes to accepting refugees and migrants, and because of that we should not be demonised. We have learnt this afternoon of a sad, long litany of failure, as acknowledged by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. We learnt that the government is not across information available to its agencies on those who are due to come, those who are there now and those who are preparing to come. If the government is not aware of what the ADF and others know, how can it be formulating policy?
I draw attention to some of the media releases of the past, and mustn’t the government be regretting them now! There is the media release by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, on the third consecutive failure to detect people smugglers, when fifteen people arrived. We were asked to pay attention to its assertions about smuggling of all kinds, including guns, drugs and people, through our northern maritime borders and about what Labor would do in government. Well, they have not done it. Then we have another media release from the then shadow minister for population and immigration Julia Gillard telling us that there was another boat on the way and another policy failure. She told us about the fact that, for asylum seekers on their way to Australia, policy was not working. She went on to talk about why the Christmas Island centre had not been opened on time. Fortunately for this government, the last government did supply a solution for Christmas Island. If it had not, where would we be now?
The tragedy of this whole issue is that, because of the policies of this government, people smugglers are now encouraged again to put people’s lives at risk. They have absolutely no concern for the asylum seekers. They are only concerned to earn the one, three or four million dollars that they get for this. They are encouraging people to put to sea, and we know very well that the losses are severe. I agree with the previous speaker that we should be doing far more to protect the lives of those people, and the best way of protecting the lives of people at sea on rickety and failing vessels is for them not to go to sea in the first place.
We heard this afternoon from the minister that not all levels of government and its agencies are yet engaged with the Indonesians when it comes to the apparent solution which they are seeking. We also learnt from the response to the question from Senator Hanson-Young that not all options have been examined in relation to the Oceanic Viking. If, in fact, the Sri Lankans on board decide that they do not want to leave or the Indonesians do not have the power or the will to make them leave, what is going to happen? We all, in this chamber and in the wider community, have the right to know what the government is planning in this area.
I draw attention to the apparent solution in the Timor Sea, when a vessel was burnt earlier this year. Thank the Lord that the Front Puffin, an FPSO, was there in the Timor Sea and able to assist in the process. At this time, we do not even have a coronial report, yet this government has made a decision to grant refugee status to all of those people on board. We do not even know the causes; we do not know who was responsible; we do not know what the outcomes are going to be. But yet another signal has gone through people smugglers to refugees: if you render your vessel unsafe at sea, you are going to have an accelerated course.
This is not the way that the Australian community has a right to be treated; this is not the way that our neighbours Indonesia ought to be treated; this is not the way that would-be refugees ought to be treated—there is no way in the wide world. All we saw was a Labor Party person attacking the Western Australian Premier when he simply read from a situation report that was available to him and to the Labor government that day. What did the government do? It criticised Colin Barnett, but Barnett added not a single word.
Then, of course, we have the ultimate—that is, when you have no policy and nowhere to go, you attack. Sure enough, the other day we heard the Prime Minister attacking the member for O’Connor because he was raising the possibility that there might be terrorists on board. What attention did the Prime Minister pay to the statement of Michael Danby, the member for Melbourne Ports, on 18 June, when he very responsibly drew attention to the following facts?
Any loophole in our law can be exploited by criminal elements to evade or subvert our border protection system. They include … people smugglers, potential terrorists, drug runners …
What response did we see from the Prime Minister to this gentleman, Michael Danby, when he simply drew attention to this? (Time expired)

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I rise this afternoon to take note of answers, and I do so on the basis of putting into perspective where this argument really sits: it is really about the situation the world is currently in. There are a large number of displaced people that are looking for a home to come to and settlement in a more stable, democratic nation, such as Australia. You cannot blame them for that. Unfortunately, they are being targeted by people smugglers who choose to use them and who take advantage of people that are in unfortunate situations. The reasons behind the surge in numbers are no doubt things like natural disasters in our region, war and conflict in our neighbouring countries, and climate change. No doubt we will see an increase as climate change bites into the world and people lose their homes and their land as a result of tidal surges.
But people smuggling is not just an issue for Australia; it is a global and regional problem. The commitment of our neighbours through bilateral cooperation and the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime is critical to addressing this most serious issue. Since September 2008 there have been 19 arrests of facilitators and organisers of people-smuggling ventures in Indonesia alone. Since September 2008, the Australian Federal Police has also charged 55 people with offences under the Migration Act 1958, including 51 illegal crew members and four alleged Australian based organisers. These offences attract a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
The Australian government remains vigilant and committed to protecting Australian borders. Trafficking in persons is a modern-day form of slavery that involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people in order to exploit them through forced labour or servitude. The report that the Australian Institute of Criminology released recently indicates that most people who are being smuggled or trafficked into Australia come from southern Asia and about 95 per cent of them are women who are put to work in the sex industries. Two cases were also brought with regard to alleged forced labour, an area of increasing regional concern.
Australia has adopted a whole-of-government response to people trafficking which includes a national policing strategy and specialist police investigation teams, enhanced visa arrangements, a victim support program and regional cooperation efforts. But what is the alternative when it comes to the opposition? We heard recently from the other chamber that Liberal backbencher and MP Philip Ruddock has made some claims on asylum seekers based on nothing more than his own opinion. I note that he has called for the reintroduction of the disgraced Pacific solution and temporary protection visas. The Liberal Party was silent when these measures were scrapped last year. It is now Liberal Party policy—though there is some division within the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party wants to debate immigration policy but has no policy of its own to put forward.
The reality is that we have had irregular boat arrivals to Australia in 25 of the past 33 years. From 1999 to 2001, under the Howard government, there were 12,176 boat arrivals. That tells you a bit about the policies that the opposition wanted to retain and wanted to rely upon in the past. In 2008 and 2009 we have seen a resurgence of mainly Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers who have fled their own countries and are seeking safe haven in Europe, North America and Australia. So it is a global problem; it is not a problem that is associated with Australia alone. Therefore, we need to address this issue globally.
This government’s message to people who are thinking about illegally entering Australia is: ‘Think again. If you are not a genuine refugee, you will be quickly sent home.’ We have invested a record amount in surveillance and interception, and in the budget we announced an additional $654 million— (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-10-26,"—As has been said, this is a very difficult problem. There are massive numbers of refugees in the world—something like 42 million was mentioned earlier by one speaker—and it is an enormous problem. But we in Australia have to be realistic about what we can do in terms of assisting with a resolution regarding the problem of the number of refugees around the world. We are in fact a very small country, of just some 21 million people. Even so, we have had a very fine record in assisting in resettling refugees, beginning of course after World War II, when we took huge numbers of displaced people, and continuing on through the years with the boat people from Vietnam and Cambodia.
Today we have a system for the orderly processing of people who want to come to Australia under the United Nations convention on refugees and have a quota within our migration system of some 15,000 people a year who come into Australia from UNHCR camps, where important checks are carried out before they get to this country. In particular, their identity is checked and verified—because, as has been said, very often people who claim to be refugees are not necessarily who they claim to be and they are not necessarily quite as innocent as they would like us to think they are. It is very important not only that their identity is checked but also that their security records and criminal records are checked. The policy that the Australian government has followed for a long time now is to accept a quota of refugees through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees process, and we have very much made our contribution to alleviating this problem around the world.
The recent flood of boat people from Indonesia and Sri Lanka reflects pull factors in Australia. Most important of all the pull factors is the change in the Rudd government’s policy in dealing with refugees. There can be no doubt whatsoever that there is a view out there that, under this government, Australia will not just confine itself to taking refugees from the UNHCR sources but will take anyone who turns up on the doorstep and claims refugee status. So there is a very different kind of view out there about how the Australian government will react to anyone coming to this country. It is disgraceful that people smugglers are putting at risk the lives of asylum seekers, and there is absolutely nothing humane about border protection policies that increase the likelihood of vulnerable men, women and children getting into leaky boats and risking their lives on the high seas.
The coalition believe the government must urgently set up an independent inquiry into the reasons for the surge of arrivals on our north-west coastline and seek to identify possible solutions to this problem. The government, we believe, must be prepared to accept responsibility for the consequences of the mixed messages it has sent. The question before the Senate today then becomes: why is the Rudd government running away from an inquiry into its border protection policies which the coalition believe should be carried out?
The situation is now becoming quite urgent, with ever-increasing numbers of boats appearing on our coastline. The facts are clear: the Labor Party policy has failed. They have lost control of our borders. What we need is a full and independent inquiry to consider all policy options. That is the question we must ask in the Senate today: why are the Rudd government running away from such an inquiry?

"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2009-10-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 2 October 2009, of John (Jack) Gordon Evans, former Australian Democrat and senator for Western Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Jack Evans was born in 1928 in Southern Cross, Western Australia, and educated at Northam High School and Perth Technical College. Before entering parliament, Jack was a management consultant and company director focusing on corporate mergers and acquisitions. He had a lifelong passion for politics, but it really was not until the events of the constitutional crisis in 1975 that he was mobilised into action. In 1977 I guess it was a real turning point for him when he invited Don Chipp to Perth to address a public meeting. Don recounted that it was at this meeting at the Perth town hall that the Australian Democrats were born. I am not sure if former Liberal senator Ian Campbell was there at the time but he was certainly active around that period and he rightly described Jack Evans as a great Western Australian.
Jack ran for the Senate on the Democrats ticket twice before he was elected. He missed out in 1977, the first federal election the Democrats participated in, despite gaining around 12.6 per cent of the vote, which I think is the highest Democrat vote ever in Western Australia. He missed out again in 1980 before he was eventually elected to the Senate in the March 1983 double dissolution election, making him Western Australia’s first Australian Democrats senator. Unfortunately he was the victim of the impact of double dissolutions on those given the shorter term. As he had the shorter term, he was up for election again in the 1984 election and so his term in the Senate lasted only until June 1985. He had only about two years in the Senate, making him the second shortest serving senator in the party’s history.
Nonetheless, his contribution was substantial—both in parliament and outside parliament. I will come to his extraparliamentary contributions shortly. During his time in the parliament he participated on the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. He also introduced one of only 12 private senators’ bills to be passed into law since Federation. Senator Bob Brown will be pleased with this. He had a bill carried by the parliament aimed at preventing a certain type of tax evasion that was a hot issue at the time. He was able to succeed in this as a parliamentarian even though he came from a minor party.
Jack was a tough negotiator as well as a passionate spokesperson for the Australian Democrats on a range of issues, including: treasury, industrial relations, trade, industry and commerce, finance, small business, transport, aviation, sport, recreation and tourism. He really was someone of the centre with a business background, which was representative of some of the constituency of the Democrats in those early days. He made a contribution in a range of those economic areas.
Despite his rather short parliamentary career, Jack was in fact a really significant figure in the development of the Australian Democrats, particularly in my own state of Western Australia. After co-founding the WA branch of the party, he was its founding president from 1977 to 1981. He was also a member of the Australian Democrats national executive from the formation of the party, Deputy National President from 1979 to 1981 and National President from 1981 to 1983. He was a significant contributor to the formation of the Democrats and its establishment as an effective third force in Australian politics. Senators may recall how difficult it is to form a third party and how many have failed, but the Democrats, in its early days especially, was a real success story in finding a position in Australian politics.
As I say, Jack’s time in the Senate was cut short at the 1984 election and his seat was captured by Jo Vallentine from the Nuclear Disarmament Party. He narrowly lost to her in that election. I have some sympathy for him; I narrowly lost to her in the following election in 1987. So we shared stories about the injustice of it all. His dedication to the party he helped establish continued long after he left the Senate. He was very much a party man, he very much worked for the success of the party behind the scenes and he was a unifying force in the Democrats, despite having very strong views of his own.
Jack Evans played a particularly important role in rebuilding the Western Australian arm of the party during what was a very difficult time for the branch in the mid-1990s. He effectively came back in and rescued the Western Australian Democrats. They were having trouble with a particular chap who was a former candidate for the ALP at the 1983 federal election. He almost won the seat of Forrest late on election night. We were so glad he did not win. Unfortunately, he then joined the Democrats and set about destroying them from within.
Jack was responsible for rescuing the Democrats in what was a terribly difficult period for them, wracked by divisions and by alternative executives claiming authority of the party. It was a nightmare. Jack went back in and cleaned up all that and made the Democrats in Western Australia electable again in the mid-nineties. That culminated in the election of Senator Andrew Murray in 1996, as well as the election of Brian Greig in 1998. That was the first time the Australian Democrats in Western Australia had actually gained a second spot in the Senate. So Jack very much turned around the fortunes of the party.
It is also the case that he was widely respected by the Labor Party in Western Australia because of his forthright and honest dealings. He was someone you could negotiate with in a very frank way. You knew that if you had a deal with Jack then the deal stuck. He was a very good political operator, a very principled man. He was well regarded by others in the political sphere, not just by his own party. I am sure that Liberal Party state secretaries and others would have the same views that I had of him—that you dealt with him in a very open, honest and fair manner and that you respected him. For many years he was very much a dominant political figure in Western Australia, given the role he played in the Democrats, even though his Senate career was short.
Unfortunately, Jack passed away on 2 October this year, at age 80. He will be fondly remembered for his great passion for politics and as a determined and committed advocate for a wide range of social justice issues, as well as for his very significant contribution to the establishment and development of the Australian Democrats. On behalf of the government I offer condolences to his wife, Margaret; his children, Suzanne and John; his family and friends; and of course to his many colleagues from the Australian Democrats and from politics more widely.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-10-26,"—I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Chris Evans in relation to the death of Jack Evans on 2 October. On behalf of the opposition I extend our sympathies to the family of Jack Evans. The Leader of the Government in the Senate has quite comprehensively and very fulsomely described Jack’s great contribution to the Senate, to the Australian Democrats and to Australian politics generally. I, on behalf of the opposition, endorse all his remarks. It was not my privilege to know Jack personally, but I have been well aware of his existence for many years and well aware of his great reputation, one that Senator Evans has properly reflected upon.
It is true that Jack’s very short Senate career belies the extent of his considerable contribution to Australian democracy. He gave extraordinarily long and devoted service to what was for many years the third force in Australian politics: the Australian Democrats. Having followed for several decades the travails of that particular party, its comings and goings, its ups and downs, I believe it must have been a tortuous experience for Jack Evans, but it is a great mark of the man that he survived that and hung on. We all know those who just pass through politics, give it a few years and move on. Jack clearly gave much of his life to ensuring that Australia had a middle-ground party of the kind that the Australian Democrats represented. I guess for that reason it must have been extraordinarily painful for Jack to have witnessed the complete collapse of the party that he devoted so much of his life to and which he helped to create with none other than our former Liberal colleague Don Chipp and, indeed, with some assistance from another great Liberal friend of ours, Steele Hall. I think Jack was actually a member of Steele’s Liberal Movement at one stage. The political process never ceases to amaze me. Steele is one of my best friends.
We can all say that Jack’s family can be extraordinarily proud of his great contribution to public life. We honour him here today. To his wife, Margaret, the children and grandchildren, the opposition also place on record our appreciation of Jack’s great service. We tender our profound sympathy at this time of their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Mr John Gordon Evans</title>,Condolences,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-26,"—I would like to add a few words to those fine eulogies to Jack Evans. I am happy to say that my political origins, like his, owe something to the mountains of Tasmania, as I will explain. I am very much indebted to former Senator Andrew Murray of the Democrats for allowing me to read to the Senate words that he delivered at Jack’s funeral service, on 13 October, at the chapel, Pinnaroo Valley Memorial Park in Padbury, Perth. Andrew had this to say:
I’m honoured that the family asked me to speak today.
A eulogy is an expression of praise. Jack’s immense political achievements extended over thirty five years. He was indeed worthy of praise, a man not only of great significance to Western Australia, but of real significance to Australia itself.
Jack Evans was of great significance to Australia because he was the Founding Father of a political party that has had a great and enduring impact on national life; on the nation’s political life, governance and institutions; on electoral reform; and on social, economic and environmental policy.
I will eschew statistics and chronology and try to give you something of the flavour and meaning of Jack’s politics.
The words that summarise Jack Evans and politics are ‘constant effort’ and ‘tenacity’. That and his character won him the admiration and respect shown him in life and death.
He was a progressive, optimistic, passionate and determined campaigner for a better Australia. Strongly anti-nuclear and pro-environment; strong on participatory democracy; intent on freeing up business with better market systems; strong on tax reform; committed to education, to human rights and social justice; and intent on better political checks and balances. He was an intensely value-driven policy modernist.
He was a warm, caring and enduring friend. In politics he was persistent to exhaustion but not stubborn; he was pragmatic but principled, knew when to say no and when to compromise; he was compassionate but not maudlin, hard-headed but soft-hearted.
There were times when he and his party were assailed in WA and nationally. He survived some hideous pressures, awful moments and terrible disappointments with his hopes, ideals and humour intact.
I only met Jack in 1994 when he was already 66, but a more energetic and upbeat personality would be hard to find. Politically he was well-informed and well-connected, wise and able. I valued his advice so much that he was on my part-time staff from my first to my last day as a Senator.
That means Jack finally left the workforce aged 79.
Jack was impelled into politics by the events of 1975.
I will interrupt my reading of Andrew Murray’s speech here to read his footnote on this. It says:
… In Jack’s own words: ‘On 11 November 1975 Margaret and I were holidaying in Hobart, Tasmania and drove to the top of Mount Wellington to enjoy the vista. En route we tuned into the ABC radio station and listened to proceedings in the Federal Parliament. We were stunned to hear … Malcolm Fraser and the Governor General [had] effected a peaceful coup of the Australian Government. I shan’t dwell on the analysis of the events of the day only to say that we feared a violent eruption from the left of politics as the day proceeded. We were scheduled to fly back to Perth the following day and on our plane was Senator Steele Hall who was going to Perth to form a WA branch of his New Liberal Movement Party. He invited us to a planned meeting of interested people and from that meeting the new LM was formed in WA.’
I will return now to reading the eulogy. Andrew Murray says:
His representative political life as a Senator from 1983-1985 was cruelly short but busy and impactful.
Andrew Murray also has a footnote here in his speech. It says:
5 March 1983 - 30 June 1985. Jack first stood for the Senate as a candidate for the Liberal Movement in 1975. When the Liberal Movement and the Australia Party merged to become the Australian Democrats he stood unsuccessfully twice more in 1977 and 1980, at considerable personal financial cost. His running mate was his great friend the renowned Shirley de la Hunty; who later also supported Andrew Murray on his 1996 Senate ticket.
Andrew Murray’s eulogy for Jack continues:
His organisational political life was long, distinguished and dedicated, ranging from the heights of National President and National Campaign Director to the grinding work of countless grass-roots meetings and committees, often accompanied by the eternally supportive Margaret.
His last speech in the Senate extolled the considerable virtues of Margaret and family, and his last words to me did the same.
When Margaret first hooked up with Jack as a teenage sweetheart, she could not have imagined what she was in for. Insiders know what great strains such political commitment puts on family life. The Evans did not just expend time, their political campaigns were self-funded and their business suffered.
His family will tell you Jack was always interested in politics, galvanised by ideas and current events, a great reader, always on for a debate. Be was a born organiser, persuasive (it helped to have that mellifluous voice), careful in keeping notes and records, diligent, methodical, hard-working, available at all hours, and blessed with a good memory. But never too busy to pass the time of day.
One highly-ranked former Democrats staffer told me:

Jack was always courteous, thoughtful, respectful. In a party with many waverers and as many, if not more, disorganisers - Jack stood apart.

The Australian Democrats nationally could not have been established and later revived in WA after near-collapse without Jack.
As to his national impact; in Don Chipp’s own words—
and this is from Hansard on 31 May 1985 at page 2,949:

 
… had it not been for Jack Evans there would be no Australian Democrats …Contrary to popular belief, when I resigned from the Liberal Party in 1977, my whole intention was to get out of politics. The last thing in my mind was to help to form a new political party. It was Jack Evans, whom I had not met then, who pleaded with me to come and address a meeting in Perth. It was in Perth, with Jack Evans chairing an overflowing meeting in the Perth Town Hall—

and that was on 29 April 1977—

that the Australian Democrats were born.

The wonderful Stephen Swift, National Campaign Director for the Democrats for 15 years wrote to Jack before he died:

To have kick-started a national political party once in the ‘70s is impressive enough. To kick-start it twice, and get four WA Democrats elected within eighteen months in the 90s, was truly miraculous. Without your steady hand on the tiller, your experience and your steadfast belief that it could be done, it would not have been. You had belief enough for us all (and the best radio voice in the business!).

Sam Hudson, that amazing two-decades Democrats National Secretary, should have the last word:

Jack was Jack, he was always there. I can’t remember a time when Jack was not there - for the Party, for the members. Sort of like the Democrats security blanket. Whilst ever Jack was there, everything was OK. In his quiet way, in his lovely dulcet tones, he soothed, inspired, negotiated, led, mentored and sometimes persuaded. He was admired and respected by everyone from every party. He was our light on the hill. To me Jack was the light that bathed us in his warm glow and I am grateful to have spent over 30 years of my life knowing him.

Andrew Murray concludes in his eulogy:
For Pam and I he was our friend, from the first day we met to the day of his passing. We owe him a great deal. We will remember him with pride and gratitude.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-10-26,"—I rise to speak on this very important matter of public importance. What do we see today? We see that there have been 45 illegal boat arrivals since Labor softened its immigration framework through a raft of changes across the immigration department—45 policy failures, to use Julia Gillard’s words: ‘Another boat, another policy failure.’ When will Labor finally work out that it has put people smugglers back in business? What we really need is urgent action to restore border security and to give to those people who are most in need—those people who do not have the contacts and who do not have the cash to pay the people smugglers—a chance to enter our refugee and humanitarian program by exercising their right to claim asylum and to come to this country properly. Many of them have been waiting for 10 years—properly waiting, having been assessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
For every person who comes in the back door, who has the money to bribe the people smugglers, one of those poor women who has been sitting there—who has perhaps come out of Africa with six children and who has a fear of returning to her country because she will be raped and mutilated—is being denied the opportunity to come here because she does not have the money to bribe the people smugglers. These women have been waiting in the camps to be resettled.
What we have seen is a government in denial—a government which, notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that has been presented to them, will not admit that their changes in policy have led to the chaos that we are now in. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship got upset with me in Senate estimates because I reminded him of about 70 articles on the weekend pointing out the obvious: that it has been Labor’s changes to and softening of border protection and the immigration framework which has led to these circumstances. It is not just the coalition saying this; it is also the International Organisation for Migration, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Indonesian officials, the Indonesian ambassador and even the asylum seekers themselves who tell us that Labor’s policy changes have contributed to the increase in people smuggling.
We have seen tragic circumstances occur. We saw it recently with the 78 people who sabotaged their boat. They were taken on board the Australian Customs vessel and have not yet docked. We have seen, in the last week, the high farce of this government scrambling to do something with them. Not long ago, at Easter, we saw the SIEV 36 with its 42 people on board. The Northern Territory police have given us clear evidence of what happened there. It is still subject to a coronial inquiry, but all 42 have now been given permanent residency. The Australian Federal Police have warned the government. It is very interesting that the government have not released the Australian Federal Police report. What are they trying to hide? They are trying to hide that the Australian Federal Police, based on its intelligence, is telling us the obvious: that it has been the government’s change of policy that has resulted in people-smuggling activities being reactivated, placing hundreds of lives at risk as a consequence. Now we see that the price for passage to Australia has doubled. It has gone from $7,000 to $15,000. Why wouldn’t it, when, with less than 90 days detention, people are walking away with permanent residency in Australia, ultimately leading on to citizenship, with all the rights, responsibilities and privileges which that carries?
The system that this government dismantled was a system which looked at a range of measures. When we left power, we left a very strong system; it was a system that took into account our obligations under international law. Let us not forget the obligation Australia has under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The convention does not obligate Australia to give permanent residency. The obligation under the refugee convention is to give temporary haven to people with the objective of ultimately returning them to their country. That is the objective: to help people over that period. Indeed, we have seen the repatriation of Afghanis and a whole range of other people. It is good that they have been able to be repatriated, that they have been able to go back to their country, rather than having to stay in refugee camps.
As the then opposition leader, Kevin Rudd advocated turning boats back. He also advocated an orderly immigration system. But what is so orderly about outsourcing our humanitarian refugee intake to a bunch of people smugglers? That is really what this is about. What is orderly about asylum seekers deliberately sabotaging their own vessels? And what is so orderly about what we are now seeing: this so-called policy on the run? We have seen this sort of plan that the Prime Minister seems to have hatched up with the Indonesians but we do not know how much it cost. We do not actually know what it is going to give the Australian people.
It is important to understand that this government cannot continue to spin the line that they have changed the very fabric of the immigration system of this country. In July last year you told everybody: ‘We are going to radically change detention values. We are going to dismantle the system and make changes in 26 programs across the department of immigration, including abolishing detention debt, the 45-day rule and a whole raft of measures.’ You cannot do this and then expect that it is not going to have some sort of consequence. Of course it is going to have a consequence. Blind Freddy could tell you that as soon as you dismantled your system you would necessarily have consequences.
In my 20 years as a lawyer with the Australian Government Solicitor, I did my fair share of immigration law. So let us not forget that it was the Labor Party that introduced mandatory detention. It is all very well now to seek to rewrite history and pretend it was the Liberals. It was the coalition who changed the laws and regulations to make sure that children and their carers were not in detention, and that was done many, many years ago. We continue to hear hysterical language from the Prime Minister. When you put him and Minister Evans under scrutiny about the changes, what do they do? They retort with hysterical language about the business of detention and children. Let us not rewrite history and be hypocritical about this.
If those on the opposite side want to go back into the deep dark recesses of Labor’s history on detention, we will do that, because that history is not very pleasant. So it is all very well for the Labor Party to come in here, turn around and criticise the Howard government for what we did, but I would like to see what guarantees this government has from the Indonesian authorities about the way they are going to keep people in detention. People may criticise us and, yes, the boats did stop, but we also stopped the unnecessary risks that those people took in coming out here. I would like to conclude my comments, therefore, by saying that even if you have got the cash, that is not the sort of system we should have. We should have a proper humanitarian program that does not reward people for doing— (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I rise to refute Senator Parry’s assertions in this MPI this afternoon. I would contend that that is simply an opposition grasping at straws and at some sort of issue in order to become politically relevant in Australia at this point in time. We do need to go back in history, and we particularly need to go back to the last 11 years under the previous federal government, the Howard government, and the way in which this country needed to hang its head in shame at the way in which it treated people seeking to become refugees and seeking asylum in this country. We very proudly sign up to United Nations conventions and we very proudly sign up to protocols, and two of those are to do with the rights of people seeking refugee status when they come to this country. What we do not sign up to, and what we do not accept, is the fact that these people are so desperate that they put their lives in the hands of people who smuggle them to this country on boats and that they risk life and limb to get here.
Since coming to government we have changed the immigration and refugee policy in this country in some respects—those respects where we believe it was inhumane and unfair to people seeking refugee status. As Senator Evans said just last week at estimates:
What we said before the election was that we would retain the excision of offshore islands; we have. What we said before the election was that we would maintain mandatory detention; we have. We said we would maintain offshore processing on Christmas Island; we have. We also said we would treat asylum seekers in this country more humanely, and we have.
So we are very proud of the fact that we have, to a large degree, kept the same thrust in policy issues as previous governments. We do now process refugees on an offshore processing centre. We have maintained mandatory detention—but, of course, it is more humane and fairer—and we retain the excision of offshore islands. But what the people opposite me want to do today is have the general public believe that with our change in policies—our more humane treatment of people seeking refugee status in this country—we are somehow, out of the whole world, an isolated island when it comes to people movement and people trafficking.
That is certainly not the case. I want to go through some of those figures in a minute. The opposition really try to hang their hat on the fact that we have abolished temporary protection visas. They really want to back us into a corner and have us say, ‘All right, perhaps we should reinstate the policies of the Howard government and have temporary protection visas.’ I say this in the context of not ever hearing Senator Fierravanti-Wells or Senator Parry in the Senate or Dr Sharman Stone in the House of Representatives iterate what their policy would be at this time. Nobody standing opposite me this afternoon is going to stand up and say, ‘We blame the Rudd Labor government for what is happening now.’ That will be their line. They will not be able to put an alternative policy before this chamber this afternoon because they do not have one. They cannot even tell us if their policy is to reinvent and reintroduce TPVs.
We announced as part of our 2008-09 budget that we would abolish TPVs—the regime for asylum seekers. As I said, the opposition consistently refuse to confirm whether they will reintroduce TPVs. They claim that the abolition of TPVs has caused these boat arrivals. They say it is one chip in our policy change that is causing this influx of people. They are wrong, of course, because TPVs did not stop the boats arriving. In the four years from December 1997 to November 2001 there were a total of 12,651 unauthorised boat arrivals. So the introduction of the TPV regime in late 1999 did not stop the boats. By October 2000, the rate of UBAs—unauthorised boat arrivals—was clearly trending upwards. There was no correlation between the introduction of TPVs and diminished boat arrivals. In fact, under the Howard regime they increased. From December 1998 to November 1999 there were 3,042 boat arrivals, from December 1999 to November 2000 there were 2,921 boat arrivals and between December 2000 and November 2001 there were 6,540 boat arrivals.
People granted TPVs did not leave Australia either. This is another myth that the opposition want to perpetuate and have you believe. By the time the TPVs were abolished last year, nearly 90 per cent of people initially granted a TPV had been granted a permanent protection visa or another visa to remain in Australia; 11,206 people were granted TPVs and, of these, 9,841 were granted a permanent protection visa. They were genuine refugees and they have stayed in this country. Even the previous government had realised that TPVs were failing and on over 300 occasions they either allowed TPV holders to apply early for a permanent protection visa or lifted the bar on applying for a PPV.
The issue is really, no matter what rhetoric you hear from the other side, that the introduction of the TPVs actually saw a spike in the number of people arriving by boat in this country and seeking refugee status. We never talk about the number of people who have overstayed their visa as a result of World Youth Day last year. We do not hear the opposition talking about the number of people who arrive here by plane on some other form of visa—a business migration visa or tourist visa—and overstaying and seeking to stay here by other means. This is because the politics, rhetoric and headlines are about boat people. The opposition still have not let go of the campaign they ran in 2001 capitalising on the misery and suffering of people trying to seek refugee status in this country.
Let me talk about the global pressures pushing asylum seekers and the increase in their numbers right around the world. We are not alone in having to deal with this issue. We are not an isolated country having to deal with this problem. According to the UNHCR, there are 42 million people worldwide—almost double the population of this country—that are forcibly displaced. Up until the end of 2008, that included 15.2 million refugees. There are hundreds, thousands and millions of people out there in the world who are fleeing from their home countries for a whole range of reasons, mainly because they fear for their lives, and are seeking refuge in a country that will accept them as refugees under the United Nations conventions we have signed. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has reported that the number of asylum seekers in industrialised countries increased by 12 per cent last year. The increases in unauthorised boat arrivals and the increases in applications for asylum in Australia are far lower than any other industrialised country. Yes, we have people seeking to come here, unfortunately by boat, because they are so desperate, frightened and anxious to run away from the horrible and rabid conditions they leave behind in their country, but we are not alone in the world.
We are experiencing a far lower increase than anywhere else. For example, last year 15,300 people tried to enter Greece and 36,000 people tried to enter Italy. The figures for 2007 to 2008 show that in Italy there was a 122 per cent increase, in Canada a 30 per cent increase, in France a 20 per cent increase, in The Netherlands an 89 per cent increase, in Switzerland a 53 per cent increase and in Australia a 19 per cent increase. We are seeing an increase in the number of people seeking to arrive here by boat, but the number of people seeking refugee status around the rest of the world, particularly in the European countries, has dramatically increased. They get there by truck. They are getting there in the back of lorries. They are getting there in boats. We are lucky that the only way you can get here is by sea. We do not share borders with other countries. However, people need to realise that there is a massive movement worldwide and we are part of that worldwide movement of people seeking to flee the countries in which they are feeling oppressed.
Our stance is that we are humane. We have said, and the Prime Minister and Senator Evans have said, that the government has ended arbitrary and indefinite detention for children, and no children are now behind razor wire fences, as we saw under the Howard government. Our processes are compatible now with those of the UNHCR. We know that the UNHCR was incredibly critical of the former government’s treatment of asylum seekers. We have ended the temporary protection visa regime and the Pacific solution.
As Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional and Affairs, and as deputy chair of that committee for many years, I have sat at estimates and heard how dysfunctional the department was, how inhumane the policies of the previous government were and what an absolute waste of money the Pacific solution was. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were thrown away each year on the Pacific solution but, at the end of the day, all of those people were taken into the country as refugees anyway. There was a definite need for us, as a new government, to make a dramatic U-turn when it came to changing our policy on immigration and the treatment of refugees.
But what we will not tolerate is people capitalising on these people and smuggling them here by boat. We have retained the excision of offshore islands and we have maintained mandatory detention and processing on Christmas island for unauthorised arrivals. Our clear message to people thinking of entering Australia by boat and seeking refugee status is: no matter how you get here, if you are not a genuine refugee you will be sent home—and quickly. We have invested a record amount on surveillance and interception. In the budget, we announced an additional $654 million to combat people smuggling.
We have also set aside $44 million to tackle the problem at its core. The previous government shied away from a dialogue with Indonesia, did not actually have any cooperative arrangement with Indonesia, did not work with Indonesia and did not have the confidence of Indonesia to look at it as a partnership. But we have done that. Our Prime Minister flew to Indonesia and had direct talks with the President of Indonesia on a one-on-one basis. We have the confidence of Indonesia. We are going to work at the source. We want to tackle the criminals, the people smugglers, who take money and commit crimes at the expense of the misery of others. We have enhanced Indonesia’s border movement alert system. We have enhanced the capacity of countries in South-East Asia to collect and share information on people smuggling and to cooperate in addressing irregular migration.
We have expanded the transnational crime unit network, which means we are putting additional AFP liaison officers in key strategic locations. Since December 2008 there have been 82 disruptions by Indonesian national police of planned smuggling ventures to Australia involving about 1,494 persons. Since December 2008 the AFP have charged 48 people with people smuggling under the Migration Act 1958. This relates to 26 irregular maritime arrivals involving 44 alleged crew members and four alleged Australian based organisers. What we are trying to do is tackle the problem at its source. It has nothing to do with the change in our policies, despite the rhetoric we hear from the other side. As I said, the introduction of TPVs actually saw a spike in the number of boat people arriving in this country. It is the case at the moment that we are part of global pressures, and what we are trying to do is tackle this at its source.
The opposition is grappling with policies. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration handed down a report this year which was unanimously endorsed by the opposition. In fact, the key recommendations were all signed off, even by Dr Sharman Stone. The opposition has consistently refused to confirm that they will reintroduce temporary protection visas. My challenge to the people on the other side who continue to speak in this debate is this: stand up and, in your first couple of sentences, tell us what you would do, tell us what your policy would be— (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-10-26,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on this matter of public importance. Sadly, I do not believe this is necessarily the best forum in which to find a better solution for managing the mass movement of people into Australia. We need to see a constructive debate which outlines our responsibilities as signatories to the refugee convention and our responsibility to Australians who are ashamed of the days of the Tampa. I believe Australians have moved past the dark days of the Tampa. Most people understand the need for compassion and rational thinking when dealing with the needs of those who are seeking our help and protection. Attempts to claim political mileage by dog-whistling fear and hatred will not sit well with Australians, who are thankful that the days of locking children behind barbed wire in a remote desert are over. I believe Australians are thankful that we have moved on from those days.
What we need to be doing is not arguing about the pull factors and push factors but discussing what we will do for the people who are seeking protection and calling out to us for help—and we know that there has been an increase, as there was in 2001. We know that the numbers have risen dramatically over the last few years. In 2001 there was a peak in the number of people seeking asylum in Australia and around the rest of the world. Since 2007 the number of people seeking asylum and refuge has grown not just in Australia but in the rest of the world as well. Senator Crossin went through a number of those figures, so I will not take up my time doing that. It is enough to say that, despite the increase in the number of refugees seeking asylum around the world to 42-odd million, Australia takes in and cares for only one per cent of the world’s refugees. It is not an awful number of people. We have a responsibility to find out how we can stop people from jumping on leaky boats and taking that treacherous trip across the high seas. Of course it is not safe, of course we would prefer people not to do that, so let us discuss what we can do to help those people have their claims assessed fairly and humanely in the hope that they will be resettled somewhere within the region—and that includes Australia.
While the Rudd government claim, rightly so, that there has been an increase in people seeking protection around the world, we have not increased our humanitarian intake. In fact, the Rudd government takes fewer people through its humanitarian intake than the Howard government or Paul Keating’s government did. For a man who says that he is tough but humane, he needs to rethink the number of people to whom we are prepared to open our arms and assess their claims for protection. We need to see an increase in our humanitarian intake. We know that we can do that. It is simply about assessing our priorities and responsibilities at a time when people around the globe are calling for our protection.
I want to debunk a number of the myths circulating in this debate of late. The first one I want to tackle is in relation to those people seeking asylum who come by a boat or by a plane, those unauthorised arrivals. They are not illegals. As we know, it is perfectly okay to arrive in Australia and seek protection and to ask for your claim to be assessed. If you are a refugee then we will find somewhere to have you resettled. If you are not a refugee, then you are sent home. Going through that process and asking for us to assess your claim is not illegal. You are actually protected under international law and under our Migration Act. It is not illegal to seek protection in Australia. Those people who come to Australia seeking our protection in that way and those people who are accepted do not eat into the quota that we take in through the UNHCR process. Our budget papers prove that. There are two different categories for how people arrive in Australia and pathways by which they can seek protection. There are those people who are assessed offshore in refugee camps or through the UNHCR process and those people who come to Australia directly seeking our help. The myth that one person is taking the place of another is simply not true. To those senators in this place who continue to repeat that type of rhetoric and use it as a dog whistle to play refugees off against each other, I suggest that they pull out their 2008-09 budget papers and have a look. They will find those two groups are categorised quite differently. We have allowed for the separate intakes.
The other issue I want to tackle concerns the fact that the majority of people who seek asylum in Australia arrive by plane. In fact, 96 per cent of them arrive in Australia by plane and only four per cent of them arrive by boat. Where are the fear campaign and the dog whistling of hatred around Australia’s biggest people smuggling effort, Qantas Airways? There simply is not one, because the same fear is not whipped up about those who arrive by plane as is it through images and the unknown that some in this place would have us believe about boat people. The majority of people who seek asylum in Australia come by plane. They do not come by boat. The vast majority of those who arrive in Australia seeking protection after crossing that treacherous ocean are shown to be genuine refugees, because they are the people who are most desperate. They are prepared to do that because they have no other option than to put themselves and their families on a boat in the vain hope that somebody will help them or that somebody will offer protection. If it was really as easy as people think, why would they not sell everything they own and just jump on a Qantas flight to Australia? Because that is not the situation they are leaving. We need to have a rational debate about this. We need to debunk the myths and get on with providing a real solution.
I would like to address the issues raised by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the claims by the government that there are no children detained behind barbed wire. I accept there are some good things in the changes that they have made. Ending the detention debt and ending temporary protection visas are good things that the government have done. These are things that the Australian public wanted to see happen under the Howard government; and in fact they would have kept pushing the Howard government to do them if there had not been a change of government. If we honestly believe that children should not be held behind razor wire and detained then we need to look at the conditions and the treatment of the people we simply handed over to Indonesia in the last few weeks. There are no guarantees that the children on the two boats in Indonesian waters this week will not be detained in dreadful conditions. We need to ensure that, whatever agreement we are able to strike with our regional partners and neighbours, people’s rights are upheld and they are treated humanely. It is not good enough to say that it is not Australia’s problem. We need to be part of the solution, but we need to set the ground rules. We accept that people should be treated humanely and fairly, they have their claims for asylum assessed quickly and, of course, Australia needs to play a role in resettling them.
The government must articulate whether it is now government policy that any boat that reaches Australian waters or international waters and is intercepted by Australia—or, at our beck and call, intercepted by somebody else, as we have seen of late—will be returned to Indonesia. Or will some of them come here? What is the resolution for making sure that their claims are assessed, that they are treated fairly and that we play a role in their resettlement? The Prime Minister must answer this question: is it new government policy that all boats intercepted will be sent to Indonesia? That will be the difference between his policy and the Howard government policy. We need a solution that actually upholds human rights, understands Australia’s obligations and ensures that people and the needs of people are at the centre of the arrangement.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2009-10-26,"—This evening I want to talk about the 45 boats that we have had on the west coast and north-west coast of Australia since August last year. I believe that, potentially, one arrived during question time today—if not during question time then shortly prior to it.
Mr Steve Cook, the chief of mission for the International Organisation for Migration, Indonesia, in December last year said:
People smugglers have clearly noted that there has been a change in policy and they’re testing the envelope. Up until about a year ago there was very little people-smuggling activity. Over the last year there’s been a considerable up-kick … There are rumours of a lot of organising going on.
That was almost 12 months ago. In October this year, UNHCR representative Richard Towle said:
I think perceptions of policy can certainly play a role in people smuggling. They have a product that they need to market, and to show that Australia is a place where refugees can get fair and effective refugee protection is something that is understood.
It is all about the messages that have been sent, and it is crystal clear that the wrong messages have been sent by a government that has completely lost control of this vital and important area of public policy.
The previous government learned through painful experience that clear and unequivocal signals must be sent, particularly to strife-torn regions throughout South-East Asia and the Middle East, in order to dissuade people from getting aboard boats and paying people smugglers. It was a long and painful experience, and after 2001 we got it down to virtually a handful of vessels every year. The fact is that there is such a huge amount of money in this. The trade is lucrative not just to the people smugglers but to the boat builders, to the authorities in some of these countries and to the governments of some of these countries. Massive amounts of money are involved. This foolish Australian government has been totally asleep at the wheel, naive and negligent.
The 45 boats that have been here in many circumstances have not had a crew. What does that say? Obviously, the people aboard these boats have paid for the use of the boat but have not anticipated the return of the vessel. I point out that on 28 June a vessel carrying 194 asylum seekers, intercepted 24 kilometres north of Christmas Island, had no crew. These people were sailing the boat themselves. They obviously had the resources to purchase such a large vessel. On 11 July 2009 a vessel carrying 73 alleged asylum seekers was intercepted north-west of Christmas Island—again, no mention of a crew. On 13 August a boat carrying 77 people was intercepted 21 nautical miles north of Christmas Island—no crew. On 29 August, 52 people on a boat with no crew were intercepted. It is very clear that there are a whole host of commercial issues underlying what is going on with respect to our border protection.
This dozy, lazy government is epitomised by the performance of Mr Bob Debus who, about four hours after SIEV 36 was blown up at 10 o’clock in the morning, was saying, ‘I know nothing more than has been reported in the media.’ Thankfully, the Prime Minister woke up to what a woeful selection of ministerial talent that had been and we got rid of him. Now, I hope, we have people who are better, but it is yet to be seen. There have been 45 boats in one year—one today, one yesterday, one the day before, and so it goes on. Two thousand people apparently are now on Christmas Island.
The government have simply lost control. So what do they do? They want to subcontract our sovereignty to the Indonesians. Do you think they will tell us what it is going to cost us? Do you think they will tell us whether it is by head, by boat, by length of stay in Indonesia? Do you think there will be any transparency? The Prime Minister does one thing to confront every problem: he reaches into the breast pocket of his coat and pulls out the chequebook. Then his hand goes into the other pocket and pulls out a pen and he says: ‘How many noughts should I put on? How many noughts, Mr President of Indonesia, would you like to run our boat people problem for us?’
Where has the government got us so far? There is overcrowding on Christmas Island. We have had to provide bunk beds and portaloos, to the exclusion of Australians on Christmas Island. We are making goodness knows what payments to Indonesia with no explanation to the public. We are now transferring a lot of asylum seekers to Darwin in clear breach of an election promise. Several Navy sailors, I think it was four, were blown up on board one of these vessels. That is what this government has delivered to this argument—the lives of our own personnel are at risk. Of course, the last and most important thing is that women and children are on the high seas. This government has learnt nothing from the several boats that were sinking or had sunk when those aboard were rescued.
Why is it that so many young Afghan men are coming to this country on these boats while our best and finest young men are in their country fighting the Taliban? This government is a disgrace on this issue. It is gutless, it has been suckered and it has done everything conceivably wrong here, yet our young men are over in the countries where these people are coming from trying to protect their best interests. It should stop.
Our policy is our record. We closed the door, and everybody knew we had. We closed it properly and we had great success on this issue. I am absolutely appalled at the huge degree of politics and inaction on this subject. If one of these boats had come through Sydney heads, in public policy terms all hell would have broken loose. If one of them had been seen off Brisbane or had been down to Melbourne, where the Prime Minister’s political future lies, something would have been done. But because it is Western Australia—because it is a vast area of Aboriginals, pastoralists and miners—no-one in Canberra gives a fig. So we will go to Indonesia, pull out the chequebook, put a whole stack of noughts on the cheque and then pretend we have not done that and try to hide it from the Australian public. Those people are going to be dragged off that boat today, they are going to resist, and we will see how good at public policy Indonesia is.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this very important issue. We have seen here today another illustration—as if we needed one—of the complete and total political bankruptcy of the Liberal-National Party opposition. The opposition would have us believe that Australia is facing some sort of vast crisis of border security and that somehow in the last two years our border security regime has collapsed. This is, of course, complete nonsense. Let us be clear about the politics of what the opposition is doing here today. We all know what is going on: in running this cheap, cynical, populist scare campaign, those opposite are desperately trying to divert the attention of the public away from their own complete failure to get to grips with the great issues confronting Australia today. This is dog whistling to a xenophobic instinct that they hope and pray still exists in the Australian community.
Let us remember what road brought the opposition to this dreadful point. They opposed the government’s prompt and responsible measures in response to the global financial crisis—measures which have now saved Australia from the great recession. The opposition are blocking the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme because they cannot agree amongst themselves on a policy for action on climate change or, indeed, on whether climate change even exists. The opposition opposed the government’s investment in Australian schools. They opposed the government’s investment in the National Broadband Network. They cannot agree on a policy on industrial relations and will not rule out bringing back individual workplace contracts.
This is the opposition that has completely failed to come to grips with the great issues of Australian politics. On all of these policy issues—policy issues that the Australian public actually cares about—the opposition have completely and absolutely failed. They either have no policies or they have multiple policies coming from various self-appointed spokespeople. Their only real policy is to use their Senate numbers—their numbers in this place—to frustrate the mandate of the government. It is in these circumstances that a desperate, divided and demoralised opposition, unable to agree on policy, have moved to finally grasp the last straw left to them. As Annabel Crabb wrote about Malcolm Turnbull recently, ‘When your back’s against the wall, often the best policy is to create a diversion.’ Today, we are seeing that diversion. Today’s diversion is the oldest and grubbiest divisionary tactic in the book in Australia politics: a campaign based on the fear of immigrants and immigration.
One senior Liberal recently described the member for O’Connor as the ‘crazy uncle’ who turns up at the wedding. On this occasion, it would appear that the crazy uncle has found many other relatives. They have seized the microphone and they are presently ruining proceedings. Nowhere is that clearer than in this Senate chamber. Here the crazy uncles rule supreme. Not only is this campaign being run by the Liberal Party a cheap, grubby and nasty one but, most importantly, it is nonsensical in a factual sense. The opposition’s repeated assertion that Australia’s border security regime has changed since the Rudd government came to power is just factually false. We have retained the excision of offshore islands and retained mandatory detention and processing on Christmas Island for unauthorised boat arrivals. The Royal Australian Navy continues to work effectively to prevent unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia. The government have invested a record amount in surveillance and interception. This year we announced an additional $654 million to combat people smuggling. Over the past year there have been 82 disruptions of planned smuggling ventures to Australia by the Indonesian National Police, and the Australian Federal Police has charged 48 persons with people-smuggling offences.
Since the opposition are so critical of the government’s policy, it would be reasonable to assume that the crazy uncles opposite have an alternative policy of their own. Alas, we know that is not their form. It is reasonable to assume that if the opposition came to government at the next election they would, as they insist, put in place a more effective policy than the one they are currently so critical of. Presumably, they would want a return to the policies of the Howard government, since they continually extol the success of the Liberal government in those years. But, when we look at the facts, what do we find? Whenever the opposition shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, Sharman Stone, has the opportunity to confirm that a Liberal government would bring back the Howard government policy, she dodges and wriggles and tries not to answer the question. She praises the Howard government’s policies but then will not say whether she favours returning this country to them. When Sharman Stone appeared on Lateline recently, Leigh Sales said to her:
Every time you’re asked that question you don’t answer it. You say what Kevin Rudd is doing is no good, you say that he’s softened the policies and therefore opened the doors to asylum seekers. But you stop short of saying that he should re-embrace the measures you had that you claim are more successful. Why is that?
What was Sharman Stone’s answer to this question? She said:
We are saying that he should look at the whole suite of measures which worked before. Now these are different times, it’s 10 years later. But he must address this problem.
There we have it. This was just one of a series of interviews in which Sharman Stone and senior figures opposite have refused to say what the opposition’s policy is on asylum seekers. She will not say whether she wants a return of the previous policy or whether she wants some new policy. The fact is that the opposition do not have a policy on asylum seekers. The reason they do not have a policy is that they are hopelessly divided on this question, as they are hopelessly divided on every significant question facing this country. It is the same reason that they do not have a policy on climate change or a policy on industrial relations: they are a desperate, divided and demoralised opposition and they have a weak leader whose poor judgement is now notorious.
We on this side are very happy to debate this issue. We are also happy to defend the changes that the Rudd government have made to policy in this area. I also note that, when the changes were made, those opposite voted for them, something they seem to have forgotten in recent days. The fact is that the Howard government’s policy was ineffective, unnecessarily expensive and—most critically—inhumane. The Howard government cynically exploited this issue for cheap political gain. The opposition is now trying to repeat the trick, but, with its usual incompetence and inability to speak with one voice, even this last stunt has fallen flat.
The opposition keep telling us how effective the Howard government’s policies were, although they will not, of course, commit to reintroducing them. The combination of the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas was, in fact, an ineffective policy. Between 1999 and 2007, over 10,000 people who had arrived by boat were given TPVs. By the time TPVs were abolished by this government, nearly 90 per cent of those persons had been granted permanent visas and only three per cent of them had departed Australia. Those are telling statistics. This harsh regime, which those opposite mourn for, is, in fact, a policy that can be shown to have dramatically failed.
During the same period, over 1,600 people were sent to Nauru and Manus Island. Over 70 per cent of these persons were ultimately resettled to Australia and other countries. Sixty-one per cent of them were resettled in Australia. This spectacularly unsuccessful policy cost Australian taxpayers $289 million. The fact is that our policy is more effective, it is cheaper and it is more humane than the failed policies of the Howard government—the failed policies that tried to extol the ‘virtues’ of meanness and viciousness but of course completely failed in their attested mission, which was to prevent asylum seekers seeking permanent homes in this country.
It is a matter of fact that we face increased pressure at our borders—as do all Western countries. According to the UNHCR, the number of asylum seekers in industrialised countries increased by 12 per cent in 2008. But increases in unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia are far lower than in other industrialised countries In 2008 we saw 162 unauthorised boat arrivals. Greece had 15,300 and Italy had 35,000—greatly increased numbers in both cases. Applications for asylum have increased by 19 per cent in Australia compared with 30 per cent in Canada, 90 per cent in the Netherlands and 122 per cent in Italy.
The core proposition that those opposite are trying to make—that is, that changes to our laws have attracted increased unauthorised migration to Australia—is a nonsense. The idea that asylum seekers fleeing conflict and poverty in places like Sri Lanka and Afghanistan have first undertaken a regulatory impact study and carefully thumbed through press releases is of course a nonsense. It is a nonsense that those opposite will try to propagate. It is a nonsense that those opposite will try to push into the living rooms of Australian voters. But it is of course nothing more than a cheap and unsustainable lie.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2009-10-26,"—A government when it is elected has a choice. It can choose to discharge its fundamental responsibility of national security through ensuring effective immigration and border control or, on the other hand, it can send a signal to the global community that on these matters Australia is a soft touch. If a government is actually serious about discharging its fundamental responsibility, about ensuring the security of the nation and its people—as the Rudd government claims it is—then it must be prepared to be judged on the realities and the outcomes that flow as a consequence of its policy decisions. That is what Mr Rudd said in a speech to the parliament on Thursday, 20 June 2002 when he was speaking on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 and reflecting on national security under the Howard government—and I quote:
It depends on concrete measures taken in each of these substantive domains so that this nation is truly secure, not simply projected to be secure through the political rhetoric of this government.
Condemned by his own words. Those fateful words are a stark acknowledgement by the now Prime Minister that the Australian people are entitled to judge his government on their outcomes rather than Mr Rudd’s rhetoric.
In undertaking this judgment it is blatantly clear for all to see that Rudd Labor, despite its media spin and despite its farcical—indeed, nonsensical—tough words, has failed Australia and Australians on border protection. Rudd Labor has failed the first responsibility of the Commonwealth government—to ensure the security of the nation. Based on the encouragement that Mr Rudd has offered the people smugglers through his policies, his words and actions should be seen for what they are: nothing more than cunning rhetoric and media spin—after all, on a day when it suits his purpose, Mr Rudd, with his chameleon-like characteristics, lays out the red carpet to the people smugglers and, in the next breath, when they actually take up the offer of the red carpet, he refers to them as ‘the vilest form of human life’. Clearly, the chameleon’s utterances on illegal immigrants are all about rhetoric and media spin. He changes his words to suit the audience. Then we have the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship’s statement that ‘the Rudd Labor government remains absolutely committed to strong border security measures’—again, nothing more than rhetoric.
These statements alone should demonstrate to the Australian people just how out of touch the minister and Labor are and, what is worse, just how far they will go to mislead the Australian public in relation to the failure of their policy on  border security. Which part of ‘Labor’s gone soft on border protection’ don’t they understand? Is it the part where the evidence shows that their soft border protection laws have given the green light to people smugglers? Or maybe it is the fact that, as at 25 October, the 17th unauthorised boat arrived in Australia in the last eight weeks? Add that to the fact that what we now have is the 45th boat arriving in Australian waters—
—What?
—The 45th boat, Senator Ronaldson—ask me again tomorrow and I have no doubt that it will be 46—since they softened their border protection policies in August 2008. Over 2,030 people have now been guided to Christmas Island. Over 2,030 people have put their lives at risk in an attempt to enter Australia illegally. For a Prime Minister who, in his speech to the parliament, acknowledged that a government must be judged on its actions and not on its rhetoric, this evidence demonstrates that, as the leader of this country, he should stand condemned for his actions, his government’s policies and the betrayal of the Australian people. Mr Rudd has put his head in the sand and refuses to admit that it is his policies that have led to the deadly surge in people smuggling. Mr Rudd has created the problem and Mr Rudd must now find the solution.
This will require more than just the Indonesian solution, which is, ‘Let’s hand out Australian taxpayers’ money to the Indonesians and simply pay for more detention places in that country.’ That is Mr Rudd’s new people-smuggler strategy—pay the Indonesians to intercept boats on Australia’s behalf and then hold the asylum seekers in their detention centres. Remember Mr Rudd squealing about the alleged ill-treatment of the unlawful boat people who were sent to Nauru as part of the so-called Pacific solution? At least on Nauru there were Australian government officials overseeing the management and the treatment of these people. Is Mr Rudd going to insist upon Australian officials overseeing the management and the treatment of the people in Indonesia? I think not. All he is interested in is, as Senator Johnston said earlier, whipping out the chequebook and asking, ‘How many zeros do I write on the cheque?’
But the Australian people are not unintelligent. They know that the money to pay the Indonesians has to come from somewhere. Which part of the budget is going to be plundered to pay for Labor’s dismal policy failure? Which programs are going to be cut to pay for their dismal policy failure? This is a disgraceful policy failure by Rudd Labor, and the Labor Party should stand condemned for their betrayal of the Australian people.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-10-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
On behalf of the opposition, I want to thank the minister for this paper. Obviously, as a Victorian, I am acutely aware of the dangers of bushfires. Indeed, I have fought them and I know the damage they can inflict. In fact, in Victoria the greatest threat of natural disaster comes from bushfires. In my speech today I have drawn extensively from an excellent speech given by the Hon. Fran Bailey MP, the federal member for McEwen, to the Combined Emergency Services 31st annual conference on Saturday 24 October entitled ‘Dealing with disaster: Victoria fires 2009’. As I said, I have drawn extensively from that speech for my comments today.
Since 1851, some 815 people Australia-wide have been recorded as having died in bushfires. Significantly, 561 of those deaths—more than two-thirds—have occurred in Victoria. Most recently of course we faced the horrific Black Saturday fire in February this year. I think people like to think that fires of this magnitude will never happen again. I go back to 1851 and the Black Thursday fires. I think people would have been saying that then, and nothing has changed. Put simply, unless we change the way we do things, it will happen again. But it appears, quite frankly, that the attitude of almost every government since 1851 has been to put its head in the sand and hope that things will not be as bad next time. Hope is not a policy option.
After the Canberra bushfires, the then coalition government established a bipartisan parliamentary panel. It was arguably the most comprehensive examination of bushfires ever conducted. The committee’s report made three key recommendations: (1) early warnings save lives; (2) local knowledge matters; and (3) hazard reduction is vital. While these might sound as if they are stating the obvious, time and again these fundamental points have been downplayed or ignored. Only last weekend, my colleague the member for McEwen made exactly those points at the conference I referred to earlier.
In the ministerial statement there was a section on prevention, but it was with some disappointment that I looked through the minister’s statement and found that there was no mention of hazard reduction. Under ‘prevention’ there is great talk about greater penalties for arson. The coalition welcomes and supports those moves as far as they go. But you cannot criminalise a lightning strike. You cannot criminalise a branch falling against a power pole. If you are serious about prevention—and I mean really serious—then you need to have a substantial program of hazard reduction. In McEwen, the seat hardest hit by those Black Saturday fires, some fire access routes were barred with padlocked gates and signposted as conservation zones. We all believe in conservation, but for tens of thousands of years Aboriginal Australians judiciously used fire to clear out dangerous undergrowth. Why are we afraid to do the same? Preventing the build-up of fuel load was the No. 1 submission of all those received by the Black Saturday royal commission.
I will just deviate briefly to indicate that I support the moves by the Victorian state government in relation to allowing landowners to clear around their homes. That is long overdue. But there is already push back from some of the local government councils, who are potentially responsible for this occurring again. Even in the Dandenongs my understanding is that if you did not have trees and bushes up against your walls you were breaching by-laws. That is extraordinary.
I want to go back to the fuel load question. It does not have to be just burning. I am informed—and again this came from Mrs Bailey—that in Portugal volunteers use heavy equipment and hand clearing to clear roadsides to a minimum of 10 metres and—this will interest Senator Brown and his colleagues who are here today—that this happens even in World Heritage areas.
I will go back to preparedness and response. We welcome the government’s promises relating to preparedness and response contained in the minister’s statement. Interaction between all levels of government and the emergency services, both paid and volunteer, is critical as we head into this year’s fire season. People need to know what is happening. One of the great tragedies of the Black Saturday fires is that lives were lost because people had no access to timely information. Stay or go can only work if you know what you are staying to face. A system of uniform and early fire detection is a national challenge which we must all meet. I note, however, that the Commonwealth is providing $15 million for the establishment and operation of a national emergency warning system. This is being trialled in Victoria. It will not reach mobile phones, yet the Western Australian system, State Alert, can already deliver a warning by landline, fax, email and mobile phones and can drill down to a specific address. It has been tested. It works. It has been offered to the Victorian government for free, so why has this offer not been accepted? Why are we spending $15 million reinventing the wheel?
I now want to turn to recovery. Bushfires have occurred and bushfires will come again. Helping communities to recover from the losses is an essential role for governments, but we are concerned about the top-down emphasis in the minister’s paper. We would prefer to see a more bottom-up approach. Around the world, a greater emphasis is being placed on organised community action and control in determining the nature of the response to the disaster in the community. It is their house; it is their street; it is their town; it is their community. It is local people who are best placed to identify their immediate and long-term needs following a bushfire disaster. Metaphorically, local communities are crying out, ‘Give us the tools and we will do the job.’
I will now defer to my colleague Senator Brandis for the remainder of the time available.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-10-26,"—Thank you. I join Senator Ronaldson in the remarks that he has just made. I want to add a few words of my own as the shadow Attorney-General, for it is within the Attorney-General’s portfolio that emergency management arises. I begin by expressing my gratitude to the Attorney-General, and his office, for the courtesy of the briefing which he provided to me on 19 October with the senior staff of Emergency Management Australia, in which the details of the ministerial statement were thoroughly canvassed with me and my office.
This is not a party political issue, of course, and, without in any way demurring from some of the observations that have just fallen from Senator Ronaldson, the opposition, so far as it goes, welcomes the measures outlined in the ministerial statement. The prevention, preparation, response and recovery of natural disasters in Australia is a combined effort of local communities and of all levels of government. This is the way it ought to be. During a bushfire emergency, the lead response sits with the state authorities that command and support both professional firefighters and the many thousands of volunteers who are the backbone of our front-line protection of communities across Australia.
The Commonwealth, too, has an important role to play during bushfire emergencies. Within constitutional parameters, Commonwealth governments of both political persuasions have done much to support communities and those who protect them from disaster. The Commonwealth government, for example, can ensure that valuable foreign firefighting resources are integrated into the firefighting effort. With coalition support, the Foreign States Immunities Amendment Act was passed in the previous sitting of this parliament to enable mutual exchange of resources and assets with foreign partners, the United States being the most important. US firefighters played an important role in the most recent Victorian bushfires, and it is in everyone’s interest to see that such exchanges continue without being impeded by liability issues. The Commonwealth also assists with financial support through the National Emergency Management Committee, providing matching funds to state governments for local initiatives.
The coalition is particularly proud to continue its support for aerial firefighting initiatives. The Commonwealth contributes most, however, in coordination and communication. The coordination role is to provide Commonwealth resources and assets as and where the state authorities require them, including, if necessary, defence assets and personnel. Centrelink staff can also be made available to assist with the 000 emergency line, in particular to screen nuisance callers.
The communications role attracted considerable comment in the course of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. The lessons are being learnt from that, but I am pleased to be informed that amendments are being made to the Telecommunications Act to provide the states and territories with access to subscriber information in order to bring the national telephone based emergency warning system into operation. This, I am told, became operational on the first of this month. The Commonwealth, in partnership with the states and territories, is also looking at other information options which would free up the 000 service for genuine emergencies and enable warnings to be better targeted.
In conclusion, the opposition supports the ministerial statement. We welcome the initiatives that have been announced. We have some misgivings, as indicated by Senator Ronaldson, that perhaps it could have gone further in certain areas, but so far as it goes it has the opposition’s wholehearted support. In closing, might I take this opportunity to place on record on behalf of the opposition our thanks to the tireless and courageous work of firefighters and volunteers involved in recent bushfire emergencies in Australia not only in Victoria but also, even more recently, in Central Queensland. They represent the very best of the Australian spirit.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-10-26,"—I rise today to also take note of the ministerial statement with regard to bushfire prevention and preparedness. I want to note that in 2001 COAG had before it a report called Natural disasters in Australia: reforming litigation relief and recovery arrangements. That report from 2005 acknowledges that significant limitations existed in national capability to deal with the consequences of a catastrophic event arising from natural, technological or human cause. It was suppressed in 2005 by the coalition, even though it acknowledged there were major gaps in our capability to respond to a major catastrophe and it made several recommendations. Bearing in mind this started in 2001, finally in 2005 we got recommendations. They identified gaps, like the lack of communication. They identified the fact that there was so little coordination around the country.
This report finally came out this year as a result of a FOI request from a TV channel. When asked at estimates why this had been suppressed not only under the coalition but also under the Rudd government since coming to power the answer was, and I find this quite extraordinary, that the reason they did not want it released was the picture that it painted—in other words, it might frighten people in Australia to know that Australia does not have the capability and preparedness to respond to a major catastrophe. I find that an insult to the Australian people, especially as since 2005 we have had a number of major disasters in this country—not least of which of course was the Victorian bushfires. We also had the heatwave in Victoria and South Australia which killed about 400 people last summer. This report asked things like, for example: what capacity have the states got for temporary morgues and what role does a national emergency management authority have in relation to this?
What came out of it all was that there is no capacity for the Commonwealth to intervene unless asked by the states. So it needed someone in Victoria to pick up the phone to Emergency Management Australia and say, ‘What can you do to help us?’ They could not actually intervene without Victoria asking them to. That is a ludicrous situation in Australia, because we know with climate change that there are going to be extreme weather events and they are going to be more frequent and more intense than anything we have ever experienced before. The bushfires in Victoria were a classic case of that. Tragically, it is only a matter of time until we could well have a fire that goes across two or three state borders at any one time—plus we could have a cyclone event in Northern Australia at the same time. So we could have a situation where emergency services in Australia are battling fires in one state, floods in another and a cyclone somewhere else, because of the realities of climate change and the realities of what is going on at the moment.
Yet when Senator Ludlam asked in estimates the other night if there was a proposal or an acceptance that we should have our operation fire chiefs from each state on Emergency Management Australia so that there is a national coordination of capability and planning, the answer was, ‘No, it is not proposed that the operation fire chiefs be on Emergency Management Australia.’ Well, frankly, that is silly. We need to have a situation where the onus is reversed. There has to be a Commonwealth power to enable Emergency Management Australia to take charge of a national catastrophic disaster and coordinate the response. So we need to reverse the onus from having people sitting waiting in Canberra for Victoria, or anywhere else for that matter, to pick up the phone.
I would like to pose a question, and this is rhetorical—the government does not have to answer; but I would like to know—was Emergency Management Australia, the Commonwealth agency from the Attorney-General’s Department responsible for coordinating operational response to all hazards, involved in the events of Saturday 7 February 2009 in Victoria? If not, why not? And did anyone in Emergency Management Australia pick up the phone and contact the Victorian government or any of its three fire services to offer assistance when it was apparent that the state was facing an extreme weather event, before the event happened? We have had media reports in the last week that the Russians offered some major firefighting aviation response. It was too late on this occasion. But if Emergency Management Australia and the Commonwealth had overall responsibility for the coordination of a national disaster plan, and had the operational chiefs from each of the states represented on that, you could be coordinating well before the event all of the services around Australia that may be needed in responding to any one event at any one time—plus looking at the opportunities for overseas assistance in the event of a major catastrophe. As I said, it could be flood, cyclone and fire all at once any time between November and March in Australia. That is our reality.
So, whilst I appreciate that the minister has come out with this statement, the fact is that when the firefighters union spoke to the Deputy Prime Minister she said there would be an audit from each of the states requested by the Commonwealth and presented before this year’s fire season; and that has not happened. The matter is now to go to a ministerial meeting in November and a COAG meeting in December. Frankly, that is too late, because we will already be well into the fire season. I understand that the government says, ‘We’re doing all these things that supersede that undertaking that the Deputy Prime Minister made to the firefighters union that there would be an audit of fire readiness.’ But, for example, have the states done as the Commonwealth asked and actually got this model legislation in place in terms of bushfire arson? I could guarantee that Tasmania will not have done that.
For years we have been calling for Tasmania to have a special arson flying squad at the beginning of the fire season to move around, because frequently the same people light the same fires in the same areas every year—and it is not as if they do not know where this might occur. We have ridiculous scenarios like the one where we had the Tarkine on fire because somebody drove a four-wheel drive in there, went off the road and rolled the car. They lit a fire and then left it and walked away. They went to get medical help. The fire got away and burnt the Tarkine. Have any charges been laid? No, they have not. Why? Because it was decided in Tasmania that the man lost his car—it was burned in the process—and therefore had suffered enough. What about the loss of not only the natural environment but also all the parks and wildlife infrastructure that was lost in the process?
So I am not happy at all that the states are being given so much responsibility here. I heard Senator Ronaldson say it is appropriate that local communities be given responsibility. I do not think that that is actually appropriate, given the potential scale, frequency and combination of a potential disaster in Australia. Certainly, local communities have to be involved and state governments have to be involved, but the onus should shift to the Commonwealth. We need a national disaster plan rolled out. It needs to be coordinated at the national level with representation from the operational chiefs in each of the states, and then it has to be coordinated with local government and local emergency responses.
We have a situation where some of these fire authorities in the various states do not even speak to each other. How ridiculous is that when you have a disaster? So I am glad we have this ministerial statement, but I think Australians need to realise that for several years these recommendations have been sitting here and nothing has been done. It is time for a shift in recognising the scale of the problem and that the response needs to be a national one, in coordination and collaboration with the states and local authorities.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-10-26,"—Summer is fast approaching already and the bushfire season will be upon us quickly. The shocking events of 7 February are still vivid in most people’s memories. We cannot erase the terrible memories or the events which have happened. We have all grieved as a nation and felt the pain shared by those who have lost loved ones. We cannot bring back those who perished in this tragedy, and there are those who are scarred from it as well. What we can do, however, is make sure that we are best prepared to avoid such devastating loss of life.
It was horrifying to hear from the minister’s report that up to 50 per cent of all bushfires in Australia are deliberately lit. I cannot comprehend what would cause some people to engage in such destruction. However, what is clear is that we need a better system of tracking potential firebugs and also tougher penalties to discourage individuals from engaging in this kind of behaviour. The Commonwealth has drafted model laws which include prison sentences of up to 25 years, and it is time for us to get a move on and put these laws into place so that anyone who is tempted to deliberately light a fire this bushfire season will know the full consequences of the laws in place.
The government has also announced funding for bushfire prone regions, and this has the full support of Family First. We need to provide funding not only to help bushfire affected zones recover and rebuild but also to prevent these tragedies from occurring again. This includes money for early warning systems and firefighting equipment. These are matters which deserve bipartisan support and a united front by all Australians.
I want to turn to the very important issue of reducing fuel around homes and in the bush generally. I have been out to these fire affected areas, and the majority of people have told me they are angry and annoyed with the lockup mentality of the government, whereby they do not do enough fuel reduction burns. These people also blame the Greens, who are too concerned about locking up vast areas of bush for the safety of the environment, with little regard for humans. That is all well and good, but what about making the environment safe enough to also enjoy and to live in, making it safe enough so fire does not devastate the areas where we live and cause such devastating loss of life?
During the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission, 485 submissions were received from fire experts, foresters and residents regarding burning off areas to rob fires of fuel. However, not one of the 51 recommendations in the royal commission’s interim report mentions fuel reduction burns. That means we will go into our next fire season in just a few weeks without any meaningful recommendations on managing the bush to protect human lives in an environmentally friendly way.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank all those firefighters, support staff, emergency services and other people who worked so hard on the day and also in the following weeks and months and right up to now. Thank you to all those people. It is a credit to all those involved.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Bushfires</title>,Ministerial Statements,16,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2009-10-26,"—I also rise to speak this evening on the comments made by the honourable Attorney-General. Others have referred to preparation, response and recovery; I just wish to speak of the first of the cornerstones of emergency response, and that is the question of prevention. I want to pick up, if I may, on a comment made by Senator Fielding, and that relates particularly to fuel reduction. We all know there are three main causes of fire: you have got to have ignition, you have got to have air and you must have fuel. The only comments that the minister actually made about prevention were in relation to arson, which of course is a means of ignition. He is quite right—50 per cent or more of fires in the bush are probably caused by people. But the point I wish to emphasise is that of fuel reduction, because if the fuel is not there in the first place to allow the sort of conflagration we saw in the Victorian fires—and we have seen it in others—then you do not get the severity of the fires themselves.
Prevention is far and away the most cost-effective method of attacking wildfires. It is the most neglected in bushfire management in Australia. As Senator Fielding said a moment ago, it is regrettable that none of the recommendations of the interim report of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission addresses fuel reduction, because it is in that area that we actually have the scope to achieve something. Equally, it is in that area that I believe the scope exists for the Commonwealth government to take a leadership role. To give you some statistics, very briefly, experts in the field—and that is led by CSIRO, departments of conservation and land management, and other land managers—would say for most southern eucalypt forests that you would need somewhere between seven and eight per cent of the forest burnt each year to achieve some sort of protection for communities. In Victoria, that figure is now down to less than a half of one per cent. Therefore, we regret-tably saw almost an inevitability in February of this year.
Prevention is an area that has the most urgent need for government attention. Land management, under our Constitution, is the responsibility of the states and we all know the role that local government, volunteer brigades and others play in protecting communities. But there is a very necessary role for the Commonwealth in developing a national bushfire policy to which all states and local governments can have input but which must be driven by the Com-monwealth. People would say, ‘Where does the role for the Commonwealth come?’ It comes in the enor-mous amount of expenditure. It is a regrettable fact that there is an argument that says that the more the Commonwealth throws into the response and recovery phase, the more it may appear to be rewarding failure, because had the circumstances not developed in the first place of the levels of fuel that we are seeing in the forests and seeing in our rural communities and those at risk we would not actually be suffering the problem. In the few moments I have to conclude, I simply say that Aboriginal communities over 30,000 years have led us in the way to go. Had they not led us that way, we would not actually have the forests that we have today. I fully support the role of the Commonwealth in national bushfire policy.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-10-26,"—I present the 139th report of the Committee of Privileges entitled Persons referred to in the Senate—Mr Alan Cummine.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 56th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate. On 8 October 2009, the President received a submission from Mr Alan Cummine relating to comments made by Senator Milne in the Senate on 10 September 2009 during debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No.4) Bill 2009. The President referred the submission from Mr Cummine to the committee on 22 October 2009. The committee deliberated upon the matter and recommends that Mr Cummine’s complaint is a proper one and that this is an appropriate case in which he be granted a right of reply consequent upon Senator Milne’s adverse remarks and that the proposed response be incorporated in Hansard.
The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or by the persons referred to. Rather, it ensures that these persons’ submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in Privilege Resolution 5. That has been the conclusion in relation to Mr Cummine’s submission. I commend the motion to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—
Appendix One
Response by Mr Alan Cummine
Pursuant to Resolution 5(7)(b) of the Senate of 25 February 1988
Senator Christine Milne referred to me and other colleagues by name during a debate on a Tax Laws Amendment Bill. In doing so, Senator Milne repeated the views that Dr Judith Ajani had expressed in her submission to the Inquiry into Agribusiness Managed Investment Schemes conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services.
For your convenience, I quote here the relevant extract from page 26 of the Senate Hansard, 10 September 2009.
‘I think it is time we had a very good look at who the government is listening to. We have a greenhouse mafia in Australia where people go in a revolving door from the coal industry into ministerial offices, then become lobbyists and then go into the department for a while—and round and round they go, giving one another the same advice. We have exactly the same thing here: from government to forest lobbying. Alan Cummine, for example, used to be an adviser to environment minister Ros Kelly. He went across to the forest lobbies through Australian Forest Growers, Treefarm Investment Managers Australia, and Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council. Allan Hansard went from ABARE and DAFF across to the National Association of Forest Industries. Mile Prosser went from state forests of New South Wales over to NAFI, Plantations Australia and A3P. Richard Stanton from DAFF and state forests in New South Wales went over to NAFI and then A3P, the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council. Phil Townsend went from DAFF across to NAFI, to Tree Plantations Australia and then to ANU—round and round the revolving door goes. And what a surprise that they all give one another the same advice! Not only do they go round and round but they spin off occasionally into the carbon fossil sector, where you have Robin Bain, who used to work for NAFI, for Timber Communities [Australia], which used to be called the Forest Protection Society or whatever. She has gone across to be the chief lobbyist for the cement industry. It is a beautiful thing—round and round they go, giving one another the advice they want to hear.’
In the context created by the first sentence about the ‘greenhouse mafia’ going through a revolving door between industry, ministerial offices and government departments, a clear implication and insinuation exists in the rest of Senator Milne’s statement that there is something inappropriate and even sinister about certain people using their knowledge and expertise to the benefit of different government and non-government organisations.
By naming me and selected parts of my recent employment (and that of my colleagues) in this context, Senator Milne is insinuating that, through the career choices I have made, my conduct has been somehow inappropriate and perhaps unprofessional, and that I may have misused my position and networks in fulfilling my duties to provide advice and representation.
I reject this insinuation and the inference that is intended to be drawn from it—both as a general principle and with respect to me personally.
The movement of people into, out of and among government, industry, academia, non-government organisations, private consultancies and diverse government appointments is a widespread and utterly unremarkable phenomenon. To single out several professionals now or recently in the forest industry as somehow having acted inappropriately by doing so is unreasonable and unwarranted.
To illustrate this phenomenon from a different perspective, I can personally name at least thirteen former environmental activists and campaigners—with whom I have had professional dealings and personal friendships going back to the mid-1970s—who have had career paths as described above, including moving into senior positions in key state and federal government agencies and then back out into environmental lobbying and consulting. I can name others who left long careers as public servants, ministerial advisers and industry leaders to take up senior positions with environmental organisations.
My own professional career is somewhat more diverse than was described by Senator Milne.
I have tertiary qualifications in agriculture (Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, Sydney) and environment (Master of Environmental Studies, ANU).
Relevant parts of my professional career include a span of sixteen years in Commonwealth Government departments—primary industries (northern Australia), foreign affairs (aid policy), environment and conservation (five years, including the formation of the Australian Heritage Commission), resources and energy (five years, energy conservation), finishing in 1985 as a branch head in the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment.
Two years with Greening Australia (1989–91) were followed by three years as a policy adviser to environment minister, Ros Kelly, before I was appointed as National Policy Director with Australian Forest Growers (AFG) in 1994.
Since 2000, I have served in chief and senior executive positions with Treefarm Investment Managers Association (TIMA) and the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council (A3P).
Over the past 35 years, I have also been a member, sometimes quite active, of my relevant professional associations and a number of environment organisations—including Australian Conservation Foundation (still current), Tasmanian Wilderness Society and Friends of the Earth.
Throughout my career, as others will willingly attest, I have behaved with professionalism and integrity in the service of my employing organisations. I have not ever concealed the nature of my employment or my role in any organisation, and I have sought to work with government and non-government organisations that have environmental and natural resource benefits at their core. Contrary to what Senator Milne appears to be insinuating, that includes organisations representing forestry.
The manner and context in which Senator Milne described my career movements is unjustified, unfair and offensive, and I ask that you take appropriate action to correct the public record.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,23,1,speech

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2009-10-26,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Vietnam and to the 17th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Laos, which took place from 5 to 15 January 2009. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I am pleased to present the report of the delegation’s visit to Vietnam and its participation in the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vientiane. The Speaker led the delegation, which also included the member for Cowan and my Senate colleagues Senators Collins and Moore. I pay tribute to the delegation secretary, Ms Catherine Cornish, for sharing her expertise in the APPF process, her attention to detail and her masterful ability to ensure that the visit went smoothly with characteristic Australian humour. Likewise we were fortunate to have the Clerk of the House, Mr Ian Harris AO, join us. His enormous wealth of knowledge and appreciation of procedure held us in good stead.
As delegations have previously visited Vietnam on a number of occasions, the visit provided an opportunity to renew parliamentary contacts with the National Assembly, to gain an understanding of the impact of economic reform and advances that have taken place in the last 20 years, to observe the outcomes of Australia’s development cooperation program at first hand and also to consider prospects for further trade and investment by Australia. Vietnam is a kaleidoscope of geographic features, from the limestone islands of Ha Long Bay and the plains of the Mekong River to the modern metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City and the Old Quarter of Hanoi. In a very short time we could only cover some of this, but we really focussed on three areas: Ho Chi Minh City, where our meetings and visits were designed to give us a perspective on the impact of economic reform, trade and development cooperation; Hanoi, where the National Assembly was the focus; and Ha Long City and Ha Long Bay, where our attention was on environmental issues and the impact of economic reform.
The discussions that we had were interesting and constructive. We were pleased to meet a number of people, in particular the Vietnamese Prime Minister and Chairman Trong, President of the National Assembly. Of particular note were the visits to organisations that were the product of Australian investment and support. One of the visits we made that was a highlight to me was to the RMIT International University campus in Ho Chi Minh City, which reached 5,000 student enrolments last year. It is a most impressive campus that provides sought after tertiary courses for the locals whilst offering exchange opportunities and professional development for Australian students and academic staff.
We visited Phu My Bridge, a Bilfinger Berger and Baulderstone Hornibrook project, which was close to completion. It is, I have to say, an engineering masterpiece, and it is one that is managed by Australians. Equally impressive, although vastly different in nature, was the Protec helmet factory, which is largely supported by AusAID. Programs like this seek to make motorcyclists safer by producing low-cost helmets. The challenge will be to mandate the same protection to all the pillion passengers, who are not yet obliged to wear helmets. The number of people and size of goods carried on the back of bikes was a sight to behold and, may I also say, defied gravity.
Two other visits we made in Ho Chi Minh City were very memorable. The first was to the centre of education and vocational training for homeless and orphan children and the second was to the school for the blind in Ho Chi Minh City. In each place we saw the impact of support from Australia, whether that was a relatively small donation under the Direct Aid Program to the homeless and orphan children, or funding support that Loreto Vietnam-Australia provided for infrastructure to the school for the blind. I think what mattered to the people and children who received that support from Australians—and this was certainly indicated to us when we spoke to many there—was the thought that went into the determination and the direction of this support and aid, the careful assessment of needs and priorities that had been undertaken and perhaps, more importantly, the goodwill that it demonstrated.
Following the visit to Vietnam we travelled to Vientiane for the annual meeting of the APPF. These meetings have taken place in cities around the region each January for the last 16 years. Our parliament participates in the APPF for two major reasons: the countries that belong to the APPF are important to our regional, strategic and economic interests; and because we support the objectives of APPF meetings. The plenary sessions at the meeting were broken into three broad subject areas: economic and trade matters; political and security issues; and interparliamentary cooperation in the region. Our delegation proposed and spoke to a number of resolutions. The topic I chose to address was cooperation on natural disaster management—an issue of particular relevance in our region and one that we actually saw the effect of more recently with the tsunami and the effect it had on Samoa. Part of my speech was directed towards encouraging cooperation to improve preparedness for natural disasters, to provide relief and to assist in recovery. We followed up our speeches with negotiations on the final resolutions on the various topics. Outside the plenary we participated in bilateral meetings with other delegations, including those from China, the Russian Federation and Mexico.
I express our thanks to the Australian embassy representatives in Vietnam: the Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Allaster Cox, the Consul-General in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr Graeme Swift, and Mr Michael Hoy, who accompanied us throughout our time in Vietnam. Michael contributed greatly to the preparation and the implementation of the delegation’s program. He was unfailingly courteous and most skilful in keeping us informed to the max and organised.
In Laos we were assisted by Her Excellency Dr Michele Forster and her colleagues—in particular, Ms Emily Russell. The post in Vientiane is not a big one and so the preparations that were made by them to assist our work with the APPF secretariat, local officials and expatriates were very much appreciated. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra also assisted the delegation by briefing us and providing comprehensive briefing materials and draft resolutions. The Parliamentary Library also provided briefing material and a draft resolution, and the Parliamentary Relations Office gave administrative support.
Each member of our delegation participated fully in the various meetings in Vietnam and at the APPF meeting in Vientiane. Throughout the visits we sought to represent the parliament effectively through the resolutions we advocated, our speeches and our meetings. For my own part I found the visits rewarding in the opportunities they presented to meet local people, including members of parliament, to hear their perspectives on the major issues they confront and to see firsthand progress that is taking place both in Vietnam and Laos. The cohesion and goodwill of the delegation was also rewarding. For that I thank the Speaker, as leader, the member for Cowan, Mr Simpkins, and Senators Moore and Collins.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-10-26,"—by leave—I am grateful for the leave granted to make a short statement with respect to the report of the Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009. I do so having participated in the committee hearings on this bill and because this is quite an unprecedented piece of legislation. This is a bill which in an unprecedented fashion targets one particular Australian company and it targets it with the objective of securing the break-up of that company. This is something that is quite unprecedented, and therefore I feel motivated, despite the conventions that I know exist here, to comment on this report, because I believe—and I think it is important to draw attention to the fact—that the majority report is quite inadequate in its very disappointing attempt to endorse what is a quite radical and unprecedented piece of legislation.
It is our contention that the majority report completely misrepresents the weight of evidence presented to the committee about this quite extraordinary piece of legislation. The numerical majority of submissions made to the committee were clearly opposed to this extraordinary proposal for the forced break-up of the company. This bill is proposing to say to Telstra: ‘You must break up the company if you wish to retain access to mobile spectrum. If you ever again wish to bid for spectrum at auction, you must break up the company in the following ways.’ Most of the submissions to the committee addressed that matter, and most were hostile to that remarkable proposition. The hostility to this bill was quite overwhelming.
I must say that the majority of this committee—frankly, like the government of the day—are treating the ordinary shareholders of Telstra, the company in which there is the widest shareholding in Australia, with complete contempt. The dismissal of the outrage, anger and alarm of what are literally mum and dad shareholders in this company is quite extraordinary and quite arrogant. There is no acknowledgement in the majority report of this committee that Telstra has, as I said, the widest shareholding of any company in Australia. It has in fact 1.4 million individual shareholders. There are many millions more who have an indirect connection to Telstra through their superannuation funds, of course. There are 30,000 employees of this company. There is no acknowledgement of their situation, of the prospects they may face upon the break-up of this company. It is a company with nine million customers. Nowhere is mention made of the potential consequences for them and their telephone services.
The majority of the committee treat the shareholders, the employees and the customers with contempt in what is a bland dismissal of the concerns raised before the committee for the future of the company. Nowhere is there any sign of the Labor Party’s contrition for the way they have completely misled shareholders about their intentions in relation to Telstra. It is quite evident that at no stage prior to the last election, or indeed until September of this year, had Labor given any hint that it would change its policy in favour of breaking up Telstra. Indeed since 1992, when the Labor Party created what is now Telstra, until September of this year—17 years—it has not once been formal Labor Party policy to break up this company. So this is quite unprecedented, and there was no sign to the shareholders or anybody else that the Labor Party would propose such a radical and extraordinary proposition.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This is misleading the Senate. Senator Minchin ran an entire election campaign in 1996 alleging the Labor Party were going to split Telstra. Now he claims that is untrue.
 (Senator Bernardi)—Order! There is no point of order.
—Despite that ridiculous interjection, the fact is that the Labor Party said in 1996, ‘Oh no, we’re not going to break up Telstra.’ And what did they say as late as the May budget estimates? ‘Oh no, we have no plans for breaking up Telstra.’ ‘I have never advocated breaking up Telstra,’ said Senator Conroy. At the last election, they went to the people and proclaimed loudly, ‘Sure, we want to keep retail and wholesale distinct—but within the company.’ So there was no hint, no sign, no forewarning of this quite extraordinary proposition which the Labor Party is now advancing. But do we find any sign from Senator Conroy, Mr Rudd, the government as a whole or indeed the majority on this committee of any apology from the Labor Party to all those shareholders? Of course there is no such apology. They continue to treat them with utter contempt.
The committee makes much of the fact that Telstra’s competitors and the ACCC want Telstra broken up. This seems to basis of the Labor policy. It is not based on some really intellectual exercise undertaken by the Labor Party. They said, ‘The competitors want it broken up, and the ACCC wants it broken up, so let’s break it up.’ I mean no offence to the competitors, but what on earth would you expect them to say? Of course, Telstra’s competitors would like the company broken up. It is entirely in their self-interest and I respect and acknowledge that, but the government do not. They just say: ‘Oh well, they must be right. Let’s break up the company, because the competitors want it all broken up.’ What a facile basis for public policy of this kind. As was said, they would say that, wouldn’t they?
As for the ACCC, of course the regulator wants an easier life. As regulators do all over the world, they regulate fully integrated companies and it is not an easy task. The question though is whether it is in the national interest to break it up, or are we going to act simply because the regulator wants an easy life? I put to the Senate that what we are obliged to do is reflect upon the national interest and not the particular interest of competitors or of the regulator.
The majority, I think, in this report failed to notice and failed to note in their report that the government have given no detailed objective analysis of the proposed break-up. All they do is rely on the fact that the competitors have been saying this—and they have been saying this, I think, ever since competition was introduced by our government last century. Of course the competitors have been saying that since then. But where is the objective analysis setting out the benefits and costs of this break-up for the national interest? It does not exist. The majority report of the committee makes no reference to it. The government have made no reference to it. But this is similar to the National Broadband Network, where there is no analysis whatsoever of the costs and benefits of the proposal, as demanded by the Business Council, nor is there in relation to the costs and benefits of the break-up of Australia’s incumbent telecommunications company.
The majority report of the committee also makes no reference whatsoever to the potential consequences for investment in telecommunications of the break-up of Telstra. Again, I think this is a major omission by both the government and the committee. Indeed, paragraph 2.41 of the majority report, in referring to the objectives of telecommunications policy, does not even mention the importance of encouraging investment in the telecommunications industry which must be a profound objective of telecommunications policy. How do we encourage investment in this industry? The majority report of the committee makes no reference to this issue. There is no reference at all to the objective and the consequences for investment in this industry of the break-up of this company nor is there any reference by the majority to the threat to investment in Australia of this quite extraordinary action. Nowhere is there any contemplation of the possibility, as alluded to by so many of the submissions we received, of the issue of sovereign risk in relation to foreign investment in this country, much of which was in Telstra, in fact.
I also draw attention to the fact that the majority baldly assert that those who bought shares in T1, T2 and T3 should have read the prospectus statement about regulatory risk and therefore not be at all surprised that the Labor Party has rolled along and said, ‘We are going to break up the company.’ Silly shareholders for not realising a Labor government may come along and just decide to break up the company! How ridiculous that the shareholders should expect that from a party that have never before advocated structural separation of the company. They did not have it as their policy. This is a broken promise. They have no mandate to do this and it is outrageous for the government to expect that Telstra shareholders, in buying those shares, should have had in the front of their minds that the Labor Party would come along and break its promises, and break up the company.
It is certainly true, I regret to say, that in future no shareholders should trust the Labor Party. Good luck to the government in trying to implement its apparent policy of, at some point, privatising the NBN. Who on earth in Australia is going to buy shares in NBN after what this lot are proposing to do to those who bought shares in good faith in Telstra from their government? This is a very disappointing majority report. It is weak in so many respects. It neglects some of the major issues raised by this most radical, unprecedented and extraordinary attack on a major Australian corporation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,30,1,speech

It is our contention that the majority report completely misrepresents the weight of evidence presented to the committee about this quite extraordinary piece of legislation. The numerical majority of submissions made to the committee were clearly opposed to this extraordinary proposal for the forced break-up of the company. This bill is proposing to say to Telstra: ‘You must break up the company if you wish to retain access to mobile spectrum. If you ever again wish to bid for spectrum at auction, you must break up the company in the following ways.’ Most of the submissions to the committee addressed that matter, and most were hostile to that remarkable proposition. The hostility to this bill was quite overwhelming.
I must say that the majority of this committee—frankly, like the government of the day—are treating the ordinary shareholders of Telstra, the company in which there is the widest shareholding in Australia, with complete contempt. The dismissal of the outrage, anger and alarm of what are literally mum and dad shareholders in this company is quite extraordinary and quite arrogant. There is no acknowledgement in the majority report of this committee that Telstra has, as I said, the widest shareholding of any company in Australia. It has in fact 1.4 million individual shareholders. There are many millions more who have an indirect connection to Telstra through their superannuation funds, of course. There are 30,000 employees of this company. There is no acknowledgement of their situation, of the prospects they may face upon the break-up of this company. It is a company with nine million customers. Nowhere is mention made of the potential consequences for them and their telephone services.
The majority of the committee treat the shareholders, the employees and the customers with contempt in what is a bland dismissal of the concerns raised before the committee for the future of the company. Nowhere is there any sign of the Labor Party’s contrition for the way they have completely misled shareholders about their intentions in relation to Telstra. It is quite evident that at no stage prior to the last election, or indeed until September of this year, had Labor given any hint that it would change its policy in favour of breaking up Telstra. Indeed since 1992, when the Labor Party created what is now Telstra, until September of this year—17 years—it has not once been formal Labor Party policy to break up this company. So this is quite unprecedented, and there was no sign to the shareholders or anybody else that the Labor Party would propose such a radical and extraordinary proposition.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This is misleading the Senate. Senator Minchin ran an entire election campaign in 1996 alleging the Labor Party were going to split Telstra. Now he claims that is untrue.
 (Senator Bernardi)—Order! There is no point of order.
—Despite that ridiculous interjection, the fact is that the Labor Party said in 1996, ‘Oh no, we’re not going to break up Telstra.’ And what did they say as late as the May budget estimates? ‘Oh no, we have no plans for breaking up Telstra.’ ‘I have never advocated breaking up Telstra,’ said Senator Conroy. At the last election, they went to the people and proclaimed loudly, ‘Sure, we want to keep retail and wholesale distinct—but within the company.’ So there was no hint, no sign, no forewarning of this quite extraordinary proposition which the Labor Party is now advancing. But do we find any sign from Senator Conroy, Mr Rudd, the government as a whole or indeed the majority on this committee of any apology from the Labor Party to all those shareholders? Of course there is no such apology. They continue to treat them with utter contempt.
The committee makes much of the fact that Telstra’s competitors and the ACCC want Telstra broken up. This seems to basis of the Labor policy. It is not based on some really intellectual exercise undertaken by the Labor Party. They said, ‘The competitors want it broken up, and the ACCC wants it broken up, so let’s break it up.’ I mean no offence to the competitors, but what on earth would you expect them to say? Of course, Telstra’s competitors would like the company broken up. It is entirely in their self-interest and I respect and acknowledge that, but the government do not. They just say: ‘Oh well, they must be right. Let’s break up the company, because the competitors want it all broken up.’ What a facile basis for public policy of this kind. As was said, they would say that, wouldn’t they?
As for the ACCC, of course the regulator wants an easier life. As regulators do all over the world, they regulate fully integrated companies and it is not an easy task. The question though is whether it is in the national interest to break it up, or are we going to act simply because the regulator wants an easy life? I put to the Senate that what we are obliged to do is reflect upon the national interest and not the particular interest of competitors or of the regulator.
The majority, I think, in this report failed to notice and failed to note in their report that the government have given no detailed objective analysis of the proposed break-up. All they do is rely on the fact that the competitors have been saying this—and they have been saying this, I think, ever since competition was introduced by our government last century. Of course the competitors have been saying that since then. But where is the objective analysis setting out the benefits and costs of this break-up for the national interest? It does not exist. The majority report of the committee makes no reference to it. The government have made no reference to it. But this is similar to the National Broadband Network, where there is no analysis whatsoever of the costs and benefits of the proposal, as demanded by the Business Council, nor is there in relation to the costs and benefits of the break-up of Australia’s incumbent telecommunications company.
The majority report of the committee also makes no reference whatsoever to the potential consequences for investment in telecommunications of the break-up of Telstra. Again, I think this is a major omission by both the government and the committee. Indeed, paragraph 2.41 of the majority report, in referring to the objectives of telecommunications policy, does not even mention the importance of encouraging investment in the telecommunications industry which must be a profound objective of telecommunications policy. How do we encourage investment in this industry? The majority report of the committee makes no reference to this issue. There is no reference at all to the objective and the consequences for investment in this industry of the break-up of this company nor is there any reference by the majority to the threat to investment in Australia of this quite extraordinary action. Nowhere is there any contemplation of the possibility, as alluded to by so many of the submissions we received, of the issue of sovereign risk in relation to foreign investment in this country, much of which was in Telstra, in fact.
I also draw attention to the fact that the majority baldly assert that those who bought shares in T1, T2 and T3 should have read the prospectus statement about regulatory risk and therefore not be at all surprised that the Labor Party has rolled along and said, ‘We are going to break up the company.’ Silly shareholders for not realising a Labor government may come along and just decide to break up the company! How ridiculous that the shareholders should expect that from a party that have never before advocated structural separation of the company. They did not have it as their policy. This is a broken promise. They have no mandate to do this and it is outrageous for the government to expect that Telstra shareholders, in buying those shares, should have had in the front of their minds that the Labor Party would come along and break its promises, and break up the company.
It is certainly true, I regret to say, that in future no shareholders should trust the Labor Party. Good luck to the government in trying to implement its apparent policy of, at some point, privatising the NBN. Who on earth in Australia is going to buy shares in NBN after what this lot are proposing to do to those who bought shares in good faith in Telstra from their government? This is a very disappointing majority report. It is weak in so many respects. It neglects some of the major issues raised by this most radical, unprecedented and extraordinary attack on a major Australian corporation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,30,2,speech

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-26,"—I move amendment (7) on sheet 5890:
(7)    Schedule 1, page 10 (after line 27), after item 32, insert:
32A  At the end of section 200F
Add:
Certain exceptions cease to operate
         (6)    Subsections 200F(2), (3) and (4) cease to have effect 36 months after the commencement of Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Termination Payments) Act 2009, unless their operation is continued or varied by a subsequent Act of Parliament.
Note:   Subsections 200F(2), (3) and (4) provide exceptions to the member approval requirement for benefits that do not exceed one year’s base salary.
This amendment inserts a creative sunset provision. This is an unusual sunset provision. I think Senator Conroy is squinting.
—I am perplexed.
—He is perplexed. I could say something very unkind, but I will not. But I will say that if Senator Conroy listens he will understand that this sunset clause is quite compelling. I would like to thank the Clerk Assistant (Procedure), Richard Pye, who creatively drafted this sunset clause. I note that it is his birthday today. I would like to wish Mr Pye a happy birthday.
This amendment inserts a creative sunset provision which causes certain exceptions to cease after a period of time. Those provisions are the ones that say member approval is not needed if the retirement benefit does not exceed one year’s base pay. If those exceptions ceased to operate, virtually all retirement benefits would require approval. This amendment would require parliament to revisit this legislation in 36 months time, which would give corporations time to test the new legislation and us, as law-makers, time to review its effectiveness in eliminating outrageous golden handshakes.
The minister has said time and time again in the course of this debate, quite fairly, that the Productivity Commission will be handing down its final report in December. I note also that APRA has been looking at this. We need to see how this legislation will work. Fundamentally this legislation is a work in progress, given that the Productivity Commission will be providing a report in the next two months, which I think will cast further light on the issue of executive remuneration and the most effective way of dealing with it.
This sunset clause gives the legislature an opportunity to revisit the legislation within three years. Unlike other sunset clauses where, if the sunset clause comes into operation, there is no legislation in place, here there would be a default provision; it being that shareholder approval would be required for virtually all executive remuneration. In other words, because of the default provision there would be a strong incentive for the government of the day to revisit the legislation, particularly in the context of the way the legislation will operate, the Productivity Commission’s report and the fact that the minister has, quite fairly and rightly, pointed out that this legislation is the first of further steps to deal with the issue of executive remuneration. I urge senators to support this amendment, which I see as strengthening the intent of the bill. It provides a useful mechanism for revisiting the bill within the next three years.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY ON TERMINATION PAYMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-10-26,"—I have listened carefully to what Senator Xenophon has said and I am persuaded that this amendment, which provides a creative sunset clause of 36 months, is worth supporting. The clause provides a very good opportunity to take into account the Productivity Commission’s report, the APRA principles and any further global regulatory changes.
During the debate Senator Conroy alluded to the evolving nature of matters relating to executive remuneration, and to me those circumstances seem a valid reason to revisit the iteration of dealing with executive remuneration that we are adopting in this bill. I think the amendment provides an opportunity to strengthen this legislation and I commend Senator Xenophon and Richard Pye, whose birthday it is today—happy birthday, Richard!—for crafting a reasonable clause that will respond to the various iterations that no doubt will attend further examination of executive remuneration. I want to indicate at the outset the coalition’s support for the sunset clause.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY ON TERMINATION PAYMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-10-26,"—If anything could possibly give you cause to pause on this amendment, Senator Xenophon, it is the fact that the coalition want to support it. They oppose every single measure that is about restraining corporate greed. It is in their DNA. Yet they are attracted to an amendment you moved. It is in their DNA to allow corporate excess and they like your amendment—there should be no more terrifying thought going through your mind at the moment.
The government will oppose this amendment, which is an attempt to kill this bill by stealth. I was perplexed during your contribution because I could not believe that you would intentionally kill the bill, but it is clear from your contribution that that is exactly the purpose of this amendment. It will mean that the gains we make on termination benefits today, reining in corporate greed and excess, giving shareholders a greater say on golden handshakes and ensuring greater accountability, will all be lost in time.
The corporate community will pretend that they will go along with it, if it is just for three years. They will pretend that they are really happy and you will think, ‘That’s fine; we don’t need to do anything,’ and then they will be back. Why would you give them this out? I am truly perplexed, because I actually know your thoughts on these issues. You have spoken eloquently many times in this chamber—
—I don’t know about ‘eloquently’.
—I am flattering you at the moment, Senator Xenophon. You are correct: you are rarely eloquent. I will take your own interjection. This bill is an important change in its own right, and the opposition—
—So why are you so frightened of accountability?
—The Liberal Party wanting to crack down on corporate greed is like an oxymoron.

Senator Coonan interjecting—

—It is like a wooden stake to a vampire, dealing with greed.
—Why don’t you have faith in your own bill?
—It is programmed into your DNA. You loathe shareholders; you represent corporate interests—it is in your DNA.

(Senator Bernardi)—Order!
—Sorry. You are awake, Chair! I wasn’t sure. I thought you’d nodded off.
—Senator Conroy, it is most inappropriate to reflect upon the chair.
—It is just that when I interjected on Senator Minchin I got about three words in before you called me to order.
—Please continue.
—Thank you. I apologise. I had no intention at all of reflecting upon the chair. The bill is an important change in its own right and it stands in its own right. The opposition will force these tough measures to lapse and will force us to start again if they successfully help Senator Xenophon to get this amendment up. If this amendment passes, the government will consider its position and reconsider the value of the amended bill when it returns to the House. This is an absurd proposition. I do not honestly believe that you truly intend this, Senator Xenophon. That is why I am perplexed. I truly do not understand your thinking.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY ON TERMINATION PAYMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-10-26,"—I thank Senator Brown. I think he might actually have risen before me, but I thank him anyway. That was the most extraordinary intervention from Senator Conroy, who seems to feel that this legislation is so fragile and so lacking in substance that it is not able to withstand the review of a sunset clause in 36 months. That is the most extraordinary proposition from a minister at the table. He feels that a proper review and proper scrutiny of what is obviously a serious piece of legislation is somehow going to bring it to its knees, that it is going to be rendered nugatory by a review and by a sunset clause.
It might just be Senator Conroy’s flourishes, because normally Senator Sherry would take this bill through its stages, but if the government were so concerned that this bill lacks any substance and is unable to withstand the scrutiny in 36 months of a sunset clause they would have put forward a very different set of provisions in the bill. But we have what we have and we are now at the heel of the hunt and the mere prospect of review and scrutiny makes Senator Conroy wobble at the knees. This is an extraordinary turn-up for the books. There is absolutely no reason why a government confident of the rightness of its position and of the robustness of the legislation that it puts forward would not be very prepared to allow the Productivity Commission report to be brought down so that everyone can have a look at that and take it into account and also consider how the APRA principles are going and how the further global regulatory changes play out. These are all relevant matters, and they are all matters that may well require the early revisiting of this legislation so that, once again, we are aligned with what is happening in other jurisdictions and this matter is kept under review.
We think that it should be kept in the public eye and that we should not just wave it through on the basis that it is not looked at again. This will keep everyone with their shoulder to the wheel, making sure that the balance is right in this very important matter. I have certainly heard nothing from Senator Conroy that would dissuade me from thinking that Senator Xenophon’s sunset clause is not only properly put forward but also an appropriate way for this legislation to be kept under review.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY ON TERMINATION PAYMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-26,"—It is an interesting proposal for a sunset clause, because it means that the exceptions to the member approval requirements for benefits that do not exceed one year’s base salary will be relegislated or the members get an improved say. I am of a mind to support that, and I think that the House of Representatives ought to have a look at it. That is the way that the two houses work. It is a good suggestion and it has been put forward in good faith. The House should have a robust debate on the matter and I think they will be inclined by dint of common sense to accept it.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY ON TERMINATION PAYMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-26,"—On the matters raised by Senator Conroy, it is the intent of this amendment to ensure that the legislation is revisited. That is clear, there is no dispute about that and I do not think that Senator Conroy disagrees with that. We know that the Productivity Commission will be handing down its final report in the next couple of months and, presumably, the government will be taking note of it. Whether it acts on the Productivity Commission’s report remains to be seen, but there will presumably be a number of useful suggestions that could form the basis of further policy development by the government. Further, since we are going into new territory here with executive remuneration, and given the very strong statements by Senator Conroy, the Prime Minister and senior members of the government, it is appropriate that we do revisit this legislation to see how it works and whether it can be made more effective, given the intent of the legislation. If this were a standard sunset clause, which would have meant that the legislation in place disappeared and there would not be any requirements to deal with the safeguards and requirements put in place, then I could see Senator Conroy’s point, but in fact the opposite is being done here. What will occur is that if the exceptions cease to operate then virtually all retirement benefits will require approval. So there is a very powerful incentive for the parliament to revisit this, because what will be left in place is a more onerous regime of accountability than that which is in this bill. That, to me, is the bottom line—that there is protection and we will not be weakening the legislation in any way. I think the opposition’s point, and I am grateful for their support—
—You are abolishing it.
—I did not hear that, Senator Conroy. I do not know if you want me to respond to that.
—Introducing a sunset clause means that you are wiping it out.
—The way that the sunset clause is structured is that virtually all retirement benefits will require approval. That is the advice I have received. That appears clearly to be the case. I think Senator Bob Brown is right: we should send this back to the House of Representatives where there can be robust debate about this. I would like to hear from the government what they are planning to do as a consequence of the Productivity Commission’s report and what plans they have to revisit this legislation at any time in the future. This amendment gives a three-year time frame, during which the legislation can be revisited. The fears that Senator Conroy has can be allayed by this parliament revisiting this legislation and dealing with it in that way. The use of this creative sunset clause provides a guarantee that the intent of the legislation will not be watered down in any way whatsoever. I urge honourable senators to support this amendment.

Note 2:             The heading to Division 2 is altered by omitting “termination payments” and substituting “termination and other payments”.
This is so that shareholders are required to approve a binding remuneration policy, and the guidelines are to be set out in regulations. This policy must, firstly, outline the objectives, instructions and executive remuneration arrangements and be used by company boards as guidelines for the development of specific remuneration packages. Secondly, remuneration policy must include issues covering base pay, performance based remuneration and termination pay components, be available for review by shareholders and be available for review by shareholders at each annual general meeting of the corporation. It simply gives the shareholders the ability to structure remuneration policy in a way that they certainly have not been able to before. I might add that the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is developing guidelines for the governance of remuneration practices in Australia’s financial institutions, and surely that is good enough for other corporations.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-10-26,"—I rise to speak to the proposed National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009. At the outset, I confirm that the coalition will support these bills. However, I do have some quite extensive remarks.
This package of bills represent a sizeable reform to the regulation of credit across Australia, with payday lenders, finance companies and mortgage brokers set to become federally licensed entities. The introduction of a federally licensed system in turn means business will need to adjust, and with that adjustment will be frustrations felt by business as a result of the adherence to yet another layer of red tape.
With regard to the implementation of this legislation, the coalition certainly hopes that this government is able to be responsive and listen to the needs of business and industry and not take the arrogant approach which has been demonstrated of late, an example of which we all saw during the budget night changes to employee share schemes earlier this year that virtually brought an industry segment to its knees pending it being revisited.
When looking at the set of bills as a package, there are four key objectives: the creation of national credit laws with licensing arrangements; the introduction of responsible lending provisions—taking effect from 1 January 2010 and 1 January 2011, depending on the type of provider; universal compulsory membership of external dispute resolution, EDR, providers for Australian deposit-taking institutions, ADIs, and non-Australian deposit-taking institutions; and the introduction of a new national consumer credit code protection mechanism which replicates and replaces the state based UCCC.
In terms of public scrutiny, the primary bill was made public in late April this year, and it was clear from this initial process that the first draft of the bill carried very considerable problems. The coalition notes that a number of key changes have taken place since then, including changes to responsible lending requirements, which have been set back for authorised deposit-taking institutions and will not begin operation until 1 January 2011. Point of sale, POS, retailers have been exempted for 12 months, subject to review, and arrangements for credit assistants were simplified, with some duplicate requirements removed.
I will now turn attention to the objectives of the bill, the first of which is the licensing arrangements of the national credit laws. The body overseeing the provision of credit under the new national laws will be the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC, which will license providers and administer licence requirements from November 2009. As a result of this, there will be a new licensing regime, which will be known as the Australian credit licence. ACL will provide licences to brokers, financiers and credit intermediaries. The lending activities requiring licences from the Australian credit licence will be, largely, credit contracts, credit services, consumer leases, mortgages and guarantees. Holders of a licence from ACL will, in turn, be allowed to lend and collect money under a credit contract and as brokers or intermediaries, or provide assistance with a credit product. It will be compulsory for the licensee to provide credit guides which will disclose all applicable commissions, fees and charges. It is also worth noting that other bodies set to be streamlined into the Australian credit licence process will be current Australian financial service licence holders already licensed to provide credit services under existing legislation.
The coalition has sought assurance from the government that holders of Australian financial service licences will not be subjected to overregulation and that just one of these licences will suffice. We are mindful of the impact the implementation of this system will have on the national marketplace and we are focused on ensuring that the licensing arrangements are not excessive and do not place an excessive demand on business. Such concerns have been raised by the coalition during the entire process of review of the legislation before us. It is also our understanding that the government is looking to exempt companies which provide loans to directors, as they may be caught in this legislation and therefore require a licence. That, of course, will be a very welcome relief for many businesses around the country.
I now move on to the next objective of the bill before us, which relates to responsible lending. In the coalition’s view, this is where a great many potential problems lie, particularly for individuals and businesses. The provisions within the legislation are designed to aid consumers when they make decisions about credit. Within the legislation there are two tests which the loan provider must meet, and definitions within these tests are to be developed by ASIC. The first test is that loan suitability must be individually determined by the provider, and the second test is that the loan recipient’s capacity to repay the loan must also be assessed. The coalition is aware, through liaison with industry, that such procedures are followed currently when loan assessments are made. One of the primary issues of the responsible lending provisions is their workability for credit-reporting purposes. Despite not coming into effect until 2011, it remains unclear as to how, without positive or comprehensive credit reporting, these provisions will operate. This will pose a number of difficulties from both a practical and an operational point of view.
A roundtable consultation on this matter, which began in August last year, is currently being conducted by the Special Minister of State. As the outcome of this review will have a significant impact on the workability of this legislation, the coalition has expressed the view that it aspires to having this legislation expressly considered in this process. In fact, we have called on the government to speed up the process because, without reform in this area, the legislation before us will not work. It certainly will not work as intended and indeed it could be detrimental to consumers and the banking and credit system. It is important to get all of these matters lined up. The coalition has also suggested a further practical measure that the government could consider in order to ease the compliance burden on financial institutions. The start date of 1 January 2011 will prove to be cumbersome, as most financial institutions freeze their systems over the Christmas break in order to withstand the level of increased transactions. A more practical solution to this problem could be the deferral of the start date to 1 March 2011.
I now move on to the third objective of the bill before us, which relates to the universal compulsory membership of EDR, external dispute resolution, providers for Australian deposit-taking institutions and non-Australian deposit-taking institutions, non-ADIs. The legislation proposes a three-tiered dispute resolution system for consumers: through the licensee, through ASIC’s approved scheme and through the court system. Under this legislation, consumers will be able to apply for hardship variations, postponement of enforcement actions, regaining possession of mortgaged goods and actions against unconscionable fees and charges imposed by credit providers for small amounts—that is, for amounts less than $40,000.
Finally, the fourth objective of the bill before us is the introduction of the new National Consumer Credit Code protection mechanism, which essentially replaces the state based Uniform Consumer Credit Code, or UCCC. This is designed to enhance consumer protection through raising hardship thresholds from $330,000, where they are at currently, to $500,000. Amongst other settings, it also prohibits the use of essential household goods as security for loans. Overall the objectives of the bill before us here today in the Senate are, we think, sound and worthy of support, despite our misgivings about some matters that I have highlighted. The coalition support the national system of licensing credit, and we do think it is particularly worth while from a consumer protection point of view. Whilst the responsible lending provisions are well intentioned, it remains to be seen how the government will manage this process leading up to the start dates in 2010 and 2011.
The coalition recognise the size of the reforms which we have under consideration here today and the compliance burden that these impose on Australian businesses—which in turn means that the government must be responsive to the needs of industry. We certainly urge that most strongly on the part of the government. The coalition understand that the government will be moving some technical and timing measures amendments in the committee stage, which, in the form we have been advised of, the coalition would be disposed to agree to.
Finally, I want to express the coalition’s fervent hope that the government, ASIC and Treasury will make themselves available to those businesses which need assistance in implementing this legislation. We do think there will be some significant teething problems and it will be necessary for business to have recourse to the government and various officials in Treasury to clarify that the provisions are operating in the way they were intended to and that they do, as developed, give effect to what are some very technical provisions. With those comments, I commend the bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-26,"—The Greens support and welcome the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009, the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009. The global financial crisis has shown us the danger of uncontrolled and over-exuberant credit provisions. Before the crisis, increasing amounts of credit were sold by banks, non-bank lenders, credit cards, in-store retail credit providers and the so-called fringe lenders such as pay-day loan providers, as Senator Coonan was pointing out. Data from the Reserve Bank of Australia indicates that we have become a nation of debtors and there has been a massive increase in debt over the last nine years. Mortgages have increased from around $200 billion in 2000 to just over $1 trillion of debt today. Personal debt has almost doubled, from around $70 billion to just over $134 billion today, including about $35 billion in credit card debt.
A well-functioning credit market is a useful and necessary tool for our communities to thrive and develop. For example, it gives access to funds to allow people to purchase their own homes. But credit should not become an unmanageable burden, particularly when the debt is the result of aggressively marketed credit that is sold to vulnerable or misinformed consumers. There is a large and growing number of examples of where credit providers have used increasingly exploitative behaviour to push credit contracts. Of course one only has to watch commercial television at night to see how widespread and how compelling this behaviour is. It is also the case that where people fall into misfortune or experience hardship, such as unexpectedly losing their jobs or becoming ill, credit can turn from being a manageable part of their day-to-day personal finances into an insurmountable and life-ruining burden.
While the decision to enter into debt is a personal one, the government has a role in ensuring that consumers are well informed about credit products and are not exploited by unscrupulous credit providers or brokers—and that, if hardship occurs, processes are in place to manage the situation in a constructive way for both the consumer and the credit provider. Of course I am not entering here into a much-needed debate about the push for consumerism itself.
The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 is long-overdue reform to develop a national standard for the conduct of the credit industry. It is a strong foundation for a good regime. We recognise that this is part of an ongoing process of credit reform and that the government plans a second round in 2010. The Greens believe the government should strengthen the bill to provide greater protection for consumers now, particularly those experiencing or at risk of experiencing financial hardship. In that regard this bill could be strengthened in three ways. The first way is by ensuring that credit sold in conjunction with retail items in department and other retail stores is covered by the terms of the code. The government has provided a 12-month exclusion for credit that is sold in conjunction with retail sales of cars, domestic household items and store credit cards. The retail industry argued that sales assistance work is clerical in nature and it is unreasonable to expect sales staff to have the same training requirements and legal responsibilities as professional credit intermediaries such as brokers—if you do not mind! So no training requirement or cost will be entered into there by some of the big chains.
However, during the Senate inquiry into these bills, it was pointed out that the so-called point of credit provision is now offered in roughly 20,000 retail outlets. Up to 50 per cent of sales in the household white goods and department store sector is reliant on this concurrent sale of credit. In fact industry sources recognise that many retailers are reliant for their survival on the sale of this credit. Might I add there that I find it quite appalling the way in which big chains push on people who do not have an ability to consider the long term as much as the short term the provision of apparently no-credit purchasing for one, two or three years. Of course the big whammy comes down the line when they not only have to pay the money back but have to pay interest at exorbitant rates. My view is that that practice should not be allowed, and this legislation comes nowhere near to preventing that sort of pushing of debt onto householders in Australia—in particular, householders who cannot discriminate between their ability to pay in the short term and their continuing inability, and sometimes even greater inability, to pay two or three years down the line.
A second way in which the bill should be strengthened is through better hardship provisions. Orderly and transparent processes to deal with situations of financial hardship are a critical component of helping people to help or in some cases save themselves. Hardship provisions help people avoid declaring bankruptcy and the negative consequences of that for both the debtor and the creditor. The increase in thresholds for consumers to access hardship provisions, from a limit of $315,000 to half a million dollars, is a positive reform for consumers, but we are concerned that the new threshold will not apply to existing credit contracts. That leaves a substantial portion of people currently in financial mortgage distress without recourse to hardship remedies.
For example, a recent study by debt collection and credit reporting agency Dun and Bradstreet found that 33 per cent of postcodes had fallen into the high-risk category of financial distress, and that was up 30 per cent on October last year. On 30 August the Sunday Telegraph reported that various banks had extended hardship assistance to over 55,000 borrowers, with 31,000 applications having been received since February this year. The Consumer Credit Legal Centre and Legal Aid in New South Wales have reported that they have commenced a duty roster at the Supreme Court of New South Wales in response to a request from the court because of the record number of home repossession applications being made to that court.
We acknowledge that the government will seek to make amendments to this bill, but we believe these are not adequate because they effectively retain the two-tiered system that was the problem with the original bill—a hardship system for mortgages entered into before the passage of this bill and a system for those mortgages which will be agreed later.
Thirdly, we recommend that there be improved access to financial legal advice. We welcome the development of a comprehensive remedies and sanctions regime under this bill. Improvements to consumer credit protection will mean little if consumers are not empowered to enforce those rights and credit licensees are not held accountable for their actions. In particular, we welcome the concerted effort within the code to ensure that consumers have access to low-cost forms of remedies such as external dispute resolution mechanisms which can help avoid recourse to the costly and time-consuming court system. But the code remains silent on the issue of support for tailored, individual legal advice for consumers who are seeking redress for breaches. That is particularly the case for consumers experiencing financial hardship and who are often vulnerable for other reasons such as unexpected illness.
The government has moved to provide additional funding for financial counsellors over the past year, and we welcome that. However, additional assistance has not been forthcoming to support legal assistance with financial issues. Evidence from the community legal sector, such as from the National Association of Community Legal Centres, has indicated that there is a large unmet need for the provision of legal assistance, particularly in relation to credit advice.
To sum up, the Greens welcome these long-overdue reforms from the Rudd government and we look forward to the implementation of the National Credit Code, which will lead to credit consumers being better informed about their choices and to an end to at least some of the exploitative practices we have seen in the past. We believe that the bill could be further strengthened in the best interests of the consumer and credit industry. We look forward to the further promised legislation from the government in coming months and we will have added input and, if necessary, amendments at that time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-10-26,"—The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and the related bills will provide a single, standard and uniform regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight. They will replace the current state based consumer credit arrangements, and I believe that will reduce duplication, red tape and compliance costs while increasing consumer protection against irresponsible lending practices and also improve access to timely and affordable dispute resolution processes. The current state laws are roughly aligned but are inconsistent enough to cause compliance problems, particularly for companies that have national operations. Therefore, I think that this will streamline the processes for most companies after the initial introduction period and will reduce the amount of paperwork and red tape that most companies currently encounter.
I am the Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which inquired into these bills, and we had a very high standard of submission to this inquiry from businesses and from consumer groups. There was quite some discussion, which Senator Bob Brown has referred to, about the point-of-sale retailers and their involvement in this process. But stores where retail employees are involved with the provision of credit are a small proportion of those retailers that provide credit in store. In fact, what happens in most cases, we were told, is that the sales assistant refers the customer to a credit provider who works in store and the employees of that credit provider will be subject to the provisions of these bills. So in my view there was no harm in having a 12-month delay to assess in what way retail employees were involved in the process so as to give the best protection for consumers while not burdening retailers and retail employees with unnecessary regulation and training. So I commend the government for allowing 12 months for further consultation on this.
The responsible lending requirements were also considerably canvassed. It is very important that people are not pushed to take up credit that they have no hope of repaying. There are a number of unscrupulous credit providers who, for their own reasons, will push credit on people who do not have the means to repay it; they might be in debt on their credit card or in debt to a number of other people. It is critically important to consumers that they get good information and that they are properly assessed for the loan which the provider is recommending to them. I do not think there was any disagreement about that or about the need for proper consumer protection. There are a number of ways in which that is done in this bill.
I will not go through the bill—others have already done that—but I will talk a bit about the major recommendations of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. The committee acknowledged concerns about the timing of the implementation of the reforms, which were originally targeted for January 2010. We were concerned that this left many small lenders, and possibly some state governments, inadequate time to transition to the new arrangement. The committee therefore recommended a deferral to 1 July 2010 to allow sufficient time for industry to prepare and to ensure that state parliaments could facilitate the necessary referrals. However, the committee strongly noted that the responsible lending provisions outlined in the bills should still operate from their planned start date of 1 January 2011 and not be delayed. This will enable improved consumer protection as quickly as possible.
There was also a recommendation about the exemption of current holders of Australian financial services licences from meeting many of the standards required under the Australian credit licence, which is set up under this bill. That was simply because those AFSLs cover much of the same ground.
There was also a recommendation to amend clause 128 of the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill so that, where the contract involves a mortgage over a residential property, the credit provider should only be required to reassess the suitability of the credit contract if an assessment has not been undertaken within 90 days of the contract being written and if the credit provider has reason to believe that the situation of the consumer has changed such that the credit contract may no longer be suitable. This was to address the situation in which someone applies for a mortgage and then, for whatever reason, it takes longer than the 90 days. We did not want the consumer to have to pay for another assessment.
Linked to this was a broker assessment. Clause 130(3) of the main bill stated that, if a preliminary assessment had been made by a credit assistant, such as a mortgage broker, in the preceding 90 days and the credit contract was found not to be suitable, the credit provider was not required to verify the consumer’s financial situation. We had very strong evidence from consumer groups that having that broker intermediary might provide an excuse for the credit provider not to do a proper assessment and tie up any remedy in the courts, so we recommended that that clause be removed.
There were other recommendations about remedy for loss and that there be no loss of access to the small claims court. Also, the committee noted concerns that, despite improving access to hardship applications for consumers, lenders were not required to state a reason for the rejection of applications under the current legislation. The committee recommended that the lender be required to notify, in writing, the reasons for the rejection of the hardship application, on the grounds that this would assist the borrower to know where they might go next time or what steps they might take, particularly if they wished to seek redress through the court system.
The government accepted those recommendations and we commend the government for addressing those concerns. The package is now, I think, a historic reform that will simplify and clarify consumer credit regulation into a uniform national regime, while also strengthening protections for consumers to prevent irresponsible lending practices and implementing tough sanctions on predatory lenders.
This is a complex and detailed reform, and I commend the government on undertaking a lengthy and thorough consultation process and for its phased approach to implementation. I thank the other committee members, the committee secretariat and all the submitters for their assistance in this process.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2009-10-26,"—My comments to the Senate about the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and associated bills are informed by the recent inquiry which the Senate Economics Legislation Committee held into the consumer credit reforms package. Basically, coalition senators believe that the reforms have merit. The heart of the package is a national scheme for the regulation of credit. That is obviously something which will be of assistance to people around the country and it is based on a decision of COAG to set up such a national system. However, I would have to say that the government’s handling of the implementation of the package has left a lot to be desired. There were several delays before it was actually introduced and that made it very difficult for credit providers to meet the deadlines which were imposed.
The main provisions are a national scheme for licensing of credit providers, and obligations for responsible lending practices in relation to the suitability of credit for a particular applicant and the capacity of a potential customer to repay the credit sought. These are worthwhile objectives, and so too is the requirement under the legislation that holders of the new Australian credit licence must provide a dispute resolution mechanism so that aggrieved customers have somewhere to take any complaints they may have.
The government’s vacillation over start dates is something we commented on in the report made by the committee. The exposure draft of the consumer credit package was released in April 2009, and during the consultation period the government announced a delay to the commencement of different requirements, followed by then bringing the commencement date forward—when the government understood that the states and territories were exiting the space and that there would be no coverage. Following the release of the economics committee’s report, another deferral was announced by Minister Bowen, ostensibly to give more time to credit providers but in reality to cover the poor planning and the difficult position in which they had left the regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in its need to gear up for these changes.
The economics committee heard from an organisation representing the interests of small to micro credit providers and their concern that this legislation, which includes the requirement to pay a licensing fee and have a dispute resolution procedure in place, could drive some of their members out of the credit business altogether. I personally am concerned that the Rudd government’s mismanaging of the implementation of the consumer credit reforms may cause problems for smaller credit providers who had already recognised that they would have difficulty meeting the financial or compliance burdens of the new credit legislation.
In moving to a national licensing scheme, the government is moving into an arena previously occupied by the states. If the states’ existing schemes were simply to continue, there would be an additional compliance burden without any gains from harmonisation. So it has been important that the government work through this aspect of the credit reform package and deliver best practice licensing for credit providers. There is a capacity in the regulations for the streamlining of approvals of existing licensing regimes, such as the industry recognised rigour of the Western Australian scheme, and to streamline approvals for approved deposit-taking institutions, and presumably to address the duplication with the Australian financial services licence. But these groups have been left in the dark too long about how they will be treated under the consumer credit reforms.
Many stakeholders would view the government’s consultation on the credit reforms as having been severely deficient and involving many problems. ASIC is the regulator for these reforms, charged with providing assistance to credit providers in gaining an understanding of, and complying with, the new credit provider obligations to hold a licence and to comply with the responsible lending obligations as they relate to disclosure requirements, the suitability of credit for a particular applicant and other provisions. But there is no guidance material set up yet on the ASIC website to assist credit providers, just a note that for the most part the guidance material will be published after the bill has been passed and the regulations made. There is no excuse for this information vacuum. Surely there is a capacity now for the regulatory guide on the general conduct obligations of credit licensees or the revised regulatory guide on dispute resolution to be provided.
The Senate Economics Legislation Committee heard evidence from the banks and ADIs that they faced significant information technology hurdles, through their processes and documentation, in rolling out this legislation. Non-ADIs to the level of small providers need time to prepare their record keeping and other processes to comply with these reforms in an orderly manner.
That is really all I would like to say, except of course that in the case of companies like David Jones there was certainly some concern as to whether or not staff would be caught by the legislation as point-of-sale assistants in the credit provision process. Coalition senators drew attention to this aspect of the legislation in our comments on the inquiry into the package, and I hope that that particular concern is going to be addressed in the near future.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-10-26,"—Tonight I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and related bills. This bill is the first phase in the Rudd government’s reforms to create a new uniform national regulatory framework for credit and credit related services. In these troubled economic times, it is vital that Australia has a well-regulated credit market. These reforms will enhance the stability of our financial sector by bolstering confidence in the integrity of the Australian credit market. They will also ensure that Australians are protected from unscrupulous lending practices and will enable more Australians to get help when they struggle to meet credit repayments. The bill will enact a new and enhanced national credit code. It will impose responsible lending obligations on Australian consumer credit providers. It will introduce a rigorous tiered sanctions regime to discourage misconduct by credit providers. It will provide a new tiered dispute resolution system for consumer credit issues, and it will establish a national licensing regime for credit providers.
Future reforms in this area include credit limit extensions, reverse mortgages and small business and investment loans that are going to form phase 2 of this package. Consumer protection, importantly, will be enhanced in the new code. For example, it will substantially increase the threshold under which consumers can access hardship provisions. Access to hardship provisions is of particular importance to working families in these difficult economic times. They allow consumers to request changes to their credit contracts or a postponement of enforcement proceedings based on financial hardship if their loan is under a specified threshold. Under the new code this threshold will be substantially increased to $500,000. The government recognises that the current threshold is simply too low. Given the average metropolitan mortgage and credit debts, the existing threshold effectively excludes many homeowners in capital cities where property prices are high. The high threshold is critical to ensure that ordinary Australian families do not miss out on financial relief when they need it most. Better access to hardship provisions can help families to keep their homes in these times of economic uncertainty.
The new threshold has been welcomed by consumer advocacy groups because it will cover a larger proportion of people on average incomes. The changes will ease the pain of households hit by the current economic downturn. It will enable households to legally request changes to the terms of credit contracts, including those governing credit cards, car loans, in-store credit cards and mortgages. The relief requested may take the form of an extension in the loan period that reduces regular repayments, a repayment holiday or a postponement of enforcement proceedings. Importantly, if a credit provider refuses a request for relief the consumer can seek further assistance from the Financial Ombudsman Service. These dispute resolution procedures are available at no cost to the consumer. These new laws will provide an avenue of relief for those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, as well as those who face financial difficulties due to sickness or other unforeseen circumstances.
The bill will also establish for the first time a comprehensive national licensing regime for people engaging in credit activities. To date, licensing arrangements have varied markedly between states and territories. Some jurisdictions have not required all providers to be registered and in many instances registration has been little more than a formality. In contrast, my home state of Western Australia already has a rigorous licensing regime in place, involving the proper assessment of applicants and regular audits to ensure compliance. The effectiveness of the Western Australian licensing regime was acknowledged by the National Financial Services Federation at the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics on this bill. I am pleased that the Rudd government has recognised that credit brokers who hold an A or B class licence in WA already satisfy the requirements for entry into the new national system and has provided a streamlined application process for these WA brokers.
Australia has weathered the recent global financial crisis remarkably well. Effective regulation of our financial sector has contributed to this favourable outcome, but we cannot afford to be complacent. Consumer advocates have long argued that the existing systems of credit regulation are insufficient, and they should be commended for their cogent and consistent advocacy of reform in this area. The recent crisis reminds us of the need to heed their warnings. We need to be ever vigilant in this regard. We must continue to set the world’s best practice standards in the regulation of credit markets and this is exactly what this bill is designed to do. We must also continue to protect consumers from unscrupulous lending practices. And we must ensure that ordinary Australians have legally sanctioned avenues that enable them to seek relief when they struggle to meet repayments, especially in difficult economic times. Whether it is bank fees, credit practices, unfair contracts, product labelling, unit pricing or any of the other consumer protection measures that this government has pursued, we know how critical it is for ordinary Australians that we set best practice standards in these areas of law.
People often take their rights for granted and assume that things will always work out as they should. They do not expect to be treated badly. It is only when something goes wrong that we realise how important these areas of law are. The unscrupulous few can make life difficult for the majority of both consumers and businesses who do the right thing as a matter of course. Keeping standards high benefits all those who want a fair go for both consumers and businesses. It makes sure our consumer markets are both stable and competitive and it ensures that those who are treated unfairly have ready access to avenues of redress. As this bill and other bills that have come into this place demonstrate, the Rudd government is 100 per cent committed to defending the interests of consumers and reputable businesses. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I thank all those who have made contributions to this debate. The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and related bills give effect to the historic agreement made by the Council of Australian Governments in October 2008 for the Australian government to take over responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit. The related bills are the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009, which sets out the transitional and consequential arrangements to support the transfer of the regulation of credit from the states and territories to the Commonwealth, and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Fees) Bill 2009, which enables the imposition of fees, as taxes, for activities covered by the credit bill and the transitional bill.
These bills together will provide a better framework for consumer credit in Australia. The bills are part of COAG’s vision for a seamless economy. This package will provide the foundation for the first single, standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight in this country. The bills introduce a national licensing regime for people engaging in credit activities, and the first comprehensive responsible lending conduct requirements—replacing the state based uniform consumer credit code, which operates inconsistently across the eight jurisdictions—will reduce red tape, duplication and compliance costs for businesses. I note that the bills rely, in part, on the anticipated referral of legislation from the states. As I said, I thank all of those who have participated in this debate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-10-26,"—I rise to speak on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009. The coalition will be supporting this bill. It provides a mechanism for the regulation of margin lending that has obviously been much discussed since the global financial downturn and regulation in and around the trustee companies, and the regulation of promissory notes. The bill also provides consistent federal regulation and oversight of these financial services and products by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC. Overall, the coalition welcome these targeted reforms, reforms which provide a positive outcome for industry, government and consumers alike.
When looking at each of the financial areas this bill addresses, it is best to look at each reform independently from the other. The first of the areas subject to reform is that of margin lending. There have been many regulatory problems surrounding this form of financial service and activity, more recently highlighted by the collapse of the Townsville based Storm Financial in 2008, and more broadly felt by financial service organisations during the downturn of the market in late 2007 and early 2008. A lack of supervision and confusion over adviser and lender responsibilities are just a few of the areas often reported in the media and suffered by consumers who have purchased financial products unsuited to their particular financial situation. The uniform national regulation of margin lending was agreed upon by the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, in March 2008 with the objective of providing clear and consistent regulation across the country.
When examining the margin lending aspects of this bill, there are three primary objectives. The first objective is that the licensing of lenders and advisers who engage in margin lending activities will be mandatory through instituting this activity through chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001. Licensing will be compulsory 12 months after the assent of this bill.
The second objective of the bill addresses the responsibility and ambiguities between advisers and providers. This goes a long way towards addressing the grey area that currently exists with margin lending, particularly the negative effects faced by investors where equities are being liquidated in order to meet margin loan debt and where investors have not been informed by financial advisers or loan providers where margin calls are acquired. This is a situation often faced at the end of a bull market and was experienced by the unfortunate investors in the collapsed Storm Financial. The improvement and clarity of this system is a positive step, particularly for the many investors who may be unaware of what is happening to their financial products.
The third and final objective of the bill is to provide additional investor protection mechanisms for margin lending, in terms of responsible lending, through subsequent regulations, which are currently available for public exposure and comment. The coalition would prefer that such substantive elements be vested within the bill itself in order to provide certainty to the market, particularly given that such provisions dictate the way in which business structures itself when engaging in margin-lending activities. The government is beginning to make a habit of vesting the substantive measures of bills in subsequent regulations. I have seen this constantly as Chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I do understand that it is easier; that doing this facilitates the passage of legislation because you can incorporate in the regulations schemes that may be quite difficult to work out. However, such an approach lacks market certainty and there can be a significant time delays between a bill receiving assent and regulations being promulgated.
It also means that the government to some extent can be very lazy about developing a scheme that can be incorporated in the bill and instead leave it to the regulations. A recent example of this is the government’s failure to release regulations for short selling. I can remember that the government—I think it was through Senator Sherry—said back in December 2008 that the bill providing for regulations around this activity was critically urgent. Yet 9½ months later the regulations are still, so far as I know, nowhere to be seen. They have not seen the light of day. It simply illustrates the point I have been making. It is easier to change regulations on the run than it is to amend legislation. It takes less effort to provide for future regulations, as opposed to sitting down and doing the hard yards of penning legislation that has to be scrutinised on the floor of the Senate. Nevertheless, we think these reforms are very important and that they outweigh our misgivings at the uncertainty of not having the provisions in the regulations incorporated in the act.
The next area of reform which the bill before us deals with is in relation to trustee companies. According to Treasury estimates, this is an industry with approximately $510 billion worth of assets under management and quite a significant part of the financial services sector in Australia. The bill before us looks to provide national uniformity in this area by allowing trustee companies to operate across multiple state and territory jurisdictions without having to comply with different laws and be subject to differing compliance costs. This is a very sensible change and we welcome it. As with the changes to margin-lending practices, the uniformity changes to trustee companies will become part of chapter 7, with their financial products to be regulated in the Corporations Act 2001. This will mean that an Australian financial services licence, which we discussed during debate on a previous bill, will need to be held by people who are providing services in this area.
The final area this bill deals with is that of promissory notes. The changes contained within this bill will ensure that promissory notes are regulated in the same way debentures are and will in turn be subject to additional disclosure and regulatory requirements, as are debentures. The additional disclosure and regulatory requirements for promissory notes will mean that promissory notes issued by retail clients will need to be accompanied by a prospectus and the appointment of a trustee, along with the issuance of a trust deed—all changes that will help to ensure transparency and that are welcomed by the coalition.
By and large, the package of reforms under consideration in this bill are sound, targeted reforms which will ultimately benefit Australian investors. To date, Australia has weathered the global downturn pretty well. A great deal of that is due to our strong and robust financial system, as we have been constantly reminded by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and, indeed, the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr Henry. Our financial system underwent many positive regulatory changes by the Howard government and has stood up well to the stress tests of the global downturn. The initiative taken by the Howard government to create the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, APRA, and the Australian Securities Investment Commission, ASIC—two separate bodies designed to provide a strong regulatory framework for financial services in Australia—is one of the main reasons Australia has been able to perform so well during this period of global economic downturn. The coalition welcomes the reforms contained in the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009 and commends the bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNISATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-10-26,"—On 26 March 2008, COAG agreed to nationalise consumer credit regulation and reached in-principle agreement that the Commonwealth would assume regulatory responsibility for margin lending and trustee corporations. On 3 June 2008, the government released a green paper which canvassed seven critical areas of Australia’s financial services, including trustee corporations, margin loans and promissory notes. A margin loan consultation group was established, consisting of industry associations, major lenders and other stakeholders such as lawyers and external dispute resolution schemes. Regular meetings were held by this group during the policy formulation stage and the group reviewed the draft legislation prior to its release for public comment.
On 7 May 2009, after further consultation with the consultation group, an exposure draft of the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009, as well as draft regulations relating to margin lending, was released for public comment. On 25 June 2009, the Senate referred the bills that make up the consumer protection reform package to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry. The committee reported on 7 September 2009.
The government has undertaken an extensive consultation period with stakeholders in the development of the bill. There are three key areas that the financial services modernisation bill seeks to amend: margin lending, the regulation of trustee corporations and the alignment of the regulation of promissory notes with debentures. Margin lending is the borrowing of money to invest in the stock market or other investments. It lets you borrow money to invest in shares and other financial products using existing investments as security. Borrowing money to invest in this way can increase the gains from an investment; it can also multiply the losses.
Margin lending in Australia is offered by a wide range of financial institutions and is often available online. It is also largely unregulated in Australia. Margin lenders will usually approve a loan for a consumer whereby the value of the loan amount cannot exceed a certain percentage of the loan’s security. This is called the loan-to-value ratio. When the value of the overall portfolio falls so that the loan-to-value ratio rises to greater than the level originally approved by the margin loan provider, the lender issues a margin call. This requires the investor to return the ratio to below the approved level by giving the lender additional security, reducing the size of the portfolio or paying extra cash.
Although the level of margin lending has dropped as a result of the global recession, the general use of margin lending has increased quite considerably over the last decade. Money that investors usually borrow in a margin loan is generally backed by the securities or financial products owned by the investors, such as listed shares. However, recently—in the past couple of years—some lenders have encouraged investors to use their homes or investment properties as collateral. Sadly, this has resulted in several high-profile collapses, such as the Storm Financial collapse. There was also the now infamous case, reported last month, of a loan given to a Townsville pensioner who signed a blank application on instruction of her Storm adviser for a $208,000 loan. In the application it was stated that this person had an income of $104,000 a month—50 times her actual income on the age pension—and made no mention of her existing margin loan of $625,000 with another bank.
This bill amends the Corporations Act to include margin lenders and provide for the first time legislation to protect consumers from harmful lending practices. The bill will provide protection for consumers in that lenders and advisers will have to be licensed and regulated by ASIC; consumers will have access to independent, free and fast dispute resolution services; and advisers will be required to only provide advice that is appropriate to the client’s needs and circumstances. Furthermore, the responsible lending obligations that are an important part of the national consumer credit protection bill, which we have just discussed, will also be introduced into the Corporations Act and applied to providers of margin lending products. This will require lenders to not provide a loan if it is unsuitable, if the borrower cannot service the debt or if the borrower could suffer substantial hardship.
Another important aspect of the bill is a provision which regulates the notification of margin calls to clients, in particular where a loan has been arranged through a financial planner. Situations have arisen where it has been unclear whether the lender or the planner was responsible for notifying clients when a margin call occurred; a delay in notification can lead to losses for the consumer. The amendments require that it is the lenders that must notify the clients when a margin call is made unless the client explicitly agrees to being notified by their planner.
The second aspect of the bill is the regulation of trustee corporations. Trustee corporations provide services such as the administration of personal trusts and deceased estates, including acting as a trustee of a trust, applying for probate of a will or acting as an executor of a deceased estate. Currently, trustee corporations that operate across different states face considerable compliance burdens, with different reporting and authorisation requirements across jurisdictions. The bill introduces a requirement that both public and private trustee companies hold Australian financial services licences. It also streamlines the dispute resolution process currently available to beneficiaries. Currently, aside from internal voluntary dispute resolution services offered by trustee companies, the only avenue of recourse for beneficiaries is the Supreme Court. Under the Commonwealth system, trustee companies will be administered by a single regulator, ASIC, and this will greatly simplify the process.
The final area this bill covers is its amendment of the Corporations Act to create a consistent approach to the regulation of promissory notes, so addressing issues that arose out of the collapse of the Westpoint Group. The amendments in this bill will improve regulatory certainty and clarify the law by amending the definition of debentures so that promissory notes valued at above $50,000 fall into the definition and are subject to the same regulatory regime. The amendments also provide for the establishment of a public register of debenture trustees. Only certain entities are permitted to undertake this role, and they must meet requirements set out in the Corporations Act as well as in ASIC’s guidelines on debentures.
This bill provides efficiency gains through harmonisation, improved regulation and transparency of financial services, and additional protection for consumers. It targets areas where ordinary investors have faced devastating losses as a result of poor legislative protection in some areas of financial services. No legislation can provide absolute guarantees for investors. However, it is incumbent on any government to seek to ensure consumers are engaging with financial services that are well regulated and provide full disclosures as to risks and benefits. This legislation goes a long way towards protecting consumers in the future from losses incurred by the collapse of organisations such as Storm Financial and the Westpoint Group. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNISATION) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I thank all of those who have made a contribution to the debate on the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009. As has been described by both the previous speakers, this bill will give effect to a COAG agreement to provide for the national regulation of margin lending and trustee corporations. The bill will also make long-awaited improvements to the regulatory regime governing the issue of debentures.
The bill will introduce three major changes. The first is the introduction of national regulation for margin loans. Until now margin lending has not been subject to any specific regulatory regime at all. This is a serious problem, particularly because non-standard margin loans contain some features that borrowers often find difficult to understand. As we all saw from the fallout from several recent high-profile financial collapses, when investors put their money into sophisticated financial products, they often do not fully understand that they stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars and sometimes their family home. The financial services modernisation bill will change that. Lenders and advisers will need to be licensed and regulated by ASIC, consumers will have access to independent, free and fast dispute resolution services, and, importantly, under the new responsible lending requirements, advisers will be required to only provide advice that is appropriate to the client’s needs and circumstances.
The second area covered by the bill is the traditional activities of trustee corporations. These include personal trusts and deceased estate administration services. Trustee corporations which carry out these tasks are currently regulated by states and territories but the regulatory coverage is often inconsistent. Under the Commonwealth system there will be a single licensing regime administered by one, single well-resourced regulator, ASIC. Under the financial services modernisation bill, the traditional services of trustee corporations will be deemed to be financial services and will be covered by the consumer protection and disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASIC Act 2001.
The third area covered by the bill is debentures and promissory notes. The bill will amend the regulatory framework in the Corporations Act to align the regulation of promissory notes and debentures and also provide additional protection for investors by removing uncertainty in the law. This is a much-needed change following the collapse of Westpoint, which tried to use the issue of promissory notes with face values of at least $50,000 to avoid the operation of the law.
By introducing national regulation for margin loans and improving the regulatory framework governing trustee corporations, debentures and promissory notes this bill will make important changes—changes which will bring far greater consistency, clarity and fairness to our consumer credit regulatory regime.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-10-26,"—On behalf of the coalition, I rise to speak on the Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008. This bill contains a range of measures intended to improve the efficiency of the Federal Court system. The measures include: introduction of a power to refer all or part of a proceeding in the Federal Court to a referee for report; amendment of the Federal Court of Australia Act to permit a single judge to make interlocutory orders in proceedings that would otherwise be heard by a full court; amendment of the International Arbitration Act 1974 to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court, concurrent with state and territory supreme courts, in matters arising under that act; permission for federal courts and tribunals to negotiate and execute leases on their own behalf; authorisation of court officers to take certain security measures in respect of court premises; and amendment of the Family Law Act to strengthen the enforceability of binding financial agreements—for example, prenuptial agreements.
The opposition considers that these proposals have substantial merit. The power to refer issues to a referee for report is one that already exists in most state jurisdictions. It is particularly important in cases which require detailed examination of financial records or which involve complex technical issues. It has significant potential to reduce the cost and length of litigation. The power to negotiate and execute leases is a necessary component of the self-administration of courts and tribunals. That responsibility previously rested with the now defunct Department of the Arts and Administrative Services. The Attorney-General’s approval is required for purchases over $1 million.
The coalition welcomes the proposal to extend the court’s jurisdiction in respect of international arbitration matters. Australia is a centre of excellence in respect of the provision of dispute resolution services and should continue to strengthen its position as the venue of choice for commercial disputes in our region. The Federal Court, with its superb reputation in commercial matters, should be able to play its full part in that process. The amendment in respect of binding financial agreements is a necessary corrective to the decision in Black v Black, which held that strict compliance with all of the technical requirements in the Family Law Act was a precondition to enforceability of the agreement. That decision was widely criticised. The amendment will provide that, provided a party has entered an agreement on the basis of an informed decision, the agreement will not be voided by a mere technicality.
This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which reported on 17 February. The only substantive submission was from the Family Law Section of the Law Council of Australia and was in relation to the amendments on binding financial agreements. The Law Council indicated that the current drafting of the amendment had the potential for further disputes of a technical nature, of the very type the proposed amendments were intended to overcome. There was also a concern that agreements made between 27 December 2000 and 19 January 2004 might have been inadvertently rendered invalid by the proposed amendments or give rise to other technical disputes. The government’s amendments, circulated on sheet PF539, give effect to the Law Council’s technical concerns and, provided those amendments are made, the bill has the opposition’s support.
I note that there are a considerable number of pages—indeed, seven pages—of amendments that have been required. I think this highlights yet again the benefit of the Senate committee system, which has allowed the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of this place to consider the bill in detail and to consider a good submission from the Law Council, which brought about this government response which the coalition supports. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AMENDMENT (EFFICIENCY MEASURES) BILL (NO. 1) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2009-10-26,"—I would like to thank senators for their contributions to this debate. The Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 contains a range of measures which demonstrate the government’s commitment to making the federal courts more flexible, minimising the costs of litigation and improving access to the civil justice system for all Australians.
The measures in this bill are consistent with the government’s longstanding commitment to measures to improve access to justice. The government is taking action to address the cost of improving access to justice with a range of further reforms in this area. This includes working with the federal courts to develop enhanced case management powers and asking the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council to report on strategies to ensure greater use of appropriate dispute resolution options both as an alternative to civil proceedings and during proceedings.
Importantly, the bill gives the Federal Court greater flexibility to obtain expert assistance, particularly in complex and technical matters, by empowering it to refer all or part of proceedings to an appropriately qualified person for report. This procedural flexibility, combined with the referee’s specialist expertise, will allow the referee to quickly get to the core of the technical issues and reduce costs and delays for litigants. This will enable the court to more effectively and efficiently manage large litigation. Of course, the court is not bound to accept the findings of the referee, and the legal effects of the report are a matter for the court’s discretion.
The bill responds to the decision of the full court of the Family Court of Australia in Black v Black. The bill amends the Family Law Act to limit the technical requirements that people need to meet to enter into one of these agreements while still providing necessary protections to parties—such as a requirement to get legal advice. It will restore confidence in the binding nature and enforceability of financial and termination agreements under the Family Law Act.
The bill gives the Federal Court concurrent jurisdiction with state and territory supreme courts for all matters arising out of the International Arbitration Act. This increases the choice of forum for litigants and puts the Federal Court in a better position to operate as a regional hub for commercial litigation. To allow the Federal Court to more efficiently manage cases and to avoid unnecessary delays for litigants, the bill enables a single judge of the court to make a necessary interlocutory order in proceedings that otherwise would be required to be heard by the full court.
The bill promotes the efficient administration and management of federal courts and tribunals by removing unnecessary and out-of-date restrictions on the heads of the Federal Court, the Family Court, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Native Title Tribunal from acquiring interest in land for the purposes of the Lands Acquisition Act. It also makes it clear to Federal Court officers and the public the areas in which authorised officers can exercise powers under the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act in the interests of the court’s security where the Federal Court is sitting on open land or in a building other than its usual premises. This will have particular application when the Federal Court sits on-country to hear native title matters.
I should make some remarks on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. On 4 December last year, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee reported on 23 February, recommending that the Senate pass the bill. The government thanks the committee for its work on the bill. As, I think, the minister foreshadowed during the consideration stage of the bill, the government will seek to move amendments to the bill. These will address issues that have arisen in the Senate committee’s report into provisions of the bill and ongoing consultations with stakeholders. Specifically, the government amendments will build upon the amendments to the Family Law Act in response to the Black v Black decision to ensure the parties who have entered or will enter into financial or termination agreements are protected from the risk that their ex-partner could use a technicality to avoid being bound by an otherwise just and equitable agreement. The government amendments will also make some minor technical corrections to the bill.
In conclusion, the amendments in this bill reflect the government’s strong commitment to ensuring that the federal civil justice system is operating as efficiently and effectively as possible and is responsive to the needs of litigants. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2009-10-26,"—Today is Pink Ribbon Day and in this month, October, we highlight the incidence of breast cancer and the initiatives in Australia to combat this problem and to support the people and families affected by it. Each year between 12,600 and 13,000 women are diagnosed as having breast cancer and, according to the Breast Cancer Network Australia, this number is rising. It is thought that one woman in nine will develop breast cancer, with the figure for the ACT being one in six women.
Both research and support initiatives are vital to combating this most common cause of cancer related death of Australian women. So this government, working with the established cancer organisations, provides funding for continuing and new programs. In August the government announced that more than $2.7 million of new federal funding would enable the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, together with Breast Cancer Network Australia, to deliver practical help to rural breast cancer sufferers, their families and carers. Online programs will enable rural health professionals, including Indigenous health workers, to access information on the latest treatments and programs and will enable communication between patients and their families. This will complement the other government funded programs, which include:      $120 million for BreastScreen Australia for the latest digital mammography equipment; $168 million for continued funding of the Herceptin program; $31 million over five years for reimbursements for breast prostheses; $28 million for other breast cancer measures, including $12 million for the McGrath Foundation for breast care nurses in 44 communities; and, finally, Labor’s $560 million for a network of 10 best-practice regional cancer centres.
The government supports not only research into the causes, prevention and detection of cancer but also beneficial treatment programs. The National Breast Cancer Foundation, NBCF, relies on both government and community funding for its research programs and recently announced that, since 1994, it had expended a total of $55 million across 230 research programs. One groundbreaking development which has recently gained publicity has been from one research program funded by the NBCF. A team from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research has made a breakthrough in furthering understanding of the specific gene mutation which makes some women more at risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers have found a population of breast cells which could be responsible for the breast cancers which develop in women carrying BRCA1 gene mutations. These gene mutations are found in 10 to 20 per cent of women with hereditary breast cancer, and they often develop a particularly aggressive form of the disease.
Research published in the international journal Nature Medicine represents a major shift in the way breast cancer is understood to develop and points to a new avenue for targeted treatments, or tailored therapies, for the next generation. Through such research projects, and through this government’s commitment, Australia makes a major contribution to the international effort towards understanding and combating cancer. Professor David Hill AO, Director of the Cancer Council of Victoria, is currently serving as president of the International Union Against Cancer. This is a non-government, independent association with member organisations in over 90 countries. Its objectives are to advance scientific and medical knowledge in research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer and to promote this campaign worldwide. Professor Hill has said that governments around the world that focus on cancer prevention campaigns will potentially save the lives of millions of people. In addition, as more cancers are prevented, pressures on healthcare systems should decrease.
I have already mentioned one project but, at present, a good deal of research on the causes of breast cancer, which is taking place in Australia and in other countries, focuses on the study of genes and genetic mutations. If we can identify the causes of cancer, we can go a long way towards developing individually tailored, effective treatments. Breast Cancer organisations and representative bodies in Australia are taking a keen interest in the current inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee into the impact of gene patents on the provision of health care in Australia. The Senate inquiry was prompted by concerns, particularly from breast and ovarian cancer groups, over the exclusive licence held by a private company for the testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. In 2008 the company decided to enforce its right under licence to be the sole provider of this testing. Although the company then retreated from this position, the fear was created that a monopoly on gene testing could be imposed at any time. At least six of the current research projects funded through the National Breast Cancer Foundation involve gene or gene mutation studies. The NBCF sees dangers in such ownership or monopoly situations not only from the point of view of the inhibiting of research but also from the perspective of the possible absence of risk assessment and counselling in the testing process.
In the United States patents have been granted for about 20 per cent of human genes. In May this year the American Civil Liberties Union and others—including scientific organisations, medical professionals, researchers, and breast cancer and women’s health groups—filed a lawsuit against the United States Patent and Trademark Office, charging that patents on two human genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are unconstitutional and invalid. Points made in the US case were: further scientific research on gene mutation or the development of alternative diagnostic methods could be delayed, limited or prevented; only one company was entitled to perform the diagnostic testing, and women would be unable to get a second opinion; the cost of the tests could well be unaffordable for many; and the funding for the initial research which led to the development of these tests was from public funding agencies. A ruling on whether this lawsuit is to proceed is due later this month. These points are now also being made to the current Senate inquiry.
Patents are granted on a country-by-country basis. Apparently the Melbourne private company, Genetic Technologies Limited, has a commercial licensing agreement with the US firm Myriad, which allows it to have the exclusive Australian rights to diagnostic testing for the gene mutations associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Many of the submissions to the Senate inquiry have come from those likely to be most affected by any exercising of a monopoly over human gene sequences. They include Breast Cancer Network Australia, which is the peak organisation for Australians personally affected by breast cancer, the Breast Cancer Action Group NSW, a joint submission from the Cancer Council Australia and the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia, and others representing doctors, pathologists and researchers. A thoughtful submission has been made by my colleague the member for Fremantle, Melissa Parke, MP. Submissions from the cancer and health organisations have urged, in the words of the joint submission from the Cancer Council Australia and COSA:
… the only efficient, permanent way to ameliorate the numerous adverse impacts around gene patenting before the technology evolves further is to exclude genes from the definition of patentable material.
The Senate Community Affairs References Committee has been commended in many of the submissions for tackling such an important and timely inquiry. Developments in genetic science and the new directions in breast cancer research make it essential that we tackle issues with foresight and with regard to the needs of our future wellbeing. I look forward, as I am sure we all do, to the committee’s findings and recommendations, and I congratulate the organisations for their reasoned and detailed submissions.
On this Pink Ribbon Day I would like to reflect, just in the few minutes I have remaining to speak, on some of the events that occurred over the weekend. I am a patron of Dragons Abreast here in the ACT and was very proud to be asked to participate in the wonderful Dragons Abreast dragon boat regatta held in Lake Burley Griffin this Saturday past. The Canberra weather was kind to us and it was the most glorious spring day. Not only was the program so wonderfully put together that it ran ahead of schedule but also it permitted everybody to participate in a final of one sort or another. I was there to help hand out the prizes. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the wonderful women involved in Dragons Abreast here in Canberra, and indeed around Australia, for the energy and commitment they have to an organisation that celebrates the life of cancer survivors and supports those who are still fighting their battles. I would also like to mention the Pink Ribbon Motorcycle Ride, organised by Canberra group Girls on the Move—a group of motorcycle riders who dressed up their motorbikes in glorious pink yesterday—culminating in a wonderful barbecue at Weston Park and again raising money for breast cancer research.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Breast Cancer</title>,Adjournment,36,1,speech
