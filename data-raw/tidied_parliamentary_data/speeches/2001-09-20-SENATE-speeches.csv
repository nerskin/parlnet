"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2001-09-20,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the Space Activities Regulations 2001, as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 186 and made under the Space Activities Act 1998, be disallowed. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with this instrument.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Space Activities Regulations 2001, Statutory Rules 2001 No.186
The Regulations provide for a licensing and safety regime in relation to space launch activities.
Paragraph 2.04(2)(j) requires the holder of a licence to notify the Minister in writing of certain details about employees and deemed employees.  The details include name, qualifications, usual place of residence, and employment history for the past 10 years. The Committee notes that this reporting requirement covers deemed employees, a category which includes persons who perform a service for the licence holder. The Minister advised that applicants should be notified of their obligations under the Regulations and that advice be provided on how the Government planned to use the employee information provided. However, it is unclear how this obligation affects deemed employees.
The Committee has therefore written again to the Minister seeking clarification on whether a deemed employee is made aware at the time that he or she agrees to provide the service that information about them (10 year employment record) will be supplied to the Minister.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,1,1

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-20,"—I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Education, Training and Youth Affairs Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001
Excise Tariff Amendment (Crude Oil) Bill 2001
Health and Other Services (Compens-ation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001
Social Security and Veterans' Entitle-ments Legislation Amendment (Retir-ement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001
Trade Practices Amendment (Tele-communications) Bill 2001
Superannuation Legislation Amend-ment (Indexation) Bill 2001.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short statement which covers the reasons for the exemption of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2001.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INDEXATION) BILL 2001
Purpose of the bill
The Bill contains amendments to legislation which provides superannuation arrangements for the military and for Commonwealth civilian employees to change the timing of the indexation of pensions paid under that legislation from annual indexation to twice-yearly indexation.
Reasons for Urgency
This proposed legislation, which gives effect to a 2000-01 Budget measure, was introduced into the Parliament during the Budget (Winter) Sittings 2001. The Bill provides for the new timing for pension indexation for civilian and military pensions to commence on the first pension payday in January 2002. Passage in the current Sittings is necessary for the new arrangements to commence in that timeframe.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Hon. John Fahey, MP)

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-20,"—On behalf of Senator Cooney, I lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 13 of 2001, dated 20 September 2001.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
My understanding is that that Alert Digest relates to the migration bills that were just introduced into the House of Representatives two days ago, guillotined through there just last night and attempted to have come on here today. It is appropriate that the work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee be noted in relation to all of its work but particularly in relation to important pieces of legislation such as these are. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, along with the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, performs a very important task which is often underestimated and not recognised—that is, to scrutinise bills, as the title of the committee suggests, and to examine them not in terms of policy grounds but in terms of fundamental legal principles, including civil liberties, retrospectivity and other grounds. It is a contempt of the work of that committee for the Senate to basically proceed with bills such as these as speedily as is being proposed without examining the sorts of concerns that the committee has in relation to these bills. Not having been on the committee and not having seen the report, if the Clerk or an attendant would provide me with a copy of it while I am speaking, that would be nice.
I think the focus of that committee's work needs to be examined. There is no doubt that there are some significant problems in these bills in regard to those basic legal principles. Leaving aside the policy debate for the moment—that is not what this committee does; we can debate that at another time—these legal principles are very important. These bills undermine some of those principles in quite a fundamental way. I have not seen the committee report, but I would be very surprised if it does not highlight them. The fact that the report has just been presented and no senator in this place, other than those on the committee, has had an opportunity to examine it makes this an important matter to consider.
The committee looks at things such as whether bills and acts of parliament trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties; make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent on insufficiently defined administrative powers; make rights, liberties or obligations unduly dependent on non-reviewable decisions; inappropriately delegate legislative powers; or insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I apologise to Senator Bartlett. I think it is quite untoward that we are debating a matter when the basic document relating to it is not available to the Senate. I would move that, until it is unavailable, we suspend the debate on this matter and come back to it when that document is available.
—You cannot move an adjournment in the middle of Senator Bartlett's speech. You could move that adjournment when Senator Bartlett has completed his speech.
—Madam President, on the point of order: Senator Brown and I have not agreed on much over the years, but I agree that we have to do something about this as a principle. I would suggest two things: first, that we try and get a report as quickly as possible so that my colleagues here can debate it and, second, that a reference by you, Madam President—and I know how gracious you are in these things—to the Procedure Committee is in order. There have been a number of occasions where I have wanted an Auditor-General's report and so on. We are often caught in a position where we are not giving due respect to reports because we are not able to read them properly before we have to get up and address them. So I was wondering if you could take that on board and refer it to the Procedure Committee—not just about this instance but generally about the availability of reports that are then to be potentially debated in this chamber.
—I will do that, but I point out that in this instance it is an Alert Digest we are talking about; it is not a report from the committee. There may be some substance in the other matters, and I will refer them.
—I note that, as you say, Madam President, it is an Alert Digest, but it is a very significant digest and it contains lots of things that we need to be alerted to. The usual procedure, which other senators are probably aware of but others listening to the debate may not be, is that the committee examine bills according to those principles that I just read out. I would suggest that all five of those principles are probably breached by these bills, which makes it quite serious, and that the committee should examine them according to those principles and, if concerned, seek the minister's advice. The minister should then respond to that and that response then be incorporated in further reports so that the Senate as a whole can take that into consideration.
This report seeks advice from the minister on a number of matters. For example, on the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001, it seeks the minister's advice as to: 
·	whether the provisions have the effect of making lawful acts which are currently unlawful ... 
·	why the validation is expressed so widely ...
·	whether the actions which are retrospectively validated must have complied with guidelines as to conduct or other internal regulatory procedures, and what remedies would be available to a person where, for example, a Commonwealth official took action which was `improper' ... and
·	whether the phrase `an intention to enter Australia' refers to Australian land or Australian territorial waters.
Those have been identified, but of course we do not have the advice from the minister about the concerns that have been raised in this Alert Digest. Concerns are also raised about:
·	why it is thought necessary to prohibit the institution of proceedings in relation to (presumably otherwise unlawful) detention; 
·	whether the powers to detain and search are to be carried out on the high seas or in Australia's territorial waters; 
·	why, given the availability of telephone warrants, it is appropriate that searches of detainees be conducted without a warrant; 
·	whether this bill is seen as dealing with `extraordinary circumstances' or a situation of emergency, and why these powers are not subject to a sunset clause. 
Again, these are extra concerns raised with just with one of these bills. The provisions in the bill that are highlighted empower people to detain persons without any charge. The Alert Digest also expresses concerns about the retrospective operation of the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001. It expresses concerns about significant definitions able to be amended subsequently by regulation—the so-called Henry VIII clause—expresses concerns about the wide discretion involved in the consequential provisions bill, expresses concerns about provisions that remove access to the courts and seeks advice on how court proceedings have been used by offshore entry persons to frustrate the resolution of their immigration status. It also deals with the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001, which I will not touch on because it is before a Senate committee at the moment, so we will have the opportunity to examine that further.
A quick perusal of this Alert Digest makes it quite clear that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills—which, as I remind senators, is not a policy committee; it does not examine the whole issue of how we deal with unauthorised arrivals—only examines those basic legal principles. I think, particularly in the Senate, we should consider these in regard to the impact of legislation that we may pass about trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties, about making rights and liberties unduly dependent on administrative powers which are inadequately defined and about making those rights and liberties dependent on non-reviewable decisions. Unfortunately, the Migration Act is already crammed full of those sorts of things, but these bills are even more packed full of them. They inappropriately delegate legislative powers and insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliament scrutiny. They do the lot.
This package of bills, as this Alert Digest shows, contravenes all of those basic principles that this committee examines. Those basic principles of civil liberties and the rule of law, the basic principles that go to the separation of powers and the foundation of the entire system of government in this country are the sorts of things that these bills undermine and these are the sorts of things that are outlined in this Alert Digest. 
I should also add that the committee is a cross-party committee: there is no, as there never is, any dissenting report. The committee is chaired by Senator Cooney, quite ably, and also contains Senator Crane, Senator Crossin, Senator Ferris, Senator Mason—some fine legal minds amongst them—and Senator Murray, from the Democrats, another person with fine attention to detail and some of those fundamental principles of accountability.
I remind people of the purpose of these committees. Why do we have a committee like this that does that hard work? It is not political work; it is not work that seeks to get publicity. It is behind-the-scenes work that scrutinises legislation for the basic fundamentals of it. It is, I believe, contemptuous of such committees for the Senate not to take into account the work that they do and the concerns that they raise and to try to rush through consideration of matters before advice has been returned to the committee from the minister. We are basically preventing this committee from doing its job—and let us not forget that this committee and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee do an incredibly important job. They actually save the rest of us a lot of work: they go through and look for these basic legal principles and draw them to our attention and seek to get answers to them before we have to deal with them in the chamber as a whole. That is an important aspect of this committee's work. 
The committee has raised serious concerns about these bills that have not even been introduced into the Senate yet. We should take note of this report and I believe seek to get the minister's answers to the many concerns that are raised within it before we proceed further on those bills. That is a point that I would seek to make later on today if such questions arise, but I do urge all senators and, indeed, others who are interested—those in the media—to examine this Alert Digest that raises some, amongst many, concerns in relation to these bills that I believe should be examined.
—Senator Brown, you gave notice of wanting to adjourn the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-20,"—I now have the Alert Digest and, although I failed speed reading school back in 1970, I have been able to look at it and I will proceed, but I would endorse the point that Senator Ray made that it is not satisfactory for us to have to debate documents that we have not had an opportunity to look at. 
This is a very important report from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, as Senator Bartlett has just said. That committee looks at bills coming before the Senate to ensure that they do not infringe on civil liberties, that they do not inappropriately delegate legislative powers, that they are clearly defined and, in effect, that they represent good legislation which has been subject to parliamentary scrutiny and do not infringe long held values that this nation stands for. This committee, which I might point out does not include Senator Bartlett or me sitting on it, has raised a number of questions which should be answered before the Senate deals with these matters. On the matter of retrospective validation of any action, the committee has sought the advice of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs as to:
whether these provisions have the effect of making lawful acts which are currently unlawful, or which would be unlawful if they occurred in Australia ... 
It has asked the minister:
why the validation is expressed so widely, and whether it would operate to validate all actions by an officer during the relevant period (including, for example, an action which caused the death of, or serious injury to, a person detained on a vessel) ...
It has asked the minister:
whether the actions which are retrospectively validated must have complied with guidelines as to conduct or other internal regulatory procedures, and what remedies would be available to a person where, for example, a Commonwealth official took action which was `improper' but which was validated by the bill ...
I have been very concerned about that. If we are getting retrospective legislation and here is this to cover the tracks of the minister or some other person who acted not just improperly but potentially illegally since the Tampa picked up the asylum seekers in the waters off our northern coast, I do want to be party to it. Retrospectively validating improper or illegal actions is, I do not think, the right way for parliament to proceed. The committee has also sought the minister's advice as to:
whether the phrase `an intention to enter Australia' refers to Australian land or Australian territorial waters.
We do not have the minister's advice on those matters. On the matter of detention and search of persons, the committee has asked the minister's advice as to:
why it is thought necessary to prohibit the institution of proceedings in relation to (presumably otherwise unlawful) detention ...
It has asked the minister:
whether the powers to detain and search are to be carried out on the high seas or in Australia's territorial waters ...
And:
why, given the availability of telephone warrants, it is appropriate that searches of detainees be conducted without warrant ...
This is a very important question. The committee has also asked the minister:
whether this bill—
that is, the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001—
is seen as dealing with `extraordinary circumstances' or a situation of emergency, and why these powers are not subject to a sunset clause.
Indeed, that is something that the minister mooted just a week ago. On the matter of mandatory sentencing—and let us not forget that this is the first time we have seen mandatory sentencing appearing in federal law—the committee sought the minister's advice `as to why it is appropriate to give the executive control by limiting judicial discretion in these circumstances'. In other words, after the long debates we have had about the Northern Territory and mandatory sentencing, and the general consensus in this place at least that sentencing should be a matter for the courts, here we have legislation coming before us to give the executive control by limiting the courts' discretion in these circumstances. Is it right for politicians through this course of action to be telling judges what they shall or shall not do when it comes to sentencing? Once we step across the border and support that, once we step over the limit and support that, where does it end? These are very important questions for the opposition to be considering.
The committee then looked at the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and it put a number of questions to the minister. It is seeking the minister's advice on why the explanatory memorandum does not indicate why the dates variously applying to the implementation of this law for Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and so on have been chosen, and whether any person will be disadvantaged by the retrospective operation of these provisions and, if so, who. We need to know these things if we are going to act with political as well as legal prudence in considering these important bills. 
The committee has also sought the minister's advice as to the head of power which authorises the excision of various parts of Australia from the migration zone—that is, from Australian law—in particular, the Migration Act. It has looked at the Henry VIII clause, schedule 1, item 1 of that bill, and it seeks the minister's advice as to whether it is appropriate that such a significant definition is able to be amended by regulation—that is, by the minister's request through a regulation which comes before the parliament. We do not have the minister's response on that. On the matter of wide discretion, the committee points out that the bill proposes to insert a new section into the Migration Act which gives the minister an apparently unfettered discretion to determine whether an application for a visa by an offshore entry person is a valid application. 
The committee also has a number of questions on the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 which will be seen in the report. When it comes to the matter of a bar on certain legal proceedings, the committee has asked the minister how court proceedings have been used by offshore entry persons to frustrate the resolution of their immigration status. If the minister is putting legislation before us to counter that, then we need to have the government tell us where the courts have been frustrated by this process. I await the minister's advice on that. 
On the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001, when it comes to drawing inferences from a refusal to produce documents under proposed new sections 91B and 91W, the committee seeks the minister's advice as to why it is appropriate that unfavourable inferences be drawn in administrative proceedings and what the consequences of drawing those unfavourable inferences might be. When it comes to the drafting note, item 10, schedule 1 to this bill, the committee notes that it consists solely of the heading of the item with no substantive enacting words. That is an extraordinary comment on the fact that this is legislation on the run. 
Finally, we are going to hear quite a bit more of this this morning. I appeal to the opposition. You know, from the feedback that is coming from thinking Australians throughout our community, that there is high alarm in the community—not least amongst Labor voters—about the way the opposition appears to be joining the government in making legislation on the run and effectively moving towards a parliamentary railroading of this legislation. I caution against it. It is the wrong way to go. I also appeal, and I will be making this appeal later, for this legislation to go to a committee—I will put the date of that committee Tuesday next—to allow the opposition at least to have the decency to support the public having some input into this legislation in the coming days, much the same as is going to occur with the regional forest agreement legislation.

We do not have the minister's advice on those matters. On the matter of detention and search of persons, the committee has asked the minister's advice as to:
why it is thought necessary to prohibit the institution of proceedings in relation to (presumably otherwise unlawful) detention ...
It has asked the minister:
whether the powers to detain and search are to be carried out on the high seas or in Australia's territorial waters ...
And:
why, given the availability of telephone warrants, it is appropriate that searches of detainees be conducted without warrant ...
This is a very important question. The committee has also asked the minister:
whether this bill—
that is, the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001—
is seen as dealing with `extraordinary circumstances' or a situation of emergency, and why these powers are not subject to a sunset clause.
Indeed, that is something that the minister mooted just a week ago. On the matter of mandatory sentencing—and let us not forget that this is the first time we have seen mandatory sentencing appearing in federal law—the committee sought the minister's advice `as to why it is appropriate to give the executive control by limiting judicial discretion in these circumstances'. In other words, after the long debates we have had about the Northern Territory and mandatory sentencing, and the general consensus in this place at least that sentencing should be a matter for the courts, here we have legislation coming before us to give the executive control by limiting the courts' discretion in these circumstances. Is it right for politicians through this course of action to be telling judges what they shall or shall not do when it comes to sentencing? Once we step across the border and support that, once we step over the limit and support that, where does it end? These are very important questions for the opposition to be considering.
The committee then looked at the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and it put a number of questions to the minister. It is seeking the minister's advice on why the explanatory memorandum does not indicate why the dates variously applying to the implementation of this law for Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and so on have been chosen, and whether any person will be disadvantaged by the retrospective operation of these provisions and, if so, who. We need to know these things if we are going to act with political as well as legal prudence in considering these important bills. 
The committee has also sought the minister's advice as to the head of power which authorises the excision of various parts of Australia from the migration zone—that is, from Australian law—in particular, the Migration Act. It has looked at the Henry VIII clause, schedule 1, item 1 of that bill, and it seeks the minister's advice as to whether it is appropriate that such a significant definition is able to be amended by regulation—that is, by the minister's request through a regulation which comes before the parliament. We do not have the minister's response on that. On the matter of wide discretion, the committee points out that the bill proposes to insert a new section into the Migration Act which gives the minister an apparently unfettered discretion to determine whether an application for a visa by an offshore entry person is a valid application. 
The committee also has a number of questions on the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 which will be seen in the report. When it comes to the matter of a bar on certain legal proceedings, the committee has asked the minister how court proceedings have been used by offshore entry persons to frustrate the resolution of their immigration status. If the minister is putting legislation before us to counter that, then we need to have the government tell us where the courts have been frustrated by this process. I await the minister's advice on that. 
On the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001, when it comes to drawing inferences from a refusal to produce documents under proposed new sections 91B and 91W, the committee seeks the minister's advice as to why it is appropriate that unfavourable inferences be drawn in administrative proceedings and what the consequences of drawing those unfavourable inferences might be. When it comes to the drafting note, item 10, schedule 1 to this bill, the committee notes that it consists solely of the heading of the item with no substantive enacting words. That is an extraordinary comment on the fact that this is legislation on the run. 
Finally, we are going to hear quite a bit more of this this morning. I appeal to the opposition. You know, from the feedback that is coming from thinking Australians throughout our community, that there is high alarm in the community—not least amongst Labor voters—about the way the opposition appears to be joining the government in making legislation on the run and effectively moving towards a parliamentary railroading of this legislation. I caution against it. It is the wrong way to go. I also appeal, and I will be making this appeal later, for this legislation to go to a committee—I will put the date of that committee Tuesday next—to allow the opposition at least to have the decency to support the public having some input into this legislation in the coming days, much the same as is going to occur with the regional forest agreement legislation. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,12,2
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2001-09-20,"—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled Risky Business: Inquiry into the tender process followed in the sale of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, minutes of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, the opening of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort in 1993 had a profound impact upon both the economy and the community of Christmas Island.
It boosted employment, encouraged the growth of a tourism and small business sector, almost doubled the population of the small island community, and had a positive effect on Christmas Island as a whole.
Unfortunately, the casino and resort closed in 1998. This was the result of internal management disputes, the cessation of direct air services from Asia and the flow-on effects of the Asian economic crises.
The closure of the casino and resort had a substantial impact on the newfound prosperity of the island economy, for both individuals and businesses who suffered financial losses as a result of the casino and resort's closure.
When the liquidator was appointed by the courts in 1998, it was hoped that the casino and resort could be tendered and sold quickly, in order to settle outstanding entitlements owed to former employees of the casino and resort, and to refurbish and re-open the casino and resort as quickly as possible.
Unfortunately, the tender process which followed was long and complicated, beset, as it was, by numerous legal challenges from the former Directors of Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd.
As a result, even though the property was sold on 5 May 2000, the liquidator is unable to pay entitlements owing to former employees of the casino and resort because of a continuing legal challenge in the High Court of Australia.
The committee was asked by the Senate to examine the conduct of the tender process followed in the sale of the casino and resort, and to inquire into the current status of the casino and resort as well as proposals for the resort's future development.
Necessarily, the committee also examined a range of broader issues which provided a context for its examination of the sale process for the casino and resort, and which bear directly on the future development of the island.
This included issues such as the provision of air services, future economic development opportunities and the level and structure of community consultation with representatives of Christmas Island.
The committee held public hearings in Canberra, in February and June 2001, as well as in Perth and Christmas Island in April 2001. 
The committee heard evidence from the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the liquidator of the casino and resort, the company which made the strongest bid within the tender process, members and representatives of the Christmas Island community and Soft Star Pty Ltd - the company which eventually bought the casino and resort.
In our report - Risky Business - the committee has made six recommendations. These relate to:
·	Administrative processes relating to Christmas Island;
·	The payment of entitlements to former employees of the Christmas Island Casino and Resort, and the Christmas Island Laundry;
·	The resolution of matters pertaining to the resort lease and the future operation of the casino and resort; 
·	Conversion of the resort leases from leasehold to a conditional form of freehold title, subject to full community consultation;
·	The conduct of probity and background financial checks; and
·	Negotiation of terms and conditions for the provision of vehicular access to Waterfall Bay for members of the Christmas Island community.
The committee has also made a number of general conclusions with regard to issues and concerns raised during the course of the inquiry.
The committee considered that many of the concerns heard during the inquiry regarding the conduct of the tender process, originated out of an inherent tension between the liquidator's role in an essentially commercial operation to realise the assets for the best price in the shortest timeframe, and the Commonwealth's desire to optimise opportunities for Christmas Island.
The committee also acknowledges that the liquidator, faced with diminishing funds and the potential for protracted and lengthy negotiations regarding the conditions of operation, subsequently sought an expeditious resolution to the sale process. 
The committee has noted concerns about the commencement of negotiations with Soft Star Pty Ltd, the eventual purchaser of the casino and resort, before the official termination of the tender process. However, the committee also recognises that this did not contravene Corporations Law.
The committee received evidence from community members of Christmas Island, who are concerned that Soft Star are yet to commence the refurbishment of the complex required for the re-opening of the casino and resort. The Committee heard evidence from Soft Star Pty Ltd, that the redevelopment of the complex has not commenced owing to commercial factors which have rendered the opening and operation of the casino and resort on Christmas Island commercially impractical.
Soft Star Pty Ltd is a company associated with Asia Pacific Space Centre (APSC). APSC are planning to construct and operate a commercial satellite launching facility on Christmas Island. The satellite launching facility will bring enormous investment and employment opportunities to the island, and to Australia as a whole.
The committee notes a June 2001 announcement by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, the Hon Ian Macdonald, regarding Commonwealth funding of approximately $100 million, for the purposes of common use infrastructure associated with the project. 
The committee noted in its report, that Soft Star have repeatedly stated their intention to restore the casino and resort to its former glory, bringing jobs and economic growth for the Christmas Island community.
In June 2001, Soft Star announced that it intends to pursue the refurbishment and re-opening of the facility in the immediate future. More recently, in the Weekend Australian newspaper of 15 September 2001, there appeared another article titled `Island Casino to Reopen'. 
The committee consequently considered that future prospects for the Island are good. The construction and operation of the satellite launching facility will make the operation of the casino and resort more commercially viable, thereby facilitating its prompt refurbishment and re-opening.
I would like to thank those individuals and organisations who provided the committee with submissions and evidence, and also to the members of the committee, who have shown their commitment to the committee's responsibilities with respect to Australia's territories.
In addition, I would like to extend my thanks to the committee secretariat of Richard Selth, Emma Herd, Sarah Steele and Anna Gadzinski, for their assistance to the Committee during the course of the inquiry.
Madam President, I commend this report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I rise to provide a contribution from the opposition members of the Joint National Capital and External Territories Committee in relation to the report on the Christmas Island casino resort that was just tabled by Senator Lightfoot. This inquiry examined in some detail the circumstances surrounding the tender process of the disposal of the failed Christmas Island casino resort and its subsequent sale to a company known as Soft Star. The salient facts in this business process are that the Christmas Island casino resort was granted a 99-year crown lease for a 47-hectare block of land upon which the facility was built. The resort was a major employer on Christmas Island and a major stimulus to the Christmas Island economy. The closure of the resort in 1998 has had a devastating effect upon the social and economic structure of Christmas Island, with up to 250 people leaving the island immediately after the casino's closure.
The Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce estimates that the island's population has fallen from 2,600 to 1,300 since the closure of the casino. It has been 15 months since the sale of the facility and over three years since the start of the sale process, and the casino and the resort remain largely closed. Let us be quite clear in presenting the report about what the closure of the resort and the sale of the casino have meant for Christmas Island—the island depended very much on the operation of the casino for income, economy and livelihood—and what it now means for those people who are still awaiting the realisation of the promise that the casino be reopened. Our dissenting report highlights the opposition's many concerns relating to this process, such as the purpose clause of the lease; the conversion of the leases from leasehold to freehold title and the conduct of the negotiations with ComsWinfair—the company that I believe would have by now opened the resort and the one, it seemed on the face of it, to which the resort should have been sold. Of course, the casino and the resort was sold to Soft Star Pty Ltd. People reading this transcript, and who want to know about this process, should be aware that Soft Star Pty Ltd is connected to the APSC—the owners of the space base—to which this government last month appropriated many millions of dollars to assist in getting the space base operating.
Much hinges on the interpretation of the purpose clause of the Christmas Island resort lease, which is now where the focus of the future of this resort is placed. The lease says:
The Lessee shall use the premises only for the purposes of a hotel-casino and ancillary thereto, for personal services, retail and non-retail shops, recreation, accommodation and entertainment facilities or such purpose as may be approved in writing by the Commonwealth.
Evidence was presented to the committee that the purpose clause of the lease is permissive and not mandatory and that therefore failure to reopen the casino does not appear to constitute a breach of this lease. We do not accept that. Even if this interpretation were accepted, non-government members could not understand why this government failed to ensure that the operation of a casino and resort was mandatory within the purpose clause of the lease, remembering the importance and the contribution of the casino and resort to Christmas Island's economy and social infrastructure. 
However, our interpretation suggests that the purpose clause of the lease means that it was mandatory, that there was an obligation on the Commonwealth government to ensure that, in the sale of the casino and resort, the future owners—Soft Star in this case—were mandated and that they must open and operate it as a casino. It appears to non-government members of the committee that the current leaseholder is in breach of the lease by failing to reopen the casino and resort. Opposition members on the committee do not accept the assertion made in the majority report that the committee understands that the Commonwealth has no ability to compel the owner of the facility to use it for the purpose of a casino and resort. We do not accept that. We believe that the Commonwealth has an absolute ability and an absolute obligation to compel the owner of the facility to open it as a casino. We say that the current operator should be given 12 months to do so or that the lease be revoked. We know, of course, that that will lead to court action.
I draw the Senate's attention to an article in the Weekend Australian of September 15 and 16 where Soft Star say that negotiations are under way with potential managers to reopen the casino and that they are `doing what they need to do and will see how quickly it can be done.' Who with? Who is Soft Star talking to? What is the time line? We have heard this time and time again. In fact, Soft Star put out a press release in June saying they were about to reopen the resort, but we are still waiting for that to happen. We are continually being led around. The people on Christmas Island are being continually misled by Soft Star's promises to reopen this casino.
The other important issue is the conversion of the lease from leasehold to freehold. Given the importance of a functioning casino resort to the tourism and small business sectors of the island economy, we feel that it would be highly inappropriate to approve the conversion of the resort leases from leasehold to freehold title, even on a conditional basis. Non-government members are concerned that the loss of direct control over the lease by the Commonwealth would impact negatively upon the community's ability to influence the use of the casino and resort by the current owner or by any other subsequent owners. We are also concerned at the lack of consultation with the Christmas Island community, again, and the lack of consultation with the Christmas Island Shire Council, again, regarding the conversion of the resort lease from leasehold to freehold—which is a prospect that this government is currently considering.
In short, the opposition members of the committee feel that in light of continuing uncertainty in the redevelopment of the complex, and its reopening as a fully operational casino and resort, the approval of Soft Star's application for conversion of the leases from leasehold to freehold title would remove any influence the Christmas Island community could have over the management of such a vital economic resource. Further, the non-government members of the committee were concerned about the result of the tender process and the subsequent sale to Soft Star. We believe that ComsWinfair clearly emerged from the tender process as the only viable tenderer with the experience, financial resources and intent to refurbish and reopen the casino and resort to its full operational capacity. It would appear that any outstanding conditions between ComsWinfair and the Commonwealth were and could have been essentially resolved as of January 2000, and that ComsWinfair anticipated resolving all outstanding issues in the shortest time frame possible.
The other thing is that, in relation to the sale to Soft Star Pty Ltd, the opposition members of the committee did not think it was appropriate to begin negotiations with Soft Star before the termination of the tender process, nor was it appropriate that probity and financial background checks were not applied to Soft Star before the sale of the property. In short— and there are many more things I would like to say about this report—we believe the tender process for the sale of the Christmas Island resort was flawed from the outset. We believe the Commonwealth's handling of its role in the process and its responsibilities to the Christmas Island community have once again been totally inadequate.
In closing, I would like to add my thanks to the committee secretariat, to the secretary Richard Selth and to the people who work in that committee, in particular to Emma Herd for the work in producing this report. (Time expired)

—The question is now that the bills proceed without formality. Senator Bartlett, you have the call.
—It is important and appropriate to speak to this motion because we often hear those words `that these bills may proceed without formalities' and do not actually consider what they mean. It is appropriate to also utilise the opportunity of this motion to draw attention to what is actually happening in this chamber today and what has happened in this parliament over the last day or two.
The motion is that `these bills may proceed without formalities'. If this motion were agreed to, it would have the effect of suspending any requirements for stages of the passage of the bills to take place on different days, for notice of motions for such stages and for the printing and certification of the bill or bills during the passage. It is a mechanical motion that is used to facilitate easy passage of legislation to stages of consideration and it is normally passed without dissent and without comment, because there is opportunity to consider legislation and to look at the detail of it in the various later stages of the debate. But that is under normal circumstances and these are far from normal circumstances in the parliament at the moment in relation to these bills and these are far from normal circumstances in relation to this government's treatment of the whole issue that is addressed by these bills. 
The Democrats do not believe that these bills should proceed without formalities because we should not suspend any requirements for stages of the passage of the bills to take place on different days. These bills should be considered on different days and that is why we oppose that part of the motion. We believe that, because the bills have only just been introduced—probably about 42 hours ago, maybe slightly less—and because they deal with such significant issues, clearly they should not proceed without formalities. 
The bills were introduced into the House of Representatives less than 48 hours ago. Some of them were not available on the parliamentary Internet until late yesterday afternoon. The explanatory memoranda certainly were not available until late yesterday afternoon. That is less than 24 hours ago. That is completely inappropriate. That is problematic for us as parliamentarians. Of course, we can get hold of the bills when they are introduced in the House of Representatives but getting commentary from the community about issues in legislation like this is virtually impossible. At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon, I spoke to a number of people who are experts in the area covered by these bills. They still had not had an opportunity to look at the bills. I still have not had an opportunity to get any feedback from them about the impacts of these bills. 
To suggest that we should allow these bills to proceed without formality I think makes a mockery of the proper legislative process that this chamber, in particular, utilises. We can forget about the House of Representatives; it never considers bills properly anyway. But the Senate has a responsibility to examine legislation properly. Amongst ourselves, we might be reasonably good at considering legislation and examining its detail but I do not profess to be an expert on everything and I rely very heavily on feedback from people who do have expertise, from people who work daily in whatever area is involved, and I have not had an opportunity to get that feedback. Indeed, in many cases, people have not had the opportunity to even examine the legislation. So this is a serious concern to the Democrats and that is why we oppose what is normally a straightforward mechanical motion. 
It is worth noting what the impact of this mechanical motion is. It is something that we do not normally examine, that we do just wave through, assuming that those words are said for some sort of procedural purpose but do not have any real meaning. But those words that we hear all the time—`that the bills proceed without formalities'—have quite significant impacts. It is appropriate not only to be aware of what those impacts are but also that we make a considered decision about whether we should allow that to occur. We believe that in this instance we should not allow it to occur. It is in effect a fast-tracking motion. In virtually all circumstances that is okay, in our view, but let us not be under any illusion that these bills are anything other than quite extraordinary. 
As we have already seen this morning in the brief opportunity we have had to consider the Alert Digest from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee there are fundamental concerns about these bills that go to the heart of the rule of law. To just wave them through without consideration and give permission for them to be brought on today—if the Senate so chooses—or for other notices of motion for various stages of the bill to be moved without notice is not appropriate given the extraordinary nature of these bills. That is why we are taking the unusual step of opposing this motion, because these are extraordinary bills. They contravene civil liberties in any number of ways. They contravene the basic underpinnings of our rule of law. They are of dubious constitutional validity in some circumstances. They savagely impinge on human rights of individuals and they undermine our obligations in relation to a range of international conventions. That is just on a first glance at the bills. That is without feedback from people who have expertise in this area. That is with initial consideration of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. We can tell that already from having a quick glance through these bills. Imagine what more we will find. 
I hear more with each comment I get back from people about some other hidden atrocity within these bills. I will not go into detail on that matter now because it is not relevant to the question. The question before the chamber is whether the bills should proceed without formalities. I certainly will go into that matter when the bills do come on for debate which, hopefully, will not be today because these bills should not proceed without formalities. They should be put off for consideration in an appropriate fashion. Other proposals, which have been foreshadowed already, will be put before the chamber about a better process for doing that. 
If there were some indication from the government or the opposition that they would support these bills being referred to a committee, even to report back next week, then we may be willing to support this motion and indeed not debate them because we would at least believe that we would have the opportunity to consider the bills. In a sense that is a suggestion to both the opposition and the government that if they support these bills going off to a committee, even just for a few days scrutiny, we would be less inclined to oppose them proceeding without formalities and, I would foreshadow, less inclined to oppose them being taken together as well, because at least there would be some opportunity to examine them. 
We are not seeking to frustrate consideration of these bills in any unreasonable way. We are simply trying to draw attention to every stage of the proceedings in the passage of these bills and to draw to the attention of the Senate, the media and the public more generally what is occurring each step of the way as we wave through these bills. These bills have had very serious fundamental legal concerns raised about them. That is not even addressing the issue of the best policy approach to deal with the huge numbers of asylum seekers and refugees throughout the world. We can deal with that when it is relevant to the question before the chamber.
There have been serious concerns raised about the basic legal principles contained in these bills. We hear repeatedly from the opposition, and I think it is a fair enough point, that the government and the cabinet are packed to the gills with lawyers—some very esteemed lawyers with great expertise in the principles of law. I would be surprised if many of them have even had the opportunity to examine these bills in any detail. I would be interested in the feedback and expertise not only from those out in the community but also from those in the government, who, I know, have the expertise and the ability and who also have concerns about not just the treatment of refugees but also the legal principles involved in these bills. I think there would be many in the coalition parties, particularly the Liberal Party, who would be extremely concerned about the legal principles alone involved in these bills, leaving aside the policy aspects. I know there are others in the opposition who have concerns as well.
What needs to be emphasised and drawn to the attention of the public in relation to these bills is not only the content of the bills—which I will not debate now because it is not the question before the chair; we can debate that later—but also the process that is being followed. Let us go back to the structure of government, the separation of powers—that is, the role of the courts, the executive, the cabinet or the government, and the parliament—and the three arms or legs balancing each other not just in terms of the content of the bill but the process being followed here. The process is basically subverting what, I believe, is the genuine will of the parliament. 
The party system in this place is so rigid and all of us are subject to that—some to a lesser degree than others—but I recognise that it is a feature of our political system. I have no doubt, and it is quite clear, that there are many in the opposition who are concerned about and opposed to these bills. I have no doubt that there are a number in the coalition parties who are concerned as well. It is quite possible that if a majority of people in this chamber were free to express their personal opinion on these bills they would oppose them. 
Unfortunately, the power of the executive over the parliament and the power of the party system over the parliament has now got to a stage where, I believe, this is a clear example of the will of the parliament possibly being overturned and overridden. That is of great concern in terms of the fundamental underpinnings of our whole system of government. One of those three arms or legs, whichever you prefer, is clearly being weakened to a significant degree in relation to these bills and this process that we are currently following. I believe this is something that really should send alarm bells. People can have different views about the best policy approach to deal with the growing number of refugees throughout the world—numbers that are probably going to increase significantly in the next few days or are increasing as we speak—but, leaving that to one side, this goes to our whole system of government and our legal principles. 
Once the parliament steps aside and allows the executive to take on board such significant powers, not just in terms of the content of the bill but the process that is being followed with this legislative process, then this is not just about the rights of unauthorised arrivals and asylum seekers but about the rights of the Australian community. Once it is accepted practice to allow some of those fundamental legal and procedural principles to be undermined, to be ignored or to be waived, to empower the government to be above the law—which is what at least one of these bills does in that it empowers delegates of the government to be above the law—then we are seriously undermining the whole fabric of the protection of the civil liberties and the legal and human rights of the Australian community. 
It is easy to think that this only applies to somebody else—people we do not know, people who do not have a face, people who are not Australians and whom we do not have to worry about. Once you support principles such as these, you put at risk the fundamental rights of the entire community. That is something the public is not aware of and I think they need to be made aware of. That is why we believe sufficient time should be given to consider this legislation. That is why we are concerned about the process that is being followed here. That is why the Democrats will take the step of opposing the motion that the bills proceed without formalities and putting on the record, in a procedural sense, why that should not be supported.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I do not intend to speak for a long time on the question before the chair, which is that the bills may proceed without formalities. I think a couple of points can be made on this question. It was not clear to me as Senator Bartlett addressed the question whether or not he intended to oppose it. Senator Bartlett might be able to indicate that to us informally.
—I will.
—Senator Brown has at least indicated that he will. I understand the question before the chair currently—something that has been heard many thousands of times: that the bills may proceed without formalities—is a standard procedure used to expedite the business of the Senate. For the first time since the new procedures for dealing with the stages of bills have been adopted, this current question is being debated. That is a first. This is the first time this question has ever been debated. If there is a vote on it or different views on it, it will be the first time that has occurred also.
The point here—and I would just like to deal with the substance of the question before the chair comparatively briefly—is that the standing orders of the Senate provide for bills to be dealt with on different days. I think that is the most simple explanation. In other words, a first reading is dealt with on one day, a second reading and committee stage is dealt with on another day and, under the standing orders, the third reading is dealt with on another day. Take, for example, standing order 112, which relates to the first reading of a bill. Standing order 112(4) says:
After the first reading, a future day shall be appointed for the second reading of the bill, and the bill shall be printed.
So this motion before the chair, this question before the chair, is basically to override that standing order and allow the bills to proceed without that formality, that formality being `a future day shall be appointed for the second reading'. In other words, the second reading can occur on the same day.
—It is because in the old days printing took a little bit longer.
—Yes, that is probably a valid point, Senator Campbell, but I think also there are new procedures in the Senate which are to streamline some of these arcane standing orders. In relation to the third reading of the bill—this is once the second reading and the committee stage have been concluded—the third reading is governed by standing order 122 of the Senate. Standing order 122(1) says:
When the report of the committee of the whole is adopted, a future day shall be fixed for the third reading.
So again this question before the chair is to override standing order 122(1), as has occurred on each and every occasion a bill has been debated in this place literally for decades; that standing order has been overridden. It might be a reasonable thing for someone to point out that perhaps it is time to review these standing orders and modernise them so we do not actually require a question that the bills proceed without formalities. However, that is the question before the chair and they are the standing orders that are overridden by it, as in our view they ought to be and as they have been in the case of every other piece of legislation since this procedure has been adopted by this chamber, and we do not see any reason why the usual procedures should not apply here.
The next question that will come before the Senate is of course that the bills be taken together and read a first time. That is debatable also. I do not know what the intention of some senators in the chamber will be in relation to that question before the chair, but it has hitherto been accepted effectively as a formality. But the whole idea of this question is to expedite the second reading. In other words, you can go through all the stages of a bill—first reading, second reading, committee stage and third reading—effectively consecutively without delay, without having to wait a day. This is the point that I would make to Senator Bartlett and also to Senator Brown, who is in the chamber and who has indicated he will be opposing the question before the chair. This means that, in the truncated sittings program we have in this parliament, there will be a very significant delay in this legislation.
I appreciate that there is a lot of public interest in these bills; I acknowledge that, and it would be silly not to acknowledge that. I also appreciate that this is a high legislative priority of the government. I accept that priority, and the opposition believes that a strong case can be made for this legislation progressing without delay. We made a very different case, as you are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, for the Commonwealth electoral bill, which the government wanted to progress quickly through the chamber and which does not have any priority and does not have the same level of public interest or national interest. We made our views on that very clear and they stand in the record of the Senate, and that will be the consistent position of the opposition.
These three migration bills that are before us, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001, are urgent bills. I do not think it is appropriate in this circumstance to use a hitherto unprecedented device to delay the debate on these bills. I always think that, if you can, it is better to debate the substance of the bills, as opposed to using procedural devices or mechanisms to stop them coming on, though I acknowledge and I have always acknowledged—and I will not be hypocritical about this—that at times governments might propose to the Senate questions that are so outrageous that you have to use whatever capacity you have under the standing orders to make a clear point.
I am sure there will be a substantial debate on these matters. I do not doubt that the senator who has spoken to this question, Senator Bartlett, will engage in it. I do not doubt that Senator Brown will engage in it—fair enough—and that a number of other senators might also. I certainly accept, as would the opposition and, I am sure, every senator in the chamber, that these are matters of very great public interest, that they are serious questions of public policy and that they do deserve the attention of the parliament. Mr Acting Deputy President, because of that, we actually ought to get to the substance of the issue. Let us debate what these bills are all about, by all means.
I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be engaging in any delaying tactics on this package of bills at all. In fact, I proposed to the Manager of Government Business as recently as half an hour ago that we actually try to move this process along by including some other bills, if it is possible, in a cognate debate if that would have the effect of saving time. But I also made the point to the Manager of Government Business that it is possible that the Australian Democrats and other senators—minor party or Independent senators—may have such strong views that that would not be helpful. I acknowledge that. I understand how these things work. If it is not a helpful suggestion—although it certainly sounds helpful in terms of the processes as we all understand them— and if it were to have the unintended consequence of delaying debate, that is not our intention.
We will not be contributing at length to the second reading debate. On this package of bills, we will be minimising the number of opposition speakers. The opposition has made clear its general view in relation to this package of legislation. I accept that it is always difficult to make such a comment and it shows how courageous I am to say that we would not be speaking at length, with Senator Schacht handling the bill!
—That's dead right.
—I know how courageous I am in saying that!
—I'm under no limitation.
—That is not quite right, Senator Schacht.
—Gagged by my own side—all right.
—That is about the size of it, Senator Schacht. The key point here is that there is no filibuster on this as far as the Labor Party is concerned, and we will not engage in it. We believe that it is better to debate the substance of these bills. I acknowledge, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, that not all bills in the government's legislative program before the chamber are priority legislation. We have made a clear point about the nature of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2001, and I hope the government has that on board. There are these migration bills and a number of other bills that have genuine legislative priority, that have clear national importance and that ought to be dealt with as soon as we possibly can, and certainly prior to an election being called. That is the real time constraint here.
Let us acknowledge it: we all know that there is a federal election around the corner. We all know that there is a certain amount of business that needs to be done. It is never what the government asks for—be it a Labor government, a non-Labor government or a `Callithumpian' government. You always put up a wish list—that is the way it goes in this business—but, contained within that ambit claim, there is always legislation that does need to be dealt with. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, this legislation fairly, squarely and clearly fits that bill. It is for that reason that I do not think we will be contributing any further to the question that the bills may proceed without formalities.
I want to make our position clear: we want to get on with the substance of the debate and, in saying that, we understand that there will be difficult views in the chamber. Senators have a right to express those views in the chamber, as they do. The Australian Labor Party has always defended that right when it has been exercised by senators, and I do not think that even our harshest critics would argue that. We have always defended the right of senators to deal with legislation before the Senate on its substance and, wherever possible, we have allowed for a reasonable amount of time to debate key priority legislation. There is no difference here, and I thought it would be worth while, in this circumstance, outlining the approach of the opposition and the import of the unprecedented debate that is occurring on the question that the bills may proceed without formalities.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-20,"—The core of the argument used by Senator Faulkner was that we get to the substance of the issue in the debate on the second reading. The core of the argument that I would put is that we ought to do that from an enlightened point of view. Remember that these bills are just now before the Senate and they were not in evidence to the House of Representatives before this week. It is proper practice in such contentious matters which fundamentally change the law—and I will argue later in the day that they effectively breach international law in a number of ways—that they be taken extremely cautiously and seriously by the Senate.
We have already heard that the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report, which came into this chamber about an hour ago, has put very serious and searching questions to the government about the legislation, but the Senate has had no response from the government. We know that a very important function of the Senate is to adequately review legislation, particularly where it has been more than expeditiously raced through the House of Representatives. If you turn to the current 10th edition of Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, on page 11, under the heading of `Functions of the Senate', you will find the fifth and sixth functions listed:
(5)  To ensure that legislative measures express the considered view of the community and to provide opportunity for contentious legislation to be subject to electoral scrutiny.
(6)  To provide protection against a government, with a disciplined majority in the House of Representatives, introducing extreme measures for which it does not have broad community support.
I would contend that the latter applies in this situation and that the Senate has a very great duty to ensure—I hope you can hear me, Mr Acting Deputy President.
 (Senator Calvert)—It is rather difficult, Senator Brown. There is a lot of talk going on to my left. If people to my left wish to have a conversation, perhaps they need to keep it quiet or go outside the chamber.
—We are dealing here with extreme measures which introduce, for example, mandatory sentencing for the first time under federal law and measures which override all other laws and approaches to the courts not just by asylum seekers but by Australian citizens. Those are extreme measures. But whatever argument other senators might have on that matter, I think there can be no argument that the way this legislation is being fast-forwarded is counter to item No. 5 of Odgers' list of functions of the Senate, which says:
To ensure that legislative measures express the considered view of the community and to provide opportunity for contentious legislation to be subject to electoral scrutiny.
There has been no electoral scrutiny of any substance on these bills. Indeed, there has not been Senate scrutiny, as the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee process highlights. Senator Faulkner said that it is extraordinary and a precedent that Senator Bartlett and I are not in favour of the removal of all impediment—that is, formality—to the bills proceeding forthwith. Let me take you to that part of the standing orders of this place where the procedure of bills into and through the Senate is dealt with. Standing order No. 111, subsection (5), says:
Where a bill ... is first introduced in the Senate ... and a motion is moved for the second reading of the bill, debate on that motion shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the speech of the senator moving the motion and resumption of the debate shall be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in the next period of sittings without any question being put.
It goes on under subsection (6) to say:
Paragraph (5) does not apply to a bill introduced in the Senate or received from the House of Representatives within the first two-thirds of the total number of days of sitting of the Senate scheduled for the first period of sittings after a general election of the House of Representatives, but consideration of such a bill shall not be resumed after the second reading is moved in the Senate unless 14 days have elapsed after the first introduction of the bill in either House.
Senator Faulkner has said that that has ceased to be general practice in this place. But I would remind senators that these standing orders are to ensure that the Senate does deal with legislation in a way which stops railroading of legislation by the government, which may have a majority in the House of Representatives, and which does ensure that the community has an opportunity to have input. Senator Faulkner, and no doubt the government, will acknowledge that these bills are a matter of high public concern—not just interest but great concern. They are front-page news today. If you look at the Australian and see the pictures of the two asylum seeker children staring through the wire in Nauru, you understand that the matters in these bills are important, because they are changing the law to remove not only the rights of those children, as they have stood until now, but the rights of Australians who feel concerned about the rights of those children.
Senator Faulkner referred to standing order No. 112, subsection (4), which deals with the first reading of a bill in this place. It says:
After the first reading, a future day shall be appointed for the second reading of the bill, and the bill shall be printed.
The fundamental intention of the Senate in that standing order is and always has been that there is time for the Senate not only to consider the legislation but also to get public feedback. When you go on to standing order 114, subsection (2), on the second reading, it says:
An amendment may be moved to that question by leaving out `now' and inserting `this day 6 months', which, if carried, shall finally dispose of the bill.
We do not want to dispose of the bills; we want the bills to be properly looked at and we want the Senate to fulfil its obligation to the people of Australia to allow some input.
I point out to the opposition that Senator Faulkner has underscored the basic contradiction in the opposition's support for the government in shoving this legislation through so quickly when he said that the constitutional review bill, which is to do with Liberal Party funding, should be held up so that people have the time to look at it. He indicated that that bill was much less important than this package of legislation and was trying to argue that, therefore, this legislation should be dealt with differently because it is important—to wit, put it through the Senate without proper public input or proper reflection by senators on the gravity of the matter that it contains. That is the opposition arguing against its own position. It is saying, on the one hand, `We've a piece of legislation which is for political advantage and may not be high in the affairs of the nation, although probity of political process is certainly involved. Hold that one up, because it gives our opponents a political advantage or allows our opponents to use parliament in an untoward fashion.' But on the other hand, the opposition's view is different when it comes to important legislation which goes not just to matters of immigration but to fundamental matters of prudence about the way parliament is a check on the executive and the Senate is a check on the House of Representatives and the Senate, as a house of review, has an obligation to allow the Australian public to have input. The opposition says, `Scrap that.'
That is a perverse argument which belies the fact that the opposition, no less than the government, wants to railroad this extremely important legislation through the Senate for political purposes to get it off the agenda in the run-up to the election. The opposition feels wounded by the government's handling of this matter. I say to the opposition: the problem is that you did not take the contrary point of view right from the outset. The first day when the Tampa picked up the refugees off our northern coast, the opposition should have stuck to the time-honoured principle which says, `Give those people a fair go.' The government was not going to; the Prime Minister was not going to. The opposition should have taken a lead there, and had it taken a lead the outcome would be very different now in terms of public regard for the way the opposition has handled the matter. It has taken the worst of all paths and that is as far as possible, with one exception, to support the Prime Minister in going the wrong way, in a heavy-handed way— which we now have to deal with in the Senate—ending up with an abuse of law and an abuse of a time-honoured practice in this nation of ours. What we are being asked to do today is to push through legislation which has not yet had community review and proper public review. 
Later this morning I will be moving that these matters be put to a committee and the indications are that again the opposition is going to oppose that. How can the opposition justify that tactic? How can the opposition—like the government—say: `We oppose the public having an input into this debate. We want this debated even before we know what the ramifications of this legislation, as requested by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on which we have members, are. Even before we get government answers to these fundamentally important questions which the three bills raise, we want to debate and dispose of this matter'? It is as if it is taking orders directly from the executive suite, from Mr Howard's office. Of course it is not, but what it is trying to do is shadow Mr Howard so closely that people will not perceive a difference and believe that the public out there is going to say, `Oh well, that's that matter; we don't have to think about that when we are going to the ballot box.' Wrong move. 
The public expects an opposition to be positive in the interests of the nation. If positive opposition here does not involve standing in support of basic civil liberties, rights and laws that are fundamental to the Australian precept of a `fair go', it should at least insist that the Senate not be used as a rubber stamp for legislation on the run, as Mr Beazley called it, coming from the Prime Minister's office in the run-up to an election.
I acquaint the committee with the early alarm that there is in legal circles in this country about this legislation and the way it is being handled by reading a media release of the last 24 hours from the Law Council, which is opposed to this legislation. The media release says:
The Law Council of Australia says that it opposes the combined effect of the legislative package of six Bills introduced into Parliament yesterday.
It is referring to other bills which I understand from Senator Faulkner the opposition would like to see rolled into this process. It continues:
“Fundamentally, these Bills substantially cut the rights of asylum seekers to have access to our legal system to establish a claim as a refugee”, says Law Council President, Anne Trimmer. “Australia voluntarily accepted this obligation when it ratified the Refugee Convention and made it part of our law. Any person within the territory of Australia, whether an unauthorised arrival or not, must have a right of access to the courts, in particular to have decisions of government officials which affect their rights reviewed by the courts”.
“Some of the Bills relate to matters which are already covered by Bills that have previously been introduced and not passed, and are rightly languishing because they could not command support. These include the Bill to block judicial review, and the Bill to block `class actions' by asylum seekers”.
“Labor has previously strongly opposed these initiatives. Why is there now bipartisan support for such draconian measures?” asks Ms Trimmer. 
The Law Council goes on to say:
In the last three years, the Federal Government has been advocating strong measures to address the boatloads of unauthorised arrivals, by seeking to limit these people's access to the legal system. These initiatives deny people affected by an adverse decision by a Federal Government bureaucrat the right to have that decision independently reviewed by [the] court. The Labor Party has consistently opposed these initiatives.
The Law Council believes that the proposed restrictions on access to judicial review are not necessary or consistent with the basic principles of fairness. Rights of judicial review for this category of decision are already very restricted. Previous legislation designed to restrict the use of judicial review has not succeeded in reducing the number of applications for judicial review by the courts. Similar problems exist in the legislation attempting to restrict the use of class actions.
The Border Protection Bill seeks to effectively exclude parts of Australian territory from the operation of Australian law, because the Bill prevents people who have landed in certain parts of Australia from accessing Australian law. Australia is a signatory to the Refugee Convention, and has undertaken to give effect to the obligations contained in the Convention.  “It is contrary to the spirit of the Convention, and the operation of our legal system, that the legal rights of refugees are restricted or removed in certain parts of Australia”.
There is more to that press release. I have another one from the President of the Australian Council of Civil Liberties, Mr Terry O'Gorman, expressing great concern and attacking the mandatory sentencing components in these bills, which were introduced into the federal parliament just two days ago, relating to changes in the Migration Act.
The opposition is on a real test here, being part of the process of railroading legislation that is important and fundamental to Australia's precept of civil liberties. The rights of individuals both Australian and non-Australian within our territories are at stake. If the government has not changed position on this legislation, philosophically Labor has. I counsel Labor to reflect upon that and, even if it does not, to do the right thing by exposing itself to the concerns of its own constituency in this matter. We should proceed with probity. We should proceed with the fundamental delay that is required to allow feedback to be heard. Therefore, I oppose the motion.
 (Senator Calvert)—The question is that these bills may proceed without formalities.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-20,"—The question that the Senate now is considering is whether the three migration bills be taken together. I will not debate the bills; I will simply debate the substance of the motion before us, as detailed under standing order 113(2). I will not be seeking to call a division on this. We do not want to unreasonably hold up the proceedings of the Senate, but we do want to draw attention to the questions that are being put before us and the issues and the importance of this process that we are going through. Given the unseemly—one might say, obscene—haste involved in this, I think it is necessary that as much opportunity as possible is given to the public, the media and those interested in these issues to be aware of not just the detail of the bills but the process that we are going through in relation to them.
The effect of the motion that has been moved by Senator Ian Campbell is to allow the questions for any of the several stages of the consideration and passage of the bills to be put together in one motion. It would allow consideration of the bills to occur together in the committee of the whole and for the reading of the short titles only on every order for the reading of the bills. I do not have a problem with the reading of the short titles only on every order for the reading of the bills—I can live with that—but, again, taking the bills together goes to a procedural issue. Again, it is a machinery motion, but machinery motions have practical consequences.
One of the practical consequences is that this will again potentially limit the opportunity for consideration of these bills because, even though these bills come as a package of measures, taken individually each bill is separate and distinct—particularly the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001. You could argue that the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001 and the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 are linked—and in that sense I could probably support these being dealt with together—but the border protection bill is clearly a distinct bill. There are distinct concerns raised about it. Indeed, it is specific and generic to court proceedings that may well still be current. I have seen reports that an appeal in the case dealing with the activities of the government in regard to the Tampa is still being considered and may well proceed to the High Court. So that is quite feasibly still before the courts or still part of court proceedings. The border protection bill goes to the very heart of that proceeding.
I think it is therefore important that the border protection bill be dealt with separately. There are very distinct and specific questions in relation to it and, indeed, about the order of priority for the package of bills. The Democrats believe that in regard to this bill, which basically seeks to overturn the proceedings that are currently before the courts and retrospectively validate any illegal action, we should see what the court proceedings produce. Unfortunately, the migration area has a sad history in our country. A lack of attention to proper legal principles and processes and an overturning of basic legal rights and civil rights are probably more prevalent in the migration area in our legislative history than in any other area, and that goes right back to 1901 and the introduction of the White Australia policy. We have seen 100 years of a range of quite shameful actions by the Australian parliament in the overturning and undermining of basic rights in the migration area. The border protection bill is another development in that sad history.
There was a bill—I cannot recall the name of it—passed by the larger parties in this place some time back that again sought to retrospectively overturn and invalidate a decision of the High Court in the migration area. I am fairly sure that related to a refugee matter—certainly, it was a migration matter. Again, I think that shows the dangers involved. I talked before, in the debate on the previous motion, about the fundamental underpinning of our system of government: the separation of powers. I think we have done some dangerous actions in the past in reducing the roles of the courts that are enshrined in our Constitution and the protection that they provide for Australian citizens as well as others.
The border protection bill is another bill that engages in that dangerous practice. It seeks to retrospectively validate actions which may well have been illegal and on which court proceedings are currently under way. The Democrats believe that bill should be considered separately. It should not just be squashed in together with other bills that deal with excising Christmas Island and other territories from our migration zone. It is a separate bill, with separate and very distinct characteristics and components. It has, as with the other two bills, been introduced only very recently, with absolutely no public consultation, and there has been virtually no opportunity for public consideration since these bills have been introduced. To try and rush all these bills through together simply reduces further the opportunity for consideration of the important matters that are contained in the bill.
As I stated before, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, through the Alert Digest, highlighted significant concerns about each of these three bills—separate concerns distinct to each bill, which of course we have not got any response to yet—not concerns about the package as a whole, with one bunch of questions. Senator Brown will move a motion, which we will consider later on, about referring these three bills to a committee. Again, as I indicated on the previous motion, if there were support from the opposition for even a brief consideration of these three bills by the public in a Senate committee, we would be less concerned about this motion that the bills be taken together.
But, given the obscene haste in relation to these bills in a matter as fundamental and crucial as those dealt with in these separate bills, allowing a machinery motion to go through that would expedite passage of these bills without the opportunity for complete consideration is something that we, the Democrats, would be concerned about. There are significant concerns and they should be properly examined. If a committee had the opportunity to do that, then at least there may be some recognition of the validity of the bills being taken together.
I do not know if it is unprecedented to try and oppose bills being taken together. I would think that bills probably have been separated before where it is appropriate. Perhaps it is not common, but this is not common legislation, these are not common times and the sorts of things being attempted in these bills are not common. Extreme circumstances require extreme vigilance on the part of the Senate, particularly in an atmosphere of concern, uncertainty and apprehension. This is precisely the time when bodies such as the Senate should take a calm, considered view of legislation and should not just allow itself to be caught up in the torrent of fevered apprehension, some of which has been quite deliberately whipped up and exacerbated by this government in relation to these issues. It is a crucial issue and that is why we believe that these bills should not be taken together.
I add a further point that is not just in relation to legal principles and process: let us not forget that these bills deal with life and death issues. That might sound dramatic, but it is absolutely the case. These are life and death issues. You cannot get a more serious issue than that and there cannot be a more serious responsibility for a body like the Senate than dealing with life and death issues. They are much more important, I would argue, than even all those niceties about civil liberties, legal rights, the underpinnings of our rule of law and fabric of the Constitution—although they are all pretty important too! Life and death stuff, I think, is pretty significant: we have had a lot of death that people have had to deal with in recent times and it is not much fun. It is very disturbing for people. Plenty more of that could potentially occur and we, in relation to issues like this, should make sure that we absolutely uphold our responsibility to examine those things properly in a calm and considered way—and it is sometimes hard to stay calm when you are dealing with life and death issues—and that is something that would best be met by considering these bills separately. That is why we oppose this motion.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-20,"—I agree with what Senator Bartlett has said. These bills are quite separate bills, although that has never featured as an argument for opposing a formal motion that bills be taken together. Bills have been taken together over the many years that I have been in this place and, as you know, you have had bills that have been quite distinct in their objectives that have been taken together without much fuss. The chamber will realise that the reason that there is some fuss about it at this time is to ensure that we have a proper opportunity to consider the measures in the legislation that has come before us. All I am doing is appealing both to the government and the opposition to just give us a bit of time. In the end, I may not change how I think about the matters at the present moment, but there are issues which I would like to canvass with a range of contacts that I have got in this particular area. 
It is quite significant, as has been said by Senator Bartlett, that the Alert Digest has alerted us to certain key situations, particularly about the border protection legislation. I have only just got the Alert Digest in my hands. I will not repeat what has been said about it: I presume Senator Bartlett has pointed out what is in here in support of his argument.
I am going to vote against the motion that they be taken together. You can do that objectively because, as Senator Bartlett has pointed out, they are distinct pieces of legislation with different objectives. I am going to vote against this type of proposition for the first time in the 26 years I have been here, and I will do so just as an appeal to give us a bit of time. Give us until next week to have a look at the ramifications of these bills. That is why I am opposing what would normally be a formal proposition.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-20,"—I hear what Senator Harradine has just had to say. I am motivated similarly to appeal through this procedure, to the opposition in particular, for time to be allowed for these hugely important matters to be discussed. As Senator Bartlett said, and I cannot run them off as well as he did, not only matters of jurisprudence and civil liberties and suchlike but matters of life and death are being considered in this migration legislation. It gives power to the Australian government, and therefore involves the assent of the Australian people, to deal with people in desperate situations and determine the outcome that will occur there. 
I read somewhere in the last couple of days that many people could be given cause to think again about the government's approach to asylum seekers when one of those boats founders and bodies start washing up on the shore. I hope we do not have to come to that point to reconsider the direction in which the government is going. It is proper that we take time to think through the very important ramifications of these three bills, which ought to be taken separately. Certainly, if not all three bills are taken separately then the first and the second bills ought to be dealt with separately because they are about quite different matters. I will come to that in a moment. I want to complete quoting the pertinent comments coming from the Law Council of Australia on the matter. Their media release quotes the President of the Law Council, Anne Trimmer, as saying yesterday: 
 ... the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in the Tampa case raised many complex issues about the power of the Federal Government to act in the manner that it did, and the operation of the Migration Act in such cases. The decision should be studied carefully before any legislation addressing this issue is enacted. 
We cannot say that we have studied the issue carefully. It is patently obvious that the Senate has not carefully studied the issue simply because the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which has put questions to the government on this matter, has not been able to get a response and the Senate does not have that response. Ms Trimmer said: 
The Law Council does not pretend that there is an easy answer to resolve the problem of unauthorised boat arrivals. The political handling of the Tampa crisis sent a very mixed message to the international community. The legislative package—
that is, the one we are dealing with today—
will only serve to compound perceptions that Australia is ignoring the basic human rights of asylum seekers and its international obligations in relation to such people. 
The media release went on to say: 
Several commentators in the last few days have correctly identified that Australia's policy towards asylum seekers should not be another casualty of the terrible tragedy in the United States last week. 
The media release quotes former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser in the Sydney Morning Herald of two days ago: 
If we want the boat people to go away, we have to go to the source of the problem and persuade other countries that we should all act more effectively and more humanely. 
Ms Trimmer concluded with these words: 
Short-term political considerations should not be the driving force for the policy of either of the major parties—
she could well include all parties, Independents and others—
when you are dealing with the lives and safety of people fleeing from desperate situations. 
Finally, the media release states: 
The Law Council urges both major parties to rethink these policies which will—
in the council's view—
undermine Australia's accessible and fair legal system. 
They are very sobering comments, and the opposition should heed them. I do not think any of us are going to say that the awesome tragedy in the United States, the heinous terrorist attack on the United States of just eight or nine days ago, is a totally overriding matter which is, quite rightly, diverting public attention from other matters being dealt with by the parliament. I am intrigued by the fact that there has been so little debate in this place about the terrorist actions in the United States. I asked a question about the matter on Tuesday. I am not sure if other questions have been asked or other motions put; certainly legislation has not come before us in this huge public debate. The parliament—including the opposition— has been galvanised by other important matters like the Ansett collapse, but I would ask it to be as judicious and as thorough in not just looking for solutions but in analysing the government's propositions in this matter as it has been in that matter. 
These three bills are different. If you go to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, a multiparty committee of the Senate which has met in response to these bills and given its report to the Senate just two hours ago, it says that the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001:
... proposes to validate certain actions taken into relation to vessels carrying persons reasonably believed to be intending to enter Australia unlawfully. These provisions: 
·	apply to any action taken by the Commonwealth or others in relation to particular vessels in the period commencing on 27 August 2001 and ending on the day on which the bill commences—
that is, is enacted. Secondly, the provisions of the bill: 
·	specify that any such action was lawful when it occurred—
that is retrospective, making anything that may have happened in dealing with the asylum seekers illegal. Thirdly, these provisions: 
·	provide that no proceedings against the Commonwealth or others may be instituted or continued in any court in respect of these actions.
There is one exception, and that is High Court action against improper use of authority by a Commonwealth officer. That matter is brought into this legislation only because senators, including me, drew attention to the fact that the Border Protection Bill 2001, which was rushed into this place three weeks ago, attempted to be unconstitutional in that it tried to override people's access to the High Court. That is one of the glitches that has been picked up in the current legislation. Notwithstanding that, I draw the attention of senators to the fact that news overnight reported that an appeal to the High Court is being contemplated on the Federal Court full bench decision.
—It's not going to happen.
—The injudicious senator opposite says, `It's not going to happen.' I do not know what news he has that I do not, but Senator McGauran is indicating—if I read that interjection correctly—that one of the aims of the government, in rushing this legislation through the Senate, is to thwart High Court action. If that is the case, it should alarm opposition senators and government senators alike, because that is not a proper use of the parliament.
—We make the laws.
—Senator McGauran says, `We make the laws,' and my response to that is that we also should abide by the laws. In this legislation, as the Senate committee pointed out, there is a move to make lawful any breach of the law that has occurred in the last month in dealing with asylum seekers. Senator McGauran may interject that, `We make the laws,' but I put it to him, his minister and his Prime Minister that we abide by the laws, too, or we take the consequences. You do not come in here with retrospective legislation to say, `If we have acted illegally, we will simply make it okay.' Tell that to the average citizen out there in relation to whatever matter in which they may have been netted by the law, and ask them what they think of politicians who bring in retrospective legislation to cover their own tracks when it comes to potential breaches of the law. I ask the government—and I will be pursuing this very vigorously in this debate—what are the breaches that the government is concerned about? What advice has it had? It can tell me in general terms that it has been in breach of the law in dealing with the Tampa asylum seekers, because prima facie that has happened and that is why this retrospective legislation is here.
The Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001, the second bill at hand, is very different. Its intention is to excise Christmas Island, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from Australia in terms of the application of the Migration Act, and there are regulations to allow that process to continue. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs may remove any other prescribed external territory and may also remove any prescribed island that forms part of a state or territory—and there we have the real problem, that Tasmania comes within that definition. I am not, as a Tasmanian senator, ever going to support a piece of legislation that treats our state differently from all the other states.
The government and even the opposition might argue that no minister is going to regulate to remove Tasmania from the conditions or the law of immigration in this country. If that is the case, we should not leave that potential there. This is a Henry VIII law which potentially enables a minister to regulate to excise further parts of Australia's territory for the purposes of the Migration Act—and, under regulation, those laws could stand for months before parliament had an opportunity to overturn them. I do not believe we should be giving the minister those powers. This bill to excise parts of Australia from the migration zone is very different to the Border Protection Bill 2001. The third bill, the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001, is consequent upon the previous one. It provides powers for the Commonwealth to deal with people who find themselves washed up, floating into or in some way or other in an excised offshore place, such as Christmas Island or the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.
It is an unusual move—and it may be unprecedented—to want to have these bills dealt with separately. But the consequences of these separate and different pieces of legislation are huge, so they should be dealt with not only separately but also very carefully and with time allowed for better public scrutiny and input to the Senate. I believe this chamber will be failing in its constitutional role as a house of review if it does not allow at least some days for public input on these important pieces of legislation. 
These are rough, turbulent and fearful times for our nation; all the more important that the Senate scrutinise government legislation which aims to change long held values, remove rights and circumscribe civil liberties with regard not only to asylum seekers but also to Australians who find themselves, one way or another, involved with asylum seekers who are seeking to come in by an unlawful manner, because of their desperation in fleeing from circumstances which most Australians, I might say, could scarcely conceive of. I support the move to have these bills dealt with separately.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I will speak very briefly on behalf of the opposition on this matter that has been raised by Senator Bartlett, Senator Harradine and Senator Brown. The opposition does not support their proposal that the bills be taken separately. I particularly noted Senator Harradine's remarks that he cannot remember taking this position in his 25 years in this place. The opposition's view is very simple. We cannot imagine that, under the Senate procedures—even by putting these bills together—there will be any limit on any senator to debate these matters, to move amendments in the committee stage, to speak as long as they like—often to the frustration of others, particularly managers of government business who do not want people to speak that often—
—They can vote on them separately, as well.
—They can vote on them separately. We cannot see that there is any limitation on any Senator who wants to express a view, move amendments—
—Senator Brown, they are all related in the immigration area. They are all related to matters that have been of considerable public interest in Australia over recent weeks. I would have thought that all senators would have a very clear view of the principle issues, the moral issues, the practical issues and the logistic issues relating to this package of bills that is before us. I therefore believe that the concerns of the senators who want to separate them are not warranted in this case. I would be very surprised if, by the time we finish the debate on these bills at the third reading, they have not had plenty of opportunity to express in every way they like their concerns, their opposition and their amendments to aspects of these individual bills. And I agree, on this occasion, with the Manager of Government Business that he can arrange to have separate votes taken on the different bills in the package.
 (Senator Hogg)—The question is that the bills may be taken together.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read a first time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EXCISION FROM MIGRATION ZONE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-20,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 22 October 2001:
All aspects of the provisions of the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001, and the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001.
I alter that reporting date to Wednesday, 26 September 2001. I do that because there would be an argument from the government, if not from the opposition, that leaving the reporting date to 22 October would make it unlikely, with an election coming down the line and next week being generally agreed as the last week of sitting of the Senate, that the committee report would come back to the Senate. 
I am appealing to the Labor Party to do the right thing by the people of Australia and particularly its own constituents. It knows, as well as all the rest of us do, that whatever supporters of the government might think, there are a huge number of opposition supporters who want to have this legislation properly dealt with, and that means properly scrutinised. I have already spoken about the Law Council of Australia and the Council for Civil Liberties being seriously alarmed, opposing this legislation at the outset and drawing attention to very serious shortcomings of the bills at hand. It goes to matters of huge importance—not only the way we deal with immigrants but the way we perceive ourselves as a nation, upholding fundamental civil liberties and human rights, not least access to the courts.
I have to look at the politics of this and I have to appeal to the opposition to take a second view of what it is doing. Is the opposition really going to support Prime Minister John Howard in railroading this legislation through the Senate without an opportunity for the people of Australia to have a look at it and comment—not least the experts in this country who deal with matters of immigration, law, human rights, and our obligations under a range of international treaties dealing with the handling of refugees and with human rights? 
As I understand it, it is a fundamental of Labor Party philosophy, if not policy, that human rights be protected and not be summarily passed away by the railroading of legislation through the parliament. I believe that, whatever else it may think about the Senate, it accepts that this is a house of review where the excesses of an executive government in the House of Representatives can be—if not stopped— slowed down, so the public has an opportunity to have a look at what we are dealing with. If the opposition does not support this move to enable the public to give us input before we finally deal with this legislation, it is falling into line with the Howard government philosophy and cutting the people of Australia out from this debate. It cannot do that; it should not do that; it must not do that. In the run-up to an election—where it is a concern that Prime Minister Howard is motivated not only by the idea of improving his stocks in the public domain but also by seeing the polls go that way and, worst of all, by the overshadowing awful tragedy in the United States—we cannot allow to slip through this place legislation which is going to affect immigrants, illegal or otherwise, to this country and Australian citizens' rights for a long, long time to come. 
For the first time in federal law, mandatory sentencing appears. It raises its ugly head in this legislation. Once you allow it in your dealings with one group of people— Australians or otherwise—where do you draw the line? I ask the opposition: where do you draw the line on mandatory sentencing? I have been proud to be associated with you— 
—We won an election in the Northern Territory; we are going to repeal it in the Northern Territory. We have stated very clearly what our view on that is.
—You are going to keep it in Western Australia. 
—Federally, we have stated what our position is. 
—Don't misrepresent us; you could provoke a blue here. 
 (Senator Hogg)—Order! Senator Brown, return to your comments.
—Give due where due is—
—Senator Schacht, you can get up and have a say in the debate later if you like, but let Senator Brown continue. 
—Senator Schacht says that the Labor Party is removing mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory. 
—We have won an election on it; we just got into office. 
—And that it won an election on it. So how contrary to that good action is the Labor Party in supporting the introduction of mandatory sentencing into federal law here today and, what is more, supporting it in a way which does not allow the public to have input, which does not allow itself to be informed about the danger of such legislation? 
—That string to your bow is about 10 miles long—to put those two together, Senator Brown. 
—Senator Schacht will be able to get up and try to defend the indefensible here. The point is: here is the Labor Party supporting mandatory sentencing. It is my understanding that people we might think are very good citizens of this nation can be caught up in this mandatory sentencing net. I want to talk about this further in the debate on the second reading of the bill, but let me just refer to it at the moment. The bill provides for mandatory sentencing of five years or eight years for citizens of Australia or other people who are involved in bringing groups of five or more `illegal' immigrants—that is, asylum seekers—into the country in the future. As I understand it, had that law applied when the East Timorese were illegally in this country—after they had been told to go—during the occupation of their country by Indonesia, and the nuns and others from the Catholic Church and others in the churches were giving those people refuge, it is not drawing too long a bow to say that they may have been subject to this mandatory sentencing provision. The Labor Party ought to look very carefully at that. I want to see what the Labor Party's legal advice on this matter is, because this is alarming stuff. As I said, I will come to it later. This legislation also overrules all other laws of the country. 
—Senator Brown, could I interrupt you for a moment. I have just had drawn to my attention, and it should be drawn to your attention, that the motion as printed in the Notice Paper today is not correct in the sense that the words `Legislation Committee' should be `References Committee'. The original motion that you foreshadowed was to a references committee, and there has been an error in the printing of the motion. I just want to draw that to your attention, because it may be germane to the comments that you are going to make in the debate.
—I thank you for that advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I have a point for clarification. I notice that you are now referring to the point in Senator Brown's motion which states: 
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee...
—That should read `References Committee'. 
—Is that what Senator Brown originally moved?
—That is correct. That is what Senator Brown originally moved. That is why I am drawing it to Senator Brown's attention now.
—I thank you for that. I will check on that matter. Let me be very clear about this, Mr Acting Deputy President. The important thing is that this matter be referred to a committee so that we can get from that committee the public's input on this matter. 
I was referring to the fact that, beyond mandatory sentencing, this legislation also overrules other laws of the country. This package of legislation removes the right of citizens to have access to the courts of this country. I reiterate that all this is happening in a background of a potential appeal to the High Court, consequent on the ruling of the Full Bench of the Federal Court in the Tampa issue. Therefore, it has very serious ramifications as far as the time-honoured tradition of upholding people's basic rights to appeal to courts is concerned in this country. Members of the opposition in particular should think about that. 
Think about the effort of the government last week to even overrule access to the High Court. If it were not for the Senate that effort to overrule the High Court, which I think would have failed because it was unconstitutional, would have gone through this place. The Labor Party is now taking part in a similar process of railroading through this place legislation with enormous consequences as far as legal and human rights in this country are concerned. We go now to the business of excision of parts of the country, dividing the country up for the application of law differently in one place to another. Where does that end? This is the start of a process which is open-ended. It is even open-ended in this legislation as it allows the minister by statute to draw the line differently, to include other external territories and, indeed, all other islands that are part of states or territories, including my home state of Tasmania.
One would agree that it is unlikely to occur, but that potential should never be allowed under legislation which treats all states equally. I will be moving to amend that provision when we get to debate the bill. It should not even be countenanced, not least in the Senate, which was under the Constitution established to look after the interests of the states against the excesses of the House of Representatives, which these days means the excesses of the Prime Minister's office. It is shoddy, fast-track legislation. 
Mr Beazley has been maintaining all the way down the line that the government should not make legislation on the run and now we have him and the opposition running with the government. The important thing here is that we take a few days to allow the Australian people to have their say too. Is that going to be so harmful to the opposition? What is the argument that the opposition puts that this should not go to a committee?
—If you sit down we will tell you.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, you will know that Senator Carr is disorderly in interjecting, but he compounds the infraction of the standing orders of this place by interjecting while standing between his seat and you.
—You have succeeded in putting Senator Carr back in his place.
—Thank you, and I will not charge him a cent. It is very important that the opposition explains the contradiction between this situation and its insistence that the Liberal Party's effort to get legislation to ensure that public funding goes to its head office and not to its party offices, in the wake of the next election, goes to a Senate committee so people can feed in their views before we deal with that piece of legislation. Indeed, the opposition agrees that the regional forest agreements around the country are important enough—and it has dealt with this legislation before—for the public to have at least a few days input before debate on that bill takes place next week. 
When it comes to this migration legislation, which has always been an important matter for the opposition, it suddenly says there will be no committee and no public input and it does not believe in anything other than the Howard government's prescription for putting this through the Senate. That is not only a contradiction but also a failure on the part of the Labor Party to uphold its own principles, its logic and its past avocation for the defence of human rights and, in particular, the defence of the have-nots, the people who do not have the privilege of easy access to the courts and rights but who, nevertheless, find themselves within our borders. It is a pretty shoddy exercise. It is all the more shoddy that the opposition should be acquiescing to Mr Howard's prescription in dealing with it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I do not intend to take too much of the Senate's time in debating Senator Brown's motion to refer this legislation to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am pleased, Senator Brown, that you did give that clarification as to which committee it is going to go to because it is important which hat I wear in joining this debate. It is a matter of whether I am chair of the references committee or deputy chair of the legislation committee. But, whichever hat I would be wearing, Senator Brown has not seen fit, since he put his motion in the chamber yesterday, to enter into any form of consultation or negotiations with me as chair or even as deputy chair of the committees. That is a breach of the normal practice and stands in stark contrast to what Senator Bartlett did during the last sittings when the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and was subject to some debate in this place. There was consultation all the way around, but regrettably Senator Brown has not seen fit to engage in that consultation.
Senator Brown, in putting forward a motion and not consulting, has put me as an individual in somewhat of a difficult position because, were I to acquiesce to and go along with the proposition that Senator Brown is putting forward, I would have to breach every understanding that we have had in the period of time that I have been chair of that committee. I agree with all the propositions of contacting the public and having the public come along to a Senate committee and inform the committee—and, through the committee, the parliament—about their concerns over or support for particular pieces of legislation. In order to facilitate the public doing that, we advertise in our national newspapers for people to come along and give their views. Where we identify particular individuals or organisations, we also make contact with them for them to come along so we can ask them to give their particular views.
With the last bill that I referred to, which Senator Bartlett moved be referred to the committee, we were able to make informal arrangements. Even prior to the Senate passing the reference to the committee, we were able to make informal arrangements for advertising to take place. Were we to advertise in the national media on this particular set of bills, which are important bills, we would have had to have put the advertisement into the newspapers through the agency yesterday. If there were consultation, that might have been able to have been done, but regrettably there is absolutely no way in the world that it can be done now, at midday on Thursday, for the weekend's newspapers.
—What humbug.
—Well, it is an actual fact, and we were able to facilitate that other matter. Senator Bartlett is sitting very close to us, and I think Senator Bartlett will agree that the advertisement did appear and that the public have made submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the refugee determination bill. Tomorrow we will be having a public hearing on that piece of legislation here in the national capital, Canberra. We were able to do that through the processes of consultation. Senator Brown, if you do not want to engage in those processes, that is your decision, but it is your humbug, Senator Brown. It is your humbug that causes that not to happen.
The other thing that needs to be considered by the Senate in regard to this particular reference is: how does the public get to the hearing of the parliamentary committee and the committee get time to deliberate on the evidence taken, write up the report and present that report by Tuesday of next week? I do not know if any other colleagues are having the same difficulties as some others that I know in making travel arrangements at this particular point in time with only one of the major airlines of this country flying. It would be very, very difficult to move around this country at this moment in time, even if we were able to.
When will the committee have time to do the hearing? We cannot do it tomorrow because we are already engaged. On the instructions of the Senate, we already have a hearing on another very important bill, a bill so important that the person who was concerned about the content of the bill actually engaged in a consultation process with those of us that are also engaged in the committee, and we were able to facilitate that and support it. But, no, Senator Brown wants to do his own thing and go charging off on a steed to make a name for himself.
Well, Senator Brown, you are entitled to do that and you are doing that, but obviously you are not going to get your proposition up—but they are the breaks that you engage in, Senator Brown, entirely different from your actions in relation to the other inquiry that is before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I refer to your contact with me in Burkina Faso just last week, I think it was or it may have been possibly the week before, and how circumstances have changed. You made contact with my office and made contact with me in the west of the continent of Africa, in Burkina Faso, to make alternative arrangements about a bill and a subject matter that was very dear to your heart. You were very able to do that while I was thousands and thousands of miles away, but while I sit four seats from you, you are not even able to come across—and we did talk about the other matter yesterday. If you fail on this particular occasion, Senator Brown, I think the first thing you should do is a bit of self-analysis of your own efforts in this. If you really wanted the bill to come through, you, the mover of the motion, would have at least engaged in some degree of consultation on it.
—What a comment for a chairman this is. This is disgraceful. It is just humbug.
—The only thing disgraceful in this, Senator Brown, is you; you have been the disgrace. But you have achieved your aim—you have made a name for yourself, but it is not a very good name, Senator Brown; it is not a very good argument at all.
Let me put one quick matter in regard to the bills. The bills, as I indicated and will be saying when we get into the second reading debate, are very important bills and are dramatically different from the bill we debated here three weeks ago. I have gone into the content of the legislation. One of the really important differences with the main bill is that we have actually seen it before it reached the chamber, whereas on the previous occasion we did not even see the bill prior to its entering the chamber. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party, the opposition party in this place, did not get a chance to look at the bill prior to it being introduced in the House of Representatives. Indeed, members of the government parties did not even get to see it.
When that bill was defeated in this place, we offered at the time to look at it and to work with the government on this very important matter of border control in this country. We offered to work with them on this occasion. On this occasion we have been given the opportunity to work with the government on it, and the government will see—by the introduction of this bill and what happened in the House of Representatives yesterday, where all the bills passed the House of Representatives with the support of the opposition—that legislation can be brought into this place and can be passed if it is good legislation. If it is bad legislation, we will oppose it, we will block it and we will not allow it to pass. We proved that some weeks ago, and we paid dearly, one would suggest, in the polls for that action.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-20,"—I take this opportunity to do something that I probably should have done the last time I was on my feet, when I incorporated, with the leave of the Senate, the second reading speeches in relation to the migration package of bills. I referred then to some documents that I would table in relation to the bills and particularly to a background paper on the unauthorised arrivals strategy which encompasses a range of information about the government's strategy in relation to unauthorised arrivals. It goes into some detail about the history of this challenge for Australia and the way that this government and previous governments have handled the problem. It also goes into some significant and interesting information about the size of the problem. I commend all who are interested in the problem to look at the tables at the back of the document which go into the size of the problem and the number of people who are actually arriving illegally as boat people, as they have become known. It shows the remarkably massive increase over the last couple of months.
—Under your regime, you have almost lost control of it.
—What are you doing? You are the government.
—I guess you could make the political point that it is our fault that the Afghans are coming through Malaysia and Indonesia! I guess that someone who wanted to make a cheap political point would try to blame someone else and say that the reason that all the Afghans and others are leaving those regimes is the fault of John Howard. And if your dog has fleas, you could blame him for that as well. One of the tables makes the point that 1,212 people, which is a remarkably high number, arrived in August. Without any further ado, I table that document.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-20,"—I wish to speak to Senator Brown's motion to refer the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001 to a Senate committee for examination. I have spoken already today on this matter to a small degree, as people may have heard, and I will not repeat some of those points. This is a specific motion and I will speak specifically to it. It deals with one of the fundamental roles and responsibilities of the Senate, which is to ensure that legislation put forward by the executive is considered properly—put very bluntly: that we know what the hell we are doing when we vote on the thing. Quite frankly, there is no doubt that, if these bills were voted on without consideration, lots of senators would not actually know what the hell they were doing and what we were really letting ourselves in for, let alone what we were letting asylum seekers in for, if we passed these bills.
I think the ramifications and consequences in a whole range of areas are things that not only the public but many in this chamber are not aware of. Surely, in our role as a parliament, as a Senate and as a legislature we have the responsibility to be aware of what it is we are inflicting on the Australian public and, indeed, on the world. These bills will not only deal with, and have an impact on, the domestic level; they will obviously have an impact internationally on people who are seeking protection from persecution. They may be put at greater risk of not getting that protection. I believe the bills will have international significance in the future direction of the ongoing debate about how to deal with the problem of asylum seekers, displaced people and refugees. As I and many others have said a number of times, it is a global problem; it is not just an Australian problem. Indeed, our exposure to it is a lot less than for many other countries. It is a debate that is flourishing and ongoing, not just in Australia but in many parts of the world. It is a debate that is probably going to intensify if the conflict eventuates that is likely to occur as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
I hope that the international cooperation that is unfolding in relation to a response to that terrorist attack includes international consideration of and cooperation on what to do about the consequences for those who are victims of any conflict—the consequences for not only future refugees but the existing ones. Clearly, the global community has failed to address that issue effectively. That is why people are seeking protection as unauthorised arrivals, rather than going through the UN system. The UN system, whilst it tries its best, is dramatically flawed, and many people cannot access protection and there is not much likelihood of gaining protection. With that system not working, it is no surprise that people pursue other avenues to get protection and safety. We need to be working cooperatively internationally to ensure that there is a better system or that that system improves dramatically. Otherwise, regardless of what laws we put in place here, the issue of people arriving here illegally will continue. It is a problem being generated by the persecution of people not only in Afghanistan but in many places around the world and by an inadequate international system for providing assistance to those people.
There is no perfect or easy solution, but this, as sure as hell, is not a solution. In terms of international ramifications, the concern I have is that Australia is looked to in relation to these issues. Many people have commented on our history in relation to refugees. We used to have a proud history that was influential in a global sense, in getting at least some improvement. The situation, such as it is at the moment, is due in no small part to the work that Australia and other nations have done in making that operate. Now that we are sending out these strong messages that we have changed our approach, both through our actions and legislation here and through direct commentary and contact with other governments, the way we are now going to deal with it is to try to stop people accessing protection. We have seen that already in the last few weeks and we see it in these bills.
It would not be unreasonable for other countries that bear a much greater burden than we do to look to Australia's lead and say, `Australia is obviously willing to trash the refugee convention through its legislation and is basically seeking to prevent people from accessing protection; we'll do the same thing.' Do you think that will solve our problem? No, it will make it worse. I think the international aspect is one that has not really been given much attention, not surprisingly, because of the immediacy of the situation and the impact on people arriving here. But I think it is also very dangerous in that international sense. That is just one issue that we will not be able to properly examine unless we get this put to a committee and are given advice and input—not just from people who work here in Australia with asylum seekers. I believe that, when you are dealing with legislation that goes right to the heart of some crucial international conventions, the opposition is quite right to be critical—and, along with others, it has been incredibly critical of this government's disgraceful undermining of international obligations in the human rights area. This legislation goes to the heart of some of those international issues on an international problem, and yet we are not going to have the opportunity to get a proper insight—nor any sort of insight—into what the likely international consequences will be. It is a global problem; we could have global input, but we are not going to enable ourselves to be aware of that now.
I have been involved in Senate inquiries before into some of these issues. I have to say that, before I came into this place, I was horrifyingly ignorant of some of these issues—and I am not suggesting that I am now fully across all of them. It is only through being able to examine some of these issues in detail that I have some appreciation of the significance of these issues and the fact that they have major international ramifications as well as local, domestic ones. 
The Democrats strongly support this motion as an attempt to get at least something of a spotlight on what are, in my view, some of the most significant bills that we are going to consider, with ramifications that I do not think anybody has really thought through, beyond obviously the government thinking about their incredibly short-term, incredibly narrow, immediate political self-interest. That is clearly their motivation. The national interest does not rate with this government in relation to this issue. Put simply, political self-interest has been put first, second and last on the part of this government. For some time, but particularly at this moment, that is what has been driving their attitude and their rhetoric in relation to this. The social damage they are causing—the social division, the trashing of our international obligations, the trashing of the fabric of human rights—obviously does not count when it comes to short-term political gain. That is a great shame. 
It is the role of the Senate, I believe, as a body independent of the government—the primary parliamentary body—to keep a check and a balance on the activities of government, to be able to operate, at least to some extent, beyond that short-term political gain of the government of the day and to take into account national and global interest. Unless we support this motion, again we will be passing up an opportunity to do that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-20,"—I support the motion to refer this migration legislation to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. It is important to have it go to the references committee so that we can question people from the various departments and others from the community on the ramifications of these pieces of legislation. This cannot adequately be done in the chamber, and that is why we have these committees—to consider and to invite people to give us their advice about the measures and the ramifications thereon. I want to say very clearly that I agree that this issue before us does raise a number of questions, including the question of the detention of persons without lawful authority. As I understand it, this legislation is going to be retrospective in respect of that matter. I have seen some legal views on this. We need further advice—or at least I do. You might be able to make your decisions, but I need further advice on this. One of the ways of getting this out in the open is to enable people to give evidence before a committee, and this legislation does raise the question of detention of persons without lawful authority.
It of course raises the importance of Australia being able to protect its own borders lawfully. It highlights Australia's obligations under the refugee convention. It will put the spotlight on those obligations that require us to give refuge to those with a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. However, it also raises the very important issue of people smuggling and organised groups or gangs making a considerable pile out of human misery. I think that, unless tackled, people smuggling will put at risk the credibility of the refugee determination system itself, and that concerns me. I understand some of the points being made by the government and the opposition, but I do not believe the remedy is in denying the rights of others. This makes me very concerned.
I have a suggestion to the government, and I will make it during the debate, if we have much of a debate, at the committee stage. I say to Senator McKiernan that I understand what he says: if it goes to a committee and the report date is next Wednesday, what chance do we have to advertise for submissions and all the rest of it. But, to be frank, that is not of our doing, is it? Here is the legislation and the government wants it pursued. As has been indicated, the betting around the place is that we will not be back again after next week—I do not know about that— and so we have to consider the matter before the end of next week. Even a truncated inquiry would assist me and, I believe, other legislators in this important task. I support the motion.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-20,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 22 October 2001:
All aspects of the provisions of the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001, and the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001.
I alter that reporting date to Wednesday, 26 September 2001. I do that because there would be an argument from the government, if not from the opposition, that leaving the reporting date to 22 October would make it unlikely, with an election coming down the line and next week being generally agreed as the last week of sitting of the Senate, that the committee report would come back to the Senate. 
I am appealing to the Labor Party to do the right thing by the people of Australia and particularly its own constituents. It knows, as well as all the rest of us do, that whatever supporters of the government might think, there are a huge number of opposition supporters who want to have this legislation properly dealt with, and that means properly scrutinised. I have already spoken about the Law Council of Australia and the Council for Civil Liberties being seriously alarmed, opposing this legislation at the outset and drawing attention to very serious shortcomings of the bills at hand. It goes to matters of huge importance—not only the way we deal with immigrants but the way we perceive ourselves as a nation, upholding fundamental civil liberties and human rights, not least access to the courts.
I have to look at the politics of this and I have to appeal to the opposition to take a second view of what it is doing. Is the opposition really going to support Prime Minister John Howard in railroading this legislation through the Senate without an opportunity for the people of Australia to have a look at it and comment—not least the experts in this country who deal with matters of immigration, law, human rights, and our obligations under a range of international treaties dealing with the handling of refugees and with human rights? 
As I understand it, it is a fundamental of Labor Party philosophy, if not policy, that human rights be protected and not be summarily passed away by the railroading of legislation through the parliament. I believe that, whatever else it may think about the Senate, it accepts that this is a house of review where the excesses of an executive government in the House of Representatives can be—if not stopped— slowed down, so the public has an opportunity to have a look at what we are dealing with. If the opposition does not support this move to enable the public to give us input before we finally deal with this legislation, it is falling into line with the Howard government philosophy and cutting the people of Australia out from this debate. It cannot do that; it should not do that; it must not do that. In the run-up to an election—where it is a concern that Prime Minister Howard is motivated not only by the idea of improving his stocks in the public domain but also by seeing the polls go that way and, worst of all, by the overshadowing awful tragedy in the United States—we cannot allow to slip through this place legislation which is going to affect immigrants, illegal or otherwise, to this country and Australian citizens' rights for a long, long time to come. 
For the first time in federal law, mandatory sentencing appears. It raises its ugly head in this legislation. Once you allow it in your dealings with one group of people— Australians or otherwise—where do you draw the line? I ask the opposition: where do you draw the line on mandatory sentencing? I have been proud to be associated with you— 
—We won an election in the Northern Territory; we are going to repeal it in the Northern Territory. We have stated very clearly what our view on that is.
—You are going to keep it in Western Australia. 
—Federally, we have stated what our position is. 
—Don't misrepresent us; you could provoke a blue here. 
 (Senator Hogg)—Order! Senator Brown, return to your comments.
—Give due where due is—
—Senator Schacht, you can get up and have a say in the debate later if you like, but let Senator Brown continue. 
—Senator Schacht says that the Labor Party is removing mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory. 
—We have won an election on it; we just got into office. 
—And that it won an election on it. So how contrary to that good action is the Labor Party in supporting the introduction of mandatory sentencing into federal law here today and, what is more, supporting it in a way which does not allow the public to have input, which does not allow itself to be informed about the danger of such legislation? 
—That string to your bow is about 10 miles long—to put those two together, Senator Brown. 
—Senator Schacht will be able to get up and try to defend the indefensible here. The point is: here is the Labor Party supporting mandatory sentencing. It is my understanding that people we might think are very good citizens of this nation can be caught up in this mandatory sentencing net. I want to talk about this further in the debate on the second reading of the bill, but let me just refer to it at the moment. The bill provides for mandatory sentencing of five years or eight years for citizens of Australia or other people who are involved in bringing groups of five or more `illegal' immigrants—that is, asylum seekers—into the country in the future. As I understand it, had that law applied when the East Timorese were illegally in this country—after they had been told to go—during the occupation of their country by Indonesia, and the nuns and others from the Catholic Church and others in the churches were giving those people refuge, it is not drawing too long a bow to say that they may have been subject to this mandatory sentencing provision. The Labor Party ought to look very carefully at that. I want to see what the Labor Party's legal advice on this matter is, because this is alarming stuff. As I said, I will come to it later. This legislation also overrules all other laws of the country. 
—Senator Brown, could I interrupt you for a moment. I have just had drawn to my attention, and it should be drawn to your attention, that the motion as printed in the Notice Paper today is not correct in the sense that the words `Legislation Committee' should be `References Committee'. The original motion that you foreshadowed was to a references committee, and there has been an error in the printing of the motion. I just want to draw that to your attention, because it may be germane to the comments that you are going to make in the debate.
—I thank you for that advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I have a point for clarification. I notice that you are now referring to the point in Senator Brown's motion which states: 
That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee...
—That should read `References Committee'. 
—Is that what Senator Brown originally moved?
—That is correct. That is what Senator Brown originally moved. That is why I am drawing it to Senator Brown's attention now.
—I thank you for that. I will check on that matter. Let me be very clear about this, Mr Acting Deputy President. The important thing is that this matter be referred to a committee so that we can get from that committee the public's input on this matter. 
I was referring to the fact that, beyond mandatory sentencing, this legislation also overrules other laws of the country. This package of legislation removes the right of citizens to have access to the courts of this country. I reiterate that all this is happening in a background of a potential appeal to the High Court, consequent on the ruling of the Full Bench of the Federal Court in the Tampa issue. Therefore, it has very serious ramifications as far as the time-honoured tradition of upholding people's basic rights to appeal to courts is concerned in this country. Members of the opposition in particular should think about that. 
Think about the effort of the government last week to even overrule access to the High Court. If it were not for the Senate that effort to overrule the High Court, which I think would have failed because it was unconstitutional, would have gone through this place. The Labor Party is now taking part in a similar process of railroading through this place legislation with enormous consequences as far as legal and human rights in this country are concerned. We go now to the business of excision of parts of the country, dividing the country up for the application of law differently in one place to another. Where does that end? This is the start of a process which is open-ended. It is even open-ended in this legislation as it allows the minister by statute to draw the line differently, to include other external territories and, indeed, all other islands that are part of states or territories, including my home state of Tasmania.
One would agree that it is unlikely to occur, but that potential should never be allowed under legislation which treats all states equally. I will be moving to amend that provision when we get to debate the bill. It should not even be countenanced, not least in the Senate, which was under the Constitution established to look after the interests of the states against the excesses of the House of Representatives, which these days means the excesses of the Prime Minister's office. It is shoddy, fast-track legislation. 
Mr Beazley has been maintaining all the way down the line that the government should not make legislation on the run and now we have him and the opposition running with the government. The important thing here is that we take a few days to allow the Australian people to have their say too. Is that going to be so harmful to the opposition? What is the argument that the opposition puts that this should not go to a committee?
—If you sit down we will tell you.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, you will know that Senator Carr is disorderly in interjecting, but he compounds the infraction of the standing orders of this place by interjecting while standing between his seat and you.
—You have succeeded in putting Senator Carr back in his place.
—Thank you, and I will not charge him a cent. It is very important that the opposition explains the contradiction between this situation and its insistence that the Liberal Party's effort to get legislation to ensure that public funding goes to its head office and not to its party offices, in the wake of the next election, goes to a Senate committee so people can feed in their views before we deal with that piece of legislation. Indeed, the opposition agrees that the regional forest agreements around the country are important enough—and it has dealt with this legislation before—for the public to have at least a few days input before debate on that bill takes place next week. 
When it comes to this migration legislation, which has always been an important matter for the opposition, it suddenly says there will be no committee and no public input and it does not believe in anything other than the Howard government's prescription for putting this through the Senate. That is not only a contradiction but also a failure on the part of the Labor Party to uphold its own principles, its logic and its past avocation for the defence of human rights and, in particular, the defence of the have-nots, the people who do not have the privilege of easy access to the courts and rights but who, nevertheless, find themselves within our borders. It is a pretty shoddy exercise. It is all the more shoddy that the opposition should be acquiescing to Mr Howard's prescription in dealing with it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,19,2
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I do not intend to take too much of the Senate's time in debating Senator Brown's motion to refer this legislation to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am pleased, Senator Brown, that you did give that clarification as to which committee it is going to go to because it is important which hat I wear in joining this debate. It is a matter of whether I am chair of the references committee or deputy chair of the legislation committee. But, whichever hat I would be wearing, Senator Brown has not seen fit, since he put his motion in the chamber yesterday, to enter into any form of consultation or negotiations with me as chair or even as deputy chair of the committees. That is a breach of the normal practice and stands in stark contrast to what Senator Bartlett did during the last sittings when the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 was referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee and was subject to some debate in this place. There was consultation all the way around, but regrettably Senator Brown has not seen fit to engage in that consultation.
Senator Brown, in putting forward a motion and not consulting, has put me as an individual in somewhat of a difficult position because, were I to acquiesce to and go along with the proposition that Senator Brown is putting forward, I would have to breach every understanding that we have had in the period of time that I have been chair of that committee. I agree with all the propositions of contacting the public and having the public come along to a Senate committee and inform the committee—and, through the committee, the parliament—about their concerns over or support for particular pieces of legislation. In order to facilitate the public doing that, we advertise in our national newspapers for people to come along and give their views. Where we identify particular individuals or organisations, we also make contact with them for them to come along so we can ask them to give their particular views.
With the last bill that I referred to, which Senator Bartlett moved be referred to the committee, we were able to make informal arrangements. Even prior to the Senate passing the reference to the committee, we were able to make informal arrangements for advertising to take place. Were we to advertise in the national media on this particular set of bills, which are important bills, we would have had to have put the advertisement into the newspapers through the agency yesterday. If there were consultation, that might have been able to have been done, but regrettably there is absolutely no way in the world that it can be done now, at midday on Thursday, for the weekend's newspapers.
—What humbug.
—Well, it is an actual fact, and we were able to facilitate that other matter. Senator Bartlett is sitting very close to us, and I think Senator Bartlett will agree that the advertisement did appear and that the public have made submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the refugee determination bill. Tomorrow we will be having a public hearing on that piece of legislation here in the national capital, Canberra. We were able to do that through the processes of consultation. Senator Brown, if you do not want to engage in those processes, that is your decision, but it is your humbug, Senator Brown. It is your humbug that causes that not to happen.
The other thing that needs to be considered by the Senate in regard to this particular reference is: how does the public get to the hearing of the parliamentary committee and the committee get time to deliberate on the evidence taken, write up the report and present that report by Tuesday of next week? I do not know if any other colleagues are having the same difficulties as some others that I know in making travel arrangements at this particular point in time with only one of the major airlines of this country flying. It would be very, very difficult to move around this country at this moment in time, even if we were able to.
When will the committee have time to do the hearing? We cannot do it tomorrow because we are already engaged. On the instructions of the Senate, we already have a hearing on another very important bill, a bill so important that the person who was concerned about the content of the bill actually engaged in a consultation process with those of us that are also engaged in the committee, and we were able to facilitate that and support it. But, no, Senator Brown wants to do his own thing and go charging off on a steed to make a name for himself.
Well, Senator Brown, you are entitled to do that and you are doing that, but obviously you are not going to get your proposition up—but they are the breaks that you engage in, Senator Brown, entirely different from your actions in relation to the other inquiry that is before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I refer to your contact with me in Burkina Faso just last week, I think it was or it may have been possibly the week before, and how circumstances have changed. You made contact with my office and made contact with me in the west of the continent of Africa, in Burkina Faso, to make alternative arrangements about a bill and a subject matter that was very dear to your heart. You were very able to do that while I was thousands and thousands of miles away, but while I sit four seats from you, you are not even able to come across—and we did talk about the other matter yesterday. If you fail on this particular occasion, Senator Brown, I think the first thing you should do is a bit of self-analysis of your own efforts in this. If you really wanted the bill to come through, you, the mover of the motion, would have at least engaged in some degree of consultation on it.
—What a comment for a chairman this is. This is disgraceful. It is just humbug.
—The only thing disgraceful in this, Senator Brown, is you; you have been the disgrace. But you have achieved your aim—you have made a name for yourself, but it is not a very good name, Senator Brown; it is not a very good argument at all.
Let me put one quick matter in regard to the bills. The bills, as I indicated and will be saying when we get into the second reading debate, are very important bills and are dramatically different from the bill we debated here three weeks ago. I have gone into the content of the legislation. One of the really important differences with the main bill is that we have actually seen it before it reached the chamber, whereas on the previous occasion we did not even see the bill prior to its entering the chamber. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party, the opposition party in this place, did not get a chance to look at the bill prior to it being introduced in the House of Representatives. Indeed, members of the government parties did not even get to see it.
When that bill was defeated in this place, we offered at the time to look at it and to work with the government on this very important matter of border control in this country. We offered to work with them on this occasion. On this occasion we have been given the opportunity to work with the government on it, and the government will see—by the introduction of this bill and what happened in the House of Representatives yesterday, where all the bills passed the House of Representatives with the support of the opposition—that legislation can be brought into this place and can be passed if it is good legislation. If it is bad legislation, we will oppose it, we will block it and we will not allow it to pass. We proved that some weeks ago, and we paid dearly, one would suggest, in the polls for that action.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,19,2
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-09-20,"—I take this opportunity to do something that I probably should have done the last time I was on my feet, when I incorporated, with the leave of the Senate, the second reading speeches in relation to the migration package of bills. I referred then to some documents that I would table in relation to the bills and particularly to a background paper on the unauthorised arrivals strategy which encompasses a range of information about the government's strategy in relation to unauthorised arrivals. It goes into some detail about the history of this challenge for Australia and the way that this government and previous governments have handled the problem. It also goes into some significant and interesting information about the size of the problem. I commend all who are interested in the problem to look at the tables at the back of the document which go into the size of the problem and the number of people who are actually arriving illegally as boat people, as they have become known. It shows the remarkably massive increase over the last couple of months.
—Under your regime, you have almost lost control of it.
—What are you doing? You are the government.
—I guess you could make the political point that it is our fault that the Afghans are coming through Malaysia and Indonesia! I guess that someone who wanted to make a cheap political point would try to blame someone else and say that the reason that all the Afghans and others are leaving those regimes is the fault of John Howard. And if your dog has fleas, you could blame him for that as well. One of the tables makes the point that 1,212 people, which is a remarkably high number, arrived in August.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-09-20,"—I wish to speak to Senator Brown's motion to refer the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Bill 2001, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001 to a Senate committee for examination. I have spoken already today on this matter to a small degree, as people may have heard, and I will not repeat some of those points. This is a specific motion and I will speak specifically to it. It deals with one of the fundamental roles and responsibilities of the Senate, which is to ensure that legislation put forward by the executive is considered properly—put very bluntly: that we know what the hell we are doing when we vote on the thing. Quite frankly, there is no doubt that, if these bills were voted on without consideration, lots of senators would not actually know what the hell they were doing and what we were really letting ourselves in for, let alone what we were letting asylum seekers in for, if we passed these bills.
I think the ramifications and consequences in a whole range of areas are things that not only the public but many in this chamber are not aware of. Surely, in our role as a parliament, as a Senate and as a legislature we have the responsibility to be aware of what it is we are inflicting on the Australian public and, indeed, on the world. These bills will not only deal with, and have an impact on, the domestic level; they will obviously have an impact internationally on people who are seeking protection from persecution. They may be put at greater risk of not getting that protection. I believe the bills will have international significance in the future direction of the ongoing debate about how to deal with the problem of asylum seekers, displaced people and refugees. As I and many others have said a number of times, it is a global problem; it is not just an Australian problem. Indeed, our exposure to it is a lot less than for many other countries. It is a debate that is flourishing and ongoing, not just in Australia but in many parts of the world. It is a debate that is probably going to intensify if the conflict eventuates that is likely to occur as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States.
I hope that the international cooperation that is unfolding in relation to a response to that terrorist attack includes international consideration of and cooperation on what to do about the consequences for those who are victims of any conflict—the consequences for not only future refugees but the existing ones. Clearly, the global community has failed to address that issue effectively. That is why people are seeking protection as unauthorised arrivals, rather than going through the UN system. The UN system, whilst it tries its best, is dramatically flawed, and many people cannot access protection and there is not much likelihood of gaining protection. With that system not working, it is no surprise that people pursue other avenues to get protection and safety. We need to be working cooperatively internationally to ensure that there is a better system or that that system improves dramatically. Otherwise, regardless of what laws we put in place here, the issue of people arriving here illegally will continue. It is a problem being generated by the persecution of people not only in Afghanistan but in many places around the world and by an inadequate international system for providing assistance to those people.
There is no perfect or easy solution, but this, as sure as hell, is not a solution. In terms of international ramifications, the concern I have is that Australia is looked to in relation to these issues. Many people have commented on our history in relation to refugees. We used to have a proud history that was influential in a global sense, in getting at least some improvement. The situation, such as it is at the moment, is due in no small part to the work that Australia and other nations have done in making that operate. Now that we are sending out these strong messages that we have changed our approach, both through our actions and legislation here and through direct commentary and contact with other governments, the way we are now going to deal with it is to try to stop people accessing protection. We have seen that already in the last few weeks and we see it in these bills.
It would not be unreasonable for other countries that bear a much greater burden than we do to look to Australia's lead and say, `Australia is obviously willing to trash the refugee convention through its legislation and is basically seeking to prevent people from accessing protection; we'll do the same thing.' Do you think that will solve our problem? No, it will make it worse. I think the international aspect is one that has not really been given much attention, not surprisingly, because of the immediacy of the situation and the impact on people arriving here. But I think it is also very dangerous in that international sense. That is just one issue that we will not be able to properly examine unless we get this put to a committee and are given advice and input—not just from people who work here in Australia with asylum seekers. I believe that, when you are dealing with legislation that goes right to the heart of some crucial international conventions, the opposition is quite right to be critical—and, along with others, it has been incredibly critical of this government's disgraceful undermining of international obligations in the human rights area. This legislation goes to the heart of some of those international issues on an international problem, and yet we are not going to have the opportunity to get a proper insight—nor any sort of insight—into what the likely international consequences will be. It is a global problem; we could have global input, but we are not going to enable ourselves to be aware of that now.
I have been involved in Senate inquiries before into some of these issues. I have to say that, before I came into this place, I was horrifyingly ignorant of some of these issues—and I am not suggesting that I am now fully across all of them. It is only through being able to examine some of these issues in detail that I have some appreciation of the significance of these issues and the fact that they have major international ramifications as well as local, domestic ones. 
The Democrats strongly support this motion as an attempt to get at least something of a spotlight on what are, in my view, some of the most significant bills that we are going to consider, with ramifications that I do not think anybody has really thought through, beyond obviously the government thinking about their incredibly short-term, incredibly narrow, immediate political self-interest. That is clearly their motivation. The national interest does not rate with this government in relation to this issue. Put simply, political self-interest has been put first, second and last on the part of this government. For some time, but particularly at this moment, that is what has been driving their attitude and their rhetoric in relation to this. The social damage they are causing—the social division, the trashing of our international obligations, the trashing of the fabric of human rights—obviously does not count when it comes to short-term political gain. That is a great shame. 
It is the role of the Senate, I believe, as a body independent of the government—the primary parliamentary body—to keep a check and a balance on the activities of government, to be able to operate, at least to some extent, beyond that short-term political gain of the government of the day and to take into account national and global interest. Unless we support this motion, again we will be passing up an opportunity to do that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,19,2
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-20,"—I support the motion to refer this migration legislation to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. It is important to have it go to the references committee so that we can question people from the various departments and others from the community on the ramifications of these pieces of legislation. This cannot adequately be done in the chamber, and that is why we have these committees—to consider and to invite people to give us their advice about the measures and the ramifications thereon. I want to say very clearly that I agree that this issue before us does raise a number of questions, including the question of the detention of persons without lawful authority. As I understand it, this legislation is going to be retrospective in respect of that matter. I have seen some legal views on this. We need further advice—or at least I do. You might be able to make your decisions, but I need further advice on this. One of the ways of getting this out in the open is to enable people to give evidence before a committee, and this legislation does raise the question of detention of persons without lawful authority.
It of course raises the importance of Australia being able to protect its own borders lawfully. It highlights Australia's obligations under the refugee convention. It will put the spotlight on those obligations that require us to give refuge to those with a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. However, it also raises the very important issue of people smuggling and organised groups or gangs making a considerable pile out of human misery. I think that, unless tackled, people smuggling will put at risk the credibility of the refugee determination system itself, and that concerns me. I understand some of the points being made by the government and the opposition, but I do not believe the remedy is in denying the rights of others. This makes me very concerned.
I have a suggestion to the government, and I will make it during the debate, if we have much of a debate, at the committee stage. I say to Senator McKiernan that I understand what he says: if it goes to a committee and the report date is next Wednesday, what chance do we have to advertise for submissions and all the rest of it. But, to be frank, that is not of our doing, is it? Here is the legislation and the government wants it pursued. As has been indicated, the betting around the place is that we will not be back again after next week—I do not know about that— and so we have to consider the matter before the end of next week. Even a truncated inquiry would assist me and, I believe, other legislators in this important task. I support the motion.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,19,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-09-20,"—This is a motion to refer the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2001 to the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. Last night I outlined the compelling reasons why that should happen and, moreover, why people should be given time to make their submissions on a matter which is extraordinarily important in my home state of Tasmania and also in Victoria and New South Wales in particular. The fate of Australia's tall forests and rainforests in the south-east corner of this continent is very much at stake. What I did not say but what is obvious is that it is three years since the last committee hearing into this matter and in that time the regional forest agreements have been implemented and their functioning has become a reality. It is very important that the Senate gets to know about the functioning, or malfunctioning, of those regional forest agreements.
I pointed out last night that one of the extraordinary shortcomings has been the forest practices code in Tasmania, which was supposed to give us the protection of the environment in those places being logged under the regional forest agreement, which of course is Mr Howard's document. What we see is the greatest rate of destruction of those forests and extraordinary breaches of the forest practices code by none other than Forestry Tasmania itself. That is aided and abetted by the Forest Practices Board, which has an incestuous relationship—
—I see that Senator Calvert is commenting—I am not sure whether in agreement or otherwise—over there at the moment. This matter is extremely important. Conservation, community and logging interests should have an opportunity also to ask where the money has gone—the millions of dollars of taxpayers' money under the regional forest agreements—and why they have had not an increase but a fall-off of jobs in the logging of native forests around the country. These are really very important matters. Notwithstanding that, there has been an enormous vote showing lack of confidence in the government's and the opposition's point of view on this. The polls most recently in Tasmania say that 70 per cent of Tasmanians, despite all the propaganda we get—
—I see Senator Sherry now assenting to the fact that we get bombarded—at taxpayers' expense—with television by Forestry Tasmania. Now falling, collapsing, in the polls is the Bacon and Lennon government—65 per cent not too long ago, then 59 per cent, now 50 per cent and heading south. No wonder, because they simply will not respond to people and they will not endorse their own Tasmania Together process. Let us have a look at it. Labor is not frightened.

The measures in the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2001 will enhance mobility between the Australian Public Service and the Parliamentary Service for employees who are employed in either service on an ongoing basis. Mobility between these services has been consistently supported by the opposition. We believe the movement of staff between the two services will enhance the vitality and effectiveness of both.
We also recognise the need for the technical amendment that rectifies a problem with the drafting of the original bill which would have required amending legislation each time there was a change to the name of a parliamentary department. Naturally, any motion before the parliament to change the name of a parliamentary department would be scrutinised very closely indeed by the opposition.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-20,"—The Australian Democrats will support the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2001. We have always supported sensible legislative changes to the public sector. We accept that this is a bill that clarifies and tidies up the 1999 Parliamentary Service Bill. It clarifies questions of mobility of ongoing employees between the Australian Public Service and the Parliamentary Service, with the aim of maintaining a high standard of staffing within the Parliamentary Service over time.
It may be appropriate at this time to put in a general thankyou to all the staff that work in the Parliamentary Service, who keep this place running and make our lives easier—be it the attendants here in the chamber, the Hansard staff, the invaluable staff in the Library or those who work in the Joint House Department. I would like to especially thank Shirley Simper from the office of the Leader of the Democrats, whose commitment to work and efficiency has long been recognised by our senators and staff.
The Australian Democrats have a long and proud record of support for the public sector, unmatched by anyone in this place. It is important to remember that this government has a poor record on the Public Service. It has no commitment at all to a strong, independent Public Service and has at many times made attempts to politicise that service. In the last decade, public sector jobs have disappeared as funding for many core services has been withdrawn. Instead of slowing, the winding back of the public sector looks set to continue as competition policy, contracting out and privatisation move into top gear. That means more job losses, lower levels of services— especially in regional areas—and higher prices for many services.
The casualisation that has occurred in many workplaces has also occurred within the public sector. It must be recognised that mobility rights are included only for ongoing employees, allowing them to have a career path within or between the Parliamentary Service and the Australian Public Service. However, the entitlements for leave for the growing class of non-ongoing employees in the public sector will continue to be paid out in cash at the end of their contract. This bill clarifies their role and is indicative of the actual situation both within the public and private sectors. The Australian Democrats support this bill as we recognise that ready mobility between the Public Service and the Parliamentary Service ensures an ease of attracting a high standard of public servant to the Parliamentary Service and vice versa.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1

The statements read as follows—
MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 2001
Purpose of the Bill
This Bill is designed to secure the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' (DIMA) private sector sources of personal information, by way of amendment to portfolio legislation.
The amendments will ensure that DIMA will continue to receive information that is necessary to carry out its core activities and functions. For example, passenger information which is received from the airlines in advance of a flight, is necessary to facilitate immigration clearance and a failure to receive this information may cause considerable processing delays at airport primary lines.
The changes are necessary as a consequence of the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000, which was passed by Parliament in December 2000 and is due to apply to the private sector from December 2001. This Act provides protection for personal information collected by the private sector and limitations on its use and disclosure.
Reasons for Urgency
In the absence of this amendment, from 21 December 2001 DIMA's capacity to continue to receive personal information that is relied upon to carry out portfolio responsibilities may be compromised.. A specific legislative authority, which will authorise the disclosure of personal information, is necessary to ensure that private sector organisations may continue to disclose information in confidence without breaching the new amendments to the Privacy Act 1988.

MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 6) 2001
Purpose of the Bill
This Bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to:
·	restore the application of the Refugees Convention to its proper interpretation;
·	promote the integrity of Australia's protection visa application and decision making processes in light of growing concerns of identity, nationality and claims  fraud amongst unauthorised arrivals;
·	provide the Minister with a power to substitute, in the public interest, a more  favourable decision for a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relating  to an application for, or the cancellation of, a protection visa; and
·	ensure in the wake of recent litigation that family members of refugees are able to  be granted visas.
Reasons for Urgency
The Bill will strengthen Australia's responses to the pressures facing the international framework of refugee protection; discourage unauthorised arrivals; correct expansive interpretations of our Refugees Convention obligations by the courts and close off areas of potential misuse of our refugee processes by asylum seekers in Australia.
Given the continuing high levels of unauthorised arrivals and increasing sophistication of people smuggling efforts, the risk of abuse of Australia's protection processes has increased. It is evident that people smugglers are coaching unauthorised arrivals in order to maximise their chance of gaining a protection visa, further placing the integrity of Australia's protection system at risk.
It is also necessary to address recent court cases which are expanding the coverage of the Refugees Convention. In particular, they have brought into question the eligibility of family members to obtain a protection visa unless they have a personal protection need. This weakens our capacity to address cases of clearly contrived claims for protection.
It is important that this Bill is passed as soon as possible to ensure that:
·	the Refugees Convention provides protection to genuine refugees consistent with Australia's international obligations; and
·	opportunities to abuse Australia's protection processes are removed.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-09-20,"—The opposition will be supporting passage of the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001. This bill deals with the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme, which commenced operation on 14 September 1997. It was a scheme which was established to enable farmers of pension age or of low income to gift or transfer their farm to other members of the family without it affecting their access to social security entitlements. At that time the then minister, Minister Anderson, announced with great fanfare that this scheme would result in some 10,000 farmers taking advantage of the scheme and arranging for the intergenerational transfer of their farms. As we have subsequently found out, the great predictions made by the minister at the time and subsequent ministers looking after agricultural matters or dealing with regional Australia were completely wide of the mark. In fact, as I understand it, only 2,000-odd farmers have made use of the scheme. Notwithstanding that failure of the government's original estimates, we have supported the operation of the scheme. 
This bill actually extends the finalisation date of the scheme. It was due to finish on 30 June 2001. However, some farmers, we understand, may have sought to access the scheme following that date or enquired about their eligibility who would still be eligible to take advantage of the scheme if the date were to be extended. So this bill does enable the scheme to be extended for up to a maximum of three months following that date upon which those farmers contacted Centrelink. So it is dealing with a specific, defined class of farmers who have already commenced the process of accessing the scheme. 
I am not sure whether or not that actually includes any members of the coalition government who may be concerned about their future representation in this place, As I know a number of them are, they may need to consider what they will be doing in retirement once they leave this building, either voluntarily or by virtue of the result at the ballot box. In any event, they will not be eligible for the scheme unless they have already made application but, for the reasons that I have advanced, we will still be happy to support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-09-20,"—The legislation provides for the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme to finish on 30 June 2001. There are, however, as has been mentioned, some farmers who, while otherwise eligible under the scheme, had not finalised the transfer of their farm by 30 June 2001. The purpose of the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Retirement Assistance for Farmers) Bill 2001 is to provide those farmers with extra time in which to take advantage of the scheme. It also provides for similar arrangements in respect of farmers applying for Department of Veterans' Affairs income support pensions who wish to take advantage of the scheme.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-09-20,"—The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 2) 2001 makes consequential amendments to certain offence provisions in the legislation administered by the Treasurer to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995 to existing offence provisions from 15 December 2001. They clarify the physical elements of an offence and corresponding fault elements where those fault elements vary from those specified in the Criminal Code. The amendments also specify whether an offence is one of strict or absolute liability. In the absence of such an amendment, offences previously interpreted as being one of strict or absolute liability would be interpreted as not being one of strict or absolute liability. In addition, the amendments restate the defences to an offence separately from the words of the offence.
The amendments moved by the government to this bill relate to the interaction between the Criminal Code and the proposed Financial Services Reform Act. The proposed amendments ensure that the Criminal Code does not apply to offences against certain provisions that are being repealed or amended by the proposed Financial Services Reform Act that are not compliant with the Criminal Code. The bill does not change the criminal law, rather it ensures that the current law is maintained following the application of the Criminal Code to Commonwealth legislation.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-09-20,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2001 amends the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976 to provide for the twice yearly indexation of pensions paid under these acts. The amendments proposed by the bill give effect to an announcement made in the last budget. The critical change in this legislation is that the government has decided to introduce twice yearly indexation of Commonwealth superannuation pensions under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, commonly known as the CSS, and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, commonly known as the PSS. This indexation will occur twice yearly on 1 July and 1 January for movements in the consumer price index for the previous half year. This will reduce the delay between the inflationary effects faced by superannuation pensioners and income adjustments. The change will commence from 1 January next year. At the present time the indexation arrangement is yearly. 
The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, of which I am deputy chair, has considered this issue together with the issue of the rate at which the indexation occurs. I will come to that issue a little later. The Senate committee handed down a report in April 2001 titled A reasonable and secure retirement. The committee held a number of public hearings at the request of not just Commonwealth public superannuants but state public superannuants. It is important to point out that the problems we were dealing with and reviewing, as identified by former public servants, have an impact on Commonwealth public servants and state public servants. There is a variation of approach between the two jurisdictions. In the report on page 50, table 7 outlines the pension indexation arrangements for  Commonwealth and the main state superannuation schemes. Until this bill is passed and takes effect, the Commonwealth frequency of indexation is annual. The Commonwealth military scheme is annual. Indexation is annual for Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. Frequency of indexation is biannual for Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. 
The government announced in the budget that former or retired public servants who were members of the CSS and PSS will receive an important change in their indexation arrangements from annual to biannual. However, what surprised me and the Labor opposition was the exclusion of two categories of former Commonwealth public employees. One was the exclusion of former military personnel and the other was the exclusion of former Papua New Guinea government superannuants. In the former case, there are some 57,000 military superannuants. In the case of former PNG superannuants, I think the number is a few hundred. It was certainly surprising to the Labor opposition that, for some reason never really explained by the government, the retired military personnel and former PNG public servants were to be discriminated against and excluded from this change to indexation provisions. It has never been explained why this exclusion was to apply. Former PNG public servants and retired military personnel were formerly employed by the Commonwealth. To this day I do not believe we have received a satisfactory explanation. 
Understandably, of course, former military personnel—some 57,000 of them—and people who are currently serving in the military were concerned about the discrimination that was proposed with this change to indexation arrangements. I received some representations from military personnel, both current and retired, about this matter. It was the view of the Labor Party that, as the government had accepted the principle that the indexation arrangements should be changed from yearly to biannual, that principle should apply also to the former military personnel and former PNG public servants. I think late afternoon on Monday or Tuesday of this week the government belatedly recognised the discrimination against military personnel and announced that the twice yearly indexation would be extended to 57,000 recipients of military superannuation pensions.
I would like to acknowledge the work of the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, Mr Laurie Ferguson. He was very active in the campaign to ensure that military superannuants were not discriminated against in the way that the government proposed. The government backed down on what was a shocking announcement in respect of military personnel. Mr Ferguson, on two separate occasions, had called for the minister, Mr Scott, in the other place to reverse this discrimination against retired military personnel and, finally, the minister accepted that advice. This issue reflects very poorly on the way in which the Liberal-National Party handled the superannuation indexation arrangements of military personnel.
I would also like to place on record the efforts of the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association. I acknowledge their persistent lobbying since this was announced in the budget and the contribution they have made to the government backdown on the indexation of the pension arrangements of military service personnel. I referred earlier to the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. Government, Democrat and Labor members of that committee unanimously recommended that this change should occur to the arrangements for all public servants. The government's inclusion of that recommendation in its budget during May must be the quickest response to a committee recommendation that I have seen in recent times. There are a lot of other recommendations that they have spent years with, and some we have never had a response to.
I should also point out that our recommendation went to ensuring that state governments changed annual indexation to biannual indexation. As I read out earlier, there are three state governments that have annual indexation. Those are Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. I think it is very important that we have a consistent principle applying to former public servants. Whether they were in the armed forces or were former police officers or ambulance officers or were in the general public service, we should have a consistent approach to their indexation arrangements around the country. In winding up, I would call on the Queensland, South Australian and New South Wales governments to ensure that the arrangements relating to frequency of indexation are changed for their former public servants. It would be absurd to have different arrangements in some states from those in other states in the Commonwealth. I would go further: regardless of whether they are Labor or Liberal states—one of them is a Liberal state and there are not too many of those left nowadays—but in the case of South Australia—
—Not for long.
—Not for long, that is right. But whoever is in government we should ensure consistency of superannuation arrangements in respect of indexation around the country. I would go further and argue that the Commonwealth should legislate to ensure that we have a consistent approach, because I do not see how the continuation of inconsistent indexation arrangements can be tolerated.
Another issue has been raised by former public servants at state and Commonwealth level, and that is the base at which their pensions are indexed. At the present time, according to the survey I have pointed to, it is the CPI. Commonwealth and state public servants were seeking a change to the base of the indexation arrangements, either to some sort of wage indexation movement or to average male ordinary time earnings, which apply to current pension arrangements. 
The committee did consider this, because it is an important issue and I understand the concern of retired public servants on this. I will not go into all the detail, but we asked the finance department for an estimated cost, if this change were to be made—this is in respect to Commonwealth responsibilities only—and the finance department told us that the cost would be approximately $700 million per annum. Therefore, regrettably, the majority of the committee—government and Labor—could not make that recommendation, based on the requests received. In the representations made since the committee's report was handed down, there has been some reasonable prima facie material presented to me at least to suggest that there is a question mark over the way in which the finance department arrived at the figure it gave to our committee. I do intend to seek further information about the finance department's estimates of the costs. I will have to check with my office whether that has gone into the department but, if I have not yet formally put it on notice, that request for further information will be going to the department, and hopefully we will receive a response very quickly.
In conclusion, the Labor opposition is, obviously, supporting this legislation. We are pleased to see that the government, after causing some months of worry for military personnel, has belatedly come to the view that it cannot discriminate against military personnel and has by way of amendment included in this legislation the 57,000 current recipients of military superannuation pensions. Obviously, this will impact on a growing number of military personnel as they retire. It is unfortunate that they have been worried and concerned about their exclusion from the announced provision, and belatedly that has been accepted. With the passing of the legislation here today, there will be a welcome change to the indexation arrangements for public servants more generally, and military and PNG pension indexation arrangements.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INDEXATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-20,"—I would like to put on record the Democrats' support for this bill. It does, as has already been mentioned, pick up on the recommendation of the superannuation committee's inquiry into retirement benefits for public servants. It does not go as far as public servants wanted; it does not give them relative benefits over pensioners. However, I think making that indexation biannual rather than annual is an important step forward. We are also pleased to see the amendment which picks up on the arrangements for military and Papua New Guinean pensioners. That is important: had the government not put that amendment forward in this Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2001, the Democrats would have done so, so I want to indicate our support.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INDEXATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-09-20,"—I thank honourable senators for their contribution. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2001 implements the government's budget announcement for twice-yearly CPI indexation of Commonwealth civilian superannuation pensions from January 2002. I remind the Senate that this bill will increase the purchasing power of some 100,000 Commonwealth civilian, and some 58,000 military, superannuation pensioners by reducing the delay between price increases and the compensatory adjustments to their superannuation pensions. I thank honourable senators, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-09-20,"—The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 proposes to amend the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995 and the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1995. The acts were passed to ensure that, when plaintiffs go to court to recover damages for personal injuries, they would repay to the Commonwealth the cost of any Medicare residential care benefits received because of their injury.
As has already been outlined in the other house, the bill arises from a review of the acts undertaken for the government by the former Commissioner for Superannuation, Mr George Pooley. He found that the compensation recovery program governed by the acts had proved cumbersome and burdensome for all parties, and he made a number of recommendations to improve these processes. These new arrangements will be simpler and more efficient and will keep impositions on claimants to a minimum. Simpler claiming and administrative processes will allow the speedier release of final compensation settlements or judgments and will reduce the worry and red tape for recipients and their families. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I understand that there has been some discussion between the government and the opposition regarding the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 2001 and the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001. It had been the intention of the opposition to make fairly lengthy submissions on both bills when the bills were listed in the normal place on the Notice Paper. They have now been brought forward into non-controversial legislation. The government has sought the assistance of the opposition to expedite passage of both bills, and we have assented to that proposition. Accordingly, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate my speech in the second reading debate on this bill.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
The Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 2001 seeks to amend the telecommunications access regime contained in the Trade Practices Act 1974. It seeks to streamline the telecommunications access regime in a number of ways. 
My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr Smith, has outlined in some detail the Opposition's position on this Bill, and on telecommunications competition issues more generally. I will not repeat what Mr Smith has already said about this Bill.
However, I would like to speak briefly about the Senate inquiry into the Bill and then I will move a second reading amendment.
The Senate Environment, Communications IT and the Arts Committee reported on its inquiry into this Bill earlier this week.  Labor Senators provided a dissenting report to that Inquiry which set out one particular concern that had been raised by witnesses during Committee hearings. 
This concern related to one of the ways the Bill seeks to streamline the telecommunications access regime, namely, by limiting the evidence available on appeals to the Australian Competition Tribunal (ACT) generally to that available to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
A number of witnesses, including telecommunications carriers and the ACCC, called for the ACT's merits review of ACCC decisions to be abolished.
This issue arose in the context of the new section 152DOA in the Bill, which specifies the matters to which the ACT may have regard when it is conducting a review of a determination of the ACCC in arbitrating a telecommunications access dispute. 
At present, review by the ACT is a re-arbitration of the dispute, and the Tribunal may have regard to any information, documents or evidence which it considers relevant, whether or not those matters were before the ACCC in the course of making its initial determination.
Proposed new section 152DOA will, in effect, limit the Tribunal to consideration of information, documents or evidence which were before the ACCC initially.
The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill explains the need for this amendment by stating that determinations by the ACCC “involve a lengthy and complex hearing process” and that restricting the material which the Tribunal may consider “will ensure that the Tribunal process involves a review of the Commission's decision, rather than a complete re-arbitration of the dispute”.
The Explanatory Memorandum also states that “Although this option should reduce delay in the review of Commission decisions, it will reduce the extent of Tribunal review. On balance, it is considered that the limitations on the review are justified on the basis of the length and depth of the Commission's arbitration process.
The primary concern of the carriers who are seeking to abolish the merits review altogether is the time and delay in access pricing decisions, particularly when there is a merits review and the lengthy process commences de novo.
The carriers had some valid arguments for abolishing the merits review. In particular they argued that:
·	In this fast-moving market, it is only feasible for one body to consider the basic matters because the availability of a review process (in addition to avenues of judicial review) gives competitors an opportunity to delay if it is to their competitive advantage. Witnesses representing the carriers were particularly concerned that the review de novo by the ACT can be utilised for `regulatory gaming', that is, using the regulatory resources and muscle of the organisation at every opportunity to frustrate competitive entry through exploiting the regulatory regime to try to exhaust competitor resources.
·	The ACCC process is already lengthy, more thorough and performed by people with greater expertise than the ACT review, so the value of merits review is dubious. The length and detail of the first instance process by the ACCC questions the need for a merits review.
·	The ACCC better placed to determine these matters because it has the background expertise and experience, whereas the ACT has never considered a telecommunications pricing issue and has no resources of its own.
·	The integrity of the ACCC process is adequately protected by the avenues of judicial review to the Federal Court or the High Court on matters of law, which is comprehensive and searching into the reasoning and analysis of ACCC decision making.
A variety of reasons were given for the existing arrangements being unsatisfactory. These included: 
·	Delay is a considerable concern for the industry, particularly as it relates to price determinations, because it creates lengthy uncertainty, is detrimental to competitive interests and delays investment decisions to the ultimate detriment of consumers
·	Another concern with the merits review is that it may tend to have an intimidating effect on smaller access seekers. That is, if even relatively larger players are being taken to the tribunal, and the matter is being dragged out from scratch, the smaller access seekers will be deterred from even taking a matter to the commission. This is not in the interests of competition.
·	The merits review is presently as of right. There is no restriction of frivolous or vexatious matters for the de novo review. It has been suggested that this encourages `regulatory gaming' as it means there is nothing to prevent Telstra bringing a review before the tribunal for a tactical or strategic delay to competitors and would-be access seekers.
As well as the witnesses supporting the abolishment of the merits review, contrary views were expressed. Reasons for supporting the existing arrangements included:
·	The enhanced appeals process (that is the merits review to the ACT) is an important part of the framework that specifically regulates telecommunications.
·	The provision for merits review acts as an effective “insurance policy” against any mistakes that may result from the regulatory system. The risk of error occurring in regulatory decision-making and the costs of such error are very high.
·	Appeals on questions of law do not provide a sufficient foundation for the confidence necessary for investment.
The Committee was advised that abolishing the merits review by the ACT might have some detrimental consequences such as:
·	Deterring investment in regulated or potentially regulated telecommunications infrastructure because of a perceived regulatory risk. This would increase the costs of raising capital and reduce expenditure on investment.
·	Setting a damaging precedent for other infrastructure industries affected by regulated decisions.
·	Introducing uncertainty about investment, or returns on investment, and reducing incentives for continued investment.
·	Eroding the accountability of the decision maker (ie the ACCC). That accountability appropriately accompanies the wide discretion of the regulator in making decisions. A high degree of scrutiny of the ACCC's decisions is also warranted by the impact of its decisions and the significant economic consequences.
The Department of Communications, IT and the Arts advised the Committee of the reasons for including the amendment in the Bill which limits the information that can be brought before the ACT, instead of abolishing the appeal for the ACT:
·	The provision strikes a balance between competing interests, which is clearly the case given the competing submissions to this inquiry.
·	Merits review has, since its introduction in 1997, been considered an important element of the package as a whole.
·	Merits review is a presumed right for administrative decisions, and is considered appropriate given the nature and breadth of the ACCC's powers.
·	Abolition of the merits review is a fundamental reform and no reforms of that central nature will be made prior to consideration of the Productivity Commission's findings from its inquiries into Telecommunications Competition Regulation and the National Access Regime.
So in summary of the Committee's inquiry into this Bill, Labor Senators were not persuaded, to oppose the Government's legislation. Clearly there are doubts regarding the merits review by the ACT, including the capacity and appropriateness of the ACT to fulfil that role and the timeliness of outcomes.
Given the imminent conclusion of Productivity Commission inquiries on relevant matters, Labor Senators concluded that it was premature to make such a substantial change as abolishing the merits review prior to consideration of the reports from those inquiries.
In view of the different positions of witnesses and submissions to the Inquiry, consideration of the Productivity Commission's detailed analysis of the issue would be worthwhile prior to deciding on the most appropriate course of action. 
In conclusion, Labor Senators recommended in our report that the issue of merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal as a part of the telecommunications access regime be reconsidered in the context of the Productivity Commission's findings which will be available within the next month.
I believe that consideration of reforms of the regulatory regime applicable to the telecommunications industry is important to ensuring there is true competition in the industry.
And that is important to all Australian consumers.
While the Government likes to gloat about the degree of competition in the industry, Telstra receives 89 per cent of the total profits in the industry. Meanwhile Optus has eight per cent, Vodafone two per cent, AAPT one per cent and the others account for less than one percent of total industry profits.
There is still some way to go in achieving a more competitive telecommunications market. A Beazley Labor government will ensure Australians get more effective competition than this government has been able to achieve.
In that context I will move the second reading amendment in my name.
—I thank the Senate. A second reading amendment in relation to the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill 2001 was circulated in my name yesterday. We are going to proceed with that amendment now and I will speak to it briefly. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes the lack of effective competition in significant parts of the Australian telecommunications industry;
	(b)	notes the Government's failure to respond in a timely manner to widespread industry concerns held since at least January 1999 about delays in the telecommunications competition regime, which continue to the detriment of both consumers and the industry; 
	(c)	notes that the cause of the Government's failure to act has been its ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra; and
	(d)	calls on the Government to urgently consider further reform as part of its response to the final report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the telecommunications competition regime due next month”.
Paragraphs (a) to (c) of the amendment address the issues of lack of competition and the failure to adequately advance change in the telecommunications competition regime, and note the government's obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra. Paragraph (d) effectively calls on the government to restart the reform agenda in the telecommunications industry. It is important to note the large, indeed huge, amount of profits—over $4 billion per year— being made by Telstra at the moment. They represent about 90 per cent of industry profits and certainly indicate that Telstra holds a dominant market share of the various industries in which it competes. That strengthens Telstra's ability to effectively thwart even the most minimal competition reform. This is reflected in the management of the company by the current administration: their implementation of failed overseas strategies and their poor investments, all leading to significant write-downs. All of the features that I have just identified reflect a lack of competition in the telecommunications industry, an apparent exercise of monopoly power and the extraction of monopoly rents, to the harm of consumers, competitors, infrastructure users and re-sellers generally in this industry. 
This serious state of affairs—in fact, the de facto re-monopolisation of the telecommunications industry—is permitted by this government, whose priority, as indicated in paragraph (d), is not advancing reform, not establishing a sound regulatory regime and not forcing the creation of a competitive market. Indeed, so poor are a lot of those elements that in his inquiry Mr Besley was unable to recommend any degree of privatisation for the foreseeable future. This amendment effectively urges the government to forget, to negate, its obsession with the privatisation of Telstra and to get on with the main game. The main game is clear to everyone: establishing a flexible and effective regulatory regime and encouraging further real competition within the telecommunications industry and a hastened improvement of retail services to rural and regional Australia—that is, further competition and reform in this industry as a matter of urgency. I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-09-20,"—I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the bulk of my speech in this second reading debate.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
This Bill amends Part 11C of the Trade Practices Act 1974, dealing with arbitration of disputes between carriers and access seekers over access to certain telecommunications services.  It seeks to encourage parties to settle access conditions by negotiation rather than arbitration and to reduce delays in the arbitration process.
Part 11C was inserted into the Trade Practices Act in 1997 and commenced operation on 1 July 1997, at the same time as the telecommunications industry was deregulated.
The intention was to allow for competition in the provision of telecommunications services.  Of course, Telstra and previously Telecom has always owned the infrastructure that runs to literally millions of homes and businesses in this country and it was never seriously contemplated that new carriers would all install their own infrastructure.  
Part 11C was enacted to provide a regime through which new carriers could get access to Telstra's lines into those homes and businesses.
Essentially that Part allows the ACCC to determine services to be `declared services'.  After a service has been declared, carriers who provide that service must give other carriage service providers access to the service.
Since the inception of the regime, the contentious issue has always been, not surprisingly, the terms and conditions on which that access is provided.  Most notably, the issue of price has been the major problem.
Part 11C provides 3 alternative means of setting the conditions of access: negotiated agreement between the parties, offering an access undertaking and arbitration by the ACCC.  In the first instance, it is hoped that the parties will be able to agree on the terms and conditions of access to the services.  Alternatively an access provider may offer an access undertaking.  The ACCC must assess this undertaking to ensure it is consistent with model terms and conditions set out in the telecommunications access code or be reasonable and be consistent with the standard access obligations.  Only four undertakings have been submitted to the ACCC, all by Telstra.  They were all rejected because one or more of the conditions was considered unreasonable.  
Ultimately, if the parties can't negotiate an agreement and if there is no undertaking in place for granting access, the terms and conditions must be determined by the ACCC in arbitrating an access dispute.
After the ACCC has arbitrated a dispute and determined the terms and conditions of access, it is open to either of the parties to the dispute to seek merits review of the determination by the Australian Competition Tribunal.
In June 2000, the Productivity Commission was given a reference to inquire into telecommunications-specific competition regulation.  One of the key matters it was to inquire into was the access regime contained in Part 11C.
In its draft report, the Productivity Commission estimates that in a clear majority of cases, at least 80%, terms and conditions for access to declared services are able to be agreed by negotiation between the parties.  However, negotiations have in many cases been difficult and protracted, and have resulted in delays in obtaining access to the services.
The major problem with the regime is that, quite simply, it is slow.  It takes the parties a long time to negotiate - it takes a long term to have services declared - it takes a long time for the ACCC to determine that it will not accept undertakings - it takes a long time for the ACCC to arbitrate disputes.
Some of the submitters to the Committee inquiry into this Bill were of the view that the delays were largely the result of Telstra's actions.  The suggestion was that Telstra has used every possible legal avenue available to it to avoid disclosure of information and to generally delay the process of negotiation and arbitration.
I make no judgments as to whether or not those criticisms are fair.  However, it must be remembered that Telstra is a `for-profit' organisation responsible to its shareholders and if it can legally pursue a course of action to benefit its shareholders, then it will.  It was interesting to hear a representative of a non-Telstra carrier criticise Telstra's behaviour but then admit that if he worked for Telstra, he would advise them to pursue the same course of action.
Rather than directing criticism toward Telstra and saying that Telstra isn't behaving fairly, I think we should be looking at the legislation and the actions and powers of the regulator, the ACCC, to rectify the situation if we think they are currently producing or allowing unfair conduct.
I am pleased that the Productivity Commission has reviewed Part 11C.  I hope that its recommendations will balance the need to expedite processes in relation to the declaration of services and the determination of terms and conditions with the need to preserve the rights of Telstra to seek review of administrative decisions which affect it.
I will refer to just one specific issue raised by the submitters to the inquiry into the Bill.  A number of witnesses thought that the right to obtain a review of the ACCC's arbitration by the Australian Competition Tribunal, should be abolished.  A number of very cogent reasons were presented in favour of abolition of that right of appeal.  The Committee in its report neither agreed nor disagreed with the proposal but said that the appropriate course was to await the findings of the Productivity Commission.  
I wish to make it clear that the Democrats support that position.  The abolition of any appeal right, especially one which relates to an administrative decision of a regulatory body, is a very serious matter.  The Democrats don't have a predetermined position on the issue.  However, we will require clear evidence if it is going to be the case that a single regulatory body will have the final say in arbitrations and the merit of that body's decision won't be subject to review.
—I would like to make some comments about the ALP second reading amendment. Part (a) says:
... the Senate 
(a) notes the lack of effective competition in significant parts of the Australian telecommunications industry ...
The Democrats support that paragraph. We still do not have significant and genuine competition in the local call market and we certainly do not have competition of any degree in most parts of regional and rural Australia. I know that there have been moves to implement competition, or to at least trial competition, in the provision of USOs, but that too seems to have stalled. Perhaps the minister could comment on how those USO pilot areas are going when he sums up in this debate.
Part (b) says:
... the Senate  ...
(b) notes the Government's failure to respond in a timely manner to widespread industry concerns ...
The Democrats do not support that paragraph. The government has made some attempts in the past to finetune the processes for obtaining access to the telecommunications infrastructure. It has perhaps been a case of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic because, in general, the whole negotiation-arbitration process has been slow and arduous. Whether you attribute the delays to Telstra, the ACCC or the access seekers, or to the mere fact that arbitrating these disputes is very complex, I have not seen the ALP or anyone else for that matter put forward serious proposals to significantly speed up the process.
Part (c) says:
... the Senate ...
(c) notes that the cause of the Government's failure to act has been its ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra ...
The Democrats do not support that paragraph. I agree that this government has an ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra, but even if we agreed that there has been a failure to act in relation to the competition regime, I do not think that one relates to the other all that well. In my view, the government would be more likely to push for greater competition in pursuit of selling Telstra. The more competitors it can point to, the better it can say that the regulatory regime is working and the more it can advocate that there is no longer a need for government control of Telstra. We simply cannot see that it is correct to suggest that there is some causation between a desire to sell Telstra and dragging the chain on competition reforms.
Part (d) says:
... the Senate ...
(d) calls on the Government to urgently consider further reform as part of its response to the final report of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into the telecommunications competition regime due next month ...
Again, the Democrats do not support that paragraph. We think it is pretty meaningless. It simply calls on the government to urgently consider further reform; it does not indicate what sort of reforms or whether there should be a modification of the current processes or a complete overhaul of the regime. That Productivity Commission report is due to be handed to the Treasurer on the 22nd of this month, just a few days from now. We will shortly be going into an election and further reform will not realistically take place until early next year. With those comments in mind, I would like to move an amendment to Senator Bishop's second reading amendment. I move:
Omit paragraph (b), (c) and (d)
I have been advised informally that the Labor Party is not prepared to agree to our amendment. If that is the case and my amendment is defeated, I indicate to the Senate that the Australian Democrats will not support the unamended version of the ALP's second reading amendment.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-09-20,"—I note that we do not have a quorum; Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that you note that as well. I thought that this period was for non-controversial legislation. This is the second time during this period that there have been amendments proposed to the legislation. The response from the government to the first one from Senator Murray was that they were opposed to it; the response from the opposition was that they really needed more time for consideration and that this matter ought to be able to be sorted out between the opposition and the Democrats at some future time. That is a nice cosy arrangement. 
I do not know what has happened between the opposition and the Democrats in this particular case. It certainly has not happened to me—I did not know anything about this being proposed during the non-controversial time, unless of course Senator Bishop's amendment is non-controversial. Senator Allison opposes some of it so presumably it is not non-controversial. It should be made very clear that everybody ought to be brought into the ring. We all ought to be in the joke if there is one. I certainly was not brought into the circle. 
I will not call a quorum but I do ask that in future we all be brought into the ring. I see no problem about what has happened, so long as you know beforehand in case you wish to make some contribution to what is, no doubt in the mind of the opposition, an extremely good amendment. It probably is, but I am not in the inner circle. Serves me right—I do not want to be in the inner circle most of the time—but I do represent people and I would be grateful if I were brought into the circle at some stage.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-09-20,"—I fully respect Senator Harradine's determination to maintain his professional maverick status. I assume he has been to too many royal commissions into police corruption when he starts talking about the joke, but I also understand why he would be concerned about what is, I think, a minor derogation from the usual practice.
The main point of concern—and I do not think this was communicated to you, and it should have been—is that the ALP were anxious to have their amendment on the record. I understand that. I think it was already known in advance that it would not be supported, that therefore it would simply be lost on the voices pro forma and that it would then be on the record in the way sought. So I apologise that that particular element of the joke was not shared with you, Senator Harradine, and I am grateful to you for not calling a quorum.
I would like to respond briefly to the amendment itself. We will not be supporting any of the Democrat amendments, much as I welcome Senator Allison's concession that the government did in fact make some pro-competition amendments back in 1999. In terms of ideological obsession, this term appears no less than five times in Mr Smith's speech on the second reading. So clearly the caucus subcommittee thinks this is one of those buttons that if you press it often enough you might get a few people out there responding. I think it is pretty clear who has got the obsession with what. As Senator Allison points out, the logic is somewhat deficient. I am grateful to her for indicating that she thinks that we are more likely than our opponents to press for serious competition. If you look at some of the Knowledge Nation stuff, you will find—
—Well, that's what she said.
—Yes, she did. She said that if you are concerned to dress something up for privatisation you are more likely to want to ensure there is full and robust competition. But the more important point you should also focus on is that if you adopt some of the Knowledge Nation proposals, such as a single national call zone, you will actually chill competition stone dead. You will put every other carrier out of business. So I am grateful for those comments. As far as the Productivity Commission is concerned, we will certainly respond constructively to that. In a spirit of being constructive, what the opposition could do is sign on to Mr Beazley's recommendations—all $163 million worth of them—if that is how you would address the three major issues—
—You could sign on to not privatising—
—Our position is very clear. In respect of Senator Allison's concern about the USO, we are committed to promoting the competitive provision of services through the USO contestability of pilots. These pilots represent an innovative approach whereby subsidies that support the provision of loss making services are also used to create an incentive for telecommunications service providers to enter regional and rural markets. 
More than $65 million in per services subsidies has been made contestable under the government's USO contestability of pilots. Contestability was introduced on 1 July 2001, so it is still too early to judge how successful they might be. They are set to run for three years and competitors can enter the contestable areas at any time during this period. Prior to entering the market, competitors will have to analyse the market, develop a business case, enter into arrangements for services and equipment and possibly even install infrastructure. The current downturn in financial markets has also not helped in making it more difficult for service providers to access the capital necessary to expand into these new markets. Through this important structural change to the regulatory regime, the government has provided the opportunity for all carriers and carriage service providers to compete with Telstra for the USO subsidies. The government will be closely monitoring developments, and it is envisaged there will be an initial assessment of the pilots in December next to determine whether any fine tuning might be desirable.
I would like to make a few remarks about the merits review debate that has been going on. The bill is aimed at streamlining the current competition arrangements. It is clearly not the end of the discussion. The Productivity Commission review will provide an opportunity to consider more wide ranging reforms. No doubt the question of retaining merits review will again be raised in that debate.
The government does not support the removal of merits review at this stage. However, in the context of the Productivity Commission's response, we will again consider the strength of the competing arguments on this matter. We will also look closely at the behaviour of the parties and the extent to which current disputes are being resolved commercially before coming to a decision. In recent days, my concerns about the willingness of all parties to achieve a commercial resolution of the PSTN dispute have been heightened. Therefore, I want to make it plain that the government will not sit idly by and allow early resolution of this issue to be frustrated by manoeuvring for tactical advantage. 
Merits review is meant to provide an opportunity for a second consideration of an ACCC arbitration. It is not meant to be an opportunity for attempting to delay outcomes for commercial advantage or for prolonging industry uncertainty. While the government acknowledges the need for a suitable process to determine the appropriate methodology for the calculation of future interconnect charges, it does not believe there is any good reason why other matters leading to substantial industry uncertainty cannot be resolved in the near future.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. During the second reading debate, two senators—Senator Bishop and Senator Allison—have asked to incorporate their speeches or parts of their speeches. None of these have been circulated in the chamber. I refrain from refusing leave. My point of order is: I believe that, under standing orders or, if not, as a courtesy, members of this chamber should be provided with copies of speeches if leave to incorporate them is requested.
 (Senator Watson)—Leave was granted at the time. I take your point that, as a matter of courtesy, it certainly would be a good idea.
—I take the point raised by Senator Harris. I will make sure a copy of my remarks that were tabled in this bill are provided to your office. I advise you that I do not have sufficient copies here for the next tabling speech on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill but, as you have raised the point, I will make sure a copy is made available to you as soon as I leave the chamber.
—The question is that the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats, removing paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) from Senator Bishop's amendment, be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—The question now is that the amendment moved by Senator Mark Bishop on behalf of the opposition be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
Original question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-09-20,"—As I outlined before, and for the sake of those Independent senators in the room, I will advise that there has been some discussion between the government and the opposition—and I think the Australian Democrats—in respect of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001. This matter was listed at another place on the order sheet. The government sought that it be changed to non-controversial and the opposition has cooperated in that process. We are still keen for our second reading amendment to be put and discussed, so the sin that was committed before is repeated in this instance because I will be seeking leave to incorporate my remarks and then speak to the amendment that has been circulated in my name. I so seek leave.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Today the Senate is presented with a Bill that amends the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The Interactive Gambling Act passed the parliament several months ago in an ill-conceived attempt by the Government to ban Australians from accessing a few reputable and well-regulated Australian casino sites.
Labor outlined a detailed policy response to interactive gambling, which, unlike the Government's ineffective Act, would have seriously limited problem gambling by Australians on the internet. Unfortunately the Government did not follow our lead.
This Bill today addresses some unintentional effects of the Interactive Gambling Act. Had the Government not responded to the considerable criticisms of the Senate Environment, Communications, IT and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry, a good deal more amendment than this would have been necessary, so flawed was the Government's Bill.
My memory of the rather extensive debate in the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 was that Senator Alston said the Government was motivated by one primary or dominant consideration:
·	Not to restrict existing land-based gambling facilities because they were
1.	already in existence and
2.	regulated by the States
·	Prevent further extension of gambling into new areas such as cyberspace as a tool of social policy.
The basic justification put by the government was to at least prevent the further growth of gambling problems in new forms of communications.
During the committee stage of that act the government introduced amendments which prohibited the advertising of interactive gambling services.  Those amendments were agreed to without debate.
One can make a number of points of that new part 7A of the Act relating to the prohibition of advertising of interactive gambling services.
Firstly this appears to be only the second time the Commonwealth parliament has imposed a blanket prohibition on the advertising of a particular product or service.
The only other example or precedent lies in the area of prohibiting tobacco advertising and that legislative prohibition took place only after
·	Extensive community debate
·	Consideration of state and territory laws
·	Review of Commonwealth and state existing policy.
The essential rationale for tobacco advertising prohibition was a community health and protection of children debate.
In any event there was extensive community/press/parliamentary debate.  In part 7A of this Act there was no such debate.
Accordingly one can properly conclude from a government perspective that the prohibitions on advertising are no longer considered a threat to the principle of free speech in this country.
In moving the amendments to the Interactive Gambling Bill on 28 June 01 Minister Alston said and I quote “the advertising ban would only apply to interactive gambling services that are banned by the bill”.
However, it has since come to the government's attention that the Act may inadvertently prohibit the advertising of land-based casinos which also provide interactive gambling services to overseas customers.  Section 61BA (1)(e) defines an interactive gambling advertisement as any writing, visual image or audible message that promotes any words that are closely associated with an interactive gambling service.
If a land-based casino uses its name for its legitimate interactive gambling services, then there is a chance that the name will become closely associated with the interactive gambling service.  This would then prevent the casino from using the name in advertising its land-based services.
So the government policy position behind this bill is clear.  It is to permit not prohibit those land based gambling facilities that also offer interactive gambling services to overseas customers the ability to advertise those services.  This is of course a commercial necessity because it allows the offeror of interactive gambling services to overseas customers the ability to draw upon the brand name of the land-based facility.
This is of course commercial common sense but contrary to the governments stated policy of limiting the spread of social harm by limiting the spread of interactive gambling.
So this bill under discussion today represents the first big backflip over the Interactive Gambling Act 2001.  
The prohibition on advertising was so critical that the government introduced a then new part 7A into the act and it was passed by agreement with the minor parties without parliamentary debate.
We now see the unintended consequences of an intellectually slothful approach to policy making in the form of this amending bill.
So to summarise the position of the government with respect to the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and this amending bill
·	It breaches long standing commitments to protection of free speech
·	It bans the advertising of interactive gambling services to overseas customers 
·	Because it refused to engage in parliamentary debate the government cast its net too wide and now has to bring in an amending bill 
·	This amending bill now permits the advertising of gambling services to overseas customers where such gambling services are associated with land based gambling facilities
·	The policy position behind this amending bill is at complete odds with the policy position as outlined by Senator Alston in the Interactive Gambling Act 2001
·	The amending bill has neither coherent nor intellectual strength as it is counter to the governments stated justification to limiting the spread of gambling on the internet.
The Opposition will not oppose this Bill, however I would like to reiterate the reasons why we believe the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 was a big mistake, why the Government's policy approach is flawed and why the Act is totally inappropriate and untenable. 
My concerns, and I have detailed them before in this place, are as follows:
1.	The Interactive Gambling Act does not prevent Australians from accessing Internet Gambling services.
2.	The easiest sites for Australians to access are overseas sites, some of which are run by criminal and Mafia elements. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity.
3.	Problem gamblers are likely to be the ones who will be desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites, and will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. Strictly regulated Australian sites would have reduced gambling problems more than this Act will.
4.	The Act permits Australians access to internet wagering and wagering is hardly immune from gambling problems.
Turning then to my first point, the Interactive Gambling Act does not prevent Australians from accessing Internet Gambling services. There are a number of reasons for this.
·	The Act stops Australians from accessing the safest sites in the world but allows them to access the most dangerous sites. 
·	If Australians want to access the services of Australian or foreign IGSPs, they are still be able to, even if those IGSPs claim not to accept Australian customers. Australians can still access reputable Australian and foreign IGSPs even if they refuse to accept Australian customers. 
·	The sanction in the Act for providing interactive gambling services to Australians is not a very persuasive deterrent and is unlikely to be enforced. This will especially be the case as the Government has failed to provide additional funding for the already under-resourced Australian Federal Police. 
·	There are significant numbers of disreputable foreign sites of dubious probity which Australians will be able to access. Some gamblers might favour those sites, particularly those susceptible to problem gambling. 
This leads me to my second point that the easiest sites for Australian to access will be overseas sites, some of which are run by criminal and Mafia elements. It is nearly impossible to distinguish reputable sites from those of dubious probity.
Despite the Minister himself stating in a Ministerial media release on interactive gambling that there are “very disturbing examples of how Internet gambling organisations actually feed the addictions of problem gamblers”, it is not Australian gambling operators; rather, it is offshore operators who are engaging in such activity. And the Government has left Australian gamblers at the mercy of these gambling sites that feed addictions.
Australian sites comprise less than 2 per cent of the Internet gambling sites worldwide. Some protection this Act offers.  All the Government has done is prevent Australian gamblers from accessing the strictly regulated sites. 
This leads to my third point that it is problem gamblers that are likely to be the ones who will be desperate enough to circumvent restrictions on accessing Australian and foreign sites, and will most likely fall prey to unscrupulous operators who will not limit expenditure. 
My fourth and final point is that Australians can still access internet wagering. Wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems.
The Government excluded interactive wagering from the Act despite the fact that wagering is as much a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling.
This Government has never been concerned to protect problem gamblers. If it had been so concerned it would have done something during its last two terms to address the real problem - the land-based forms of gambling that are causing huge social problems. 
The Government couldn't even come up with a sensible and effective policy for interactive gambling that would minimise interactive gambling to the greatest extent possible. Even when we told them what it was. They even initiated a Productivity Commission inquiry that said the same thing we did.
The most notable thing that the Act does is prevent Australians from accessing the world's best, safest and most consumer-friendly interactive gambling sites - the Australian ones. 
Wagering is not any safer than any other form of gambling. Wagering is not immune to the social effects of problem gambling. 
The Opposition took a very different approach to the issue of interactive gambling. Our primary concern was and is to ensure that problem gambling arising from interactive gambling is kept to an absolute minimum. 
We remain concerned that the Government's Act will not control or limit problem gambling in the online environment. 
The Opposition continues to believe that the most effective way to manage interactive and Internet gambling is, overwhelmingly, to have State and Territory cooperation in formulating and implementing a national regulatory regime.  
There is no evidence to support the Government's conclusion that its ban will limit problem gambling. 
—I thank the Senate. There is an amendment circulated in my name on behalf of the opposition in respect of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill. I now formally move the amendment:
		At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate:
	(a)	maintains that the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 remains unworkable, internally inconsistent and hypocritical legislation which:
	(i)	does not provide strong regulation of interactive gambling as the most practical and effective way of reducing social harm arising from gambling;
	(ii)	may exacerbate problem gambling in Australia by barring access to regulated on-line gambling services with in-built safeguards but allows access to unregulated offshore on-line gambling sites that do not offer consumer protection or probity;
	(iii)	does not extend current regulatory and consumer protection requirements applying to off-line and land-based casinos, clubs or wagering venues to on-line casinos and on-line wagering facilities;
	(iv)	damages Australia's international reputation for effective consumer protection laws and strong, workable gambling regulations;
	(v)	singles out one form of gambling in an attempt to create the impression of placating community concern about the adverse social consequences of gambling but does not address more prevalent forms of gambling in Australian society; and
	(vi)	is not technology neutral or technically feasible;
	(b)	calls on the Government to show national leadership on this issue by:
	(i)	addressing harm minimisation and consumer protection as well as criminal issues that may arise from on-line gambling;
	(ii)	ensuring a quality gambling product through financial probity checks on providers and their staff;
	(iii)	maintaining the integrity of games and the proper working of gaming equipment;
	(iv)	providing mechanisms to exclude those not eligible to gamble under Australian law;
	(v)	implementing problem gambling controls, such as exclusion from facilities, expenditure thresholds, no credit betting, and the regular provision of transaction records;
	(vi)	introducing measures to minimise any criminal activity linked to interactive gambling;
	(vii)	providing effective privacy protection for on-line gamblers;
	(viii)	containing social costs by ensuring that adequate ongoing funds are available to assist those with gambling problems;
	(ix)	addressing revenue issues that impact upon state government decisions relating to interactive gambling;
	(x)	establishing consistent standards for all interactive gambling operators;
	(xi)	examining international protocols with the aim of achieving multilateral agreements on sports betting and other forms of interactive gambling;
	(xii)	ensuring appropriate standards in advertising, in particular, to prevent advertising from targeting minors;
	(xiii)	investigating mechanisms to ensure that some of the benefits of on-line gambling accrue more directly to the local community;
	(xiv)	working with State and Territory governments to ensure that on-line and interactive gambling operators meet the highest standards of probity and auditing through licensing agreements;
	(xv)	seeking co-regulation of interactive gambling by establishing a national regulatory framework that provides consumer safeguards and industry Codes of Practice; and
	(xvi)	coordinating the development of a co-regulatory regime through the Ministerial Council comprising of relevant State and Federal Ministers”.
Paragraph (i) of the amendment condemns the government for failing to adopt the most practical and effective way of reducing social harm arising from gambling by not choosing to strictly regulate the domestic industry. Instead, the government's Interactive Gambling Act bans a few strictly regulated Australian sites. Paragraph (ii) expresses the opposition's concern that I discussed earlier in my incorporated remarks that the impact of the act may be to exacerbate problem gambling in Australia by barring access to regulated online gambling services with in-built safeguards. The act still allows access to unregulated offshore online gambling sites that do not offer consumer protection or probity, placing those most vulnerable to problem gambling at an alarmingly high risk. As I discussed earlier, it leaves Australians at the mercy of unscrupulous gambling operators who feed addictions.
Paragraph (iii) condemns the government for not extending current regulatory and consumer protection requirements applying to offline and land based casinos, clubs or wagering venues to online casinos and online wagering facilities. Paragraph (iv) expresses the opposition's concern that this act damages Australia's international reputation for effective consumer protection laws and strong workable gambling regulation. Australia has a fine reputation internationally for its regulation of gambling. By failing to regulate this industry, the government is causing further damage to Australia's international reputation.
Paragraph (v) condemns the government for singling out one form of gambling in an attempt to placate community concern about the adverse social consequences of gambling. The government has singled out a form of gambling that has been around for some time now but has not revealed itself as a significant cause of gambling problems. This act was an attempt to detract the public's attention away from the real gambling issues related to more prevalent forms of gambling which the government has done nothing about.
Paragraph (vi) expresses the opposition's view that the act is not technology neutral or technically feasible. Even the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has contradicted his own policy guidelines for the regulation of content of online services that he announced in July 1997 with the act.
Part (b) of the second reading amendment calls on the government to take a new approach, the approach recommended by Labor numerous times over the last 20 months. This is a comprehensive approach that will restrict problem interactive gambling to an absolute minimum, and the elements of our recommended approach may be found in paragraph (b).",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-09-20,"—I put on record that One Nation will not support Labor's second reading amendment. Very briefly, the chamber will remember that in the debate on the Interactive Gambling Bill One Nation moved amendments that would have resolved the issue raised in paragraph (a)(i) of this amendment, in that we moved amendments for Australian based operations to be able to operate offshore and also for no offshore operations to be able to operate out of Australia or for Australian citizens to access them. Those two amendments moved by One Nation would have removed all of the problems that the Labor Party is professing now. Under paragraph (a)(vi) of the amendment, I disagree with the Labor Party in that the information I have is that it is technically feasible to achieve what the government is intending to do, and I note One Nation's opposition to the amendment. ",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-09-20,"—I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001 and in particular the Labor Party for its constructive approach to having these matters disposed of expeditiously. The amendment really is a response to the Interactive Gambling Act, which is already in force. It also needs to be said that the reason for this amendment is that it was never the intention of the act to restrict offline or land based gambling or the advertising of such services. Whilst we remain very concerned about the socially harmful effects of poker machines in casinos, the responsibility for these rests with the states and territories which have allowed them to proliferate. 
We will not support the second reading amendment. We do not support regulation as an alternative to a ban. We note that the states and territories still have not agreed on new national standards. There is no reason to think that they will be able to do that or be any more successful in restricting the growth of new forms of gambling than they have been with poker machines.
Amendment not agreed to.

The statement read as follows—
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee's Report No. 385—Australian Taxation Office Internal Fraud Control Arrangements, Fraud Control in Defence and Defence Estate Facilities Operations.  This is our Review of Auditor-General's Reports for the second and third quarters of 2000-2001.
Madam President, the Committee held a public hearing on Friday, 2 May 2001 to discuss these ANAO Reports with the relevant Commonwealth agencies.  I will briefly discuss issues in each of the selected reports in turn.
Audit Report No.16 examined the Australian Taxation Office Internal Fraud Control Arrangements.  The audit of fraud control arrangements in the ATO forms part of a series of performance audits by the ANAO on the management of fraud control in Commonwealth agencies.
The prevention and detection of fraud within the Commonwealth public sector is not only important to protect Commonwealth revenue, expenditure and property, but also to maintain the Parliament's and community's confidence in the staff and operations of public sector agencies.
The Committee acknowledges that the ATO is moving positively in the areas of fraud control planning and staff education and training.  This is especially relevant for outsourced programs.
The Committee believes that when work is contracted out by an agency, the contractors' staff should be put through the same security checks as the agency's own staff and should have the same level of fraud awareness.  The ATO must actively manage the risks of change, and should have a high awareness of what those risks are.
The Committee is aware that the Attorneys-General have been working with agencies to reach an agreed definition of fraud.  The community understanding of fraud, both in Australia and overseas, would not generally encompass acts such as inappropriate accessing of taxpayer files.  The Committee considers it would be useful for the ANAO, in its preparation of a better practice guide on fraud control, to develop subcategories of fraud to clarify the nature of the fraud for the purposes of fraud reporting.  The Committee has recommended accordingly.
In the second report selected, Audit Report No. 22, the Committee examined the strategies developed for Fraud Control in Defence.  It was cognisant of the fact that there was scope for improvement in Defence's corporate governance with reference to fraud control.  For instance, Defence's Chief Executive Instructions did not comply with the Commonwealth fraud control policy requirement to review its fraud control arrangements every two years.  The audit found that Defence lacked a suitable fraud intelligence capability, thereby making it difficult for Defence to estimate accurately the extent of fraud in or against Defence.
Although the Committee accepts that the amount of fraud detected in Defence has been fairly consistent over the past five years, the Committee questions whether Defence has been as diligent as it could be in detecting fraud, given that its asset register `is not in good shape' and fraud investigation is undertaken in four separate areas:  the Inspector-General's division and the military police in each of the services.
The Committee is not convinced that the financial and administrative systems Defence has in place are sufficient to obtain an adequate organisational view of the occurrence of fraud in Defence.  The Committee recommends that Defence address the shortcomings in its asset registers and develop a fraud intelligence capability.
I now turn to the final ANAO report the Committee reviewed in this quarter—Audit Report No. 26, Defence Estate Facilities Operations,whichsought to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the Defence estate, given its importance in supporting Defence in the achievement of its mission.
The Committee was told that following its creation in 1997, the Defence Estate Office (DEO) had made a significant effort to develop and implement a strategic, corporate-focused framework for the delivery of maintenance work through its Facilities Operations Program.  Initiatives, such as the Comprehensive Maintenance Contract, focus on economies and efficiencies that earlier approaches and/or methods lacked.
Having considered the evidence, the Committee is not satisfied that all the problems have been addressed effectively.  Defence's poor record in contract and project management shows that Defence still has a long way to go before DEO staff are able to effectively exercise their responsibilities for properties and assets with a gross replacement value of $14.8 billion.
May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee, the witnesses who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review process.
The Chairman has asked me to thank my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports.  As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries.
Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-09-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is interesting to note that we have now reached the point in the proceedings where we are discussing the second government document listed on the Notice Paper—that is, the corporate plan of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I have spoken about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and their corporate plan many times. It is interesting that they have tabled their corporate plan for consideration at this time. What is not before the Senate at the moment is the response by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to the order of the Senate of yesterday for the production of documents relating to the Ansett catastrophe by 5 p.m. today, nor has there been an explanation for this. 
Obviously, the minister and the government are quite happy to stand in contempt of the Senate on this matter. They obviously have no intention of explaining to the Senate why they have not met the timetable laid down by the Senate. I remind government senators and the minister that the wording of the return to order is on page 31 of today's Notice Paper. It required the production of documents by 5 p.m. today. I stress that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government had the opportunity to come in here this afternoon and explain why they were unable to meet that timetable or what timetable they were able to meet or give some other explanation for their non-compliance with the order of the Senate. 
They have chosen not to do so. They have allowed the matter to run on. I guess they are expecting that somehow we might forget that this was due today and they would simply get away with not responding to it. I can assure them that that will not be the case. If they think that we are simply going to accept that they will continue to hide from the public the material which is essential for the public to understand just how culpable this government is in relation to the Ansett failure, then they are sorely mistaken. I remind the government that the Senate has authorised the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee to conduct an inquiry into this matter. If they believe that that will not be pursued, then they are also sorely mistaken. 
CASA is one of the bodies that has to be satisfied that Ansett, if it is capable of getting back into the air, is capable of meeting the obligations laid down under the regulations and administered and monitored by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Other aircraft brought into Australia have to be operated in accordance with the provisions of any air operating certificate issued by CASA. The aircraft have to comply with certifications given in relation to aircraft operated in Australia. All of those questions are relevant to what the future of aviation will be in this country. 
In terms of the return to order, it would have been of great interest to the Australian public had the Minister for Transport and Regional Services done as he was required by the Senate and produced any analysis and report prepared by the Department of Transport and Regional Services relating to the application by Air New Zealand to the Australian government for approval to take 100 per cent ownership of Ansett Airlines. It is interesting to note that today Minister Anderson could not get his lines right as to whether his government was favouring Qantas or Ansett or taking an even-handed approach to that matter. The fact of the matter is that the government have done nothing to allay the concerns of the public in relation to this matter and they stand condemned. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-09-20,"—This evening I rise to set straight the matters which pertain to me in this report. I was a full member of the inquiry into the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. I replaced Senator Cooney for the purpose of that inquiry, and I was therefore a full member, with full voting rights. The report that was brought down by the Privileges Committee refers, at paragraph 5, to this fact:
The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee met during a break in estimates hearings, that is, before the article based on the draft report appeared in TheAustralian, to discuss the matter. It made admirably exhaustive but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to discover who might have disclosed the draft report.
I believe that was a meeting that was held on the night of 20 February and I, unfortunately, was not invited to that meeting. The following day I received from the secretary of the committee, Ms Pauline Moore, an email which confirms that very fact. The email says:
Dear Senator Hogg
I am sorry that we did not get in touch with you yesterday about the meeting held last night. This was the result of each of two groups thinking the other had contacted you.
With respect to the letter from Senator Payne—a written response to Senator Payne is required from all those who either had access to the report (the Secretariat) or were sent a copy (Senators and their staff, where applicable).
It goes on to say that the committee will meet to consider the matter. I responded to that email, and my response to Senator Payne, dated 22 February, was as follows:
Dear Senator Payne,
I cannot explain the disclosure.
I was not invited to the private meeting of the Committee held on 20 February and so I am not familiar with the circumstances relating to any alleged disclosure.
Anyway, whatever the circumstances, it wasn't me, if that is what you were asking or wanted to know.
Yours faithfully
John J Hogg
So I made it quite clear in my response that I had not been invited to the meeting of 20 February, when the issue of an unauthorised disclosure of a draft report of that committee had been raised, and nor was I aware of any alleged disclosure.
The report of the Privileges Committee then goes to the issue of the conduct of the inquiry into whether there was a breach of privilege because of the early disclosure of the draft report. On the conduct of the inquiry, the report notes at paragraph 10:
On receipt of the reference, the Committee of Privileges wrote to the editor in chief of TheAustralian, as well as to all current members, and the secretary, of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, seeking comment on the matter. All responses to the committee's letter are included at Appendix B to this report...
Unfortunately, the secretariat of the Privileges Committee for some reason did not write to me. There was no letter to me at all; I was not consulted. When one reads appendix B, one will find that there is a response from Senator Cooney, who at that stage was a participating member of the committee, and you will find no response from me at all.
The real reason I am speaking tonight is to get to the tawdry response of the secretary of the committee—and that is the only way to describe it. The response of the secretary of the committee leaves me outraged and appalled at the unprofessional and scurrilous attack on me, the Clerk Assistant (Committees), Senator Bishop and, undoubtedly, others by innuendo. Let us look at the scurrilous way in which I was attacked. The letter from the secretary of the committee, Ms Moore, to the Chair of the Privileges Committee, Senator Ray, in no way mentions my letter of 22 February to Senator Payne, but says:
I refer to your letter of 13 August on the above matter. The following events may or may not have some connection.
`May or may not'—that is trying to have a go at my character and that of others who are associated with me. The heading reads:
Prior to the unauthorised release of the above report:
I requested the Clerk Assistant (Committees) to advise Senator Hogg that the Secretariat was far too busy to write what amounted to a separate report on issues essentially irrelevant to the inquiry ...
What a hide for them to determine that I do not have the right to a dissenting report if I wish to write it! This is what we have got from this upstart of a secretary of the committee. The letter goes on:
... and that, as this `dissenting' report was being requested long before the Chair's draft was available, as well as being irrelevant, it was contrary to Standing Order 38(2).
So what! I am a member of this Senate and, if I want to put in a dissenting report, I will do so. It then goes on:
I was subsequently advised by the Clerk Assistant that Senator Hogg insisted on the report proceeding—
of course I did; of course I insisted that there be a dissenting report—
and had told the Clerk Assistant this dissent was a `payment of a debt', or words to that effect.
What does that imply about my character and my relationship with the Clerk Assistant (Committees)? This is a load of rubbish. No-one in their right mind would write this. It goes on—and this gets better:
Senator Hogg requested that the Chair's draft, when available, be emailed to Senator Bishop.
Let me say that, in my ignorance at that stage, I thought that Senator Bishop was a participating member of the committee and was entitled to a copy of the report. When it was pointed out to me by the secretariat that that was not the case, fine, I backed off. But let us look at how this is used. It goes on:
As Senator Bishop was not a member of the Committee, Senator Hogg was told by the Secretariat this was not possible.
I accepted that. But then they include a paragraph entitled `After the unauthorised release'. What do we have here? Innuendo after innuendo. It says:
Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him and Senator Collins to discuss it; when they arrived, they were told to return later. Shortly thereafter Senator Bishop left the office.
What do we have—spies running around this place trying to check up who is in whose office? Anyone who knows my office knows that the door is wide open. You look straight into my office. There is no secret about what goes on in my office, and if people want to walk in to talk with me they can. But we get this nonsense from this person who claims to be a responsible and professional member of the secretariat of a committee of this Senate. All I can say is that it leaves a hell of a lot to be desired when they can write this letter and not include anything about the fact that I had written to the chair of this committee—and the secretary of the committee would have been aware of the letter in which I clearly outlined that I had no knowledge of, or no association with, any leaking of any report. To impute that some association between me and Senator Bishop then led to some form of leaking is completely scurrilous, completely unwarranted and, when one reads this within the context of the report, leaves my character open to quite a deal of question which is quite unfounded and quite baseless. I believe it shows that there is a lack of professionalism and a lack of any integrity in the secretariat of that committee. I can understand why that committee must have difficulties in working with the secretariat when they have such a person leading the secretariat.
I believe that an unequivocal apology is due to me. This letter was given under the privilege of parliament, and this is the only place that I have to redress the issue that I raise here tonight. This letter, singly, is a disgrace to this Senate and to a committee of this Senate and I would like to see at some stage a total withdrawal of any inferences in that letter made public by the author of it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,44,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-09-20,"—In taking note of the 100th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges, I refer to page 10 of the report—the page just referred to by Senator Hogg—and read into the record some comments made about me in the last paragraph of the letter dated 27 August by Ms Pauline Moore, the secretary of the committee, to Senator Ray. Under the heading `After the unauthorised release' it says:
Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him and Senator Collins to discuss it; when they arrived, they were told to return later. Shortly thereafter, Senator Bishop left the office.
That is the end of the letter. It seems to me that that raises a number of issues. For the record, I want to state that I never participated in this particular committee report, did not attend any of its deliberations and never had access to or saw the committee report until after it was a public document tabled in this place. It seems that this letter from Ms Moore to Senator Ray raises two issues. Firstly, it is apparently the practice of this committee and this secretary and some or all of her staff members to keep records of the attendance of members of parliament at various offices in this place. How is it anyone's business that a member of parliament, either in this chamber or in the other house, attends the offices of other senators—as they do regularly all day every day—to discuss routine or other business? And why is it the business of the secretary of the committee and her staff to keep written records of the activities of members of parliament in this place and then put them in public documents under privilege? As Senator Hogg said, it is simply outrageous. The apparently grossly improper activities of committee secretariat staff in keeping tabs on the activities of members of parliament should be the subject of an inquiry by the Clerk of the Senate. I formally request that.
The second issue it raises is that of the professionalism and the ability of Ms Pauline Moore to carry out her duties as a member of the staff providing support services to the various senators in this place. I say that because there is a clear implication in her correspondence of improper behaviour by me. She linked attendance at a meeting with later events without a shred of evidence suggesting any such linkage at all. So, in my view, it would be quite pertinent for the Clerk of the Senate to pay heed to this correspondence and the comments that are now formally on the public record and to institute an inquiry into the professionalism of Ms Moore and other persons who may have been involved in these activities and report accordingly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,44,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2001-09-20,"— First of all, I thank Senator Hogg for warning me that he was going to raise certain issues out of the 100th report of the Senate Committee of Privileges. I also indicate to Senator Hogg that there was a failure by the committee to write to him on these matters because we wrote to current committee members and not to people who had been substituted in. This was a failure on my part: not only did I not remember that I suggested that he go on this committee and suggest to Senator Carr that he replace Senator Cooney on it; it completely escaped my mind when all the correspondence came to me to send to existing members. That was an oversight by the chair. I apologise for it.
Secondly, I do not think any member of the committee ever thought that Senator Hogg would be responsible for leaking to that particular journalist. It is inconceivable that a member of the Right faction of the Labor Party would leak a story to a former Centre Left member of the Labor Party—unless you are exceptionally clever! I have to say—and Senator McGauran is present tonight and a honoured member of the Senate Committee of Privileges—that we do have enormous difficulty in tracking down leakers. I have to say—and I have said it for the record before—that leakers of Senate reports are inevitably senators. Let us not cast a shadow of doubt over other organisations, secretariats and all the rest; these reports are inevitably leaked by senators. The odd senator has been caught. We did catch one two or three years ago because he gave a televised press conference leaking the report. He did throw himself on the mercy of the Senate. So it does happen, but normally you do not catch a leaker. If you look at the report, at least one of my colleagues in the Senate was pretty straightforward. He said:
It would appear that the document in question was `leaked', and that such a leak may have been calculated to politically damage a member or members of the Legislation Committee, given the political context and the subject matter at the time. Certainly, that seems a credible theory.
That is code for: there was a Liberal Party preselection in New South Wales and maybe it was leaked for that purpose. Who knows? I do not know. I have no idea who leaked it. I could have a good guess—
—Don't.
—But I will not. You are right: I will not have a guess whatsoever. And Senator Greig, at least, does not have a guess either. But one thing I think he is right about—and I am probably right about—is that it was a senator who had access to the report. As I said, tracking down any leaker is usually beyond the powers of the Senate Committee of Privileges, no matter what talent is therein assembled. 
Could I also say that the committee—and I am not going to go into the discussion of the committee—did receive a letter from Ms Moore. It was noted, I think, by committee members that maybe it was a strange letter. I have to also say that we never had any intention to censor any letters. I think it is our responsibility to publish all the replies unless they are totally defamatory, and I do not think this falls into that category exactly. However, I do not think this is a very wise letter. In the very opening paragraph, the letter states:
The following events may or may not have some connection.
If they do not have any connection, we do not want to hear from the person. The last sentence in the larger paragraph, where the letter mentions `a “payment of a debt”, or words to that effect' is pure scuttlebutt, second-hand hearsay knowledge, and I do not know why it is there. It has no relevance to our inquiries into leaking. As for the reference to Senator Mark Bishop, I have say for the record that, whether or not Senator Bishop is on this committee, Senator Hogg has the right to discuss those issues with Senator Bishop or a staff member any time he likes. There is, of course, a requirement on Senator Bishop not to disclose any of this material, and he would not. But we do discuss issues with colleagues and with staff.
For heaven's sake, we have had plenty of these committee reports find their way into a minister's office and then over to departments, and that does take things a little too far. We have been a bit cross about that over the years when it has occurred, and we have had grave suspicion that some of the minority reports to references committees have been departmental reports, et cetera. But the more innocent explanation is really that the department wanted to be prepared to respond properly. Quite often, we have found that departments do not understand Senate privilege. Many of them have taken education courses of late and have made progress in this regard, and that is quite pleasing. The letter goes on to state:
After the unauthorised release:
Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him ...
Yes, Senator Hogg may well have been busy, but then it goes on to state:
Shortly thereafter Senator Bishop left the office.
So what? He has left my office on a few occasions. Sometimes he has been happy, sometimes he has been unhappy, depending on the nature of our conversation. More often than not, I think he will concede, he has had a very nice coffee there.
—That's right.
—But so what? In summary, we are not in the position of ever censoring the material that comes to us. I do not think that is appropriate. The only time we ever censor material is in a section 5 right of reply, which we are instructed to do—and always in terms of negotiating with the complainant. So we had no choice but to put that letter in our report. But it was a very strange letter. It was one that I think drifted aimlessly all over the place. It is full of innuendo—for what purpose, though, I cannot divine. I think it would have been better not to have come.
One of the things possible here is that the Clerk Assistant may well draw that committee secretary's attention to all of the previous correspondence sent to the Privileges Committee by other secretaries. That would be a very good educative process, to see how all of the other secretaries over the years have responded. Nevertheless, if such a letter had come in and referred to me, I have to say, Senator Hogg, I would have been pretty concerned, as you were tonight.
I would like to finish by saying that we have had a record number of references of leaked committee reports. Really, it is getting beyond the pale. Why do people leak committee reports? They leak them basically for brownie points, don't they? They leak them to pre-empt the rest of their colleagues or to do damage to someone. It is not really a proper procedure to do that to your colleagues. Often it is only to get a bit of publicity a day or two before the report is about to be published.
If you think that you are getting brownie points with journalists by doing it, I can tell you that as soon as you make a mistake they will be the first ones to attack you. They will attack you because they do not even respect you. They do not respect leakers along these lines. They know deep in their own hearts that it is part of their job to obtain this sort of stuff and to publish it. That is part of their job. That does not mean it carries respect with it.
When it is things like in camera evidence it becomes even worse and we wreck the whole committee system that actually is the joy of the Senate. We are all frustrated by aspects of the committee system, sure, but we have to have something productive that at least delineates us from the other place, that justifies our existence. It is little wonder that various parliamentary institutions from around the globe come here to see how the committee system operates—the estimates committees, the standing committees, the references committees and the legislative committees—because rarely is it so accurately defined and effective as in this chamber. Senators have to take responsibility for protecting that committee system, and they will not do so by leaking reports and by leaking the internal discussions within those committees. You would have to say that an overwhelming majority of senators in fact abide by the rules and respect their colleagues.
It is a real disgrace, I have to say in conclusion, that we are up to the 100th report of the Privileges Committee. I cannot remember what the number was when I took over the chairmanship, but I think it was about 55 or 60. We have had all of those cases, the majority of which have been leaking cases. In conclusion, I think these matters can be resolved internally. They had to be raised here. They could be raised nowhere else, because this letter itself was a privileged document.

It has no relevance to our inquiries into leaking. As for the reference to Senator Mark Bishop, I have say for the record that, whether or not Senator Bishop is on this committee, Senator Hogg has the right to discuss those issues with Senator Bishop or a staff member any time he likes. There is, of course, a requirement on Senator Bishop not to disclose any of this material, and he would not. But we do discuss issues with colleagues and with staff.
For heaven's sake, we have had plenty of these committee reports find their way into a minister's office and then over to departments, and that does take things a little too far. We have been a bit cross about that over the years when it has occurred, and we have had grave suspicion that some of the minority reports to references committees have been departmental reports, et cetera. But the more innocent explanation is really that the department wanted to be prepared to respond properly. Quite often, we have found that departments do not understand Senate privilege. Many of them have taken education courses of late and have made progress in this regard, and that is quite pleasing. The letter goes on to state:
After the unauthorised release:
Two of the Secretariat staff working on the dissent went to Senator Hogg's office by appointment to meet with him ...
Yes, Senator Hogg may well have been busy, but then it goes on to state:
Shortly thereafter Senator Bishop left the office.
So what? He has left my office on a few occasions. Sometimes he has been happy, sometimes he has been unhappy, depending on the nature of our conversation. More often than not, I think he will concede, he has had a very nice coffee there.
—That's right.
—But so what? In summary, we are not in the position of ever censoring the material that comes to us. I do not think that is appropriate. The only time we ever censor material is in a section 5 right of reply, which we are instructed to do—and always in terms of negotiating with the complainant. So we had no choice but to put that letter in our report. But it was a very strange letter. It was one that I think drifted aimlessly all over the place. It is full of innuendo—for what purpose, though, I cannot divine. I think it would have been better not to have come.
One of the things possible here is that the Clerk Assistant may well draw that committee secretary's attention to all of the previous correspondence sent to the Privileges Committee by other secretaries. That would be a very good educative process, to see how all of the other secretaries over the years have responded. Nevertheless, if such a letter had come in and referred to me, I have to say, Senator Hogg, I would have been pretty concerned, as you were tonight.
I would like to finish by saying that we have had a record number of references of leaked committee reports. Really, it is getting beyond the pale. Why do people leak committee reports? They leak them basically for brownie points, don't they? They leak them to pre-empt the rest of their colleagues or to do damage to someone. It is not really a proper procedure to do that to your colleagues. Often it is only to get a bit of publicity a day or two before the report is about to be published.
If you think that you are getting brownie points with journalists by doing it, I can tell you that as soon as you make a mistake they will be the first ones to attack you. They will attack you because they do not even respect you. They do not respect leakers along these lines. They know deep in their own hearts that it is part of their job to obtain this sort of stuff and to publish it. That is part of their job. That does not mean it carries respect with it.
When it is things like in camera evidence it becomes even worse and we wreck the whole committee system that actually is the joy of the Senate. We are all frustrated by aspects of the committee system, sure, but we have to have something productive that at least delineates us from the other place, that justifies our existence. It is little wonder that various parliamentary institutions from around the globe come here to see how the committee system operates—the estimates committees, the standing committees, the references committees and the legislative committees—because rarely is it so accurately defined and effective as in this chamber. Senators have to take responsibility for protecting that committee system, and they will not do so by leaking reports and by leaking the internal discussions within those committees. You would have to say that an overwhelming majority of senators in fact abide by the rules and respect their colleagues.
It is a real disgrace, I have to say in conclusion, that we are up to the 100th report of the Privileges Committee. I cannot remember what the number was when I took over the chairmanship, but I think it was about 55 or 60. We have had all of those cases, the majority of which have been leaking cases. In conclusion, I think these matters can be resolved internally. They had to be raised here. They could be raised nowhere else, because this letter itself was a privileged document.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-09-20,"—At the outset of my remarks tonight on the adjournment I place on the record my sincere sympathy and condolences to all of those who lost their lives in that terrible tragedy last week in New York. I particularly wish to acknowledge the death of Andrew Knox of Adelaide, who has already been referred to in other remarks by members of this chamber. Andrew was a former official of the Australian Workers Union, a union that I had the privilege of being an official of and general secretary of for a number of years. I pass on my sincere sympathy to his family and friends. Just as we have seen out of that terrible tragedy in New York the goodness in human spirit rise to the fore with the efforts of the many volunteer service workers such as firemen, police, ambulance officers and thousands of members of the general public of New York to assist in the recovery and rescue operations, I also wish tonight to refer to some work being done by two Australians.
Some weeks ago I was visiting my duty electorates on the North Coast, Cowper and Page. I met Mr and Mrs Barry and Michelle Wicks, who live at Harwood on the Clarence River, just north of Grafton. Senator Ridgeway, who is in the chamber tonight, would know this area very well. Barry and Michelle Wicks are retired people. Barry is a retired boatbuilder. They were distressed by the devastation that was inflicted upon the people of East Timor after the vote for independence there. They were particularly distressed to see the destruction of many thousands of fishing boats and the consequent destruction of the livelihoods of many East Timorese people living in the coastal regions. 
As I said, Barry is a retired boatbuilder. He and Michelle decided that they would try to do something practical to assist the people of East Timor. Barry set about using his skills and the equipment in his garage at home. He put in some capital of his own and last year he commenced building some boats, some canoes, which could be used by the fishermen of East Timor to try to get their lives back together. As part of this project, which has become known as Aussie Boats for East Timor, they also sought sponsorship. Since they first began this project, they have managed to involve community organisations such as Rotary, surf clubs and shire councils, including the Maclean Shire Council near where they live, which have contributed funds and other resources to the project. One of the ironies of the project is that early this year, while Barry and Michelle were involved in building their first couple of boats for delivery to the people of East Timor, major floods occurred in the North Coast region and their property was flooded. It was with some degree of irony that Barry found himself trying to build these boats while his property was under severe flooding. But he pushed on and the first boat, out of a target of 100 boats, was delivered to the East Timorese people earlier this year.
Since then, he was informed that the Chinese government had donated a large number of outboard motors to East Timor. This provided a certain degree of synergy to his project. He then set about redesigning the initial boats that he was intending to build and came up with a design which could incorporate the outboard motors that the Chinese government has donated. He and Michelle have now constructed a number of these boats. The cost is about $1,200 per boat, so it is not a huge amount; but, when you are talking about building 100 of them, of course it adds up. A number of the boats have already been delivered to the people of East Timor.
There is another side to this very generous and practical voluntary work performed by Barry and Michelle Wicks. They have also taken on some local unemployed people, who have been assisting with the project. In the process, Barry has been teaching them skills such as how to operate machinery, some basic woodwork skills and boatbuilding skills. Michelle, who runs the administrative side of this project, has been teaching these people some computer skills. So there is a positive spin-off from this project to assist local unemployed people in the region.
Tonight I want to put on the record my immense thanks to Barry and Michelle and also to give public acknowledgment to what I believe is a very worthwhile project. As I have said, they are intending to produce—and are well on the way—over 100 of these canoes, which will be sent through to East Timor and will certainly restore the livelihoods of many of the fishing people there. There is an old saying that I am sure we are all aware of: if you give a person a piece of fish, you can possibly feed them for a day; but if you teach them to fish, or provide them with the means to fish, you can feed them for a lifetime. That is what Barry and Michelle have done: they have given back to these people a means to earn their livelihoods.
Their work has been acknowledged by the newly formed Fisheries and Marine Environment Service of East Timor. Mr Richard Mounsey, the United Nations Principal Fisheries Adviser, wrote to Barry and Michelle in June this year:
Dear Barry and Michelle Wicks,
The Fisheries staff of East Timor's newly formed Fisheries and Marine Environment Service (FMES) thank you both for your efforts to help the poorest fishermen in East Timor. The fishing group in Fatu Hada also thank you most sincerely.
The new boat (fatty) is performing well and the fishing group testing it are reporting that they now have a real chance to get back on their feet. Three families are operating the boat and they are feeding themselves, putting some money away for future repairs and maintenance, able to buy basic fishing gear and still make a modest income ... They also believe things will get better as they learn new skills and can afford better gear.
It is a project that I believe we should all give great support to. I understand that approaches for assistance have been made to government departments including AusAID but as yet it has not been forthcoming. Indeed, I wrote to AusAID at the end of August—27 August, I think—asking them why they had not provided any assistance to this most worthwhile project. To date I have not received a reply and I hope that I get one soon. I commend to the Senate this most worthwhile project which is helping the people of East Timor.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Aussie Boats for East Timor</title>,Adjournment,46,1
