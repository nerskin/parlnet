"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—When we adjourned last evening, we were having an important debate in the committee stage on an amendment to the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 that I think was moved by Senator Kerry Nettle. 
—No. We had already voted on that.
—We had voted on that, had we? I came into the chamber just after that.
 (Senator Ferguson)—We had voted on that. The amendment was negatived, I am informed.
—I thought it would be useful to make a few remarks while the opposition spokesman came into the chamber, unless Senator Lees or Senator Nettle have questions they want to proceed with straightaway.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-11,"—I, and also on behalf of Senators Harradine, Harris and Murphy, move requests (1) to (3) on sheet 4189:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments—
(1)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 14), omit “$500”, substitute “$300”.
(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 18), omit “$1,000”, substitute “$700”.
(3)	Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (line 7), omit “$500”, substitute “$300”.
Statement pursuant to the order ofthe Senate of 26 June 2000
The effect of the amendments will be to reduce the amount of the thresholds for the extended medicare safety-net. The methods of calculation of the safety-net for families and for individuals are set out in clauses 10ACA and 10ADA of this bill.
This increase in payments will have the effect of increasing expenditure under a standing appropriation in section 125 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the amendments are therefore presented as requests.
Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000
The Senate has long accepted that an amendment should take the form of a request if it would have the effect of increasing expenditure under a standing appropriation in an Act amended by the bill. This request is therefore in accordance with the precedents of the Senate.
These are simple requests to change the safety net. They change the $500 limit for those who have concession cards—basically for those people who also have tax benefit A—down to $300, and they change the top limit from $1,000 down to $700 for other Australians.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-11,"—I will comment specifically on the safety net, which is being reported as providing benefit to possibly 450,000 people. It is worth pointing out something that I know Senator Lees acknowledged this morning. In terms of how many people should benefit from any Medicare legislation, one option was that we could have, as we now have, 450,000 people benefiting from the safety net. But the option we could have had was 20 million Australians benefiting by increasing bulk-billing for the GP rebate for all Australians, for ensuring the universality of the system. I know that Senator Lees has acknowledged that, both yesterday in the chamber and in the morning. She conceded that the deal that had been brokered created a two-tiered health system, saying that she was concerned that we still do not have bulk-billing for everyone and that Medicare needs another $1 billion.
I know that the other Independent senators are concerned about this as well. We had Senator Murphy in the chamber yesterday saying that he supported universality. If these are the intentions of the Independent senators—to look after universality because people are concerned about there not being increased bulk-billing for all Australians—why are we here at the moment discussing a deal that has already been made? It has given the coalition the opportunity to go to the federal election having had something to say on health and having got legislation through the Senate.  
Of course, there are benefits for the Independent senators, and it is worth looking at some of the commentary that is running in the papers today from people watching these issues. In today's Daily Telegraph, Malcolm Farr commented:
The Government yesterday sent a sign to NSW, Victoria and Western Australia: elect an Independent senator.
That was an astute comment in relation to the deal that we are currently discussing. In today's Age, Michelle Gratton commented that the Independent senators have done the government a `double favour' and said:
The payoffs for their individual needs are blatant.
That was another astute comment on what we are dealing with here. It is worth reminding ourselves that the other option was to maintain the universality of the system.
For less money than the cost of the amendments that have been put forward to this package, we could have increased the GP rebate across the board. The decision was clearly made by those who were negotiating this deal. It was something that Senator Lees spoke about yesterday in the chamber when we were talking on this issue, saying, `We lost universality when the disallowance went through, so this is the path we are continuing down.' The Greens do not think that we should just sit down and say, `We've lost universality. Let's give up. Let's forget this concept of having universal health care.' But that is the decision that has been taken. This morning on the radio, we heard one of the architects of the Medicare system, John Deeble, saying that his system of universal health care was officially dead. Thank you to the four Independents and the government for ensuring that the system of universal health care is officially dead, in the words of one of the architects of the system.
That is what has been brought into the Senate. That is what we are here debating. That is part of what the amendment here is about. Four Independent senators have decided they are more interested in getting little wins in each of their states, in increasing their capacity for re-election when we get to the next election than in having a universal public health care system. And the government has decided that this is the way that it is going to make future decisions about the planning for public health in this country—that is, pander to the interests of four different states, ensure that a child in New South Wales who is, say, 17 years old does not get the same benefit as children in Tasmania. That is the decision that has been made by the government and the four Independents, and that is the situation we are faced with.
The Greens do not think that we should just sit down and say, `We've lost universality—no worries about that. Let's just continue on down the path that the government has.' This is handing the government a victory on this issue—getting their Medicare legislation through the Senate. And for what? Not for the future of public health care in this country; that is for sure. There are a couple of little wins in the states. I just do not think it is worth it. But that is the decision that has been made, that is where we are at and that is what part of these requests for amendment is about.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-11,"—Obviously, I have to disagree most strongly with most of what Senator Nettle has said. Again, she is confusing the issue of the $5 and the $7.50, which all four of us have said we would have preferred to have stretched further. This government was simply not going to. That went through last year. Senators, you are well and truly aware of that. The $5 for some and not for others was passed in this chamber with only two senators dissenting in December last year. The issue we are dealing with today is that of the two new safety nets. The safety net the Labor Party put into Medicare when they designed it is out of date. It does not work for most people who have large medical expenses. They do not reach eligibility for it because you can count only the difference between what you get back from Medicare and the schedule fee. If the schedule fee is $100 and you get $15 back, that is fine. But, if the schedule fee is $100 and you are charged $200, you cannot count at the moment that additional $100. That is why we need new safety nets. 
The four of us have managed to drag down the safety net from $400 to $300, and fix it at $300, which means that those people who have large out-of-pocket expenses—and some 12 million family units are in the group eligible for the $300 safety net—can get 80 per cent of them back. I say to Senator Nettle: even if last year this chamber had been able to get the government to offer across the board a $5 incentive for every bulk-billing service, we would still need the safety net because only 10 per cent of the safety net covers additional GP charges. The rest of it goes to addressing the cost of attending specialists, and there is nothing before us from this government to encourage bulk-billing from specialists or to even help people cope with what specialists charge by way of extra fees. The safety net is primarily not for GP out-of-pocket expenses but to help people with the huge amount they pay when, for example, they need radiology, surgery, an anaesthetist et cetera. The issue we are dealing with today is whether we stick with the old safety net in Medicare—which is not adequate—or put in two new safety nets that give Australian families greater security and at least the opportunity of getting 80 per cent of additional costs back if they reach the threshold.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be opposing Senator Lees' requests for amendment. I want to make a few general observations on that and on the debate more generally. I am a political pragmatist. I understand the way the Senate works. I am not one generally to accuse people of dirty deals et cetera when numbers are gathered around a particular proposition. Politicians, members of the Senate, make a decision to vote one way or another based on their own political judgment. On this occasion, the four Independent senators have decided to join with the government to put a package to the Senate. That is their right. I leave aside the issue that does get to me a little, which is that two of them were elected not actually as Independents but to represent either the Australian Labor Party or the Democrats. I have no concern for Senator Harradine's or Senator Harris's positions—they were elected as either an Independent or for One Nation, and they represent their views in this place. That is purely an aside which sticks in my craw a bit.
My great concern, and Labor's great concern, is that this fundamentally undermines the universality of Medicare. I do not think that is an easy proposition to argue to the Australian public. It is a complex concept, and I think it will be understood properly only in limited circles by people concerned with the health debate. What people do understand is that they cannot get access to bulk-billing doctors anymore, and what they need to understand about this package is that that is not going to improve. The government made it clear that it does not expect, and has not planned on, any rise in the number of bulk-billing consultations as a result of the package. The government is about changing the fundamental structure of Medicare from a universal health system for all Australians to a welfare safety net approach where it will provide services to those most in need through the public system but will promote the private system as its primary health care response for the majority of Australians. I have great difficulty with that. 
This package fundamentally undermines the universality of Medicare—that is, the universal public health system we have established in this country that is the envy of most countries in the world. It provides basic fairness and equity of access to health care for Australians. My concern with this package is not with its detail but with that fundamental attack, and that is Labor's major concern. Senator Lees seeks to talk about the existing safety net and about some of the arguments on the margins. I understand that. She has to defend the position she has negotiated. We said at the start we were moving to a two-tiered system; we are moving to a multi-tiered system, where we have a range of safety net arrangements and special deals. We are now in a position where Medicare works differently in Tasmania from the rest of Australia. This is supposed to be a universal health system, but it is a system which is predicated not on health need but on location, location, location. It is nonsense to say that we are preserving the universality of Medicare by endorsing this package. It is just not right. Those of us who think universality is a fundamental tenet of Medicare will oppose the package.
I understand that the Independents are faced with a political issue of the government wanting to get its bill through. There is no doubt the government has changed its position markedly. You have to give the Independents their dues; they have negotiated over the last six months or so from a $900-million package to a $2.8-billion package. I suspect that is a reflection not just of the Independents' negotiating skills but of the political position the government finds itself in, of the pressure it is under not only in health care but in its general political position. The government's answer is to throw some more money at the problem, but fundamentally its position remains the same. It does not support a universal health care system like Medicare. It never has. Despite the rhetoric, every measure the government takes—be it in private health insurance or in this package—fundamentally moves towards undermining that system. We have been having that ideological debate with the government for 20 years. It will go on. I think in this debate we are the pragmatists and the government is the ideologue. Certainly the Prime Minister is the ideologue in this debate. Fundamentally, this package undermines the universality of Medicare and we will be opposing it.
There are a range of other issues that cause concern. I have no trouble with Independent senators negotiating positions, but this sort of Americanisation of Australian politics, with special deals for states based on who you are negotiating with, is a retrograde step. I know we are supposed to be the states house, but special deals for Queensland university places or for Tasmanian children is not a helpful development in Australian politics. I have always argued that we are not the states house and that we are here to represent those people who elected us. I have always thought we ought to, and have encouraged us to, look at national responses and at what is in the nation's best interest and not operate purely on a narrow state basis. The fact that this package reeks of special deals, political fixes and rewards for those negotiating so they can go home and sell the package undermines confidence in the Senate and in democracy. It is an Americanisation of the political process that I do not think is a good thing and, although I understand the political realities, I do not support it. 
I think this is a political fix. I have no difficulty with people negotiating such results—that is the way this place works. But in the end Senator Lees and Senator Murphy here yesterday effectively said, `We accept that this is going to undermine the universality of Medicare. We accept that there are valid criticisms of the package, but we have decided to make the deal anyway—oh, and by the way there is an election coming up and whoever wins the election can fix it if they're not happy.' In other words, they were turning to the Labor Party and saying, `You'll get the chance to fix it if you are elected.' I do not think that is an excuse. They have to take responsibility for their actions today, and what they have negotiated is not an appropriate response. I do not think they have done enough to protect the key elements of Medicare and the services it provides for all Australians. We ought to be talking about clinical need, we ought to be talking about access to health services not being prejudiced by lack of income and we ought not to be focusing particularly on where any Australian lives with regard to what sort of access or services they get. We have always argued they ought to get equal access.
For the range of reasons I have expressed Labor remain opposed to this package. There are some improvements in the package—there is more money going into health, which is good thing, and there is some access to allied services, which is a good thing—but these improvements are very limited and do not address the fundamental criticisms of the structure of the package, which will eventually undermine Medicare as a universal health system in this country. We reject the approach, we reject the requests sponsored by Senator Lees and we will be voting against them.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—I will make a quick response to some of the contributions made to date. Firstly, both the MBS and the PBS already have qualities—for example, the PBS safety net—which are two-tiered. I think that was agreed on and voted for by everybody in this place. The concessional payments threshold is currently $196 and for all other patients it is $720. So this parliament already supports a two-tiered access to benefits within the medical schemes. Already in the Medicare scheme developed by Labor and introduced by Neil Blewett in 1984 there are two levels of support: people who are bulk-billed and people who are not bulk-billed. But with these thresholds, you have universal access to it. This will be undeniably of great assistance to hundreds of thousands of families.
We expect that between 450,000 and 490,000 families—which I think was mentioned at the press conference yesterday—every year will get access to new health care because of these proposals. That is a fundamental support of publicly funded health care. Contrary to Labor's claims that we are undermining it, we are building it up. You cannot say you are undermining the Medicare scheme when you spend an extra $2.9 billion on it—you are supporting it. That irks Labor. It is a far more informed and intelligent policy than theirs. You only need to look at Labor's on-the-run policy response to areas of low bulk-billing rates. I think their idea was to have Medicare bulk-billing hit squads.
Senator Nettle raises the issue of how people may have differential access to the bulk-billing of services across Australia. You have that at the moment. In Tasmania the bulk-billing rate across the state is 51.3 per cent and in New South Wales it is 76.3 per cent. We are applying the extra $7.50 rebate in non-metropolitan areas across New South Wales, so people in New South Wales will get a benefit from that. I presume the Greens will support Labor's policy—it will be interesting to see. They support Labor's policy on getting rid of the 30 per cent private health care rebate. 
Senator Nettle made two points that need to be responded to. One is that Labor will be providing a special level of service. I guess it will be targeted at marginal seats or whatever; where the Medicare hit squads will go will be announced during the elections. If it is based on the Ros Kelly sports rorts whiteboard strategic process, the Medicare hit squads will probably go to the marginal seats. I presume the people who live near those Medicare hit squads will, under Labor's plan, get better access to the benefits of Medicare than the people who do not. Through its policy of hit-and-run bulk-billing Labor will create a two-tiered system: people who live near the hit squads will get better access and people who live away from them will get worse access.
Labor's argument is that this is getting rid of universality. It is not; it is actually underpinning universality, making it stronger, putting in place new safety nets. Labor, if you accept its argument, has effectively done the same thing in a different way—in a ham-fisted way I have to say, not a strategic way, unless it just wants to play cheap politics. If you accept the journalist's point of view that Senator Nettle read out this morning about electing Independent senators in WA or other states, one thing is for sure. If the voters in Western Australia vote for a Green senator they will assure the passage of Labor's legislation—that is, if Labor gets up in the lower house, and let us hope it does not, for the sake of the health care of Australians. If Labor did happen to get a majority in the House of Representatives and were able to form a government over there, and Western Australians, for example, voted Green in the Senate and sent over another Green senator, they would vote for Labor's legislation to get rid of the 30 per cent private health care rebate. If you want to guarantee that the 30 per cent rebate is not universally available, then you will vote Green in Western Australia. We have that on the record now. It is a point that needs to be made.
A strong Medicare with good, new safety nets helps people, particularly those most in need. Who are those people? They are people on low incomes who cannot get access to physios or podiatrists or dieticians now because they cannot afford them. This package and the very requests we are negotiating today assist those people through the allied health care measures and the cutting in of the out-of-pocket expenses threshold safety nets. The package helps people with chronic illnesses and complex illnesses and people on low incomes.
Senator Nettle's approach is, `We do not want to help those people.' She is actually saying, `We do not want to help them. Let them suffer. But let's go to areas where there are already high bulk-billing rates, say in New South Wales'—because that is the state she represents—`and give them another $5.' What a brilliant policy! Senator McLucas was the chairperson of the committee that handed down the multiparty report. In relation to the policy that Senator Nettle now supports, that report on page 20 of the introduction or summary states:
The committee is not convinced of the need to substantially increase the level of the MBS rebate and has reservations as to whether doing so would of itself improve levels of bulk-billing. It is clear that other incentives are also required.
The agreement of the majority of senators in this place is that her policy would cost a lot of money and probably would not work. We have accepted that to the extent that we believe that other incentives are clearly required, and that is what this package delivers. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-03-11,"—I want to take issue with something Senator Nettle said. She was quoting Malcolm Farr in this morning's Daily Telegraph, who said that if you elect an Independent senator you are going to do really well based on this deal. I have to commend Senator Harradine on the exceptionally good deal that Tasmania has got, but I disagree with the view that Queensland is getting a very good deal out of this package, because it is not.
The minister's press release makes it clear that the new bulk-billing incentive of $7.50 per consultation will be available for RRMA 3 to 7. That excludes towns with a population of greater than 100,000 people. In my state of Queensland, that excludes Brisbane, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast and Townsville. I have just come from a radio interview with Peter Lindsay, the federal member for Herbert. Apparently, he is marching straight into Brendan Nelson's office as we speak to ask why Townsville is not included in the bulk-billing incentive scheme. That is very interesting because Townsville's bulk-billing rate in 2003 for the federal seat of Herbert was 61 per cent. The bulk-billing rate for Cairns was 75.9 per cent. The bulk-billing rate for Mackay was 63.6 per cent. We now have the anomaly that Townsville, which has a lower bulk-billing rate than Cairns and Mackay, is going to get a lower incentive for its doctors to bulk-bill. What is going to happen in Townsville? Townsville's bulk-billing rate is going to fall further.
In the metropolitan areas of Brisbane, in the southern part of Queensland, we have seen the biggest fall in bulk-billing rates for any part of Australia. Let me read through some of them—particularly for the benefit of the Liberal members in the other chamber—because they are all marginal Liberal seats. In Dickson the bulk-billing rate has fallen by 30 per cent in the last three years and now sits at 48 per cent. In Petrie it has fallen by 30 per cent and now sits at 57 per cent. In Griffith it has fallen by 28 per cent. In Fisher, up on the Sunshine Coast, it has fallen by 27 per cent. In Fairfax, also up on the Sunshine Coast, it is down 22 per cent. In Ryan, the electorate where I live, it is down by 25 per cent to 49 per cent.
This package and the concessions negotiated overnight do nothing for metropolitan Brisbane. They do nothing for the Sunshine Coast. It might surprise senators to know that the Sunshine Coast is a socioeconomically poor part of Queensland, because so many lower income people and unemployed people live there. This package and the concessions do nothing for that area, which has had one of the biggest falls in bulk-billing rates in Australia. The package does nothing for Newcastle—which, whilst not in my state, I visit regularly—where there have been some of the biggest falls in bulk-billing rates in Australia. In the electorate of Shortland the bulk-billing rate has fallen from 76 per cent to 51 per cent in the last three years—a fall of 24.5 per cent. But these areas are excluded from the extra bulk-billing concession. This package provides a concession to a lot of places that do not need it.
Senator Campbell talked about the bulk-billing rate in regional Western Australia. He might be interested to know that in 2003 the bulk-billing rate in the seat of Pearce was around 70 per cent and in Kalgoorlie it was 61.3 per cent. However, the bulk-billing rate in Canning, which is in a metropolitan area, was 54.2 per cent. Now, 54.2 per cent is a lot lower than 70 per cent or 61.3 per cent; but Canning's residents are not getting an extra concession out of this deal—they are screwed. In my state, Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast, the Gold Coast and Townsville—the poor, struggling federal member who represents Townsville is likely to become the ex-federal member soon—are screwed as well. I disagree strongly with Senator Nettle's view that Queensland has done well out of this. We have had the biggest fall in bulk-billing rates of any state in Australia over the last three years, yet we are being comprehensively screwed in this package. 
There is not a single new concession in this package, negotiated overnight, to actually fix the bulk-billing rate in Queensland. All we will have to rely on is the $5 in the original MedicarePlus package which was to go to the bulk-billing of children, pensioners and concession card holders. That means doctors will simply stop bulk-billing other patients. The maximum bulk-billing rate in Queensland—assuming all of those patients are bulk-billed—is probably about 60 per cent, which is lower than the 67 per cent bulk-billing rate that we have now. That really worries me because there are an awful lot of families in my home town of Brisbane who are not going to be able to afford to pay the gap fees. This is rapidly becoming more prevalent across the Brisbane metropolitan area. It is quite clear that the concessions negotiated overnight are not going to do enough to bring those bulk-billing rates back up.
I am very disappointed in this deal. There were apparently two packages in the health minister's in-tray last week: there was one from the Democrats and there was one from the Independents. The Democrats' package, replicating an element of Labor Party policy, would have provided a bulk-billing incentive to every doctor who reached an agreed target—we were looking at a target of around the 75 per cent or 80 per cent mark. It would have ensured that those doctors doing the right thing, regardless of where they were, actually had an incentive to bulk-bill. The government would have been saying to doctors: `It's not just the worthy poor that are worthy of a concession. If you do the right thing and are universal in your bulk-billing approach, then we'll look after you.' That would have provided a much stronger floor to the bulk-billing rates in Australia than only providing extra incentives to bulk-bill concession card holders, under 16-year-olds and pensioners. It certainly would have provided a much stronger floor in the areas where the bulk-billing concessions are needed rather than simply giving it to country areas. I will be interested to see how Senator Harris defends carving out the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville and Brisbane from the bulk-billing concession he has negotiated. The alternative package in the health minister's in-tray would not have carved out those areas.
I want to deal with the anomaly of Hobart. I commend Senator Harradine on his negotiation skills, because the bulk-billing rates in Hobart are 51.5 per cent for Franklin and 47.4 per cent for Denison. It is the only one of the RRMA 2 towns in Australia included in the bulk-billing concession package. But if you go to a town we all know very well, a town called Canberra, you find that the bulk-billing rate is 35 per cent in Bob McMullan's Fraser electorate. Tony Abbott argues that Hobart needs an incentive because its bulk-billing rates are so low, so why doesn't that apply to Canberra as well? Importantly, why doesn't it apply to Newcastle, where the bulk-billing rates in Shortland, Hunter and Paterson are similar to the bulk-billing rates in Hobart? Why doesn't it apply to those areas in Brisbane, such as the electorate of Dixon—based on the Pine River shire on the northern side of Brisbane—which have a bulk-billing rate of less than 50 per cent? Why doesn't it apply to those areas of suburban Adelaide, such as the federal electorates of Boothby, Mayo and Sturt, which have bulk-billing rates similar to or lower than those of Hobart? I am disappointed in Senator Lees. She usually does her homework, but in this particular case she has forgotten to do her homework on her own backyard of suburban Adelaide. 
These are the sorts of issues that the chamber needs to tease out in this debate. The Hobart anomaly is going to be something that we will all have to look at because the justification given by the health minister for the Hobart anomaly does not stack up when you look at the bulk-billing rates. This debate should be about the universality of Medicare, as Senator Evans and the Democrats have always said in this debate; it should be about making sure that Medicare provides a universal safety net for all Australians who need access to health care. It should not be about dividing the population into the worthy poor and the rest. Yet this package—the bulk-billing incentives which are being negotiated and the two-tier safety net which we now debating—actually does that. If we had a decent safety net, if we had a decent incentive program on bulk-billing rates, the safety net would not be as necessary as it is. That is the argument that has been put by the public health alliance around Australia for a very long time. But in this package the safety net will become more and more necessary because bulk-billing rates will continue to fall. The 30 per cent fall in suburban Brisbane will accelerate over the next year or two because there is not enough in this package to encourage doctors in Brisbane to bulk-bill—in fact, there is no extra incentive to bulk-bill. As a result, we will put more pressure on the safety net. The two-tier approach will undermine the universality of Medicare, which has been a cornerstone of our health policy in this country for 20 years.
I am very disappointed with this deal. I thought that, given the Senate committee report and all the evidence that was available to the rest of the crossbench, the government and the Independents would understand these arguments. Unfortunately, with the exception of Senator Harradine, who has done very well for Tasmania, we have a package which leaves metropolitan Australia and the large towns of the Sunshine Coast, the Gold Coast, Townsville, Wollongong, Newcastle, Canberra and Geelong comprehensively screwed. It is very unfortunate and very disappointing. This package is going to put back Medicare and it will probably be the most retrogressive step in Medicare's 20-year history.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-03-11,"—I am going to use a cliche in responding to the requests for amendment to the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 that have been moved by me, Senator Lees, Senator Murphy and Senator Harradine. This cliche is `comprehensively screwed'. If we want to have a look at what is being comprehensively screwed, then we should look at the figures. This is the absolute classic example of what you can do with figures.
Let us have a look at the proposal being put forward by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens—that is, a $5 payment right across the board. Let us have a close look at the outcome of that. Senator Cherry has given us some examples of bulk-billing rates in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. But he fails to admit and disclose to the chamber that in those areas there are some extremely high-volume bulk-billing clinics. When the figures from those high-usage clinics are put into state averages, you arrive at the figures that Senator Cherry has put forward. If you look at the figures provided by the department, you will see that, if the $5 payment were made right across the board, more than 80 per cent of the funds would go to those high-volume bulk-billing clinics that already have rates above 80 per cent. But Senator Cherry does not tell you that. He gives you bulk-billing figures that are brought down by state averages.  
What has been proposed by the government in conjunction with One Nation, Senator Harradine, Senator Lees and Senator Murphy is a lifting of the bulk-billing rates to 70-plus per cent not just in Queensland but in every state. So my comment about comprehensively screwing figures is very apt. When you want to you can get them to provide the answer you want. That leads me to the next point that we need to raise. There has been some very skilful use of answers given in the chamber last night. I quote directly from the Hansard.Senator Allison asked the minister:
Is it possible for me to ask at the same time about the inflationary—
I emphasise the word `inflationary'—
assumptions that were built in for the $300 and $700 thresholds for GPs and specialists? 
The answer provided by Senator Ian Campbell was:
The first half of the question related to inflationary assumptions. The assumptions that were made, broadly, were that bulk-billing rates will be maintained and that the gap will be maintained in broad and general terms.
I do not want to put words in Senator Ian Campbell's mouth but he is clearly saying that, when the department assessed the inflationary tendency of the increase in bulk-billing, the government was conservative in its assumptions and did not add into that increases in bulk-billing. The answer from Senator Ian Campbell was specifically to the inflationary expectation in relation to the $300 and $700 levels. I now move to Senator Nettle's question to the minister: 
I ask the minister about his previous answer to Senator Allison. He said that the assumption is that bulk-billing will not increase. Is that the assumption for the government's model of the future of public health in this country—Medicare and bulk-billing? Are we basing it on an assumption that there will be no increase in bulk-billing rates?
Here we have a very skilful use of an answer. The minister gave the department's assessment of inflationary tendencies with the $300 and $700 levels, and it is being misused to create an assumption that the government does not support bulk-billing. Nothing could be further from the truth. You will see from the Hansard that the answer was given in relation to the inflationary assumptions. But Senator Nettle's question—and I will do a little speculation here—in all probability is intended to be used in an election period. And there we have the answer.
The requests that we have put forward are to reduce the government's original position on the $500 and $1,000 thresholds. We looked at the additional people who would benefit from that and, by the year 2007, that will be as high as 490,000. As was said here last evening, the moment this bill is given royal assent, 33,000 people who have already reached the $300 safety net will immediately be reimbursed 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses. 
For a person or a family who has had out-of-pocket expenses in the vicinity of $1,000, they are left with $700 out-of-pocket expenses after the $300 threshold is removed. The moment this bill is given royal assent, they will receive a rebate of $560. This is what the government and the senators on the crossbenches who support this legislation have taken into consideration. We are here to help people in need. We are not here to see 80 per cent of the additional funds go into bulk-billing when that will not increase those levels across the states.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I would like to speak broadly about what has occurred in the past 24 hours and to express my disappointment at the deal that has been struck between Independent senators, some of whom have very publicly defended Medicare in the past. What we have now is a system that is not Medicare. Medicare is dead, according to Professor Deeble today, and it is on the heads of those four people who have said that we can give up the thing that has made Australia's health system internationally recognised as the best health system in the world. 
We have seen Medicare slowly dismantled over the last eight years. It has been slowly pulled away because the Prime Minister could not say what he thought—that Medicare is not a fair system. That is what he thinks. He does not think that Medicare is a system that should be supported. So, instead of doing what he wanted to do in the 1980s—instead of saying openly and plainly to the Australian people that he was going to get rid of Medicare—he has done it in this underhand way. He has pulled apart the health care system that Australians trust and believe in. Yesterday was the death knell for Medicare. Yesterday we saw the end of a universal health insurance system that treated people according to their health needs and not according to what they had in their pockets.
Medicare was simple and fair. Whether you lived in Burketown or in Bankstown, you were treated according to your health needs. Now we have a system whereby a person who makes a decision to go the doctor has to understand what the EPC means, what RRMA means and whether their doctor lives in a RRMA 2 or a RRMA 3 zone. These are not issues that people want to make decisions about when they go to the doctor. They do not know whether they are on the FTBA or whether they are on a $300 threshold or a $700 threshold. If they have a sick kid, they want to go to the doctor and they want a bulk-billing doctor. Those days are gone—they are finished—and it is on the heads of those four people who have said they will support the Prime Minister's dismantling of Medicare.
We are now faced with a complex and confusing health care system, when we had a system that was internationally recognised as the best. What have we got for it in Queensland? That is a very interesting question. A deal has been done in Queensland such that James Cook University will get an extra 12 medical student places. As a North Queenslander, and knowing the quality of graduates from James Cook University, of course I accept that—of course I think that is a fantastic thing—but let us look at the detail. Let us be really clear about what Senator Harris has got for North Queensland. He has given up Medicare, apparently for 12 medical school places. I will ask some questions about those 12 places later. I certainly hope that we do have the data on them, because I do not know whether it is 12 places or two. If we have given up Medicare for two medical places at James Cook University, it is not a really good deal. We have not done very well in Queensland.
Let us look at the other states. Why is it that the whole of Tasmania can get the bulk-billing incentive? What is the difference between Tasmanians and the people who live in the ACT, where the level of bulk-billing is in fact lower? Why has Tasmania been given this special incentive? Why didn't we look at it a little more equitably? Senator Harradine has said that it has nothing to do with the fact that he comes from Tasmania. I do not think so and neither did Tony Abbott on AM radio this morning. On AM this morning he said, `That is the democratic process.' What he meant was: `Of course Senator Harradine and Senator Murphy got bulk-billing for everyone in Tasmania, because that is the democratic process. They stood up for their states.' 
—That is what he said, Senator Harradine. Listen to it. What he means is that you did the deal for Tasmania, and we missed out in Queensland. That is not fair. Medicare is a fair system. That fairness has been undermined by a decision that RRMA 3 to 7 will apply everywhere in Tasmania. Where is the justice in that? Where is the fairness in the decision that a RRMA 1 or 2 in Tasmania gets included in the RRMA 3 to 7? We want a fair and equitable system in this country, and now we do not have it.
Let us look at what will happen to people accessing allied health services through the EPC program. We have had an analysis of EPC. EPC, according to the department and to the medical practitioners, is not a good system. Admittedly that is because there was not a payment to those allied health workers, but that system has been found to be ineffective. There is a whole range of conditions by which a general practice can become an EPC compliant practice. Does the woman with a sick child know that? No, she does not and she should not need to. If she has a sick child, she does not want to work out whether or not her doctor's surgery has EPC approval. How would she know?
Let us go to the doctors whom we recognise—and whom Senator Harris has talked so passionately about—are working so hard to deliver the services that our community wants. What sort of paperwork will they now have to go through to access these sorts of services for their clients? They do not like doing it, and now they have more red tape and more work to do. We heard over and over during the Medicare inquiry that doctors do not want any more red tape. What are we doing to them now? We are telling them they have more work to do—more administration. Doctors want to see people. Doctors are trained to make people better, not to fill in forms. But now we have more forms for them, thank you very much, through the EPC program.
There is a range of other questions that need to be answered during this process, and I certainly hope we get to them. Let us go to MediConnect. Why is it that Tasmania—that place again—and South Australia have moved up the line? We are told that it is because they were close. I would like to see some analysis of that. Why is it that doctors who operate in states other than South Australia, the home of Senator Lees, and Tasmania, the home of Senator Harradine and Senator Murphy, miss out? That is not fair. Why should we miss out on a program that is regarded as being beneficial to our community? That is simply not fair. According to Mr Abbott this morning, it is part of the democratic process. This is not a fair package. This is the dismantling of Medicare. This is John Howard getting his own way, and the people of Australia will be very disappointed in him. I will make some contributions and ask further questions later.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech

They have been returned to Griffith University and those positions will be filled there. That is purely a function of the university not being able to accommodate them in 2004. I made contact with the vice-chancellor to ensure that in 2005, 2006 and 2007 they would be ready for that intake. There was no impediment from the government. The government tried to assist in providing those initial 10 places. The university themselves could not accommodate them. It is not the government taking them away; it is the university saying that they will not be prepared in time to take the intake. The places were transferred back to Griffith University. James Cook University said yesterday that they are absolutely overjoyed to be able to take the 12 places in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and can accommodate them.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech

They were offered to James Cook but they could not make use of them. What needs to be put on the record, because Senator McLucas has now three times tried to distort the facts, is that as a result of the negotiations there are now 12 more medical school places in Australia than would have existed prior to yesterday's announcement. There are 12 new places—not taking them from one university to another and back again, as did occur and I correct the record immediately—and they are for James Cook.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—We have now had not quite 24 hours to reflect on this arrangement—this deal—and the more we know about it the more we realise what a mess we are getting into. Already it has been demonstrated comprehensively how unfair this package is on some regions and on some individuals. It does not, to say the least, hang together as a comprehensive approach to solving some of the pressing problems that we have in Medicare in this country. 
Senator Harradine and Senator Lees have argued that something is better than nothing. We do not agree. There was another proposal on the table—our proposal. It did not cost any more but it had much more integrity to it because a lot of the things that are now being raised as problems had been thought through at that time. I am disappointed. I am not disappointed that it is someone else's deal and not ours. That does not matter. At the end of the day it is the outcome that is important. I think what we have here is a poorer outcome than we might have had otherwise. Our proposal, I would argue, would have strengthened Medicare. Whilst $300 for a safety net is certainly going to make the relief of out-of-pocket costs more available to people on low incomes, it sets up so many problems that it is not worth doing. In our view there should have been a uniform safety net and it should have been about $500.
These amendments will make primary health care more affordable, but that goes nowhere toward solving the biggest problem which we came to understand through the important Senate processes—and I am referring to the two inquiries that were conducted into this bill—namely, the importance of specialist fees in all of this. Big out-of-pocket expenses come principally from specialists, not from GPs. Most of the people who will reach that safety net will be there because of the very high costs of specialists. The increase in bulk-billing of $7.50 for some people in some areas will not assist in this respect. As I understand it—perhaps the minister can clarify this—that $7.50 will not go to specialists; it is just for GPs. In any case, $7.50 would probably be laughed at by most specialists, who now exceed the schedule fee and the rebate for their services in many cases by hundreds of dollars. So it is problematic from that point of view. It has not addressed the most pressing problem here, which is that of specialists.
The government admitted yesterday that, as a result of the safety net changes to the $300 and the $700, one in five patients will face a doubling of the fees that they have to pay for specialists by 2007. That is a very large increase. There is nothing by way of either a message through these amendments to the bill or anything the government has said that would discourage that doubling. I think we can expect to see that doubling. It sounds like the government expects it to happen, and most thinking people would reckon it likely in any case. There is nothing in here to discourage that inflationary impact. We are not just talking about inflation in the normal sense of health costs; we are talking about the encouragement for specialists to increase their fees.
That will make it worse for GPs. We are in this position of GPs opting out of bulk-billing because of how they see themselves in relation to specialists. The relative values study that was quoted endlessly in this chamber throughout the process was about GPs comparing themselves with specialists and saying, `Our income is so much lower than theirs, and yet we do extra training—we do the same kind of training, in effect, as specialists. How is it that we are missing out so much?' There is nothing in this package that, as I said, discourages that doubling of fees for 20 per cent of those people who will be caught up by the safety net, so a fifth of those are going to see a doubling. There is absolutely no question that that is going to be inflationary, and we may see that spreading over to GPs, who will continue to be grumpy about the fact that they have missed out. 
Our amendments will go to a review of the government's strategies—if you can call them that. I do not think it is a strategy; we just have a mess. We have an ad hoc bundle of approaches to these problems. I think that down the track, in three years time, we will see that costs have blown out significantly for not just specialists—we already know that they will go up—but for GPs as well. So, as I said earlier, we felt that a $500 across-the-board safety net would have been preferable to this two-tier arrangement. Obviously, people who have costs of $300 and $400 would miss out—there is no question about that—but at least it would maintain the universality of Medicare and would not differentiate between income groups or any other approach.
What we have here is a welfare approach, as many people have said in this chamber already. We do not want to go down that welfare path. We value the universality of Medicare. That is an overused word, but it does mean that, regardless of your income, the amount of dollars that flow through to you from Medicare will be related to your need—that is, not need in terms of your income but need in terms of your health. So the sicker you are the more you need the services of GPs and specialists and the more Medicare dollars flow to you. That is right and proper, and it is what Australians value.
I think that the eligibility criteria that have also been canvassed throughout our inquiries have been very poorly thought out. There have been a lot of criticisms of the tax A category. We are going to get an enormous amount of division in the community and very justified claims of unfairness. We are going to get the anomalies that could have been avoided—very simply avoided, and at the same cost. We have here a two-tiered approach. This is not just rhetoric. We are not just saying that two-tiered is bad because it is bad; it is bad because it is often targeting the wrong people.
The biggest flaw in what has been negotiated is that it will not encourage bulk-billing of patients. The government may say, `Medicare is not just about bulk-billing.' I agree; it is not just about bulk-billing. But bulk-billing has become a signal. It is a measure of the success of our system in delivering affordable primary health care. The other signal is the schedule fee. That used to be everything in Medicare. The schedule fee was the compact between government and doctors, so it had integrity as a reasonable fee. What has happened in recent years is that that compact—that regard for the schedule fee—has broken down. I would agree: I think that we could have quite low bulk-billing rates if doctors kept to the schedule fee, because then patients would be out of pocket by only 15 per cent—the difference between the rebate and the schedule fee. I think our system would be much better off if we focused on this question of the schedule fee and how to bring it back in terms of compliance with the figure.
But, as we heard through the inquiry process, pretty much everyone has given up on the schedule fee. We just shrug and say, `Expectations, costs and so forth have now exceeded the schedule fee, so we'll dismiss that. It is no longer part of our system. We don't need to worry about it.' Putting in a safety net at all reinforces that notion. So, whilst I join with others in saying that bulk-billing is not everything, the schedule fee is everything. You do not have affordability if you do not have adherence to the schedule fee. We have seen specialists in particular ignore the schedule fee—and we have seen no attempt on the government's part to retrieve it. 
The $7.50 measure will not work without a target. The importance in all of this is seeing a movement to stem the decline in bulk-billing and hopefully lift it. The $7.50 rebate in country areas is not enough. I agree with the principle, the concept at least, of taking money out into areas where it is in short supply. We argued very strongly to fix the black holes in Medicare. On average, somebody in a remote area might receive $80 a year from Medicare, whereas someone in a well-off metropolitan area can receive $200 a year. Fixing those anomalies—those black holes—is important, but I am not sure that the $7.50 will do it, Senator Harradine.
GPs in country areas, the more remote areas in particular, have high salaries—much higher than those doctors who work in the cities. Are they seriously going to say that for $7.50 they will increase their bulk-billing rates? We know attitudes are different in the bush. There is a much different approach to bulk-billing there than in the city. My colleague Senator Cherry has drawn upon the very serious anomaly of using RRMA as a measure for deciding who gets the $7.50 and who does not. We do not even have targets in this for bulk-billing all concession card holders and all children. You get your $7.50 for those who qualify. It seems to me that this is not going to deliver any change in the way that doctors do their business.
One of the most serious and disappointing problems with this package is what might have been a very important step in the right direction for allied health. The Democrats succeeded, I think it is fair to say, in persuading the government not to go down the path of giving doctors a bucket of money under the extended care program and asking them to contract out allied health, as they saw fit, through case management and so on. That was unlikely to deliver much in the way of improved access to allied health. Out of 97 million GP consultations only 150,000 have been involved in case management and, by and large, these have not involved allied health services. There is no obligation to make sure the money goes to clinical, professional allied health services. It could well be siphoned off to other doctors or the nurses in the practice. It is the most disappointing aspect because we could have had a system where there would be GP referrals. We could have contained it. We could have still had the GP as the gatekeeper, as it were, but it would have been an opportunity to refer off to the allied health professionals so that in their own professional capacity they would be in charge of those services being delivered.
I have a lot of questions to ask about this aspect of the package, which I will come to as we proceed. Case conferences have not been picked up by GPs so far. They complain about the red tape, which is going to be greater. The AMA have come out and said that they do not like this. If they do not like it and the previous package was not being picked up, then this was not going to be picked up. There are questions about how this interacts with the safety net. We have a mishmash here. It could have been simple. It could have been straightforward. It could have been contained. It could have been cost effective, but instead of that we have got a very complicated arrangement which is clumsy, to say the least, and not likely to deliver. If people think they are going to get physiotherapy, access to a dietician or a podiatrist or whatever else as soon as this bill is passed, then they are mistaken. I think we are going to see a very small number of GP consultations that will take advantage of it. Again, it is a lost opportunity, because we could have relieved doctors of some of the work that they do not need to do—and are not very good at, I might add. That is one of the most significant disappointments. 
We all know that at some stage we are going to look at a more comprehensive approach to this. I do not even like using the word `fix'. It is a short-term approach. It is ad hoc. It is not going to solve our overall problems in the long term. I think we will be back here debating this in the not too distant future when those costs start to blow out. We need to improve access and affordability. We also need to find alternatives to GPs and other ways of relieving them of the tasks they have.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech

You might be able to throw some light on that for me. Concerning allied health services and dental health care provisions, on one of your fax sheets you say, `This incentive will add initiatives, a new MBS item that can be claimed by a GP for certain services provided for and on behalf of the GP, except state or Commonwealth-funded allied health providers.' On that list, as well as having physiotherapists, podiatrists and chiropractors, you have included Aboriginal health workers. Can you tell me why Aboriginal health workers are on that list and to which Aboriginal health workers do you think this provision would apply? My understanding is that Aboriginal health workers are included in state or Commonwealth funded allied health providers and are employed by Aboriginal community controlled health care organisations.

This amendment would require the government, by the third anniversary of the day on which the act commences, to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the act. I think that is really important. As we debate the issue here today, anomalies arise and we will discuss those, and there are question marks about the inflationary impacts of this package and the effectiveness, for instance, of the extended primary care plan. I think all the measures in this bill deserve some sort of review after three years because of the doubts about the effectiveness of them. 
This bill is specifically about the safety net. But so much else will come into such a review because the safety net is going to be a measure of how well or otherwise the system is working. The more people on the safety net, the more we know that costs have spiralled out of control. I would strongly recommend that the Senate support the review. It is not unusual for us to review pieces of legislation in this place after a period of time to see whether or not they are working. It is a small ask of the government. It would give us an opportunity to not only see what has happened but also push along a serious analysis of the situation and for that to be made public, not just something that the government does and perhaps hides the results of. I think this is a very important amendment, though not a highly significant one in terms of cost or what it is calling for on the government's part.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I asked a number of questions previously about the rebate for children and pensioners, particularly in relation to Darwin and its classification as a RRMA 1. Can I have some indication as to whether I can have an answer now or at which stage in this debate am I likely to get an answer?
—I am happy to provide an answer, but we are now dealing with another amendment. I will give a detailed answer very shortly, as soon as I have the details.
—Under what amendment are you intending to provide that answer to me?
—The very minute I have accurate information, I will give it to you.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—I also have a number of questions. I have another amendment, so there may be an opportunity for us to ask those questions at that point. I would also like an indication from the government and the opposition as to whether our amendment is supportable or not.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-11,"—I indicate that the Australian Greens will support the amendment put up by the Democrats for review of this legislation. I agree with the comments that Senator Allison made. The 24 hours that commentators in the media have had since this deal was announced has allowed them the opportunity to outline and draw out some of the issues that are part of this package. I know that other senators who have already commented this morning have said that it has also given them the opportunity to look further into the detail. Senator Cherry's contribution about looking at the geographical impacts of this legislation was extremely important. We will support the review of the legislation that is being proposed in this Democrat amendment. 
Senator McLucas raised the issue of complexity. This is a very complex deal that has been struck. There are many different layers of safety nets, as Senator Evans mentioned before. There are many different forms that need to be filled in, as Senator McLucas mentioned. The president of the AMA has already made the comment that it is a more complex Medicare system as a result of the deal. 
Complexity always assists those who have had the educational opportunities to understand it. That means people who are more privileged in our society and who have had the opportunity for education—education that will mean that they can understand all the forms, all the different systems that doctors are looking at when making decisions about their health care needs. They are the people who benefit from a more complex system. It is not the low-income people, the people who have lacked opportunity and educational opportunity, who will be able to understand the more complex system that is being introduced this week in the Senate. Previously Senator Campbell spoke about how he believed the deal that was coming in would help low-income people. That does not fit with the idea that a more complex system always assists people who have the educational opportunities and can understand a more complex system.
The Greens want to see that all Australians are helped and assisted by improvements to Medicare, our universal public health care system. That is not something that bits and pieces around the edge, as proposed in this deal, will provide for all Australians. Senator Campbell said before that he thought there was universal access to the safety nets. You cannot have universal access to safety nets when you have two different safety nets—differential safety nets—depending upon people's income levels, their classification and whether they happen to be self-funded retirees and therefore get a health care card. That is not universal in terms of having access to those safety nets.
The comments that have been made today by Sharan Burrow from the ACTU point out that the deal fails to provide any benefits for single low-income earners. Low-income earners who are families and may be eligible for family tax benefit B are included in the particular safety net. But what about the low-income earners who are single people and do not have children? Single working people earning as little as $340 a week are not eligible. They are not eligible for a concession card; they will not receive the safety net that the government is providing.
Yesterday in the chamber, we were talking about the holes in the safety net that people will fall through as a result of this package. Yesterday in this Senate we were told by Senator Campbell that he hoped that bulk-billing would increase. We were also told that the assumption for the modelling was that there would be no increase in bulk-billing. But yesterday Senator Campbell told us that he `hoped' there would be an increase. Minister Abbott told us on radio this morning that it `should' improve bulk-billing rates. Yet it is being modelled on an assumption that there will be no increase in bulk-billing rates.
—No, it is not. That is not what I said.
—That is what Senator Campbell said yesterday.
—It is not what I said. You are verballing me again.
—If that is different, I am happy to hear Senator Campbell get up and clarify that for the chamber. Certainly when, on Lateline at the end of last year, the minister was asked what were the modellings and what were the assumptions in the Medicare package, the answer was that it had been modelled for there to be no increase in bulk-billing rates. If that has changed, that is great. I would really love to hear the minister stand up and say that the model has been developed on the assumption that there will be X per cent increase in bulk-billing rates. I would love to hear that, and I am sure he will get the opportunity to stand up and clarify that for the chamber. 
In relation to another component of the package, whether we would see increases in specialist fees, I think Senator Lees commented that we need to trust doctors—trust that they will not raise their fees. We have been told to `hope'; we have been told to `trust'; we have been told there should be an increase. That is not filling me with a great deal of confidence in this government's preparedness to bolster and protect our universal public health care system. But I am quite happy for Senator Campbell to stand up and clarify that system. I think it was described in the Financial Review today as `Dr Tony's Trusty Tonic'. I am not feeling really great about leaping in and having some of that tonic thanks to Dr Tony, as described in the Financial Review today. I will leave my comments there. I have further questions of Senator Campbell that I will ask later on.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—I understood that we were debating the Democrat amendment in relation to a review. The government will oppose it on the grounds that, as part of the proper administration of all of its programs, we intend to monitor the benefits of the safety net and evaluate what it has achieved. Regular reports will be available on the number of people receiving safety net benefits, the average level of benefits and what other impacts the safety net may have, including the annual report. In relation to the proposed sunset clause, this amendment would establish a sunset clause for the amendments introduced. Unless further legislation was enacted, at the end of four years the safety net would lapse. It is the government's intention to introduce a safety net that can provide certainty to people in the long term, ensuring that they have continued peace of mind and protection against high out-of-pocket costs.
To that end, the benefits resulting from the safety nets can only be paid from the date of royal assent. Although we know from figures that 33,000 families have already incurred expenses of more than $300 and that more than 3,000 families have already incurred expenses of more than $700, we cannot pay for those retrospectively. All senators need to know that the benefits of these provisions cannot help families retrospectively. People who incur expenses between now—that is, if we can get the legislation passed today and get royal assent today—and when the parliament next sits cannot be helped. It will be a decision of senators in this place to prevent those families from receiving in some cases hundreds or thousands of dollars if we do not pass this legislation by a quarter to one. There is no reason why we cannot do that.
To assist that process, I will respond to Senator Crossin's questions: Katherine is in RRMA 6 and therefore will be entitled to the $7.50; Darwin is a capital city and therefore will not. However, the benefit of this package for Darwin—which it will not receive if this legislation is not passed today—is that it will receive the benefits of the work force measures. It will receive those if this legislation is passed; it would not have done previously. It will now receive the benefits of the work force measures.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I would like to make a brief contribution. Firstly, I formally indicate that the Labor Party will be supporting the amendments moved by the Democrats in relation to the sunset clause. To briefly pick up on the point made by Senator Ian Campbell: it is not the chamber standing between families and the benefits of this package. This is a package that the government has been unable to negotiate successfully with the Democrats for months and months. It was brought into this chamber yesterday. The Senate is in its second or third hour of consideration of a major change to Medicare arrangements. The attempt to browbeat the Senate contained in Senator Campbell's contribution certainly will not work on me, and I doubt that it will work on the rest of the chamber. The fact is that this is a major change.
—That is right. I am making my second contribution to the debate, Senator Campbell. You have made considerably more contributions.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Evans, please address your remarks through the chair.
—Senator Campbell put forward a very longwinded and completely false argument about private health insurance, in which he accused the Greens of supporting a Labor Party policy that was not in fact a Labor Party policy. If he wants to talk about how the debate has been delayed, Senator Campbell ought to have a look at his own performance.
In my short, second contribution to the committee stage of the debate, I indicate that the bullyboy tactics used in saying, `You are standing between families and benefits,' will not work on the chamber and will only delay the passage of the legislation. We are in the committee stage and we are considering a very detailed and major change to Medicare. We are debating only part of the change, because most of it will be done by the minister with regulation. The government announced this package yesterday. The amendments came to the Senate later yesterday evening, after the government attempted to start the debate without giving the Senate the courtesy of providing the amendments. There is a range of issues that senators are genuinely seeking to explore and understand. I accept that the government has the numbers. I do not generally rage against the dying of the light—and I do not attend to on this occasion—but equally I am not going to be party to the chamber being told it is not allowed to have proper consideration of the measures. I am not going to kowtow to some bullyboy argument that the chamber ought to get on with it and endorse the package inside 24 hours because the government has finally got its deal and got the numbers.
Senators will legitimately pursue issues that they think need to be pursued. I understand there is still some movement in the package, that there were some further negotiations regarding RRMAs and how different parts of Australia will be treated under this package—negotiations which have not yet been revealed to the Senate—last night after we commenced the debate. It seems to me that those are issues the chamber ought to know about and understand. I do not understand them. I am confused by what they mean, but I understand a change was negotiated last night in the classification of rural and regional Australia. I would have thought it would be important that the Senate understood that before we passed the legislation. Anyway—as I do not want to be accused of holding up the debate—Labor will be voting for the Democrat amendment.
—I remind the Senate that we are debating the amendment put forward by the Democrats in relation to the review of the operation rather than the sunset clause. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—What Senator Evans says to some extent is right, except that the only amendment to the legislation that is required has already been dealt with. None of the other issues—if you want to look at RRMAs, at how you describe them and at how you define them—are dealt with by the legislation. The only effect of any debate now that that amendment has been passed by the chamber is to delay the payment of the benefits. You can have very important debates about the RRMAs or about anything else you like in the forum of the Senate, but this legislation does not affect those. It affects the thresholds. All we do now by having further debate—
—The RRMAs define where the threshold is paid!
—We have just passed the threshold amendment. Further debate on this will achieve one thing, and that is to delay payment to families in need.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-03-11,"—I rise to speak with regard to the amendment that Senator Allison has put forward. I have always been of the view that reviews of programs, particularly serious programs like this one, are worth while. I am probably inclined to support a review process because it would not detract from the program but it would offer a chance to assess it, and I assume that assessment would be reported to parliament. With regard to the matter of RRMA classifications, which Senator Evans alluded to, both are active at the moment. As a result of discussions that I have been having for some time with the minister's office and last night, the minister has written to me indicating that he has asked his department:
... to devise a new classification method which is a better indicator of medical workforce and other health care needs, preferably locality-by-locality, but at least by local government areas which are much more widely understood than—
the statistical local area data that is currently used to determine RRMA classifications and their application. That has implications for the application of some of these measures. The minister and I may not agree on many things, but I congratulate him on at least taking this step because it is a very significant step. It will provide a much better outcome. It will allow the department to look at the real health issues confronting various areas around this country. This is a very significant step which ought to be applauded, if nothing else is. I have had a long and ongoing argument about a particular area in my state. I am again thankful to the minister that he has ordered the reclassification of that area to what it ought to be classified as and not according to statistical data that is not relevant to the provision of health services.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech

—I am quite happy to table it.
—Thank you. Minister, as I understand it you are suggesting that Darwin and Palmerston are currently classified as RRMA 1. Is that correct?
—Yes.
—And Humpty Doo.
—And Katherine, I understand. It is my understanding that there will be a review of the RRMA areas. Is that correct?
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Crossin, finish your speech first.
—I am asking a question. Will the RRMA areas be reviewed or revised?
—Sit down if you have finished.
—I am just getting a nod of the head and I don't think Hansard can record that.
—I will stand up and then I can say something.
—Thank you.
—Order! Senators have to talk in proper sequence. We cannot have questions flowing to and fro.

But while you are still on your feet I cannot call him.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—The letter that Senator Murphy refers to, which is now on the public record, states very clearly that—in a constructive mood, that I think all senators will welcome—the minister has asked his department:

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I find this absolutely extraordinary. For over two years we have raised the classification system known as RRMA through the Senate estimates committee process and have on every occasion been advised that the anomalies that exist in RRMA will stay because any other system would always have the same anomalies. But now we have Senator Murphy agreeing to a package because another system is going to come along. There is no consistency in the message that the department, through its minister, is providing this place. We have raised this on many occasions. Senator Forshaw has raised the problem of Nimbin many times, I have raised the problem of west of Nambour on many occasions and Senator Murphy has come to estimates and talked about his particular problem. But the message has been consistent that we cannot change the RRMAs because, if you change it and put something else in its place, it will have exactly the same problem. Why is it that all of a sudden we can get an unequivocal commitment from the minister that we can fix this? I am sorry, but we have been told for too long that we cannot. Senator Murphy, for you to accept that as gospel, I think you have potentially been duped. 
I want to also talk about what happens next. If we change the RRMAs, if we move from a system that we do understand to some other system, which might be by local government area or might be by locality, how do you cost that? How do you work out what it is going to cost? How do we know what we are buying in this package? We are just saying, `Maybe we'll work it out a bit later; it'll be okay. Don't worry about it.' We do not know what it is going to cost. How can a government manage the health department of this nation by doing deals with senators and saying, `We'll talk about it later'? We do not know what we are buying, they do not know what they are buying and you do not know what you are getting. 
I am sorry, but we do not know what we are getting in this package. I think it was a little naive of those senators to think that they could get a letter from the minister and that we would sort it out later—it might be local government area and it might be locality, but we are not quite sure—when they know that the consistent message from the department has been that, wherever you draw a line, there will be an anomaly. That is why the RRMA system is not a good measure, and the departmental officers know it. I will leave the question of bulk-billing till later, when we might get a bit more time.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-03-11,"—With regard to the process that operates now with respect to the RRMA classifications, they change on a regular basis. They are reviewed I think at least biannually or triannually and sometimes annually. They change because of population changes, either in the positive or in the negative. So there is an unknown factor to the costing anyway.
The government has programs that it administers under the RRMA system. Those costs will vary from year to year. There is a health budget. I agree with the argument that has been put that the system has been fundamentally flawed and there have been anomalies. I have argued about those anomalies for a long time. The reason I congratulate the minister is that he recognises that and he has asked the department to devise a new classification system.
—You have been told you can't do it.
—I agree. We have been told. I have been there and I have been told consistently that it cannot be done. But the fact of the matter is that this minister has asked his department to devise some other mechanism. That is a positive step.
Of course you cannot cost it, nor could you cost it in the past. To a limited degree maybe you could. But there have always been changes and there have always been unknown factors. Obviously when they devise this new mechanism they will look at the potential costs, and that is something that the government will then have to come to grips with. If it means a significant increase in cost, that is something that the government will have to confront. But this is a step in the right direction. I think it is one that a lot of people have been trying to get an outcome on. Despite the fact that it is just in the form of a letter, it is a fairly significant commitment to devise a new classification system. I hope it will be one that will deliver a fairer outcome.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I have one very straightforward question. In the update there is a note that says:
Areas of consideration to be added to RRMA classification.
Under certain criteria, exceptions can now be made to the standard classification method that determines whether an area is metropolitan, regional, rural or remote for some GP Programs. 
Can I get an explanation of what that means, please.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-03-11,"—I have not entered the debate today so as to enable other senators to have their say about matters. But it is appropriate that I seek leave to incorporate a statement outlining my view about the matters that have been dealt with. It does not have a go at anybody; I can assure you of that. I would be grateful if I could incorporate this speech into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
There are some fairly obvious problems with Medicare today.
The main problem is that medical costs are increasing, but the insurance coverage offered to patients through Medicare is not keeping up. The increasing gap between the Medical Benefits Schedule and what doctors actually charge is hurting Australians.
There is an obvious approach to this problem. The Government could increase the insurance it offers through Medicare by giving bulk-billing doctors an extra $5 across the board, whether a patient holds a concession card or not. The Senate Committee made this recommendation on the grounds that Medicare is about health care, not about welfare.
The reality of course is that the Government is not willing to do that. It is not willing to spend this much money on Medicare.
I note that the Senate did not disallow the regulations enabling the MedicarePlus $5 increase to the MBS to encourage doctors to bulk bill particular groups of patients. The Opposition in this case obviously thought that the $5 incentive was at least some extra money for Medicare, even though it was not enough.
My colleagues Senators Shayne Murphy, Meg Lees and Len Harris and I have much the same attitude to what we have achieved in negotiations with the Government. $427 million extra to help Medicare is not enough, but it was all the Government was willing to give, and it will help a lot of people.
We should acknowledge here that the Government's initial Medicare package—“A Fairer Medicare”—weighed in at $917 million. The second attempt—MedicarePlus—was valued at $2.4 billion. The third attempt—achieved through our negotiation—is worth $2.8 billion. That's three times the initial package and a substantial achievement.
The package that we have agreed on adds three components to MedicarePlus:
(1) $131 million more funding for bulk-billing;
(2) a much improved and more generous safety net with an extra $174 million, targeted to those least able to pay; and,
(3) a new MBS item for the services of some allied health professionals when they are providing treatment for and on behalf of a GP, at $121 million.
All of these components are important, but I have concentrated on the first two in negotiations with the Government as I think they go to the heart of what is of most pressing importance to the Australian people—affordable health care.
Extra incentives for bulk-billing
We have managed to negotiate extra funding for the MBS to the tune of an estimated $131 million to 2006-07. This comprises a $7.50 payment to doctors who bulk bill concession card holders and children under 16 years where services are provided in the classifications Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas (RRMA) 3-7.
For this purpose, all of Tasmania is to receive the full $7.50 benefit. Tasmania has a bulk-billing rate 13 per cent lower than the national average. Bulk-billing rates are particularly low in metropolitan areas such as Hobart, where the bulk-billing rate is down as low as 47 per cent, or around Launceston, where the rate is 43 per cent. This is compared to the Australian average of 67 per cent. It therefore made no sense to exclude cities like Hobart and Launceston from the bulk-billing incentives. Including all of Tasmania also acknowledges the State is part of Regional Australia. The Government's own document “Stronger Regions: A Stronger Australia”, states that “Regional Australia is the Australia outside our major capital cities”.  
When looking at improving bulk-billing rates, we looked at a number of options for addressing the problem. Obviously, as I have said, the best approach would have been a universal payment for each bulk-billed patient. But the Government wouldn't come at options which involved that much money.
The main approach we considered was to pay $5 extra per bulk billed patient to all doctors who bulk billed over 70 per cent of their patients. I think the Democrats considered a similar plan at an 80 per cent threshold. But when we looked closely at this, we realised this wouldn't provide any incentive in places like Tasmania, where bulk-billing rates range from round 40 per cent to 60 per cent. All it would do would be to reward doctors who were already bulk-billing at those rates, or drag up doctors who were a few per cent under the target rate. Those doctors would mostly be from metropolitan centres, where bulk-billing rates are generally high. In other words, all the money would go to where there was no bulk-billing problem.
We then sat down with the Government to talk about an alternative which would be more likely to improve incentives for doctors to bulk bill in low bulk-billing areas. That led to the decision to give $7.50 to doctors who bulk bill concession card holders and children under 16 years in RRMA 3-7 areas and all of Tasmania.
Now I should be clear that there is a risk such payments will not stop or reverse the slow decline in bulk-billing. Certainly what we have negotiated is more likely to give an incentive in some areas. But in Tasmania where out of pocket expenses for visiting a GP have increased by 25 per cent to $15.39 between March 2001 and the end of 2003, I am concerned the extra $7.50 will not provide enough incentive to bridge that gap.
Improved safety net
Recognising those high out of pocket costs and the risk that bulk-billing rates may not improve, it is important to ensure that people in lower and average income level families can receive real relief from the costs of health care.
The new safety net offers the opportunity to do that. But it needs to be rigorous, robust and generous.
Visits to the GP impact on the cash flow of families, so it is legitimate to look at measures to alleviate people's cash flow burden.
Ideally it would be more in keeping with the principles of the Medicare system to inject further money into the system so that the cash flow problem is minimised at the doctor's surgery. As I've said, this Government has not shown a desire to do that. So it falls to this place to try to fix the problem.
We again looked at a number of options with regard to the safety net. One of the difficulties of the safety net is that some people will miss out, not because they don't in principle meet the requirements for eligibility, but because they don't meet those requirements within the inflexible confines of one calendar year. To address this problem, we advocated there be an option for people to have their out of pocket expenses calculated over two years, as well as an option for calculation over one year. Once again, the Government would not come at that option because of cost.
What we did get though was a substantially better package calculated over one year. We managed to have the $500 threshold for concession card holder and Family Tax Benefit (A) recipients reduced to $300, and the $1000 for all other people reduced to $700. So instead of an estimated 200,000 families and individuals having access to the safety net under the original MedicarePlus, we have opened it to two and a half times more people. It is estimated 490,000 people will benefit from this package.
We considered what the Democrats had proposed for the safety net, which was a $500 flat threshold for all, but that would have helped 30,000 fewer families and individuals and cut out some of the lower income earners.
My primary concern is that Tasmanians should have access to their general practitioner or to a specialist, if needed, on the basis of their health regardless of their financial resources. By and large, most people don't like visiting the doctor and do not do so unless they are ill. They should have access to a doctor if they need one. 
Access for allied health professionals to the MBS
The Government has agreed for the first time to fund through Medicare five allied health consultations per year for services provided for and on behalf of a GP. This is a substantial step forward for patients, who will get better, more specialised care. It is also a step forward for allied health professionals, who get more recognition for their skills and access to payments from Medicare via a GP.
Claims can be made by GPs only where the allied health services are provided to patients with a chronic condition and multifaceted care needs. The patients have to be managed under the Enhanced Primary Care Program or through a multidisciplinary care plan. 
This will allow Medicare to pay for services provided by Aboriginal health workers, audiologists, dentists (under a dental care plan), dieticians, mental health workers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, chiropodists, chiropractors, osteopaths, psychologists and speech pathologists.
The new funding acknowledges the important and special skills that each allied health discipline can bring to enhancing a patient's health. There is evidence this improves patient satisfaction and health.
Conclusion
I have had many representations from sincere people concerned about the Governments package. I agree with their general thesis that the Government should be providing an increase to the MBS to provide for bulk-billing which reflects doctors' costs. But I can't force the Government to do that. Six months or so of negotiations between various groups and individuals have led to the outcome before us today. It is my judgement that this is the best deal that could be made with the Government to improve the package.
Some have said that we should just reject the package. But without the package, inadequate as it is, Medicare would continue to decline and Australians would suffer indefinitely. We have managed to negotiate some increase in funds to support bulk-billing to make the lives of lower income people and working families a little easier. This is something to help them now.
Some have also said that we should reject the new safety net, as it undermines Medicare. I agree that if Medicare was operating properly, we would not need this new safety net. But I also think that in the current environment the safety net is the only concrete benefit we can offer to Australians, and particularly lower income Australians. The extra money we have negotiated to increase the rebate for bulk-billing doctors is an incentive only. It may not work. Doctors may say that it is just not enough to make it worthwhile for them to bulk bill. And in that situation, the safety net is the only assistance we can guarantee is available.
The safety net measures seek to protect the low income, poor and chronically ill from a future of rising health costs and out of pocket fees. They also recognise that the bulk-billing incentives will erode over time due to the inadequate indexation of the MBS, so there has to be some protection for Australians. There has to be some long term protection of the interests of the poor, the sick and those who suffer.
Ultimately, the Government's performance at the next election will be linked to whether this package actually does encourage an increase in bulk-billing, or whether Australians find that they have to pay more and more in out of pocket expenses to visit the doctor.
But what we have achieved in negotiating with the Government is a concrete benefit for the Australian people—a much more generous safety net—which until the Government is willing to invest substantial funding in the MBS, is the only real guarantee that they won't be crippled by out of pocket medical costs.

(2)	Page 2 (after line 2), after clause 3, add:
5 Cessation of operation of Act
		This Act, unless sooner repealed, ceases to operate at the expiration of four years after its commencement. 
This amendment has the effect of at least stopping the operation of the act four years after commencement. This would allow the matter to be returned to the parliament and would follow, presumably, the three-year review. There are enough doubts about the safety net and about the package in general for us to indicate that it should automatically stop its operations so there can be parliamentary scrutiny of the review and decisions made about how to proceed.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—I did speak about the sunset clause and why we would be opposed to it because ultimately it would create uncertainty for people as the date got closer. Now that you have achieved a review, clearly any such review will create an environment—to be frank, a political environment—whereby if the review did pick up anything that needed to be changed or any weaknesses in the system then there would be a need for government to address that. In those circumstances not only would the sunset clause create unnecessary uncertainty but the review would create what the Democrats are aiming for—a review of the benefits and so forth. That would create an environment whereby reform would have to occur. So you would still get the benefit without having to create the uncertainty that a sunset clause would impose.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—I said earlier that there were a number of questions I still had to ask the minister. We were encouraged to go to votes at various points, so I will raise these now since this is the last part of the debate. I have quite a few questions on the enhanced primary care items—the EPC items. As I mentioned earlier, there have been only 150,000 of these case conferences done with GPs in the past, but we are nonetheless using this model for extending the program out to allied health professionals. How many of those 150,000 case conferences involved allied health professionals other than a practice nurse and another doctor?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—In answer to Senator McLucas's question, the guidelines for GP work force programs that are currently located in RRMAs 4 to 7 will be revised to allow funding to go to the areas where the RRMA classification system throws up clear anomalies in RRMAs 4 to 7. The program guidelines are being revised to do that, and that fits in with the approach that is outlined in the minister's letter that was tabled this morning.
In relation to Senator Allison's question about the enhanced primary care programs, she said correctly there are roughly 150,000 there. People who currently are in those sorts of programs and have that sort of care made available to them will now get the additional benefit of the $220 new rebate for services such as physio, podiatry, dieticians and so forth. On top of that, if they qualify for assistance for complex and chronic illnesses where dental care can be of assistance, then that can be added in as another $220 for up to three consultations with a dentist. We expect that the numbers will stay fairly steady. There will be some growth, of course, and the additional $220 for allied health professionals and $220 on top of that for dentists will make them more attractive, particularly to low income people.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—That is not quite answering my question; perhaps I should rephrase it. There were 150,000 case conferences, but my question was: how many of those actually involved allied health professionals? It is my understanding that it was quite a small number. Given that yesterday the AMA came out and said it was not in favour of this proposal because of the extra administrative work, how likely is it that GPs are going to take this up given that the government is asking them, through this arrangement, to contract allied health workers rather than refer patients directly to them? The Democrats think referring patients to allied health professionals seems to be a much more sensible approach. 
This program has been criticised for its very low uptake. As I said earlier, we have got close to 100 million GP consultations but only 150,000 have gone to case conferences—yet there must be many patients who have the need for case management. How confident can we be about this program? What assumptions have been made about how many of these case managements will include clinical allied health professionals? Or are we going to see more of the same? Are we going to see GPs not taking it up? How would you get them to take it up? What are the incentives when GPs already complain about the administrative work? How will you ensure that allied health professionals will be included?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—I will answer Senator Allison while her question is fresh in my mind. Firstly, there is no doubt that the $220 payment for the allied health professionals and the extra $220 for dental work in complex and chronic cases meets one of the complaints about the existing scheme. You could come up with the perfect program for someone with diabetes, for example, who needs that care, but if they cannot afford to pay for it then the uptake is not going to be as good. It is a very clear benefit. Secondly, we have made it very clear that we will be consulting with doctors about how we will implement the scheme. We want to ensure that the value of the $220 payment, which is not available now to people—this support for allied health professionals and dentists is not available under any existing scheme; it was not envisaged in any policy that I have seen, and it is a good policy—is provided to the patients without putting an undue burden on the doctors.
Senator Allison knows better than most, because she takes a very close interest in this, that this government has been very active in looking at ways to reduce red tape in doctors' surgeries. We set up an inquiry, we have responded to it and we have implemented a whole range of measures to do that using the very best information and communications technologies. We have given assistance to doctors' surgeries to get them online and to increase the uptake of practice software. That is the same constructive, positive and active attitude that we will take to make sure the new program ensures that doctors, where it is in their patients' interests, take up the new benefits that are attached to the health care plans.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—Unlike the government, we actually consulted doctors. They said some weeks ago, `We would prefer a system where we don't have to contract these services out; where we can simply refer them.' We have already asked the question, and that was the response. It was no surprise when the AMA came out yesterday and said, `We don't like this package.' You really should have gone to them and asked them, as we did and as we told you. That is why we suggested that this should be a referral process. Why was this chosen instead of a referral process? It could have had all of the same limitations on the number of consultations; it could have had the GP referral in the first place and the feedback so that it was still primary care through the GP. That arrangement is what doctors said they favoured. This is a very clumsy and inferior approach to providing allied health services. I would like to know why you chose this approach as opposed to what was effectively agreed and also favoured by allied health people and GPs.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-11,"—I have a number of questions for the minister. I understand that we are getting close to the end of being able to ask questions as the amendments run out, so I want to put these questions to the minister. One question I thought he wanted to answer previously related to the assumptions on which the modelling was based for this package and whether there will be any increase in bulk-billing rates. Would he like to answer that one again?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—I assume from the minister's silence that he does not intend to answer my question about the EPC arrangement as opposed to one with direct referrals. It is a pity that he is not prepared to answer that, because I think this is a fairly fundamental flaw in what we are being presented with.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-11,"—I do not have anything to add to what I have said about it. We have said we are going to consult with doctors. It is important to make it work. Some members of the medical fraternity think the way that we have gone is a good way; others have doubts about it, and we are going to talk to them about it because we want the benefits to go to the patients. I am told that some sections of the AMA have strongly supported this model and others have not. I think that is reflected in Senator Allison's own consultations. Doctors are not some sort of amorphous mass who always have a unitary view on issues that affect them. They have different views depending on their perspective.
At the moment we have a system whereby doctors can refer patients to allied health professionals such as physios and others. What we are envisaging is a system whereby the GP will create a plan, they will work with allied health professionals and with dentists in some cases, and the GP will obviously keep control of that plan. That may not suit some GPs but it may suit others. It is quite natural for there to be a division on it. What we want to do is work through the most practical way of implementing it. I think Senator Allison would support that approach. It is a consultative, practical approach to getting benefits delivered in health care to the very needy patients in our society.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-11,"—I doubt I will get the answers to these questions, but I want to put them on the record anyway today. Perhaps at some later stage the minister can get round to answering them. It would be interesting to know the age and demographic profile of the 150,000 people who currently receive case management plans. It would be interesting to know how much of that $35 consultation fee that is being paid to the GPs to be passed on to allied health professionals will actually be paid to them—in other words, how much will GPs keep in return for the administrative cost of doing that? What is the average consultation fee by allied health workers? Thirty-five dollars does not sound a lot. A lot of those allied health workers will have 45-minute consultations. What happens to the gap? If it is $90 for an hour's consultation, does that gap go into the safety net, for instance? If there is a maximum of five consultations out of which at least two health workers will be paid, are you effectively saying that each allied health professional will only receive a maximum of two payments? How that works would be interesting to know. 
At the moment members of health insurance funds can sometimes claim $90 or $122 for allied health services such as dentistry or physiotherapy on their ancillary insurance, but they are prohibited from claiming any service that has an MBS item number. Is this part of the MBS item number system, and so does it take it out of private health insurance for those people? In which case, how do they work all this out? Will the establishment of an MBS item mean that people with private health insurance will not be able to access allied health care through private insurance from now on? If not, how will people with private health insurance decide? At what point will they be able to make that decision—whether they are better off claiming allied health through this approach or a private insurance approach? Does the government intend to change the act to allow private health insurers to insure for the first time against items that are covered by Medicare for out-of-hospital expenses? If so, is that a backdoor approach to what A Fairer Medicare attempted to put in place—which was private health insurance cover for the gap?

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I rise today to support in principle the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 2004, which outlines a number of changes to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. In essence, these amendments to the existing bill are necessary to enable the Australian Sports Drug Agency to comply with provisions required to fully implement the world antidoping code. Labor is and always has been a strong advocate of the fight against doping in sport and understands the integral role that the Australian Sports Drug Agency plays in eliminating the use of performance enhancing drugs in sports, both within Australia and internationally.
The establishment of ASDA by the Labor government in 1990 is indisputably one of Australia's proudest achievements in sports policy. The initiative and foresight shown by Labor through the creation of ASDA at a time when no other country had come up with a solution to the rise in performance enhancing drugs placed Australia at the forefront of the doping battle. Since this time, as the complexity of drug use in sport has escalated, it has become apparent that a coordinated worldwide effort to eliminate the inconsistencies of doping policies that applied across sports and countries was essential to stem the rising tide of doping abuse.
In 1998, after the scandal of a drug riddled Tour de France, a world conference was called to address the issue of doping in sport. From this conference the concept of a world antidoping agency grew and subsequently, in 1999, WADA was established as an independent, nongovernment organisation. WADA's aim is to foster a worldwide doping free culture in sport by combining the resources of sport and government. Its charter is to enhance, supplement and coordinate existing efforts to educate athletes about the harms of doping, to reinforce the ideal of fair play and to sanction those who cheat themselves and their sport. A key element for real success in a worldwide fight against the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport was the necessity to have a standardised set of doping rules and regulations that applied to all sports across all countries. As a result the world antidoping code was developed. 
The Copenhagen World Conference on Doping in Sport held last year provided the first opportunity for countries to sign up in support of the world antidoping code. On many occasions Labor has strongly urged the Howard government to take a genuine stand against drugs in sport. Adopting the WADA code was seen as an integral step in bringing an end to the use of drugs in sport. In a move that was loudly applauded by Labor, Australia was one of the first countries in the world to sign up in support of the WADA code. Adoption of the WADA code represents a historic achievement for those concerned with doping in sport. With governments and sports organisations playing an active and crucial role in supporting and promoting the code, we are much closer to achieving our goal of doping free sport. Accepting and, more importantly, abiding by the code creates transparency and accountability. Under the code, the actions—or inactions, as the case may be—of all will be known and closely monitored. If adhered to and used properly, the code is an important step forward in the fight against doping. It marks a point of no return.
The year 2004 is a crucial year for the fight against doping in sport. This year is the year that the world antidoping code will be implemented by sports organisations prior to the Athens Olympic Games. For the first time, athletes will compete at the Olympics knowing that they are competing on a level playing field, at least when it comes to doping guidelines. The code will ensure that the rules and regulations governing antidoping will be the same across all sports and all countries for this competition. Governments will soon follow the example being set this year by the sports movement and will implement the code in their countries prior to the Winter Olympic Games in Italy in 2006.
Regardless of whether one agrees with the contents, the code will be the standard for all antidoping regulations not only as the norm which should be complied with but also as a standard of quality. For too long there have been incomprehensible variations in application of the code between sports and within sports at different levels of competition. One of the major inconsistencies is that up until now each sport has been allowed to develop its own list of banned substances. One of the major concerns raised by some sporting bodies who initially spoke out against the code was a uniform banned substances list. Cricket, for example, argued that some drugs which should be banned as performance enhancing in the sport of archery should be allowed in cricket because they do not really aid a cricketer's performance. One would have to ask why, if performance is not enhanced, a player would be taking the drug at all. There are provisions made for the use of drugs required to treat genuine medical conditions so, if a drug is not used for therapeutic reasons, then why use it at all? The reality is that a performance enhancing drug is a performance enhancing drug regardless of what sport you play, and a banned substances list that applies to all sports is a fair and equitable list.
Similarly, sports have in the past been allowed to impose their own sanctions for drug use infractions. This has led to almost inexplicable variations in sanctions both across and within most sports. As an example, in the case of two failure to comply incidents a weight-lifter received a three-year ban while a rugby league player was not sanctioned for a similar offence. These examples clearly show the need for greater consistency in the guidelines that determine doping infractions across all sports, as well as for uniformity across sports for sanctions handed down.
The specific purposes of the WADA code are: first, to protect the athlete's fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for athletes worldwide and, second, to ensure harmonised, coordinated and effective antidoping programs at the international and  national level with regard to detection, deterrence and prevention of doping. Implementing and following the WADA code's comprehensive set of doping rules and guidelines will greatly assist in limiting some of the inequities that currently exist in sport. While Labor supports the amendments to the ASDA Act before us today, it is on the basis that these changes must be made to ensure that the ASDA is WADA code compliant prior to the commencement of the Athens Olympics. 
There are, however, a number of issues of concern. One of the key concerns is a relaxation in regulations that relate to privacy. A mainstay of the WADA code is transparency and sharing of information. In essence, the WADA code allows for the naming of athletes found guilty of doping offences, and further allows for that information to be accessed via a centralised doping register warehouse. While the naming of drug cheats is not an issue—the aim is to deter athletes from using performance enhancing drugs—the relaxation of the guidelines that determine when an athlete is considered to have tested positive is a major concern. Under current ASDA guidelines an athlete is not considered positive and cannot be named to a relevant sporting body until such time as both an A and B sample have tested positive and the competitor has had the opportunity to make a written submission to ASDA.
Implementation of the new WADA code guidelines will mean that disclosure is required immediately upon the A sample revealing a positive test result and ASDA being satisfied that there is no therapeutic approval and that the relevant international standard for testing has been complied with. There is also the requirement to make a public disclosure of information relating to entries on a register, in effect, to release the name of an athlete who tests positive. This represents a substantial dilution of the protection afforded to competitors who are under suspicion but whose status has yet to be determined through B sample testing and hearing processes, and also places a degree of discretionary decision making regarding disclosure on the testing agency.
The public exposure of a bona fide drug cheat is a move welcomed by all. Perhaps the prospect of permanently tainting one's character will be enough to make an athlete think twice before using banned substances. The concern is that relaxing a number of current protective measures potentially increases the chances of publicly naming an innocent party, and the labelling of an innocent party as a drug cheat is another matter altogether. Currently there are very few courses of action available to an athlete who finds themselves in such a situation to clear their name. Athletes may make an appeal to the Privacy Commissioner or launch a Federal Court case, but for many these avenues are not seen as genuine alternatives. 
Regardless of the options available, even in the event of an athlete being totally cleared of any wrongdoing, there is no question that no matter what the issue some of the mud always sticks. It is for this reason that Labor believe it is important to pay particular care to the issue of disclosure of infractions. We have been advised by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts that the conditions under which an organisation—in this case ASDA—can release information regarding a doping infringement are covered by the ASDA regulations. These regulations are currently being redrafted in order to bring them into line with administrative changes required by the implementation of the WADA code. Labor have lodged an expression of interest in the progress of this redrafting and will continue to closely monitor this process to ensure the rights of all concerned are upheld. 
Another area of concern is that of drug testing and research. The WADA code will serve as a fundamental tool in the fight against doping; however, the fact that the code exists will not by itself reduce doping. Doping will not be reduced alone by rules, by strong declarations or by sanctions on paper. Using the code to set rigorous rules to make a strong stand and to impose tough but fair sanctions will only go part of the way to solving the problem. It will be the actions in the fields of testing and research that will genuinely determine the effectiveness of the fight against doping in sport. It is that moment when we finally cross the line where the chance of being caught is a much greater deterrent than the threat of a sanction that the fight will begin to favour the just, rather than the cheats. Athletes from all sports must know that the chances of being tested and caught are much greater than the chances of avoiding detection.
Staying ahead in the testing game means staying ahead in research. Every day there is evidence of new previously undetected drugs coming to light—THG, EPO, HGH or genetic modification; the list seems endless. It is only through continued support of research that these doping methods will be uncovered and tests for their detection developed. Until recently Australia was the world leader in antidoping research. Inexplicably, however, in recent years the Howard government has chosen to enforce a ban on some of this world-leading research, which has effectively relegated Australia to a position of disciple rather than messiah.
Research and testing must be supported as integral parts of the world antidoping program. The passing of the WADA code has allowed for a worldwide giant leap forward in harmonising efforts across all sports and countries to eliminate doping in sport. Its genuine success, however, rests on the ability of organisations to develop effective detection tests for the myriad of banned substances that riddle sport. The WADA code is like a new Porsche. The specifications are great, it looks good on the outside, and if driven properly it should perform magnificently. Like every high-performance vehicle, it must be handled with care, due consideration and skill.
The WADA code alone cannot make the change. The true success of the code will be ultimately determined by the sports organisations and governing bodies whose duty it is to embrace and enforce the principles of the code. Labor supports WADA and the WADA code. Labor also supports the Australian Sports Drug Agency and its role in promoting the code and leading the fight against doping in sport. As I said at the beginning of my speech, Labor supports this bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2004-03-11,"—Today we are considering two bills cognately, the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Amendment Bill 2003 and the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2003. The first bill makes amendments to the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Act 2002. Its primary purpose is to extend certain charges in the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 during the switch-over between computer systems. The Australian Customs Service has been redeveloping its computer systems for the better management of its business. This is the cargo management re-engineering project, which has achieved much notoriety for its delay and extraordinary overspend. It is an overspend which has left Customs virtually bankrupt, and the receivers have now been called in.
This project and the authority needed for its operation have been authorised by the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2003. This bill contains provisions for the transition between systems so as to provide continuity of function, but authority for the collection of duty in that period is also required. Unfortunately this necessity has not been properly foreseen. In short, it has belatedly been realised that the old and the new systems will need to operate in tandem for a fixed period. This will enable industry to switch over and adapt its systems to the new framework established by Customs. It will also allow a period of grace in which the new system can be bedded down without risk of total failure in business transactions. That is very sensible. It is reassuring for industry, whose confidence in this project is of a very low order. So continuity for the authority to collect duty is needed for both systems. These are very practical propositions which the opposition supports.
The second bill, the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2003, is the fifth piece of legislation necessitated by the CMR project. I emphasise the point just made about the quality of the planning for this project going right back to its inception. We can have no doubt that it will not be the last amending bill brought before this chamber. This bill provides for the tandem operation of the systems described a moment ago. As with all changes to the system, there need to be provisions for transition. This is particularly the case for high-volume systems which operate 24 hours per day. Business in a pipeline for one system must clear, and new business must commence. There cannot be any down time. Industry users need that continuity and safeguard if something goes wrong. Of course, we sincerely hope that Customs gets it right and all the bugs are ironed out. We hope that when the new system goes live there will be no problems. That is why we are currently seeing extensive testing with industry. But, as we know, there is no test like that of the full load of normal daily traffic. Tandem operation is therefore essential for the time being but, as I said earlier, it is a pity that it was not anticipated and put into the planning process. 
It must, however, be said that this is quite a complex project. Customs transactions are detailed with respect to manifest information and other processes. There is an enormous amount of data to be transmitted in line with very detailed legal requirements—hence, there are other provisions in this bill to clarify the communication of data. The bill also makes some changes to the importation of firearms. The minister is given additional powers in some circumstances to withhold such restricted imports. Provision is also made for the clarification of cargo reporting requirements and record retention. Added changes have been made with respect to impoundment. The bill also changes the means for the calculation of duty on imported alcoholic beverages. That has been necessitated by a number of successful appeals on the calculation of duty. Duty will be calculated not on the level stated on the label but as measured for actual content. None of these provisions are controversial, and they are therefore supported.
However, the introduction of these bills does provide an opportunity to draw attention to the parlous state of Customs operations. The management of the CMR project is symptomatic of this, but it also goes to the heart of the government's management of this very important portfolio. It is no news that the CMR project is overspent by $100 million. That in itself is, of course, an indictment. It means this project commenced without proper analysis and continued with inadequate planning. It has been undertaken without a clue as to actual cost.
The evidence is there before us. The Australian Customs Service, the collector of billions of dollars of revenue, is broke. What started as a good idea has become a monster, eating up $100 million of operational funding. No supplementation has been granted by the government by way of capital investment—until now. Customs has run up the white flag to the Department of Finance and Administration and the receivers have been called in. The current additional estimates provide for a capital injection of $43 million.
But it is only the start. Customs were forced to provide for an overspend of $30 million and must find another saving of $24 million before the financial year is out. No operational organisation can manage that task without seriously abandoning some of its operational responsibilities. In fact, we know that is already happening. Staff on the ground, who are already pressed, simply cannot fulfil their duties. It is apparent at airports where there are shortages of staff and rosters are therefore increasingly difficult to fill. There are restricted hours for the operation of X-ray facilities at the four major seaports where cargo flows 24 hours a day. Intakes of trainees are cut. Instructions sent out to regional staff to inspect more ships and ships crews' IDs are fulfilled by stopping other work. The fabric is stretched to the breaking point. 
All of this is at a time of heightened security when it is expected that a frontline force like Customs would be fully funded. That is simply not the case. The admission is on the record. In fact we are looking forward to seeing the findings of the Finance investigation in due course. We look forward to seeing extra provision in the forthcoming budget by way of additional capital investment. What we do not look forward to though is seeing valuable Customs staff with lifelong experience leaving and not being replaced. The CEO of his own volition has admitted that he will have no choice but to tell the government that he cannot any longer carry out necessary and statutory tasks. That is on the record also. What is staggering about this serious predicament is that the minister is in total denial. All we hear from the minister are good news stories about the latest interception of a flick-knife or some narcotics. That is good stuff and we need to know. But what is not being done is the question. It is much more than a public relations task. Underneath, all industry knows there is a serious cancer growing. Customs is starved of operational funds. 
Customs has long been the real force guarding Australia's borders. The sad state of its finances, however, prompts the question: how much longer can it manage under its current administration and with current levels of funding? How much longer will it be before we have a serious incident? We have already seen at Mascot over the New Year a person without a ticket get past the barrier to board an aircraft. Customs own premises were invaded in broad daylight and thieves removed computers, some still in boxes. The investigation took five months and the only report we have is the censored version. We know that very few containers are being inspected. Staff are repeatedly telling us they cannot cope. This is a very serious position Customs finds itself in. These bills today are just further indicators of the problem. The CMR project, despite all good intentions, has become a monster. It has consumed much of Customs capital, and industry is still distrustful and sceptical that the project will not work. We certainly hope that is not true. We support the bills.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-11,"—Radical reform to the customs department systems is a consequence of the legislation passed after a very contentious inquiry and debate in the year 2001. The Democrats were obliged to exercise their balance of power on the original bill and, having made that judgment, have a stake in seeing that the outcomes are as intended. The Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2003 implements a range of measures designed to assist with transitional arrangements required for the ongoing program of customs international trade modernisation and the transition between the current Australian Customs Service electronic reporting systems and the new integrated cargo system as part of the cargo management re-engineering project.
This customs omnibus bill seeks to clarify aspects of the major reforms associated with new electronic communication arrangements aimed at: implementing the program of customs international trade modernisation, enhancing customs border controls, clarifying cargo reporting requirements, and clarifying calculation of customs duties on alcoholic beverages. The Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Amendment Bill 2003 simply extends some transitional provisions in its parent act. I do not want to take a lot of time discussing the provisions of the bills, as we have all agreed that these two bills should proceed cognately as non-controversial. There are, however, a couple of points I want to make about this first bill and the cargo management re-engineering project more generally.
Firstly, I turn to the project itself. As we are all aware, this undertaking by Australian Customs has been in train for several years now. To say the least, it is taking a lot longer than Customs and the minister told us it would. It is a reminder that when the minister stands in this chamber and says, `Trust me,' he needs to be able to back up that trust and fulfil the obligation that he puts to the chamber. The Australian Customs Service initially released its cargo management strategy in 1997 and its draft customs management re-engineering business model in 1999. Since 2000, this project has been considered in a range of different bills, inquiries, reports, and hours of estimates committee hearings. Generally at those times I am otherwise engaged on the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee— 
—We've missed you, Senator Murray!
—I am always grateful for the diligence with which Senator Bishop my colleague in the Labor Party does attend to these matters, but that does not mean to say that I do not keep an eye on it. Last year we passed the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 granting an extension of the legislative deadline for the project until 2005.
The parliament has devoted a great deal of time to this matter of these new systems and has been very accommodating in granting the government and Customs a deal of latitude with respect to this project—indeed, it is being accommodating again today. More than a year overdue, more than $100 million over budget and with the most complex phase of the project yet to be completed, our patience is wearing thin—and when I use the word `our' I do not just use it with respect to my own party. A decade or so ago, Customs got itself into terrible trouble with the parliament and acquired a poor reputation in its corridors. Customs and its minister need to be alert to the growing irritation with poor outcomes in this IT process. This entire affair suggests poor planning and poor project management on the part of the government and the department. While I remain hopeful the new systems will eventually be very beneficial to importers and exporters, as outlined in the original bill and the original projections, this kind of delay and overspending is unacceptable.
Recent press commentary has suggested that industry is growing ever more fearful about the workability of the new system and ever more distrustful about the assurances that it will all be up and running soon. I note that there are also concerns about the fact that matters such as the `deferral of duty' component of the accredited client program have not yet been resolved between Customs and Treasury. Frankly, Minister, the message I seek to give you and which Senator Bishop—I gather from his remarks in the second reading debate—seeks to give you is that this has gone on for long enough. If it is not sorted out soon, the minister will need to ensure heads roll. That means that management, who are responsible for this state of affairs, should pay for it as they would in the private sector, and it means that if the minister does not sort it out he should pay for it as well.
I am somewhat encouraged by comments of Customs officials in the most recent estimates hearings that the last phase of the project, the building and testing of the software components for the imports side, is due to be completed in May this year. While I understand that the process of integrating these new systems may take several months more, it is reassuring to be told that the new July 2005 deadline will be met. More than enough time, money and effort has been expended on this project already.
I will turn finally to just one provision of the bill. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised concerns that item 5 of schedule 2 to this bill gives the minister an apparently unfettered, non-reviewable discretion to order Customs to detain certain goods. The committee pointed out that:
... although the provision states that the Minister must consider that the detention is `in the public interest', there is apparently no means by which the owner of those goods could challenge the exercise of the Minister's discretion.
The Scrutiny of Bills Third Report of 2004, dated 10 March, reported the response of the minister. In part, he said:
The Government protects the Australian community by restricting the import of certain goods, such as dangerous weapons and drugs. Primarily this is achieved through the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (the Prohibited Imports Regulations). New or amending regulations are disallowable instruments. 
The proposed new provisions will only apply to imports which are restricted by the Prohibited Imports Regulations.
.... the Bill also prohibits the Minister from delegating his or her powers under the new provisions—item 2 of Schedule 2 to the Bill refers. On this basis the Government does not propose that the Minister's decision be subject to merits review.
The Government anticipates that the Minister would only need to consider exercising this power in extreme circumstances. Where this occurs the importer, under the terms of proposed new section 77EF, will be entitled to receive compensation on just terms unless the situation is amicably resolved earlier.
The committee accepted this explanation and the safeguards outlined, as do I. It is a pity the explanatory memorandum did not explain this issue fully in the first place and save a lot of time and trouble for those concerned.
In closing, I am aware that there are many very fine people in the customs department. Many are doing a really good job and applying themselves in Australia's interests. I think that some of the achievements of Customs have been really notable and commendable on the operational side, but I want to repeat that this particular issue of the systems of Customs matters so much to Australia. It is not just a question of money, although the money is huge, but it matters so much to Australia's national interest that Customs really does have to get its act together.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-11,"—The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2003 creates a National Measurement Institute within the industry portfolio. It combines a number of existing agencies: the National Measurement Laboratory, currently located within the public research agency, the CSIRO; the National Standards Commission, a stand-alone statutory authority; and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, or AGAL. The Labor Party are not opposing this bill and, on the face of it, the bill is not controversial. In many ways, the bill moves towards the sorts of policy directions that we are interested in doing—that is, finding mechanisms by which we can have a more coordinated national research effort across the whole of government. On the other hand, this bill provides measures which deserve careful consideration and close scrutiny.
The bill goes to matters that are central to aspects of my portfolio—that is, the articulation of standards that meet world's best practice in measurement and calibration. If we look at the historical precedents for this, 150 years ago what went by way of measurement in one town did not necessarily go by way of measurement in the next town. Even the times on the town hall clocks were different—until the advent of the railways and therefore some economic need for some semblance of standardisation to make sense of the railway timetables themselves. In most circumstances, there was not really a pressing need for deadly accuracy when it came to measurement by physical quantities—weight, length and so on. However, in today's environment that is no longer the case. The demands created by sophisticated technology, science, legislation, international agreements and treaties mean that standardised measurement and calibration of measurement instruments are central to the conduct of commerce and public life. 
The functions carried out by Australia's existing agency in this field are very important. They are all distinct. In considering this bill, I think that needs to be understood. Therefore, it is worth spending a couple of minutes describing the salient points. The responsibilities of the National Measurement Laboratory are established by two acts of parliament, the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 and the National Measurement Act 1960. Located within CSIRO, the laboratory's role was strengthened and emphasised by the Keating government's national facility within the CSIRO following recommendations of a committee of inquiry into Australia's standards and conformance infrastructure which reported in 1995. This report put forward the concept of a national system of trade measurement. It articulated the imperative to meet international standards of best practice in this area to enhance Australia's global competitiveness.
The laboratory has a prominent international focus and reputation both in metrology research and through an active comparison process with systems and standards in other countries. Keeping abreast of global requirements for accurate measurement systems and devices grows in importance year by year. International trade, I emphasise, depends on it. The National Measurement Laboratory also runs a calibration service for Australian industry and commerce. Again, as the accuracy of fine measurement becomes more crucial to manufacturing and communication, due to technological requirements, this function also becomes ever more vital. Australia's National Measurement Laboratory plays a pivotal role in assisting the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific to establish and strengthen their national standards and systems in measurement. One of my key reservations about this bill is that this process that we are establishing today contributes to the asset stripping of CSIRO that has taken place continually under this government. CSIRO must retain the ability to operate a comprehensive research program, especially in areas such as this one, which is of central importance to Australian industry.
The National Standards Commission is an independent statutory authority with a range of powers and functions, again crucial to industry and to the commercial world. They include establishing and maintaining a national system of units and standards for measurements of materials, applying these standards to commercial contexts and transactions, and reducing barriers to international trade through global harmonisation of measurement and measurement testing. The commission is currently the authority responsible for the verification of the accuracy of measurement instruments of various kinds, including gas and similar utility meters. It is responsible for the licensing of other authorities—for example, in the states and territories—to carry out this function. It also has enforcement powers, such as the revocation of licences and the power to undertake other disciplinary actions for breaches of measurement standards.
The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories provides actual services in measurement and analysis and is located within the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. The fields it covers include chemistry, microbiology and materials science. Among the critical work that AGAL performs is the provision of forensic analysis for the Australian Federal Police and other government agencies in court actions involving drugs and other prohibited substances. This is a case where the integrity of analytical research and presentation is everything. Of great concern is the matter of the skills and the capacity of the organisation, and that has been the subject of public debate in recent times—a matter that I have raised through Senate estimates. Examples of other projects recently undertaken by AGAL include a review of the technologies for detecting GM materials and the development of a method on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency for detecting certain substances in human blood that may be used improperly by athletes. So this is a hands-on, specialist measurement agency. As such, it performs essentially different, though related, functions from those of the regulatory and research agencies. 
I will return for a moment to the 1995 Kean report, the report of the inquiry I referred to earlier. This was an important inquiry in the process of the development of these agencies. According to the Australian Constitution, measurement and its regulation are the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Yet, when this report was produced, measurement standards varied across all Australian states and territories. A company wanting to produce goods for sale in states and territories had to run the gauntlet of eight separate standards regimes before it could begin. The inquiry that led to the Kean report was set up by the previous Labor government with a view to achieving a national approach that would befit that regime. The report recommended a revamping of the national standards and measurement structures and infrastructure and, more importantly, a truly national framework for regulation and standards setting. Its emphasis was on strengthening existing institutions and functions. Additional funding was recommended, as well as revision and clarification of the role of the National Standards Commission. The then Labor government proposed to do this through a new memorandum of understanding between government and its arms-length standards body.
In short, the framework recommended to the government in 1995, following this independent inquiry, proposed that the formal separation of the regulatory authority, the commission, from the government be preserved—that is, in its structural independence and integrity. At the same time, other aspects of measurement and standards setting would be brought into line across the country and with international best practice.
It might well be argued that, since 1995, it can be demonstrated that rationalisation of the world of measurement and measurement regulation has moved on. I think we could say that, since 1995 and following the change of government in 1996, the coalition has taken a number of modest steps—and I say that they are only modest steps—to implement parts of the recommendations of the Kean report to keep Australia in step with world developments. However, the government should have taken the opportunity to bite the bullet on major reform.
The government has moved to rationalise the standards regime, and what we see before us today is one approach. Labor do not oppose this bill, because we recognise that there is some genuine merit in the efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework and associated public infrastructure. However, back in 1996, the then Minister for Science and Technology, Peter McGauran, expressed the Howard government's support for the major recommendations of the Kean report, especially those relating to the establishment of a single, national regime. The government's attitude then, however, appeared tacitly to support the continuation of the status quo that has until now formally separated the peak national standards body from the administrative machinery of government—that is, as a statutory commission or authority. The government is now moving to dissolve that separation, taking away the statutory independence of the National Standards Commission and moving those functions into the industry department. 
Although it is proposed to establish the position of a chief metrologist, the government is essentially vesting all final power in the secretary to the department. This power includes enforcement and disciplinary action. It also includes the powers of licensing, other than over non-government bodies, to undertake some regulatory functions related to measurement standards in particular fields. Such a move could be regarded as contrary to the direction taken in other policy areas. For instance, if we look at the registration, regulation and enforcement powers relating to companies, we can see that they are regulated by an independent statutory body—that is, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Migration agents are registered and their activities regulated by the independent Migration Agents Registration Authority.
So in the area of measurement standards, where it is critical that there is objectivity and no suggestion of compromise to the integrity of administrative practices, it might well be that a position different from that proposed in this legislation could have been taken. We simply cannot have a situation in which it can be alleged that public servants might fiddle with the calibration of a set of scales. We simply cannot have that circumstance. It is because of the need for accurate measurement and integrity and objectivity of standards of measurement, especially when we are talking about forensic issues with regard to drug enforcement and prosecutions, that the standards not only be right but be seen to be right. These standards must engender confidence in the Australian public and internationally. Basically, we need to ensure in terms of our international trade that there cannot be a question mark over these sorts of issues. If national standards and monitoring in this area are not right, and guaranteed to be right, I say that our trade in high-tech products might not reach its full potential. Australia is a signatory to international agreements that pertain to standards. These agreements are relevant to our standing in negotiations surrounding international trade agreements.
For all these reasons, Labor regard it as crucial that the operations and determinations of our national standards regulatory mechanism, and the research activities that underpin it, should be clearly seen as objective and impartial. Whilst Labor agree to the passage of this legislation, I would like to signal now our firm intention to revisit this issue should we win the next election. We intend to revisit the national standards and measurement framework after we come to office. We must ascertain that the new framework established by this bill, the National Measurement Institute, which is to be located within the industry department, actually performs satisfactorily the functions ascribed to it.
So Labor will review these measures and the research functions related to the measurements currently carried out by CSIRO, to ensure that the capacity of independent, high-calibre research and advice has been retained and been improved. Frankly, in this regard, I am not persuaded at this time that the reallocation of the functions of the National Measurement Laboratory outside the CSIRO is appropriate, nor am I persuaded that the removal of statutory independence of these agencies is appropriate. Labor will re-examine the regulatory functions of the National Measurement Institute to ensure that objectivity and integrity do prevail and are seen to prevail. We will also review the role of chief metrologist and the relationship between that role and the functions of both the minister and the secretary of the department. We will review the enforcement and disciplinary functions of the new institute to assess whether these functions are satisfactorily located in the body as established. We will also examine the hands-on services and product development currently provided by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories. 
The opposition welcome the opportunity to address some of these important and complex issues in the area of national measurement, regulation and standards setting in terms of research and product development and the provision of analytical services. These are matters fundamental to our economy, to our capacity to trade and to our legal framework. We are very concerned to make sure that these things are done properly and we are determined that they will be done properly under a Labor government. Once we come to government, Labor will look to revisit these issues carefully to consider the structures and frameworks that deliver these functions. Labor provide the assurance that, if the new arrangements established by this bill are found wanting, they will be revisited with the priority they clearly deserve.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-11,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister confirm that the review of intelligence agencies requires Mr Philip Flood, to quote the Prime Minister, `to provide advice on ... the adequacy of current resourcing of intelligence agencies and in particular ONA'? Is the minister aware that Mr Flood, while he was the Director-General of ONA, cut the entire staff expertise in the field of chemical and biological weapons proliferation, a specific area found lacking in ONA's assessments of Iraq WMD intelligence? At the time didn't Mr Flood assert that this was done to reorder staffing priorities within the agency and not because there were any doubts about the competence of the job being done? Indeed, didn't the key WMD analyst axed from ONA later serve with great distinction in Iraq with UNSCOM and UNMOVIC?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Intelligence</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-11,"—Mr President, I rise to ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister was unable to answer the question that was asked and proceeded to answer another question, perhaps as he is checking these matters out he can establish whether Mr Flood informed the Prime Minister before he accepted the review task that, in a former incarnation, he put an axe through ONA's WMD assessment capability. Given that this is now the second major review the Howard government has handed to Mr Flood, will the minister ensure Mr Flood's true independence by guaranteeing the Senate that he will not be considered for any further government reviews or tasks at any future time, in a similar vein to the strictly tenured appointments of auditors-general?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Intelligence</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-11,"—I do not know about his policies whilst within ONA. I do not think that is surprising. I will seek advice on that. I have to say, however, that I do not understand why the Labor Party wants to undermine the appointment of Mr Philip Flood. He is a very distinguished Australian. He headed up the department of foreign affairs, he headed ONA and he was our high commissioner to London. My memory is that he headed up the predecessor to AusAID. He has a very wide experience in foreign policy and intelligence agencies. He was appointed to these high offices by our government and by Labor governments. I would have thought he was a most appropriate appointment. 
The fact that the Labor Party want to undermine his work before it starts can only suggest some base political motive within these attacks. It seems that the Labor Party, having demanded the inquiry and having described the sort of person that they wanted to conduct the inquiry—which description fits Mr Flood aptly—now seek to discredit his work before it has even commenced, presumably because they feel that there is no further mileage that can be made out of the WMD issue unless they seek to create another issue. So the issue at the moment is the suitability of Mr Flood and, when he brings down his report, they will then seek to discredit the report on the basis of the case they have made in relation to Mr Flood himself. I think this is a most unfortunate way in which to approach a matter of important national significance.
We obviously want our intelligence agencies to be appropriately funded and to be appropriately staffed. Their role and function are most important in this country. I would have thought that that was beyond dispute. It is certainly the approach of this government. We are looking at his inquiry and his report to be constructive contributions towards ensuring that we have the intelligence gathering and analysis capability within this country that is necessary to contribute appropriately to our security in these very uncertain times.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Intelligence</title>,Questions Without Notice,13,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-11,"—It is most offensive the way in which the Labor Party is seeking to discredit Mr Flood. What is in this for Mr Flood but a willingness to serve the Australian community—a retired senior official with a highly distinguished reputation? What the Labor Party now wants to do is to publicly discredit him, simply because he has been asked to do an inquiry by this government—ignoring the fact that he was a chosen appointment of the previous Labor government's, if my memory is correct. When he was put in as head of ONA it was by former Prime Minister Mr Keating. Obviously, Mr Keating thought he was a suitable person for that very high office. We think he is a suitable person for this task that he has been given.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-11,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence. Minister, did the government consider the needs of Australian industry when it agreed to spend $550 million on second-hand tanks without a tender process? What local production arrangements have been put in place in terms of this acquisition? Is it true that the ammunition for the current Leopard tanks is manufactured here in Australia by an Australian company but all of the ammunition for the Abrams tanks will be imported from the United States? Given that there appears to be nothing in this deal for Australian industry and that delivery will not be until at least 2007, can the minister indicate why he refused to undertake a fully transparent and accountable tender process for this major acquisition project?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Equipment</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-11,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister said that this was the best deal available to Australia. Can the minister explain to the Australian public why it is the best deal to pay new vehicle prices to buy 20-year-old second-hand vehicles from a dealer, who admits it is a gas guzzler, says he has wound back the speedo to zero and we know it is too heavy to drive up the driveway?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Equipment</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-11,"—You could ask the question: does Labor support tanks to protect our infantry or does it not? In the last two years of this government has Labor produced one single defence policy? No—just carping, whinging and whining but never anything constructive. This government is pleased that in a timely way it has acted on the advice of the CDF and particularly on the advice of the leaders of the Australian Army that our infantry need protection in the field from a modern tank, that armour is necessary to protect infantry from the consequences of shoulder-fired, man-held, anti-armour weapons and that it should be obtained promptly. In other words, the existing Leopard tanks are too vulnerable and need to be replaced.
—Order! Senator Faulkner, you know that shouting is disorderly.
—The next issue relates to why the Abrams tank was chosen, and I know the Labor Party does not like it because it is made in America. If the Leopard tank had been chosen, if the German manufactured tank had been chosen, it would have been a much more muted response. But the concept of the ADF getting the best tank available in the world—which is the American tank—is too much for this Labor Party, under the leadership of Mr Latham, to withstand. Why was it chosen? As I said, it was chosen on the basis of the professional advice from our military that the Abrams Eames M1A1 is the best tank available from anywhere in the world to do the job. The second issue relates to a comparison of the costs. The acquisition cost of the Abrams was the lowest of the three that were looked at. I would have thought that Labor would have applauded the fact that we could get a lower acquisition cost than for the German Leopard. The deal that was offered by the United States, through the FMS project, includes all the logistical support, training and ammunition, as I said yesterday, in a way that Australia gets exceptional value for money. Is that what Labor is knocking? 
—Senator Evans, you have asked your question. I reminded you yesterday that, when you ask a question, you are heard in silence and you are supposed to hear the answer in silence, so interjecting does not help.
—Why does Labor not want the best deal, a deal under the FMS? Because it is a deal, of course, with the United States of America. Why should we be embarrassed about the fact that our strategic relationship with the US gives us the opportunity to get a product such as this on an exceptionally good basis—not only the initial purchase price but the whole-of-life support cost? It ought to be something that should be applauded. Why is it not being applauded? Because the deal is being done with the United States of America. And we remember Mr Latham's personal attacks on the President of the United States of America. And what did he say? Does the Labor Party remember what he said or has all that been forgotten with the new Mr Latham? History is in the dustbin. The new Mr Latham is going to head off to America. Guess who he is taking with him. Mr Beazley. You would think he would take Senator Evans to help him with strategic policy. No, he is keeping close to Mr Beazley and Mr Beazley has to take him down the corridors of power in the White House, ease the way in and on the side, of course, apologise for the foul mouth of the new Leader of the Australian Labor Party. Here we have the best tank that could be bought at the best price, with the best support package—and that is something that should be applauded.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-11,"—Would Mr Latham take Senator Evans, who is doing his best to discredit the best tanks in the world? The answer to Senator Evans's question is: the United States of America itself is refurbishing these tanks as front-line tanks for its forces. It was the M1A1 tank which led the American forces so successfully into Iraq that provided protection for US forces on the ground. It did that task superbly. These tanks will be a more updated version of that tank than what the Americans had in the most recent of all conflicts. So if it is good enough for the front-line troops of the United States of America, I reckon that is a reasonable case for saying that it is good enough for the ADF. That is certainly the view of the ADF. This is the tank they want and they are thrilled that they have a government that does not just talk about it for years but actually delivers the product they need.

Can the minister give the Senate more information about the government's response to the ANAO recommendations against ratchet clauses in leases?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Labor Party: Centenary House</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-03-11,"—I can inform Senator Humphries that I have been examining leases in Barton entered into by the previous Labor government between 1989 and 1994. The examination was undertaken with an eye to the vital elements of any lease: the initial term and options for renewal, the frequency and basis of rent reviews and the cost at commencement. I can inform Senator Humphries that the following was revealed. A building owned by the Salvation Army at 2 Brisbane Avenue had a six-year lease with no renewal option. It had its rent reviewed to market rates every two years with no ratchet clause. It had an initial rent of $325 per square metre. Another building, owned by the Australian Democrats at the time, at 10 Brisbane Avenue, had a five-year lease. It had its rent reviewed to market rates every two years with no ratchet clause. It had an initial rent of $250 per square metre.
The general lease terms during that period were about five years and options were very hard to come by, although I note that the Democrats got one. The rent reviews were every two years to market rates. So senators can imagine my surprise at noting a lease for 10 years with a six-year option and another for 15 years with a five-year option. At the time they were signed, both leases contained the highest commencement rent: $327.50 in one case and one substantially higher, more than 10 per cent higher, at $368 per square metre. However, honourable senators will understand my lack of surprise at finding that the two buildings in question with these favourable lease terms were owned by the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Labor Party respectively.
I table a chart that sets out 13 Commonwealth leases in Barton between March 1989 and December 1994. One landlord stands out as having achieved the longest lease term, the highest commencement rent, the only annual rental review and the only guaranteed annual rental increase. Guess who that landlord was. Mr Latham's Labor Party, the same Mr Latham who said on 17 September:
Only Labor ... stands for competitive capitalism—open, free and fair trading, where companies are treated on their merits rather than on the striking of special deals and favouritism.
If the Centenary House lease were to be judged on Mr Latham's own professed standards the rort would be stopped today. The lease was a rort in 1993. It is an even worse rort today. A Labor government signed a lease of its party's national headquarters on outrageous terms in 1993, with clauses ensuring that the outrage compounds each year. Yet the would-be Prime Minister sees nothing wrong. The reason Mr Latham is blinded to this rort is the rivers of gold provided to Labor's election coffers. I am sure that the University of Tasmania would like to have a $36 million income stream. I might add that the Transport Workers Union just happened to donate $340,000 to the Australian Labor Party during the last financial year. Mr Latham owes an explanation to the Salvos, to the Democrats and to the Australian people about this rental rort, how it came into existence and how it justifies—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Labor Party: Centenary House</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,answer
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-03-11,"—Senator Humphries is quite right to mention ratchet clauses because at the very heart of the Centenary House rort is the ratchet clause, which allowed a nine per cent per annum increase each and every year. I just happened to be browsing through old ANAO reports the other day, and what should I find? In 2001 the ANAO said about ratchet clauses: 
Agencies should seek to avoid ratchet clauses ... to ensure that they are only exposed to normal market rentals. 
...	...	...
The effect of a ratchet clause ... prevents a `true market' rental being reflected in subsequent rent reviews ...
What could the ANAO possibly be thinking of with comments like that? We all know what they were thinking about: Centenary House and the rental rort rip-off over which Mr Latham now presides.

Under the Social Security Act, crisis payment is available to persons in receipt of a social security pension or benefit. Because Abstudy living allowance is not paid under the Social Security Act, crisis payment is not available to recipients of an Abstudy living allowance. Abstudy is a package of assistance for Indigenous students paid under policy guidelines issued by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. The package includes a range of payments designed to cater for the students' individual circumstances. Persons receiving support under Abstudy also have access to rent assistance, remote area allowance and pharmaceutical benefits as paid under the Social Security Act. I am advised that Centrelink is undertaking community consultations on the operation of the crisis payment, and the issue of its application to Abstudy students has been raised.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Evans today relating to the Government's purchase of tanks from the United States of America.
In his answer the minister tried to run his latest argument that, by attacking the purchase, we were somehow denying troops the protection that they need. Talk about the last refuge of the scoundrel. What this debate is about is whether the purchase is the best one for Australia, whether we have value for money and whether it meets our operational and strategic needs. That is a proper debate to have in this parliament; it is a proper debate to have in the Australian community. Labor have no qualms about the fact that the Abrams is a good tank, and we have no problems with the concept of hardening the Army. But the question here is whether this is a good deal for Australian taxpayers and whether it is a good deal for the ADF. It is hard to work that out when you know that there was no open competition. There was no tender process undertaken. 
The government, after deciding as late as a couple of years ago that we did not need replacement tanks—they were not a priority—decided that we needed to purchase tanks. But they did not go into an open tender process. They did not look for a competitive process to decide that. There was no transparency about the process. Instead, we have an announcement that this sort of `mates rates' deal is the best deal the government can get for Australia, that they are going to buy 59 tanks—a rather odd number—to replace the hundred or so they have currently at a cost of $550 million and that we all ought to be very happy about that. This is despite the problems that exist about whether we can transport it anywhere, whether we can get it over bridges, whether it is going to sink our landing craft and whether the fuel problems mean we will not be able to provide the logistical support for our tanks in the field. Despite all those problems we are expected to believe it is a good deal and just accept the government's word. You might be inclined to do that if the government did not have such a poor track record—and here the Seasprite helicopter immediately comes to mind. That was the last time the government bought second-hand vehicles from the United States of America. We still have not got them operational and armed. We paid a billion dollars for them. They are very late in delivery and there are huge question marks about these Vietnam War veteran vehicles that we bought. 
But the real question that I think has to be answered is whether or not we can assess this purchase against the purpose for which it was acquired. The government have been very uninterested and disinclined to debate the questions in relation to that. It was only a little while ago that the government said these tanks were not a priority; they were not part of our strategic need. And then they put out a defence updatewhich said, `No, the threats have changed in Australia. We now have a new threat posed by international terrorism and we ought to change our defence posture in certain ways to respond to the threat of terrorism.' I accept that. There is no doubt that that is a reasonable and rational assessment. What I have difficulty coping with is why the government suddenly bought a number of heavy second-hand tanks as a rational response to the rise in terrorism. I just do not get it. I just do not see the justification.  
The minister tells us that the threat of terrorism has changed Australia's security environment. We accept that. Then he says our response to that is to bring forward as a priority the purchasing of a tank that is much heavier than the old tank when the general in charge of Army says he would have preferred a lighter tank and when there a whole range of question marks about our ability to use that tank effectively.
I accept that the Army has argued successfully for a hardening of the Army and the need for armoured support for the infantry. I do not have a problem with that, but the debate is about whether we bought the right tank at the right price and what the purpose of the tank is and whether it will meet Australia's defence needs. There are a large number of questions surrounding these issues that have not been answered. 
It seems to me this is very much a victory for the minister. He has argued to reject the traditional strategic view of the defence of Australia and involvement in our region in favour of creating a defence force whose purpose is to serve in far flung parts of the world as part of a sort of expeditionary force in concert with American forces—and we needed new equipment to do that. Quite frankly, this is what these tanks achieve. These tanks will assist us if the object is to deploy in support of American troops in far flung places of the world. But they do not fit with the traditional strategic view of Australia's defence needs, and so it can only be interpreted as a significant victory for the minister's view.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-11,"—Senator Evans raised a number of different issues; I will start with the last. There seems to be a distinction between the government and the Australian Labor Party in that the last thing we would want to do is to actually fight our battles on Australian shores. We would much prefer to resolve the issue before the problem reached Australia, whether that is within the region and the sorts of contingencies that we have had to address in the past or in some circumstances even further afield. Thus on the issue of terrorism we were prepared to send forces to Afghanistan, because Afghanistan had become the home of al-Qaeda, and to attack al-Qaeda, its command and its training organisation within Afghanistan was one of the key strategies to reducing its capability.
Whether it is nearby or further afield, where Australia fights will depend on where it is threatened. But we certainly do not dream of any tank line across the north of Australia and us fighting traditional tank battles. That might be a concept the Labor Party is still wedded to, but the rest of the world left the Australian Labor Party behind on that one a long time ago. These tanks are designed to provide better protection for the infantry—I have said that, and I will say it again. 
The existing tanks are now too vulnerable, too lightly armoured in relation to modern man-operated anti-tank weapons, anti-armour weapons, that have proliferated. It is that increased risk associated with the proliferation of these weapons that is the basis of the urgency that is seen by Army in this matter. The position has not changed since 2000. In the 2000 white paper, the government said that Australia did not intend to have heavy armoured brigades; we were not going to fight tank battles in the desert. But we did say then that our forces needed to be protected. At that time it was believed that the armour of the Leopard 1s would be adequate. We have learnt in the last few years that the Leopard 1s armour is no longer adequate and something with heavier armour is necessary. Why go to the M1A1? Because our Army, our professionals, our best advice says that it is the best tank in the world for the purposes for which we need it. I cannot see why we should be embarrassed by getting the best to protect our forces. We actually think that is a good idea. If you can afford it, then get the best. 
It is true that General Leahy said that if we could get that protection with a lighter vehicle it would be a good thing, but Senator Evans also forgot to mention that General Leahy went on to say that there is no such vehicle available in the world today. In the decades to come, it might be possible as new forms of armour are developed—like everything else in defence, that technology is developing quite rapidly—but, at the moment, to provide that protection you need a tank of the M1A1 size. That particular variety offers the best tank for the purpose, so that is why there was a preference for it.
Fortuitously, the assessment made from within the department was that that tank was the best value for money as well, through the US Foreign Military Sales process. If we had gone down a different path—what Senator Evans refers to as `the more traditional tender process'—he would have been told that that tank won because it represented best value for money, not necessarily because it was the cheapest. But, when a whole range of factors were taken into account, including its acquisition costs, its whole-of-life costs and the capabilities that it had to represent, it achieved the best value for money. We took the advice of the professional experts in that regard. We are doing exactly what Senator Evans requires with respect to the information that is provided to government, upon which it makes its decision, but we are doing it in a slightly different way from that which he would have apparently preferred. But then we would not have been able to fairly compare it with the FMS process. It is true, as I said in question time, that we took advantage of our strategic relationship and we are not ashamed about that.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-11,"—Senator Hill does not want to debate the whole issue; he only wants to tell us about part of the story on the tanks. Senator Hill has not explained that a transparent process that provides all that information would have been a far better course. There are many questions that remain unanswered on the government's purchase of 59 M1A1 Abram tanks from the United States. They are, as we already know, second-hand. The opposition know this, and we also know that a team is being sent to the US to choose 59 tanks from the selection pool. However, the question remains: if you are going to select them in this way, can the minister give an assurance that the team being sent to the US for the selection process will have a number of qualified technical personnel? For the minister's benefit, they would be qualified engineers who could ensure these issues are taken into consideration. Because of this opaque process we do not know whether they were considered—the minister has not informed us. Have the tanks sat on big US Marine Corps preposition ships? The minister may or may not be aware that, if they have sat on preposition ships, they may have rust. No amount of servicing is going to fix those corrosion problems.
The next question goes to burden of proof. Is there substantive material to prove that the tanks on offer were not used in the 1991 Gulf War? Have any of the tanks on offer been used as training vehicles at Fort Irwin, the US national training centre? Anyone who knows about training centres—if the minister has taught his son how to drive in his car—would know that, if you are using them for training vehicles, they generally tend to be thrashed a little. Were any of the tanks in the pool used in the 1991 Gulf War? More importantly, were any of these tanks hit by Iraqi fire? I believe that the minister has said that the Navy may have to make arrangements for some of its fleet to accommodate the heavier Abrams. What cost are you going to put on that? Has that been factored into the overall purchase price? You say you are getting best value for money, but you are only isolating that narrow band and talking about tanks. What we do not understand, and what we have not heard from the minister, is whether he has considered whether HMAS Tobruk will have to be modified.
—Can I have a second go to answer all those questions?
—I am sure you will be able to answer them in your time, Minister. You had that opportunity twice, during question time and during your taking note, to provide some of this detail. What modifications will have to be made, and at what cost? The current Leopards, which the papers have indicated have some cracks—and I think you indicated that as well—will also have to be upgraded. As far as I understand, that is going to be curtailed. Will a penalty be paid by the Australian Army in relation to that curtailment? If so, why don't you tell us how much it will cost if there is a penalty provision? How much will you discount that whole purchase price?
The Minister for Defence said today that these tanks will provide increased mobility on the battlefield. It will do us no good if we cannot get the tanks to the battlefield in the first place. Will the M113 upgrade program provide armoured personnel carriers to operate these tanks? These are some of the questions that you would expect to be answered in an open and transparent process, questions which the Army would normally answer. Our Army deserves the right to have up-to-date equipment—particularly equipment like the M113, which will save lives as the minister said—but it should do so in an open and transparent environment where we know that we are getting value for money. We should not have to take it on a kiss and a promise from the defence minister.
`Value for money' in defence seems to be a very loose term. We only have to look at the two recently deployed 155 millimetre Howitzer guns sitting in 105 Field Battery at Enoggera to know what the problem is. Perhaps the minister could get artillery shells for those 155s. That is what can happen. You are now going to purchase another four 105 Howitzers, and you will have six of them sitting at Enoggera with no shells. That is what can happen if you do not open up the process and you do not examine all the logistical issues that go with it. When will the minister provide shells for the 155 Howitzers? How long have they been dry-firing for now, Minister? It does not take six months or longer to come up to speed on how to operate a 155 Howitzer.

"Ferguson, Senator Alan",LP,2004-03-11,"—The one thing that is quite evident from the debate today is that the contributions from Senator Chris Evans and Senator Ludwig serve to highlight the fact that the minister and this government have made a sound decision, have made the decision to purchase, and that for all of those years in government Labor refused to make decisions. We are left now making acquisitions and decisions that should have been made some time ago. There is no defence acquisition made at any time or in any place that is not questioned by some of these so-called experts of defence capabilities and defence commentators. There are always questions raised by the so-called experts, and it would appear that Senator Chris Evans and Senator Ludwig have done their best to look at all of the negative aspects that have been raised by some of the commentators about any potential purchases and set up some straw man or argument. 
Senator Chris Evans in his contribution said, `Despite all the problems ...' In fact, not one cent has been paid for these tanks yet. We will have the chance to go and select those tanks to make sure that whichever ones are provided to the Australian Army are suitable. We will know what we are buying because we will be able to see for ourselves exactly the condition and state of these tanks and to make sure that we only purchase defence equipment which is in the best interests of this government and the defence of our country.
Senator Chris Evans talks about assessing the purchases against the requirements of the Army. That is exactly what took place. Our professionals, as the minister has said, say that the Abrams is the best tank to suit our purposes. It is the best tank that is currently available in the world to suit the purposes of the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force. For him to question the ability of the professionals in this area to provide us with the most suitable tank bears some questioning. He talks about heavy second-hand tanks. He says that there is a question as to whether these tanks will be the right tanks for us to have and asks why we are going the way of second-hand Abrams tanks. The minister has answered those questions and he answered them very adequately again in the debate on taking note of answers. While the Chief of Army might have liked to have had a lighter tank there is simply not one available. Because there is not one available we have to choose the best available at the best price. Their role is to protect our infantry and if that role is to protect our infantry then in fact this is the best purchase we can make. 
Senator Chris Evans asks whether we have the right tank at the right price. The judgment of the professionals is that yes, we have got the right tank at the right price. He questions the influence of the minister in making sure we get this view. This is the view of the professionals, and that is what is most important.
We also need to remember that over the past 2½ years that this defence minister has been in charge of this department and our armed forces he and the government have made some enormous decisions. Each of those decisions concerned instances that, at the time of his taking over this portfolio, he could have reasonably expected would not have been likely to occur. The decisions that have been made by this minister have stood the test of time in every way. We have a government that, through the minister, has decided that this is the best tank for our operations and that we are getting the right tank at the right price. We have not paid one dollar yet. We will be able to inspect these tanks to see for ourselves, and the experts will be able to see for themselves, what condition they are in.
—What if they are duds?
—We know they will not be duds, Senator Ludwig. Most of the duds in this place are over there, not over `there' as in the USA. Senator Ludwig says that we get only half the story. I can tell you that Senator Hill and those professionals within the Defence Force who made this decision are some of the few people that do know the full story. When you allow professionals and the minister, in the full knowledge of what they are buying, to make the decisions then you will get right decisions.

"Marshall, Senator Gavin",ALP,2004-03-11,"—Senator Hill in answer to a question today indicated that the Labor Party's questioning of this decision to buy the second-hand heavy tanks was somehow to do with anti-American views. Let me refute that absolutely. The Labor Party have always been supportive and have indeed nurtured the US alliance with Australia. We do that on the basis of equal partners in our national interest. Let me be very clear, Senator Hill has indicated that we must be the only people that question this purchase. Let me quote very briefly from the Canberra Times, a newspaper that could hardly be described as being anti-American. An article which appeared on 11 March 2004 says: 
... the decision to purchase invites questions about the competence of the minister and the national security committee of Cabinet, as well as of its most senior military advisers. And the public needs to know why specialised civilian defence expertise—which has been virtually unanimous in opposition to any such purchase—has been completely displaced in national defence decision making. If Government knows more than it is telling the public about ... different defence posture. It is simply impossible to fit this purchase into any publicly discussed defence framework.
Minister, describing anti-Americanism as the reason for questioning the viability of this decision is a nonsense. As the Canberra Times indicates they question it and every civilian commentator and every civilian expert in this field also questions it.
The primary purpose of the defence forces of Australia is to defend Australia itself. The minister indicated that we have changing defence needs. We accept that. We understand and accept that we face new threats now from terrorism, regional instability and insurgency. Very clearly, the foreign minister, Mr Downer, has described the area in which we live as the `arc of instability'. We are at the centre of that arc as he describes it. We have recently intervened in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. There are still tensions in our region in West Papua, Vanuatu, Bougainville and Fiji. We have a vast coastline and the government has taken a view—and I support this—that we need to look at our own region more closely and intervene where it is necessary.
The purchase of this tank cannot in any way fit into that strategy. For a start, we have no ability to move these tanks to any of those areas. If we want to airlift them there, we have to rely on foreign national charter aircraft. The only aircraft that are able to move those tanks are Russian Antonovs or the US Army C5 Galaxies or C17 aircraft. We will have to rely on the availability of charter aircraft and on whether those countries want to make those aircraft available to determine whether we can deploy our tanks in our own region. We cannot move them by ship. Even if we had a capacity in the Navy to move these tanks and even if we were able to modify them to move the tanks round, as I understand it there is not a wharf within 10,000 kilometres of Australia that is capable of having those tanks offloaded. There is not a wharf in the South Pacific or in South-East Asia where these tanks could be offloaded.
The minister says that our infantry deserves the protection of these tanks. If our infantry is going to the South Pacific, why do they not deserve the protection of these tanks? Those tanks cannot be there. It is a ridiculous notion for this minister to say that these are the best tanks, when these tanks obviously do not fit into our overall national interest. They do not fit into our existing infrastructure and they can play no positive role in the defence of our immediate region or the defence of Australia as a whole.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-03-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002 has come on a lot quicker today, ironically, than I think we expected, but in actual fact this bill has taken a long time to get to the floor of this chamber. I am proud to say that it is a history making day—maybe a herstory making day—today as we, for the first time as a federal parliament, debate the issue of paid maternity leave legislation. As honourable senators would be aware, we are one of only two OECD countries that do not provide some form of national paid maternity leave, particularly paid leave for women when they decide to have a child. Two-thirds of Australia's working women have no access to any form of paid leave on the birth of a child. 
The legislation that I tabled in this place in May 2002, almost two years ago, provides for what would be Australia's first national, government funded, paid maternity leave scheme applicable to all Australian working women. The design of this scheme would ensure not only that women had the 14 weeks which is the ILO standard of paid leave but also that they would be paid the minimum wage. This scheme is intended to underpin local top-ups at the workplace level and it would replace current arrangements whereby about a third of Australia's working women, mostly in larger companies and in our public sector workplaces, enjoy paid leave whereas two-thirds of Australia's working women do not. This bill aims to address this inequity by ensuring a more fair system of paid maternity leave for all working mothers on the birth of a child.
The Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee investigated the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002 after it was introduced. Arising from the committee's report was a chair's report accompanied by supplementary reports by the Australian Democrats, the ALP and the Australian Greens. Overall, there was a commitment to the notion of paid maternity leave from a majority of members but, understandably, there was debate about how best that scheme would be structured and introduced. Thus, this legislation has been examined quite comprehensively and in great detail.
Today I circulate amendments that take into account the proposed changes and the recommendations within that Senate committee report. This may be the first time this legislation has been debated on the floor of the chamber but, in fact, it has been reviewed comprehensively previously and recommendations have been adopted to fix up some anomalies in this bill and any quirks of the legislation in its original drafting that needed to be rectified. Essentially, the aim was to provide a national system that did not provide on-costs or burdens for small business, large business or medium-sized business but that, at the same time, would create an incentive for women in the workplace not only so that they could have their children but also so that they could return to their workplace after the birth of their child.
The committee received 34 submissions on the bill. It took additional evidence from witnesses over two days of public hearings. There were contributions from individuals, from women's organisations, from organisations generally, from the business community—from a range of organisations. I cite as one example the Australian Industry Group, which said at the time:
Government funded paid maternity leave scheme: affordable and desirable.
I note that at the time the Australian Hotels Association passed a resolution at one of their executive meetings in which they endorsed this bill. They endorsed the model that I put forward at the last election and then provided in this legislative format in May 2002.
—Was that the New South Wales hotels association?
—It is the national AHA. It is a fully costed government funded scheme; it is a comprehensive model that allows that important 14 weeks of paid leave for women. A practical, efficient fair system of government funded paid maternity leave has clearly found widespread support among the Australian community. Employers, unions, women's organisations, individuals and community organisations see the need for greater support for women when they have a child.
Evidence before the inquiry—and I am sure that this number has increased—showed that three-quarters of Australians support paid maternity leave. That was evidence from BPW. They suggested that there was a great deal of support in the community. Since then news polls, research, surveys, editorials and the rhetoric of both major parties indicate that there is strong support for work and family measures that make that ability to balance work and family issues better. That is a desirable aim for all of us. 
The problem is that we have heard a lot of discussion on this issue but we have seen minimal action. We have not seen action or specifics, particularly from the government, which said that barbecue stopper issues—their work and family debate—would be a priority for them. They said that at the last election. The Prime Minister said it and I welcomed his comments at the time. But almost three years later I am waiting to see some specifics, some constructive contribution to this debate. And I do not call the baby bonus constructive—a scheme that was an ad hoc, ill-conceived election measure pronounced by the Prime Minister during that campaign. It was a scheme that budgeted for up to $550 million in its third year of operation, a scheme that inevitably benefits more wealthy women, a scheme that is based on an incentive for these women to take more time—years, in fact—out of the work force.
Let me make something very clear: the Australian Democrats believe that motherhood is an important and valuable role—as would all senators in this place—and we believe that women who choose to stay at home and have a child should have that work acknowledged. They should be able to do that in a way that is well resourced. Similarly, Australia's working women should be able to choose to have a child and not feel forced to give up their income or, indeed, their employment. There is a form of systemic discrimination that exists in our society against those women in the work force who choose to have a child. Many of them feel they cannot be open with their employer about the fact that they are of child-rearing age and they may want to have a child. Many of them, when they do have a child, do not feel they can take time off work.
While women have access to one year's unpaid leave in our society, it is the access to paid leave that makes a difference as to whether or not they can stay in employment—the difference as to whether or not they can retain their job after they have had a child. Many families just cannot afford it. There was one case that came before the Senate inquiry that was of particular significance and it was certainly one that astounded me—although it probably should not have surprised me, given the evidence available—of a woman who said in her submission that she had had a caesarean and gone back to work within two weeks of having that child, not because she wanted to, not because she was well enough to and not because it was in the interests of the child to, but because she needed the income. This is the reality with which we are faced today. We have two-thirds of working women, and thus their families, unable to access paid leave if they decide to have a child.
As we know, a lot of families—and I suspect this is a reason for declining fertility rates—are delaying the decision to have a child. In fact, it is not so much the first child but the second child that families tend to postpone. Indeed, in some cases, they do not have a second child because it is exactly at the point of having a second child that the difficulties arise with access to income and indeed access to leave. So the rationale for paid maternity leave is to try to redress that discrimination against women in the work force. It is to ensure the welfare of the mother and child as well. 
There is widespread evidence in our society that maternal health, bonding with the child and the child's health are all improved through a period of leave from paid work for the mother with her new baby. I know that the inquiry received a great deal of evidence on this and many people have examined this evidence over the years. In fact, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, also examined this issue. Family health and wellbeing are improved by paid parental leave, particularly paid leave for the mother. As the Australian Industry Group put it: 
Community benefits include improved returns on public investment in education and training as well as improved health and welfare of mothers and newborn children due to reduced hardship in the period immediately following the birth of a child.
The significant changes in the labour market over recent decades have created a strong argument for paid maternity leave. In fact in 1976 only 48 per cent of women in the peak child bearing age group of 25 to 34 years were in the labour market. This has now increased to 70 per cent, so there has been a radical change in the participation rates of women—particularly the child-rearing aged women—in the work force. In the overall child-bearing age group of 15 to 44 years, 65 per cent of women are now in paid work, and a further five per cent are looking for work. We just have to accept the fact that most women are now in paid work at the time they become pregnant. Many of them will choose to return to work after the birth of a child, so let us ensure that that can be done in a way that is healthy and that there is no discrimination in the workplace as a consequence.
There are also employer benefits. Many employers are recognising that family friendly policies and practices deliver real benefits to their businesses—such as increased staff retention and productivity, reduced costs of hiring and retraining, and improved staff morale. It has been fantastic looking at some of the businesses around Australia that provide family friendly workplaces or paid maternity leave—for example, Pacific Brands, Westpac and Esprit. Esprit is a great example of a female dominated shop and industry. A lot of female workers in Esprit stores want to have children or have had children and Esprit has worked out that it is better to invest in the people they have already trained and who have the job down pat. Why not keep those workers and thus not have to expend money in order to retrain or rehire as the case may be?
Other reasons for maternity leave include equity among workplaces and international standards. On that point, this bill provides for a 14-week paid maternity leave scheme. That is in line with the ILO convention; that is the ILO standard. As for whether or not this legislation, or paid maternity leave generally, will have a positive impact on the declining fertility rate, I suspect that is a debate others will have. It is certainly not my motive for putting forward this legislation. I have put forward legislation that amends the Workplace Relations Act because I think paid maternity leave should be viewed in that way—as a workplace entitlement designed to redress discrimination but at the same time recognise the biological imperatives that face women at the birth of a child, hence the 14-week standard. I do not think the birth rate is an issue we can afford to ignore. That is why I put on record in my previous comments in the second reading debate—and also in the Senate committee processes examining this bill—that there are reasons associated with a lack of paid leave that see families, and women specifically, not having children, not having further children or postponing having children.
This bill had been through a few processes before it got to this chamber today. I am not the only one who initiated an inquiry into, and an examination of, the issue of paid maternity leave. As you would know Pru Goward, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, has also examined this issue. I was very pleased to see that in her report, A time to value, she emulated the model that is before us today. She had the opportunity in two reports to examine what would be the most appropriate process, whether or not it should apply to all women, or working women specifically; how many weeks it should be for; whether it should be at average weekly earnings or at minimum income; whether it should apply to casuals, and whether it should involve superannuation payments et cetera. She concluded that the model that I provided, not only to her but to others in evidence before that, was appropriate. 
This bill has had quite a long gestation period—ignore the pun. As I said, it incorporates some of the suggestions that were made by other senators in this place when it was examined by the Senate committee. The reality is that Australia has paid maternity leave but only for an elite few. Women in this place would know that we can access paid maternity leave. Women in the Public Service, women in some key industries and women in some big businesses can access paid maternity leave, but I remind the chamber again that two-thirds of working women are not in that position.
Why is it time to debate this now? Because we lag behind the rest of the world, because we have declining fertility rates and because both major parties have talked about work and family measures. Isn't it time to see some action on this issue? I ask honourable senators today not to simply talk to this bill but to give us an indication of what their intentions are. Do they intend to support the bill? Do they intend to support the legislation with amendment? Do they intend to bring in their own legislation? If they do, what are the specifics of that legislation? That is my request, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, particularly to the Labor members here today.
I know that the Labor Party is on record as supporting paid maternity leave. If we doubted it, Wayne Swan said at the Press Club yesterday that he supported it. So we have one party clearly on record supporting paid maternity leave. There is a commitment from the Labor Party and I acknowledge that. I hope that we can get some more specifics about what they will introduce if they get into office and what they will or will not support today. As for the government, I am yet to understand exactly why they have not acted on this issue. Surely they understand how important it is. They are the first to talk about declining fertility rates. At the last election they were probably the first of the two major parties to acknowledge work and family as an important issue. So what is the hold-up? I see that Senator Minchin is in the chamber. I have asked him questions on this issue before. I know that he has strong views and I welcome that debate. As one of the two men responsible for finances in this nation, I genuinely ask him: what is the hold-up? How is it that this government can provide $550 million in forward estimates for a baby bonus scheme and yet ignore the possible introduction of a paid maternity leave scheme for all working women that would only cost this government $213 million or $352 million, depending on whether or not you introduced it with the baby bonus?
The amendments do a couple of things. Firstly, one set of amendments updates the bill so that it is current. Some senators may have read the bill only recently and wondered why some of the dates or some of the figures are not correct. Obviously that is because the bill was introduced two years ago. So those amendments will solve that issue—it is certainly not a reason to oppose the legislation. Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, the majority of the amendments seek to introduce the majority recommendations from the Senate committee. They take on not only the recommendations made in my report but also the views of others who were part of that process. 
The amendments aim to ensure that eligible employment periods can be accumulated across multiple employers; that 12 months of employment can be accumulated over a two-year period; that the two-year accumulation period can occur either side of the period of leave; that no distinction is made between casual and permanent employment, that is, any eligible casual employees should have access to the government funded payment; that no distinction is made between part-time or full-time employment with no minimum hours requirement, although these factors will actually affect the level of payment; and a minimum of three months unpaid leave for all women in paid work in Australia regardless of their prior employment record, their casual or part-time status at the time, or any other employment criteria.
The amendments also provide for a review of the scheme, which is something that was suggested and which I heartily adopt, after three years. This review must incorporate, firstly, an analysis of the scope and impact of enterprise top-ups and, secondly—depending on the results of that analysis—consideration as to the demand for and the merits of an employer levy. Under the provisions of this bill, employers will continue to pay superannuation contributions to employees during the period of their paid maternity leave—I think that may answer a question Senator Nettle had for me during that process; payment can be taken at either a full rate for 14 weeks or at half the rate over a period 28 weeks; and, if agreed between the Commonwealth and state governments, all employees, including state employees, regardless of the sector in which they are employed, will have access to government funded paid maternity leave. That should answer some of the questions some senators have asked previously.
I thank the senators who are involved in this debate today. I do care strongly about this issue, as I know many of you in this place do. I put this bill forward as a way of creating some momentum around the debate and contributing to it. I am glad to say that the combined efforts of many people over the last couple of years have led to a point today where I think we will see results—I hope so—in this budget. I urge honourable senators to view this bill favourably today.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PAID MATERNITY LEAVE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-11,"—Labor welcome the opportunity to debate today the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002. As indicated by Senator Stott Despoja, only yesterday Mr Swan indicated Labor's solid support for a paid maternity leave scheme. I should highlight at this stage—to avoid any confusion which others have generated in the past—that Labor's view is that such a scheme should be provided for with no additional cost to small businesses. This has clearly been stated many times, including in the Labor Party platform unanimously endorsed at Labor's national conference of January 2004. Although Labor support 14 weeks paid maternity leave, we do not believe that this bill is the correct vehicle for its introduction. Whilst Senator Stott Despoja might like a Democrats private member's bill in the Senate to be the path through which the government—or, indeed, the opposition—might indicate their policies, I think that is highly unlikely and implausible. But this does give us an opportunity to indicate Labor's view on a number of the issues that were raised through the process of this bill and its consideration in the committee.
Our view in relation to paid maternity leave generally was foreshadowed in the Labor senators' report to the inquiry into this bill by the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. We do not believe that paid maternity leave is purely an industrial issue and we therefore question whether the Workplace Relations Act is the proper legislative vehicle for such a significant reform. Labor also have concerns about a number of details in the bill. Specifically, we remain unconvinced that the bill proposes the best solution to the complex issues around public and private funding and to whom the payment should be made—whether that is employers or employees. Labor believe these issues warrant further consideration—which we are currently conducting. 
Let me go back to the critical issue here: why do we need paid maternity leave? Labor believe that paid maternity leave is a critical part of a modern policy response to work and family issues. There is an element of history here which I do not think the report itself commented on, and certainly Senator Stott Despoja did not in the discussion here today, with respect to Australia's obligations in relation to maternity protection. Labor were on course to getting us to meet those commitments. What this bill does not deal with, as far as I can see, is the current maternity allowance. It was around the time I first came into this place, in 1995, that Labor introduced the maternity allowance. It might not hurt for us to revisit some of that history and the basis for it. The present maternity allowance, which was consequently adapted into the maternity allowance and the maternity immunisation allowance, was introduced to provide for seven weeks basic income support for women who had babies as long as they were under an income threshold of, essentially, the family tax benefit higher income cut-outs. That amount, which now is just over $1,000, was calculated roughly at the time of seven weeks of basic income support regardless of the income of your partner—unless it lifted you well above the family tax benefit thresholds. Labor's objective at that time—and, indeed, I think that if we had made government afterwards then we would have implemented it—would have been to double that payment to equate to the 14 weeks.
Whilst it was basic income support—and I note that the report canvasses a number of options for precisely what income level we should look at for paid maternity leave—I am surprised that very few of the commentators and participants in this debate have not remembered and have not acknowledged that Labor did in fact get us halfway to meeting our minimum international obligations. In reflecting on why we need paid maternity leave, I think that Labor are able to demonstrate that we do have form, we were trying to address this problem and, had we continued in government, we probably would have resolved some, if not many, of the issues of concern.
When we reflect on the government's response, we find that the Prime Minister has often sought to rebut the arguments for paid maternity leave by saying that it is not a panacea for work and family balance. That it is not a panacea may be so, but it is an important part of work and family policy. Given the government's view to date, its hedging, sending off to inquiries and not responding to recommendations from the Sex Discrimination Commissioner should not be so surprising to some in this debate. I have before me an article dating back to September 1986 in which Mr Howard says maternity leave may have to go. The article says:
The Leader of the Opposition ...
at that time it was Mr Howard—
has said he would consider scrapping maternity leave for federal public servants. 
He described the 12-month leave entitlement for women—
remember, most of this 12 months is unpaid leave—
who have been employed for more than 12 months as `very generous' and said a coalition government would look to abolish it.
We need to remember the government's starting point: they question whether this type of benefit should exist. In comparison to Labor's position so far of seeking to address the matter, the distinction is quite stark. Labor recognises the need for paid maternity leave to be supplemented by other work and family policies like giving parents a better chance of getting part-time work when they return from parental leave if that is what they want. No, paid maternity leave is not a panacea but it is a key way forward for Australian families. Paid maternity leave is about the health of our mothers and children. It provides mothers with the support they need at the time of birth.
What has become more and more alarming in recent times is the number of stories you hear of mothers returning to work well before they should. Perhaps in Australia—unlike some other countries—this is surprising to some people, but it is a recent trend as economic circumstances, such as mortgage rates and even child-care issues, start being brought to bear. Many mothers are feeling these pressures. There is a good reason why most OECD countries, most developed countries, aside from Australia and the United States have paid maternity leave: to try to ensure that mothers will be supported whilst they are out of the work force during the minimum period of roughly three months when they should not be working, when they should be caring for a newborn child. The health and wellbeing of both the child and the mother highlight that that is the most desirable social outcome.
The 240,000 Australian women who have babies each year need time to recover from childbirth and be with their newborn baby. It is shameful that Australia is the only developed country, other than the United States of America, which does not provide a national paid maternity leave scheme. Australia needs such a scheme to support happy, healthy mothers and happy, healthy babies. We talk about having a national agenda for early childhood. Whilst we continue to lack a specific strategy there, one clear component of that strategy should be support to enable mothers during those few months around the birth to be at home with their baby. As I said, contemporary pressures today result time and time again in cases where that is not able to occur.
If we look at the current level of paid maternity leave in Australia, we see that only 38 per cent of female employees have access to paid leave. Few Australian women receive the 14 weeks recommended by the International Labour Organisation, whose equality of opportunity in the work force survey found that only three per cent of about 1,600 organisations surveyed offered paid maternity leave of 14 weeks or more. The average period of paid maternity leave in federal enterprise agreements is eight weeks.
Perhaps more concerning than the absence of paid maternity leave is what is happening nowadays in relation to unpaid maternity leave. A recent piece of research which was published just last month in both the Age and the Sydney Sun-Herald highlights that many women are not using or are unaware of their entitlement to unpaid maternity leave. Marian Baird, who compiled the study, found that three out of four parents did not use or did not know of their entitlement to unpaid parental leave after the birth of the child. The survey found that only 16 per cent of women and 10 per cent of men had taken advantage of it. It found that fathers were significantly less likely to take unpaid leave but that women earning more than $70,000 a year were more likely to take time off without pay to care for their newborn. So those actually taking the time are those on well-established incomes who can afford to take time off without pay. One has to continue to be concerned about the number of women, and in some cases men, who do not have the income or the assets to enable them to afford time off without pay and who continue working to the detriment of themselves and their children. 
Dealing with some work issues, a national paid maternity leave scheme will ensure that no Australian women are forced to return to work for financial reasons before they have recovered from childbirth or before they feel their child is ready to be left in care. Today most Australian women have either full-time or part-time work and the number of women in paid employment is greater than ever before. In 1966 the proportion of women in the work force was 35.3 per cent. Today this proportion has risen to a record 56.3 per cent. Paid maternity leave helps women retain their connection to the workplace. A recent survey done by the government's Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency found that the retention rate of women returning to work after maternity leave was more than 10 per cent higher in organisations that offered paid maternity leave than in those that did not. Productivity, staff retention, employee loyalty and corporate image can often receive a substantial boost through family flexible work practices.
Westpac have reported that their retention rate of female employees increased from 54 per cent in 1995 to 93 per cent in the year 2000, partly as a result of introducing paid maternity leave. They have calculated that an increase in the return to work rate of 10 per cent in three years would cover the cost of its paid maternity leave scheme. When their return to work rate went up over 30 per cent it represented a significant return to the organisation on their investment. However, we know from the history to date that despite these organisational benefits there is considerable resistance to businesses and enterprises going down this path. The enterprise bargaining approach has not worked in this area and this is why the government must address the need for a national scheme.
Workplace connection is not the only one of the many strong reasons to support the need for a national paid maternity leave scheme. The Labor senators' report on the bill pointed to the evidence of Professor Wendy Weeks, who provided a convincing list of reasons for paid maternity leave other than just the fertility rates. She stated that, firstly, paid maternity leave has been acknowledged by international instruments such as CEDAW and the ILO Maternity Protection Convention as a human right; secondly, it is a basic family and workplace policy in the great majority of developed nations, with the USA and Australia being, as I said, the two exceptions; thirdly, it will go some way towards addressing systematic discrimination on the basis of gender if it is provided on a national level rather than, necessarily, just on an enterprise and ad hoc basis; fourthly, it will provide some income security for women; fifthly, it acknowledges the social and economic worth of parenting; sixthly, it is supportive of families in their choice to have children; seventhly, it is responsive to women's health needs pre and post partum and during the establishment of breastfeeding—another social objective we need to reinforce; and, finally, it values the work that women do carrying, delivering and caring for infants as work in itself.
In addition, the issue of fertility rates cannot be ignored in the debate about paid maternity leave. Australia's birthrate has dropped dramatically over the last decades. Australian women are having, as Senator Stott Despoja highlighted, fewer babies. The birthrate fell from 3.5 babies per woman in the early 1960s to just 1.7 in 2001. This is the lowest rate on record, down from 1.75 in 2000 and much worse than previous lows of 1.86 and 1.94 recorded in 1991 and 1981. Many women are delaying having a child until they have completed their education, established their career and purchased their first home—and perhaps paid for their education as well. The median age for women having their first child has risen to 30 years. The downturn in Australia's birthrate is contributing to our ageing population. This may lead to a greater proportion of the population that needs to be supported by the working-age population and will potentially contribute to problems for Australia's economic future. Yet this government's response, its own Intergenerational Report, did nothing to address this critical issue; nor did the more recent report of the Treasurer when it had a chance to address some of the intergenerational issues highlighted by our lack of support for families with young children. 
A work and family framework is one of a range of measures that can contribute to a national strategy for helping arrest Australia's birthrate and help Australian families. For life now is tough for Australian families under this government. Whilst John Howard has said that he thinks that a policy mix for working families is `about right', at the same time he says it is a barbecue stopper amongst average punters. Essentially, you cannot have it both ways, and Labor certainly does not agree that the current mix is about right. The Howard government's attacks on workers' conditions have stripped many provisions for working parents from industrial awards and diminished the ability of workers to bargain collectively. This was recognised by the Prime Minister's own interdepartmental task force into work and family, which noted that the government's award simplification process had removed a provision that gave parents returning from part-time leave the right to ask for part-time work. Labor is committed to restoring this right, and it will be constructive and not destructive. We need to be very constructive about women's access to part-time work—another one of the promises of the Prime Minister that he will address—and the effective marginal tax rates that that often attracts as their work interacts with the social security and tax system. Again, this is something that we have not seen any action on although it has been an issue on which rhetoric has flown for quite some time.
When Senator Stott Despoja was reflecting on the International Labour Organisation, it reminded me of one element of the Australian industrial relations system that I do value quite dearly—one that still, fortunately, does remain. Conditions that part-time workers attract, if they are actually characterised as part-time—and we know what has happened with the growth of casual work—are the same as entitlements of a full-time worker. This is something that I took for granted for many years until at the ILO I discovered that in many European countries they did not have the same tendency to provide the same entitlements to part-time workers as they do full-time workers. This is a critical component of our industrial relations system that we must preserve—and indeed enhance. This is why Labor says that we need to look at ways through our industrial relations system of enhancing the ability, particularly of parents with young children, to move to part-time work if that is what they need to do to manage their work and family lives and if it is reasonable within the business environment in which they or their employer are operating.  
Unfortunately, the enterprise bargaining philosophy has not been delivering this, as indeed it has not been able to deliver paid maternity leave. Perhaps it is one of the most fundamental aspects of the system that the Prime Minister and many others ignore when they think, `Well, people can bargain for these additional entitlements.' They fail to understand the intrinsic nature of the bargaining relationship between most employers and their employees. Most employees are not in the position to issue demands for additional pay, additional conditions, paid maternity leave or definite access to part-time work.
—Then why are AWAs growing?
—Senator McGauran asks me about this point. Certainly the power relationship means that a casual or part-time checkout operator within the Coles Myer corporation is not in a position to bargain over those sorts of conditions. In fact, they are often struggling to bargain about some regularity of their working hours so that they can fit with their access to child care so that they can indeed work if they have a young child. These are the issues that confront average workers on a day-to-day basis. Unfortunately, some of the changes that have occurred in our industrial relations system have made this worse. We now have workers who have lost their protections about when they can have their rosters or their work changed, and that then prevents them from combining their work with suitable child-care arrangements. They cannot access the type of work they need. The government needs to understand this aspect of the situation, but unfortunately it seems far from comprehending the problems of day-to-day life for many workers with young families.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PAID MATERNITY LEAVE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-03-11,"—Today we are debating the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002. In so doing, I think it is important to state from the government's perspective that the Prime Minister has indicated on a number of occasions that maternity leave is one of the issues being considered in the context of building on the government's family and work policy. But in that context we have to make sure that whatever changes are made are fair to people who choose either to work or to stay at home. I say that because one of the difficulties we could have in trying to do something like this is that we end up with one group of people actually being better off than another group of people who choose not to go back to work or who choose not to be in the work force to start with, and that is an important area. There is a fine balance in all of this also in making sure that we do not remove the choice of women and the choice of families in what they are going to do. In doing that we need to be cognisant of the fact that many families choose to work straight after the birth of a child or, in fact, to have the father of the child take over the care of the child.
What we are very careful and mindful of is that we have increased that choice by assisting both men and women, particularly women, with increased wages and increased availability of child care. We have increased so many of the areas of assistance to families so that they can make the choice. I think it is worth noting that when we talk to young women, as Senator Patterson mentioned in the Senate only the other day, opportunity and choice are the two things that they want and that they consider are sacrosanct.
This government has given $11 billion in assistance to families through family tax benefits—almost $2 billion a year more, which means about $6,000 per family. In addition, we have funded family tax benefit B, which enables a member of the family to stay at home; it gives the family that choice. That is really what we are concerned about in the entire overview of this particular policy option—to make sure that we do not undermine choice but that we enhance what families actually want for themselves. It was interesting reading part of the report of the inquiry that the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee conducted back in 2000 which says: 
Evidence before the committee indicates the pitfalls of assuming that benefits can be standardised for those in paid work and for those ... who stay at home. It is difficult to achieve this aim without creating perceptions of unequal treatment.
That, I think, is our primary consideration. It was interesting listening to Senator Collins's contributions, because her ideological fixation on having the trade union movement being paramount in this country is just so outdated. People have voted with their feet. They have decided where they are going to stand on this issue. They have walked away from the trade union movement in favour of going and negotiating at an enterprise bargaining level. The general direction of the workplace relations reforms has been to give Australian workers and employers the opportunity to resolve workplace relations issues in the workplace through certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements. If paid maternity leave is desired by those who are involved in those negotiations and they want it as part of their working conditions, it can be discussed as part of the usual process of negotiating certified agreements under the act.
It is interesting that the Labor Party still have this fixation of making sure that workers are somehow attached to the trade union movement with a ball and chain, when we have seen the results of a Business Council of Australia survey in 2003 that highlighted the fact that tackling the issues of work and family effectively requires strategies, policies and activities that can be tailored to particular circumstances and employees rather than assuming a one size fits all solution. A very interesting result was that 93 per cent of the companies surveyed offered flexible working hours, including flexible start and finish times. That reminds me—if I may interrupt the flow of those figures—of something that happened under the Labor Party. I remember there was a clothing manufacturer in Victoria with a predominantly female employee base, and quite often a lot of those employees were of overseas origin. They went to their employer and asked whether they could have a half hour instead of an hour for lunch and sacrifice their quarter of an hour morning and afternoon tea breaks so that they could finish an hour earlier to go and pick up their children from school. The employer said: `That's fine by us. That's okay. No problem.' And do you know what happened? The trade union movement said, `Oh, no you don't; we'll close you down.' So the female workers had to oblige the trade union bosses and not go and pick up their children after school. That was under the Labor Party government.
—What was the name of the company?
—I do not recall the name of the company, Senator.
—You should put it on the table or go and check it out.
—Senator George Campbell, who is just an old Labor union hack, comes in here and says, `Do you remember the name of the company?' We are talking about 10 years ago. He would not have been able to remember his name 10 years ago. 
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Brandis)—Order! Senator George Campbell, Senator McGauran and Senator Buckland, Senator Knowles has the call.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is interesting that, under the Labor government, that was what happened to workers who tried to negotiate with their employers. But I go back to the figures of the survey of the Business Council of Australia: 88 per cent of companies offered job sharing, 74 per cent offered paid maternity leave, 53 per cent offered paid maternity leave with an average of a week, but 88 per cent offered work from home arrangements, 13 per cent offered work based child care and 69 per cent offered family support groups and services.
I think even that survey indicates that there is a willingness in businesses to resolve these issues to their own benefit. Quite frankly, if any of these people on the other side had actually run businesses, like most of us on this side have, they would understand that it is not in the business interest to have a high turnover of staff. It is in the business interest to train one's staff and to have them there in continuity and, if they need special requirements, to try to accommodate those special requirements so that you do not lose the corporate knowledge and the corporate training that the business has invested in that individual.
Senator Stott Despoja mentioned in her contribution that there are many examples of success stories, and she mentioned the company Esprit. I would like to quote from their evidence to the committee. They said:
Esprit offers up to 12 weeks paid maternity leave for a full-time colleague of more than two years service. These colleagues must intend to return to the same or a similar position on their return to work.
	...	...	...
Esprit also offers a flexible return to work policy for colleagues who wish to return to work within six months of maternity leave. Such a colleague would then have another 120 days owing of maternity leave to use. For example, a colleague might return to work for two days a week after five months, increasing this to three days a week after seven months and then to four days a week after 10 months from the start of leave. She would then be able to work four days a week for a further two years following the end of the initial 12-month maternity leave. This policy allows our colleagues the flexibility of working part time, thus finding a balance between family and work in their child's early years. It also allows the company to have their valuable colleagues back in the business sooner. Other aspects of our family friendly policy include flexible weekly working hours to fit in with family responsibilities, car lease payment assistance during maternity leave, utilising sick leave for family emergencies and the flexibility to be able to work from home when the need arises.
I do not think anyone in their right mind would suggest that they want to turn back the hands of time to what the Labor Party, in particular, wants—that is, trade union domination where one size has to fit all—when we have made huge gains in the private sector with the workplace relations legislation and when we now have so many more people in the work force, in particular so many more women in the work force. Senator Collins said that Labor have form on this issue. They sure have form. Let me just give you a couple of examples of the form they have. The unemployment rate was at a peak at 10.9 per cent under Labor. That was the form they had.
—It was over 11 per cent under John Howard in 1983. Did you forget about that?
—Isn't it amazing how Senator George Campbell just plucks figures out of the air. He does not care less about the facts, but let us just go on and ignore him. The unemployment rate was nearly 11 per cent under Labor—a million people out of work. That was their form. They had a million people out of work, whereas now there are 583,000. When it came to female unemployment, they had nearly eight per cent. It is now six per cent. When it came to things like average weekly earnings, they had an increase of 7.6 per cent—as opposed to the 16 per cent under this government. And you can just go on and on about the real value of wages. The real value of wages between 1992 and 1996 under Labor dropped by 2½ per cent. Under this government it has gone up by 6.5 per cent. It was in a negative under Labor and it has gone up under the coalition—and they still want to hark back and say that everything has to be done through the trade union movement. 
This is a particularly important area for a lot of people, and for Labor to just continually want to look back over their shoulders to the past creates a very big problem. There are, we have to say, some potential legislative anomalies in this particular bill. That is not to say that this whole issue does not need to be considered in the broader context of what is happening out there in the marketplace. Some of the anomalies were identified in the committee inquiry, and they related to the way in which existing paid maternity leave schemes would mesh with the model proposed in the bill and that, potentially, the bill would undo the substantial progress made under the government's reform of workplace relations processes and increase the outlay of public funds to provide a benefit which these particular employees already receive.
One has to be very careful with legislation such as this that we do not end up undermining what has already been achieved and allow employers to effectively just wipe their hands and say: `We don't have to do that anymore. The taxpayer is going to do that.' I do not think that is in the economic interest of this country. The economic interest of this country means that we try to get agreements by employers and employees. If we are simply going to hand the whole responsibility back to the ever-loving taxpayer, we will have to look at the consequences of that as well.
Interestingly enough, the ACTU also suggested at that inquiry that the complex Commonwealth-state funding issues that would arise from this bill could create anomalies as well. So it is not just something that one has to look at from that point of view, or that point of view, or that point of view. We have to take into account the whole spectrum of what would be affected under this particular type of legislation. Instead of rushing in and doing something like this, we have to take into account what is currently out there in the marketplace and what could be usefully achieved in benefits for those particular people. Above all, we must make sure that we do not remove the choice that families want to make for themselves, and we must not create a benefit for one group in society that is not extended to others.
That is where the difficulty could arise with this bill. So, with those words of caution and those words about where Australia has marched forward on this issue, I would suggest that far greater consideration needs to be given to this proposal than one day of debate in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PAID MATERNITY LEAVE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-11,"—I am pleased today to stand to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002, a private senator's bill introduced by Senator Stott Despoja with strong support, obviously, from her party room. I am also pleased to be able to put on the record what I have said privately to both Senator Stott Despoja and the party room over a long period—that is, my congratulations to the senator for the strong, vigorous, persistent, consistent and well-argued campaign that she has carried out in this field. I think it is very much in Australia's national interest that we have this debate. I think it is an important part of social architecture that we should seriously consider introducing. 
The coalition, particularly the Liberal Party, often like to describe themselves as conservatives, and within the philosophy of conservatism is a strong attachment to, and belief in, the family. There is nothing more conservative and there is nothing more valuable than children and their nurturing and early support. I would suggest to you that this is one of the most conservative of proposals—small `c'—and I am quite surprised by how vigorously some members of the government oppose it. Those members are often very much small `c', even very much capital `C' conservatives—usually males, and their opposition is a bit disappointing. But it seems to me that their rejection of this is inconsistent with their basic belief. If that rejection were based on cost, I could perhaps understand that because one of the things that conservatives believe they have is a good sense of the value of money. But the cost is not high. The greatest proponent on the government side—and I do not mean the political government side, I mean the administrative government side—Ms Goward, has costed this at a very affordable rate. It is far less indeed than the deal we saw culminate today with the passage of MedicarePlus. So I must say that I found it surprising in my own understanding of the very strong attachment that conservatives have to family and its nurturing.
In addition, we think the social benefits are matched by credible economic benefits, and they are verified by sound international study. It is widely recognised that Australia lags behind the international community with respect to support for women when they have a new child, particularly women in paid work. Australia is one of only two OECD countries without a national scheme for paid maternity leave. Quite often if you are out of step it might be that you are listening to a different drummer, but quite often in international affairs if you are out of step it is because you are out of step. I recall that, during the GST debate, the Treasurer had great delight in pointing out how few OECD countries did not have a consumption tax. We, with equally great delight, point out to the Treasurer how few OECD countries do not have a national scheme for paid maternity leave.
There is a reason for that: it contributes to and delivers very sound social and economic outcomes. Not only are we behind the rest of the OECD in implementing 14 weeks paid maternity leave; countries like the United Kingdom have six months government funded paid maternity leave. So it is not as if we are proposing a very advanced model here. This is a minimalist model, and a very affordable one.
Equally, I say to my Labor colleagues that, although I have not had the opportunity to listen to all that you have said, I understand there have been some concerns about some elements within the bill. Senator Stott Despoja by her own circulated amendments on sheet 4191 has recognised that the bill needs adjustment, and we will accept any amendments that you put to this bill that fall within achieving the broad objective that we are after. It is not good enough just to say, `Not everything in the bill is what we'd like.'
Eighty-eight per cent of Australian women work before having children—that is, work in terms of paid work. I think 105 per cent work otherwise! Yet Australia has one of the lowest employment rates in the OECD for women with two or more children—43 per cent compared to about 59 per cent elsewhere. With all eyes on how to increase labour force participation to offset the ageing population and looming skill shortage, shutting a large section of productive workers out of the labour market is not smart economics. Instead of trying to force people off disability support and making people work longer, the government should be doing its utmost to provide support to mothers so, if they choose to, they can return to the work force. Without pressure to change—and that comes from policy makers such as the people in this chamber—workplaces often do not. A recent University of Sydney study found that 57 per cent of Australian workplaces do not provide paid maternity leave. 
While the Democrats have supported enterprise bargaining, recent statistics show that the take-up of family friendly practices is low. While it is pleasing that 42 per cent of federal agreements contain at least one family friendly provision, the majority, 58 per cent, do not. The consequence of not having paid maternity leave is that many women are forced to take annual leave or long service leave, return to their job within a week of childbirth or resign from their job. Senators who know me know that I take an intense interest in matters that affect children and I have been reading the literature. There is a concept known as `affect', which is the relationship that builds between a child and its mother. It is very important to nurture and sustain that attachment at an early stage. It is very important to do it consistently, particularly in the early months of a child's development. If you want to contribute to sound human beings, Australians who get a good start in life, you need them to be attached to their mother in a comforting and sustaining manner early on. This sort of measure contributes to that.
It is low-paid mothers, many of whom are employed in casual or part-time jobs, who are the least likely to have access to paid maternity leave. There has been concern in some areas of business about the potential cost of paid maternity leave, especially to employers who employ many women, especially those in small business. The Australian Democrats think those concerns are absolutely legitimate. Some people are concerned that forcing employers to provide paid maternity leave would lead to greater discrimination against women because they would be less likely to employ women. We take the view that there are some employers who just cannot afford to pay maternity leave at the level that is required. This is a social need and this is a measure which benefits society, and that is exactly why we need government funded paid maternity leave, not employer funded paid maternity leave. Let employers who can afford it add to the 14 weeks we propose. Let employers who can afford it add extra conditions or advantages to the system. But we believe that the basic government system should take the burden away from employers to ensure that all women have access to a maternity payment.
The government's indecision on implementing government funded paid maternity leave is having unintended consequences. According to the ACTU, 15 per cent of employers have halted efforts to implement paid maternity leave while waiting for the government to make a decision on the issue. I should remind the government that this bill is supported by key industry groups such as the AIG, which I deal with a great deal in my portfolios and have a high opinion of, and the Australian Hoteliers Association and, of course, on the employees side, the unions. Government funded paid maternity leave is well overdue. The reason for it is clear: to overcome the disadvantage and inequity women face in the workplace as a result of child-bearing. But it is not a measure just for the benefit of women. It is a measure for the benefit of children. It is the children on which the future of Australia rests. The biological imperative for women to take a break prior to and after childbirth is in the mothers' interest, it is in the children's interest and it is in society's interest. 
This measure addresses the physical reality that distinguishes women's workplace experiences from men's on the birth of a child. In this sense, paid maternity leave is a basic and essential workplace measure to prevent indirect discrimination against women who, I am told, can forgo between $160,000 and $239,000 in earnings as a result of their first child alone, depending upon their qualification. Paid maternity leave, therefore, is an employment related measure that recognises, first and foremost, the benefits of at least 14 weeks paid leave for working mothers, their children and their families, along with its contribution to equal opportunity at work, productivity and women's employment security and attachment. We would urge the Labor Party and the coalition in their preparation for the election to support this measure if they are not going to support this bill today. The coalition is clearly committed to opposing the bill tonight. We would like to bring this to a vote and we would like the Labor Party to support it. It would be a great symbol for the women and children of Australia.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PAID MATERNITY LEAVE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-11,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002. The Australian Greens believe that it is a disgraceful situation that Australia is only one of two OECD countries that do not have paid leave for women on the birth or the adoption of their child. In most OECD countries, as Senator Murray has said before me, people have six months. In the UK they recently extended the government funded paid maternity leave system from 18 to 26 weeks. On the international level, Australia also has not ratified the ILO convention that deals with maternity protection. That means we are in a situation in Australia where fewer than four out of every 10 women have access to paid leave on the birth of a child and most men have no access to any type of special leave on the birth of a child. This is despite the overwhelming support that exists in the Australian community for a parental leave system. Indeed, there is also majority support in the country for a paternity leave system.
Most Australians who have access to paid leave earn above $40,000 a year. They tend to be highly skilled professional workers who are employed mostly in large organisations that have the industrial power at the bargaining table to get these sorts of things into enterprise agreements. That means that the people who need parental leave most—that is, those on low and middle incomes who need additional help with the cost of having a child or those who are working in small businesses—are the ones who are missing out on getting any form of leave at the moment. They will benefit little from the government's regressive baby bonus. We all acknowledge that the baby bonus is regressive in that the more you are earning the more you get back.
In the cabinet document that was leaked just last month, the government acknowledged that 14 months ago a submission to cabinet said that they should abolish the baby bonus, introduce a paid leave scheme and boost child care but we have seen no response. There has been a big blank coming from the government. The Senate has backed a Greens motion that was put up before to abolish the baby bonus in favour of paid parental leave. A whole range of organisations have come on board to support it, as the previous speaker mentioned. Even the Australian Industry Group has come out to support the introduction of paid maternity leave. It has now been 15 months since the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner reported on the need for paid parental leave, but still we have that big blank coming from the government on the other side of the chamber. 
In the Prime Minister's white picket fence vision of the world, all women stay at home to raise their children. This is reflected in the baby bonus, which pays women more money the longer they stay out of the work force. That is an acknowledgment from the government that they miss the point: one of the major benefits of a paid leave scheme is that it allows women to maintain their attachment to the work force. Women want to maintain their attachment to the work force for a range of different reasons. It may be for income reasons—for example, sole parents may need it financially. As the government supports sole parents being pushed into the work force, this is an option for helping sole parents maintain their attachment to the work force. But it is not just for income reasons that people want to maintain their attachment to the work force. It may be for social reasons, such as self-esteem, or for making a contribution to the community. It may be for later work opportunities when they come back to full-time work after having a child. They want to be able to maintain an attachment to the work force so they do not suffer a significant loss in income as a result of coming back to work after childbirth.
In terms of the bill that is before us today, the Greens support an 18-week paid parental leave scheme paid up to average weekly earnings. We acknowledge the work that has been done. I acknowledge the comments that Senator Stott Despoja has made about this bill being designed to make a contribution to the debate and asking people to put forward their positions on these issues. The Greens support an 18-week paid parental leave system which would pay up to average weekly earnings. The reason we support that is that it would allow 75 per cent of women to get a replacement wage whereas a minimum wage scheme would only allow for somewhere between 35 and 48 per cent of women to get a replacement wage. That is what we support and that is what we believe Australia can afford. I acknowledge the amendments that have been sent around in relation to state and Commonwealth employees. It is important that they become part of the whole picture and part of any paid leave scheme that goes forward. I know that the opposition support a leave scheme. I am probably exaggerating to say that we wait with bated breath, but we all wait to see the scheme that is announced by the opposition.
I am a little bit concerned about the comments in relation to the right to return to part-time work after somebody has been on leave as a result of the birth of their child. In the United Kingdom, the onus is on the employer to justify why the individual cannot return to part-time work. I note the comments that Senator Collins made and the comments that the ACTU have previously made that people should be able to return to part-time work but only if it is reasonable. My question would be: where is the onus? Is the onus on the employer or is it on the employee to justify being able to return to part-time work?
I will preface the Greens' vision for having paid parental leave by saying that we believe this is important to acknowledge the work that parents do and to acknowledge the caring work that is done by people in our community in an unpaid capacity. We recognise that paid parental leave is just one step—adequate support for carers in the community is also a part of that—but we need to acknowledge the unpaid work of parenting to bring up the future generations of young Australians. This was certainly in our minds when we launched our position in relation to paid parental leave in April last year. The Greens advocate the abolition of the regressive baby bonus and the redirection of those funds into a scheme for 18 weeks of replacement income up to average weekly earnings. We also support a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave with the right to return to work at the same or equivalent position or to return to work part time with the onus being on the employer to say why an individual cannot return to part-time work. 
We believe that payments should be to full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers who have been employed for 40 of the previous 52 weeks or for 52 of the last 204 weeks. That is based on a recommendation from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I acknowledge that there are some amendments that relate to that. A quick glance at the amendments shows that they are related to unpaid leave rather than the paid leave component but the Greens support the position put forward by HREOC in allowing seasonal workers who have worked for the last 52 of 104 weeks to have access to the paid leave entitlement. We also support partners sharing the leave in a way they believe is appropriate and for leave to be available for people who are adopting a child. Our proposal directs employers to pay superannuation for the period of paid leave and encourages them to top up wages for those earning above average weekly earnings.
We support—and I know there was some talk of this in the chamber before—a review after three years. The Greens are talking about it being an 18-week model. We would want a review in three years that would look to extending it to 26 weeks, as we have just seen recently done in the United Kingdom. Independent costing for the Greens' model shows that the scheme could be immediately funded by scrapping the regressive baby bonus, which we talked about before, and making family tax payments more equitable. The money is there, as others have said; what we need is a commitment. We have heard the announcements several times—the barbecue stopper, the balance between family and work. What we need now is to be shown the commitment behind those announcements. Show us the scheme. Show us the real commitment this government has and often talks about in terms of balancing work and family. It is vital that we have such a scheme and it is vital that it meets international standards and guidelines.
The Greens believe it is vital that it be treated as a work entitlement and not as a welfare measure and that it go along with a range of other measures, such as maternity allowance and adequate provisions for casual and part-time workers, so many of whom are women. For women to leave their positions for a period for the birth of their child and then come back, we need strong conditions for casual and part-time workers. The Greens are strong supporters of paid parental leave. Our model is slightly different to the one being advocated here, but we welcome the opportunity to be involved in this debate in the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (PAID MATERNITY LEAVE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2004-03-11,"—I rise to speak this afternoon on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill 2002, which is a private member's bill presented to the Senate by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja. At the outset I would like to congratulate Senator Stott Despoja on her commitment to this very important issue over a long period of time and congratulate her on bringing it before the Senate and to the attention of the government and the wider electorate. Work responsibilities are increasingly threatening most families' abilities to provide the kind of family life they want. However, very few of us today have the luxury of being able to choose not to work, and this is the case for many, many Australian women in the community. The question of how to bridge the work-family life divide is one of the great political debates of our time. 
We have heard today that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, suggested that this issue was his third term barbecue stopper, but it has been more than just a barbecue stopper for ordinary Australian families. For most families in the Australian community, this work-family life issue has been a topic for discussion over almost every meal, not just the occasional barbecue. People in this place and elsewhere in the community have waited a very long time for the government to actually go some way towards providing Australians with a real solution to this problem.
The Prime Minister first raised expectations of significant reform in this policy area as early as 2002, when he described balancing work and family as the most important social issue facing Australia. Since then we have seen very little. Although we have had a cabinet-level policy review and the release of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's plan for a government-backed universal scheme providing 14 weeks paid maternity leave up to the level of the minimum wage, we have had from the government—from the Prime Minister and his ministers—no concrete new policies whatsoever over the past couple of years. All we have seen from the Prime Minister and his senior ministers—including the Treasurer, Mr Costello; Mr Anderson; Senator Minchin and Mr Abbott—is public attacks on paid maternity leave proposals. In these public statements the government have said that paid maternity leave will not provide a cure-all solution to work and family problems, including support for stay-at-home mothers. There would not be many people in this place who would disagree with that. Of course we agree that paid maternity leave is not going to provide a cure-all. Supporters of paid maternity leave have never suggested that. They have always been open to the fact that paid maternity leave is only one of the aspects of balancing work and family life that needs to be given attention to.
Of course, there are a range of other measures in addition to paid maternity leave that would provide choice for working parents at different stages of their lives. Some of these other benefits would include more flexible working hours, secure part-time employment rather than the increasing casualisation of the employment market that we see at present, extended or even unpaid parental leave in some circumstances as well as emergency family leave and, crucially, more affordable child care. It is certainly the case that paid maternity leave is not going to be the cure-all, but it is certainly a good place to begin, and it has been the focus of public debate for at least the last 12 months or so.
The balance that needs to be found between work and family cannot just be addressed on one side. Women in particular should not have to choose between adequate income and adequate time with their families. Recently released ABS statistics show that one-third of working new mothers returned to work less than 26 weeks after having a baby. This includes 12 per cent of employed new mothers who returned to work after less than 13 weeks. This is only about three months after the birth of their baby. Of course, as we have heard, the reason for these women returning to work is not necessarily because they want to get back into the work force but because they have to in order to survive—to earn an income for their family and to sustain the standard of living they were accustomed to before they had their child.
For women in households where there are couples, 54 per cent of mothers with children under two are in the labour force. More than 50 per cent of mothers have returned to the labour force, yet they have children under the age of two. Over the 25-year period between the years 1976 and 2001, the proportion of mothers of children under 12 months old who were in the labour force more than doubled from 17 per cent to 36 per cent. This represents the changing nature of the work force and the changing demographics. These are things we need to become aware of and so develop appropriate policies to meet the changing nature of the work force. It is the case that at any one time around one-third of mothers are outside the labour force, but they are not necessarily the same women who have permanently exited paid employment. In fact, the latest ABS data suggests that only 17 per cent of mothers of children under six have not returned to work. 
So, because of the statistics that I have cited, I think that those people out there who seem to have difficulties with paid maternity leave need to acknowledge that it is just one of the many policies that provide important grounds on which to build a range of more family friendly policies. We on this side of the chamber would like to see Mr Howard, now that he has confirmed his long-term leadership ambitions, take the opportunity, sooner rather than later, to act to end what has effectively become this government's work and family policy paralysis.
I now turn to what Labor has announced publicly. As was made clear by other speakers, including Senator Collins, in the chamber earlier this afternoon, Labor's policy is not publicly available as yet but we have laid out a number of the principles on which our policy will be based. To reiterate them, it is the case that Labor are committed to 14 weeks paid maternity leave. We want Australian families to have more financial options available to them in balancing work and family. We are of the view that it is not unreasonable for workers to come back from parental leave and then seek a part-time job. It is not unacceptable to give casual workers greater security, and of course with this job security workers and parents are better able to look after their families. It is not unreasonable in our society to have workplace flexibility: job sharing and allowing employees to plan their hours and their holidays around the needs of their children. We do not want people to have to choose between being a good parent and being a good employee. In a society such as ours, you should be able to do both with the support of the government and the community.
As many speakers have acknowledged in the chamber today, Australia is one of the few countries in the world where paid maternity leave is left to separate enterprise bargaining or workplace agreements. Perhaps inevitably, this has led us to a situation where the highest incidence of paid maternity leave is recorded amongst managers, administrators and professionals. In fact, I have here some Australian Bureau of Statistics survey results, dated November 2001, and I will mention this afternoon some of the statistics as to where the highest incidence of paid maternity leave is recorded. For managers and administrators, 65 per cent is the figure that the ABS found in relation to paid maternity leave in those occupations. For professionals it is 54 per cent. So you can see from these figures that women in the higher echelons of the work force are the ones who are benefiting from paid maternity leave insofar as it does exist.
The lowest incidence of paid maternity leave was, not surprisingly, recorded in the following occupations. Among elementary clerical, sales and service workers, only 18 per cent of women have access to paid maternity leave benefits. In the case of labourers and related workers, just 21 per cent have access to paid maternity leave. The ABS survey also found that access to paid maternity leave was higher the greater an employee's length of service with an employer. This means of course that it is going to benefit those people who have been with a particular employer for a longer period of time, whereas those women who have perhaps been with a particular employer for only a short time are not going to benefit from these schemes. 
The ABS survey also found that a higher proportion of part-time employees were without leave entitlements, 64 per cent, as opposed to full-time employees, of whom only 12 per cent were affected—that is, they were without leave entitlements. So it is pretty clear from these figures that many low-income women would have no current eligibility for any form of maternity leave. Also, there is little likelihood of these women gaining it through enterprise bargaining. It is these types of women, people in the low-income brackets and in the occupations that I have mentioned, who are going to benefit substantially from any successful proposal for paid maternity leave.
As we have heard today, the Prime Minister has continually promised that paid maternity leave is still on the table, but it seems to me and to many of us on this side of the chamber that he really is just trying to sweep the issue under the table. The lack of support from the Prime Minister is not new. I believe Senator Collins cited an example of a comment the Prime Minister made publicly as long ago as 1986 when he was Leader of the Opposition. At the time he described some proposed changes for federal public servants relating to maternity leave as `plainly ridiculous'. He also made it clear at that time that a coalition government would consider scrapping maternity leave for public servants. More than a decade later—15 years or more—the Prime Minister still has not got the issue right. He still has not realised that time has moved on, society has changed and there is this need for paid maternity leave in our work force.
Also, as has been mentioned, since the coalition came into office they have introduced the baby bonus. A number of people have talked about the regressive nature of the baby bonus. It is pretty clear to people that this baby bonus scheme is skewed towards wealthier women in our society. These women receive more of a bonus than lower paid women and it is dependent on one parent giving up their work. On average, the baby bonus delivers just $10 a week to a family on an average income and, again, it is on the condition that one parent remains outside the work force for five years. The baby bonus, resulting essentially in the loss of one wage with a pittance for compensation, is a very poor cousin to a system of paid maternity leave.
Unfortunately, Labor has indicated that it thinks the Democrats' paid maternity leave bill is—like the government's baby bonus scheme—an inadequate attempt at solving the work-family life balance, as good as its intentions are. As Labor senators mentioned in their dissenting report—I was not a member of the committee but this is clear to me from the dissenting report to the inquiry—the concerns of Labor senators were whether or not a workplace relations bill was the appropriate vehicle for the introduction of a paid maternity leave scheme. There was also concern about eligibility for paid maternity leave being restricted to only working mothers, the lack of sufficient support and consistent access to paid maternity leave for women employed in state governments and, finally, the funding of the proposed maternity leave scheme.
Despite much talk by the government on work and family, as we are all very aware and as we have seen today, the government has made no clear commitment whatsoever to the introduction of any form of paid maternity leave. On the other hand, the Australian Labor Party has committed to the introduction of a paid maternity leave scheme and also to a comprehensive work and family package for Australian families. Labor has committed to introducing paid maternity leave as part of a package of work and family measures so that women in particular do not have to choose between their job and raising a family. The government's objections to paid maternity leave reflect its failure to understand the pressures facing Australian families who want children, who want a family, but who cannot afford not to work. 
Paid maternity leave is, as I have said throughout the course of my remarks today, just one of a number of work and family measures. By itself it is unlikely to offer a solution to the multiple pressures that people will face in deciding to make the commitment to having and raising children. It is, however, a step towards bridging the gap between women's desires and women's realities. It is also a step, I believe, towards shaping the kind of society that we want to live in here in Australia—not one where high private costs deter even those who want children from having them but one where government policy enables families to combine work and family life and to avoid the either/or choice of being a good worker or a good parent. I would like to end with a simple quote from the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, that really sums up the basis of this debate. She said:
It's time motherhood received the respect and support in Australian society it deserves.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-03-11,"—I sometimes wonder when I listen to those opposite whether I belong to the government that I belong to. They attribute motives to us that are not our motives. They attribute a type of performance to us that is not our performance. They attribute to us statements that we have never made. They basically seek to denigrate the public record and, in the instance of this debate, the achievements of the Howard government. They do so without any shame and they do so without any hesitation. I ask myself, `Is this really the government I belong to that is being described by members opposite, and just very recently by Senator Kirk?' I have sat here in the chamber and listened to most of the speakers because I wanted to be able to respond very specifically to some of the statements that have been made, including those made by the mover of the motion. I am disappointed by some of the misrepresentations that have been put forward by some of the other speakers opposite.
The first major point I want to make for the benefit of those people listening is that the Howard government is not against paid maternity leave. That statement has been made by everybody who has been mentioned as being against maternity leave. It is a statement that I know Senator Minchin supports. I know it is a statement the Prime Minister supports. It is a statement that I think anybody would support because it really is about motherhood, and paid maternity leave should be considered within a policy mix. We all support motherhood. Paid maternity leave is something that should be considered within a policy mix. It should be considered and debated and I think it is tremendous that we are having this debate this afternoon because it gives those of us who feel pretty strongly about it the opportunity to say a few words about this important issue. 
At the beginning of my contribution to this debate I would like to draw on some very strong statements by the Prime Minister because, in the end, leadership is important and the Prime Minister is one of those leaders who says it as it is. He said recently that he had indicated at the Liberal Women's Conference at the Liberal Party's National Convention that the government is not opposed to paid maternity leave and that any statement to that effect is absolutely wrong. He went on:
I added that it is also important to keep the issue in perspective and that we should not fall into the trap of attributing outcomes to paid maternity leave that simply aren't going to accrue. 
During the rest of my contribution tonight I want to come back to outcomes and cause and effect situations that have been quoted in this debate. This is obviously a very emotional debate. Obviously, if paid maternity leave were available to all women, all women would partake of it, and so there is support for the idea amongst many in our community, particularly women. But I also acknowledge that there is support for the idea amongst many men. There are those on the other side of the argument—mainly employers, but not exclusively employers—who say: `Look, who's going to pay for it? If it is the government, how is the government going to raise the resources necessary to fund paid maternity leave? If it is going to be funded directly by industry we need to consider whether we are in a position to afford to pay for maternity leave, whether it is 14 weeks, 18 weeks or 12 months.'
That is the process of reasoning that is undertaken by employers, because one of the key aspects of an employer's psyche, as speakers before me have mentioned here this evening, is their desire to maintain job security for their employees. They have a desire to maintain continuity in the work force and to keep employed the people they have trained and welcomed into their employer families. They fear additional cost imposts. Paid maternity leave, if it were to be funded directly and compulsorily by employers, would represent just one of many imposts which members opposite constantly ask the government to impose on business.
—I agree.
—I take the interjection from Senator Stott Despoja. She agrees with that line of argument. I appreciate her sensible—and, from an employer perspective, sensitive—interjection. Employers are strongly against any suggestion that it should be paid directly by them—not because they do not want to do it, not because they are anti mothers and anti children and not because they are the mean spirited so-and-sos that members opposite often try to convince us they are but purely because they have to look at the realities that exist out there in the workplace and in their places of employment specifically.
I cannot understand why some statements are made in relation to the motivations of employers and the motivations of people, such as those on this side of the chamber, who stand up for the arguments of employers. I have to be honest: I have heard members opposite say that employers seem to favour the introduction of paid maternity leave and that in some way it should be funded by them. I have not experienced a groundswell of feedback to that effect. I move around a lot in employer circles and the community—as many senators in this place do—but I have not sensed that groundswell within employer ranks, mainly for the reasons which I have just stated. So I cannot understand why that argument is put forward.
Getting back to the first point that I made at the beginning of this contribution, I cannot understand how members opposite could be so mean spirited and suggest that this government has done nothing in relation to helping mothers—or indeed fathers—within the work force. I have listened to the arguments in favour of paid maternity leave, and one argument is that job security would be improved. Speakers opposite do not acknowledge that the Workplace Relations Act provides for one year of job security for permanent employees who decide, through the exercise of free will, to become mothers. There is a statutory guarantee of up to 12 months unpaid maternity leave for employees with more than 12 months standing with their current employer.  
When looking at what employers do in terms of ensuring that employees are able to benefit from positive working family policies, it is instructive to look at the survey by the Business Council of Australia that was quoted by Senator Knowles. I believe, after listening to some of the contributions since Senator Knowles made hers, that it is worth reiterating the results of that survey. The survey in 2003 highlighted the fact that tackling issues of work and family requires a whole range of strategies which employers are implementing. Of the companies included in the survey, 93 per cent offered flexible working hours, including flexible start and finish times; 88 per cent offered job sharing; 74 per cent offered paid maternity leave, with an average of 7.8 weeks; 53 per cent offered paid paternity leave, with an average of one week; 88 per cent offered work from home arrangements; 13 per cent offered work based child care; and 69 per cent offered family support groups and services.
I restate those figures to reinforce one fundamental fact—that is, those sensitivities displayed by employers within the workplace are being achieved by Australian workers, particularly working women, as a result of the application of this government's workplace relations legislation. That is a fact that just cannot be denied. Those particular achievements are occurring under our legislation. We have also heard a bit about fertility rates. People talk about our ageing population and the desirability of looking at ways to encourage an increase in the fertility rate. Some people say that paid maternity leave would somehow lead to an increase in fertility rates.
—Maybe.
—Again, I take the sensitive interjection by Senator Stott Despoja because she is right. In the United States there are no paid maternity leave arrangements, unlike in many countries in Europe where there are paid maternity leave arrangements. Yet in the United States—and we are trying to compare apples with apples here; there may be some socioeconomic differences between the United States and some of the European countries that we were talking about, but in the main I think we are talking about a homogenous type of population within the countries that I am mentioning—the fertility rates are much higher than in those countries that have paid maternity leave. That is anecdotal evidence perhaps, but I think it is fairly persuasive evidence. I simply put that point to people who claim that paid maternity leave is desirable because we want to increase the fertility rate in this country.
The other point that is made by advocates of paid maternity leave is that the government should help women in work by funding mothers in work. I think that is a desirable goal, except that it discriminates against mothers who are not at work when this government does so much to assist mothers who are at work. The point I am trying to make here is that the government I belong to seeks to assist all mothers, irrespective of their work circumstances. 
The other issue that I wish to address has been raised by a couple of speakers in this debate, and that is the claim that Australia's international obligations are being compromised as a result of this government not encouraging paid maternity leave provisions. As I just tried to explain to the Senate, the making of paid maternity leave arrangements is encouraged at a workplace level by the legislation which governs workplace relations in this country. Senator Stott Despoja, in her submission to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill, made that point—as did, briefly, Senator Nettle earlier in this debate. Senator Nettle suggested that Australia was failing to fulfil its international obligations to protect women in the work force who decided to have children. I must admit that I am persuaded by the conclusion of the committee's majority report, which noted:
 ... the advice of the Office of the Status of Women, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, and the Department of Family and Community Services that `Australia has no specific obligation in international law to provide paid maternity leave.'
The report continued:
The committee notes that the ILO conventions which support paid maternity leave were devised and driven by European nations with a long history of the provision of social insurance. These policies have limited application to Australia. The Government agrees with the basic objective of the ILO conventions—to support workers with family responsibilities.
I reiterate that this government is already doing that. It is already supporting workers with family responsibilities in a very substantial way. The committee went on to say:
In achieving this objective, the legislative framework must reflect the continuing and evolving policy which we have seen in the Workplace Relations Act.
That conclusion by the committee underlines the point I have already made. So they are some of the arguments that have been put forward by speakers opposite, and I have sought to address them one by one.
Another point I want to make before my time runs out is that women in work have indeed prospered under the Howard government. In the limited time that I had to get ready for this debate I sought to come up with some figures to illustrate the point that working women are indeed much better off as a result of this government's policies. For example, more women are in the paid work force than ever before, and this has occurred during the life of the Howard government. In January 2003 the labour force participation rate of all women 15 years and over was 57.1 per cent, an increase of 3.4 percentage points since March 1996. That, I would respectfully suggest, is a big improvement. Since March 1996 the unemployment rate for women has dropped by 1.7 percentage points to 5.9 per cent in January 2003. If you look at these figures you have to say that women within the work force are certainly prospering under the policies of the Howard government. I think it shames a debate such as this when members opposite refuse to acknowledge and give credit to a government that has indeed cared a lot about working women and has done everything it can to assist them to balance work and family responsibilities.
I could also talk about this government's other initiatives to assist working families and working women, such as the family tax benefit, which the government introduced on 1 July 2000. This was a major simplification of family assistance as part of the tax reform package. I know many women and many working families who have reflected very favourably on that government initiative—not to mention the introduction of the parenting payment. I do not want to be repetitive, but clearly the government has introduced many good initiatives for working families.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-03-11,"—In relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission annual report for 2003-03 it is interesting to note that we are in an environment where significant change to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has taken place. I asked questions today of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, about significant legal advice which she is in receipt of which, contrary to what the minister told us in question time today, calls into question an allocation through the budget of over $1 billion. The government's own advice raised questions about the validity of that appropriation. I also propose to speak on the report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, which is on the Notice Paper to be dealt with later today.
On the question of funding of ATSIC, the Australian Government Solicitor warned Senator Vanstone's predecessor, Mr Ruddock, that the ATSIC Act may prevent the creation of a prescribed agency to expend ATSIC funds. A prescribed agency is just the creation that was made—ATSIS is a prescribed agency under the regulations. The Australian Government Solicitor said that, if moneys were appropriated to the prescribed agency, a challenge to the creation of that body would put the appropriation at risk. The government, against the advice of their own legal adviser, proceeded to create a prescribed agency to expend ATSIC funds. The minister suggested that, properly advised, they had considered all the risks and were satisfied they could go ahead. Well, they considered them in the context of the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor which I just repeated: a challenge to the creation of that body would put the appropriation itself at risk.
That prescribed agency, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services, has been  appropriated more than $1.1 billion in taxpayers' funds and that appropriation is, as foretold by the AGS 11 months ago, at risk. Yesterday the ATSIC board determined to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the creation of ATSIS by launching a constitutional challenge. It is doing so on the basis of advice from Mr David Jackson QC. I understand Mr Jackson to be a lawyer of significant standing, one whose advice ought not be dismissed as blithely as Senator Vanstone elected to do in question time today.
I asked Senator Vanstone two questions today. I asked her about the government's legal standing in relation to ATSIS. She blustered for a bit but refused the opportunity afforded to her to affirm the legal standing of ATSIS. I then asked her a simple question—one I want to repeat in the course of my remarks on the other report—that concerned social justice and Indigenous Australians. I asked:
Can the minister assure the Senate that no direct or indirect punitive action will be taken by the government or its agencies against the ATSIC board, individual commissioners or ATSIS funded organisations for the decisions made at yesterday's ATSIC board meeting, including the decision to withdraw the delegation of the CEO? Will she assure the Senate that no direct or indirect inducements will be offered by the government or its agencies to influence actions of ATSIC commissioners in this matter? Minister, if threats of punitive action were made or inducements offered in respect of decisions of a commission established under the laws of this parliament, would they not constitute serious impropriety? 
It is a simple question. It is a question to which the Senate, Indigenous Australians and the broader community deserve an answer. Today in the Senate in question time the minister refused to answer. She did so for reasons unknown but, in the absence of a statement to the contrary, the Senate is entitled to draw the conclusion that she did so because she fails to understand that threats and inducements in relation to decisions of the ATSIC board are acts of serious impropriety. At least we are entitled to draw the conclusion that the minister does not consider them so.
We should understand that the board's processes deserve protection. I will have more to say on this matter later, but for now I say this: attempts to improperly influence the decision making of elected representatives, whether members of this parliament or members of a commission established under its laws, deserve the strongest possible condemnation. A claim of improper dealing in relation to any decision taken by the ATSIC board deserves immediate investigation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2004-03-11,"—This year the National Farmers Federation celebrates its 25th anniversary, a quarter of a century as the single national voice of Australian agriculture. The creation of the NFF in July 1979 was the culmination of a very long quest by Australian farmers for unity. In fact, before the NFF was formed, a federal government of the day could choose any one of 26 farmer representative bodies. Tonight I would like to reflect on the 25 years of the NFF, the importance of farmers speaking with one voice at a national level, and the significant achievements that the NFF has made during its life. 
Former president Donald McGauchie in his foreword to Tom Connors's book To Speak with One Voice wrote:
The history of farm organisations is the history of Australia.
I agree. The history of farm organisations is inextricably intertwined with our political, economic and social history. Politically active farm organisations in Australia originated about the time of the great shearers strikes and the growing militancy of bush unions during the late 1800s. The Pastoralists Federal Council, the first federal farmers organisation, was created in 1890. Farm organisations evolved during the formation of the nation at the time of Federation when centralised wage fixation and the protection of Australian industry behind large tariff barriers defined the national economic environment. Farmer organisations participated in the creation of the Country Party but subsequently moved away from direct affiliation. For most of the 20th century the defining feature for the politically active agricultural communities was sadly not unity but division. Up until the creation of the National Farmers Federation no single unified voice for Australia's primary industry existed. In fact, the divisions that existed between the `farmers' and the `graziers' extended well back into the 1800s. This divide was very deeply rooted and some may say those tensions still exist to some extent today.
That division was based on social and educational differences and encapsulated quite differing approaches to economic issues such as pricing and protection. Tom Connors notes in his book on the National Farmers Federation that the extent of the divide left many observers of rural Australia in the 1960s and 1970s to conclude that a united voice for agricultural Australia was in fact an impossibility. This inability to speak with one voice was identified from an early stage as a great disadvantage for the farming community, especially in contrast to the well-organised and largely unified trade union movement. In fact, Tom Connors recalls Labor Prime Minister William Morris Hughes in February 1918 telling a group of wheat growers of the need for a unified voice. He said:
I can bring into one room three men who represent all the labour of Australia ... I have preached to labour the necessity for organisation ... and the wheat industry like every other, must save itself by organisation.
How true. But, despite this division, the desire for a unified voice remained, and in 1979 the National Farmers Federation was born. Tonight I would like to pay tribute to the work of those who turned this need for unity into a reality and to some of the significant milestones achieved by its leaders over the last 25 years. During the 1980s and 1990s the National Farmers Federation was a key participant in the national push to deregulate the Australian economy. Successive NFF presidents, such as former defence minister the Hon. Ian McLachlan, were a driving force in the push for economic reform. Connors quotes the Business Review Weekly that wrote in 1984 that Ian McLachlan has `lifted the power of the rural lobby ... to a stage where the federation is a powerful intellectual force in the national debate'.
I joined the National Farmers Federation in 1984, three weeks after Ian McLachlan was elected president. I remember the day well, and I am very grateful for the opportunities that working with that very talented team offered me. My personal recollections include the 25 legal actions which were required to break the draconian tally system in the meat industry and to enable workers at the Mudginberri Station meatworks the opportunity to negotiate directly with their employer and not with a union official hundreds of kilometres away in Brisbane. I shall never forget the look on the face of Jack O'Toole from the meatworkers union as he confronted the clear possibility of a final court judgment that broke not only the tally system but the financial base of this very inflexible union itself. It was a milestone indeed for the meat industry and of course for Australia as well. 
It was perhaps the Mudginberri meat dispute and the live sheep dispute a year or two earlier that led former President of the ACTU and then Prime Minister Bob Hawke to comment of president Ian McLachlan that he was the toughest man he had ever negotiated with and that farmers were very fortunate to have him negotiate on their behalf. And who in the farming community will ever forget that crisp winter's day in 1985 when more than 40,000 farming families came to Canberra to protest at the Hawke government's tax summit where the wheels fell so spectacularly off Paul Keating's GST tax cart? There is no doubt that the last 25 years have shown just what can be achieved by farmers when they speak with one voice.
One of the most consistent policies advocated by farmers over the years has been that of fairer and freer trade—fairer and freer next week than last week. The formation of the Cairns Group of free trade advocates during my term at the NFF was an important achievement and one which has grown in both stature and membership since 1985. How puzzling, then, that the National Farmers Federation leadership should have expressed disappointment in their first press release when the free trade deal was announced between Australia and the United States. What on earth would the dairy industry, the livestock industry, the horticultural industry, the fishing industry and the wine industry say to such a statement, particularly when a senior National Farmers Federation executive was in the negotiating team? Let's get it straight: 97 per cent of all manufactured exports will enter America from Australia duty free on day one and 66 per cent of all agricultural products will be at the zero tariff rate from day one—a deal worth billions to our agricultural primary producers and exporters. Disappointment indeed! As a member of the Senate's committee selected to investigate this historic and great agreement, I am looking forward to discussing the NFF's claimed disappointment when the federation appears before the committee.
Perhaps one of the great milestones of more recent years, certainly since I have represented South Australia in this place, has been the reform of our waterfront. I would particularly like to recognise the leadership of my old friend Paul Houlihan and the former president Donald McGauchie in leading the evolution, if not the revolution, on our coastline which has given Australia among the most efficient waterfront terminals in the world.
The National Farmers Federation has also been an important nurturing place for both professional and support staff. Two colleagues of mine, the Hon. Ian McLachlan and former senator Winston Crane, served the Australian parliament in distinguished capacities, and a number of administrative staff are now in senior positions in this parliament. The former Federal Director of the Liberal Party and strategist for the victorious 1996 campaign, Andrew Robb, is a former senior executive; and David Trebeck, a senior economic consultant in Canberra, is also a former executive. They are colleagues and they are friends. 
For 25 years the NFF has represented Australia's farmers at the peak level across Australia, and perhaps it is true and appropriate that they represent a group of individuals who have been fundamental to our history, our culture and our prosperity: Australia's farming families, who endure the joys and heartbreaks of life on the land for the benefit of all Australians.
