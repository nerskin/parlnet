"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Enterprising Australia—planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment: a short report on the proceedings of the inquiry, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—This is a short report on the proceedings of the inquiry. The Minister for Trade referred the inquiry to the joint committee on 2 November 2000. With the calling of the 2001 federal election, the inquiry automatically lapsed on the dissolution of the 39th Parliament on 8 October 2001.
The committee gave consideration to the re-referral of the terms of reference of the report, Enterprising Australia, in this the 40th Parliament. We decided not to continue with the inquiry. Our decision was based on a number of factors: 
·	the poor response to the call for submissions; 
·	the quality of the evidence; 
·	a review of the Commonwealth's investment promotion and attraction efforts by a task force headed by Dr Ian Blackburne that embraced significant aspects of the Enterprising Australia terms of reference; and
·	broad acceptance by the government of the recommendations made by Dr Blackburne in his August 2001 report Winning investment—strategy, people and partnerships.
Notwithstanding the lapse of the inquiry, we took the view that a short report should be tabled in the parliament outlining some of the issues and conclusions that came out of the evidence. These reflect a similarity of view between our observations and the findings of Dr Blackburne's review team. I do wish to place on record our appreciation of the assistance the former Irish Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Richard O'Brien, and the Singapore High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Ashok Kumar Mirpuri, gave to the inquiry.
We see a number of challenges for Australia in planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment. No specific development agency model, whether it is an Ireland or a Singapore model, fits the Australian context. What is paramount is a national strategic approach to trade and investment. Additional challenges are developing regional initiatives that can build a diverse base for regional economic wealth, developing the skills in Australia that will underpin research and development initiatives, and ensuring Australia's global competitiveness and the comparative effectiveness of the incentives we offer.
A national strategic approach to planning, preparing and profiting from trade and investment promotes and increases Australia's international competitiveness. Evidence to the inquiry showed there were a number of federal government agencies that played a role in promoting investment and exports and—as Dr Blackburne noted in his investment review—this is not efficient and does not allow for a single Australian brand.
In the climate of global competitiveness where national leadership is paramount, the multiple-player approach promotes the insular culture of the bureaucracy and the notion of `turf', with government processes cumbersome and unresponsive. It was evident to us that the degree of commitment to a national strategic approach is a key to advancing Australia's trade and investment competitiveness. The government has agreed to the development of a national strategic framework for investment promotion and attraction, with the employment and infrastructure committee of cabinet to oversee operations. We are hopeful that this will indeed provide the capacity and capability to implement a whole-of-nation approach.
With the intention that this framework is to be developed in the context of Australia's overall economic growth and industry and regional development objectives, we regard the major national issues raised during Dr Blackburne's consultations as very important and they need to be addressed. These major national issues are set out in appendix E of our report. We are concerned that these issues, which were to be included in the work program of the Blackburne review's proposed prime ministerial investment council, will not be addressed under the new arrangements of the revamped Invest Australia. These major national issues should not be dismissed as not applicable and lost to examination within the changed operational arrangements of Invest Australia.
In our report we comment on the issues of tax, seen as an impediment to business; the adequacy of Australia's skills base, with investment in education critical to the future of Australia; and the commercialisation of R&D in Australia. On this last issue we are of the view that, in pursuing commercial outcomes, the capability to reach commercialisation should not become the sole criterion for funding an R&D project.
In conclusion, irrespective of Australia's achievements in encouraging inward investment and promoting export sales, the challenge for Australia and its policy makers at all levels of government is to move forward and put us ahead of our competitors. We need to focus on becoming even more competitive than our competitors and not to be both outmarketed and insufficiently aggressive in the pursuit of opportunities.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—I am very pleased to support my colleague the member for Cook who chairs the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade of the parliament. Australia is a country blessed with natural resources. In the past, the bulk of our trade has been selling minerals, wool, wheat and an abundance of other produce for domestic and export markets. In the contemporary trade and investment environment, 80 per cent of our gross domestic product comes from trade in services, and exports of services today account for 20 per cent of the world trade. Australia benefits from a $17.1 billion a year tourism trade, $4 billion a year in education and $200 million in legal services. Environmental services also bring us $300 million, and this figure is growing very dramatically.
Currently the services sector outstrips agriculture, mining and manufacturing, and this trend has been developing since the eighties. The services sector in Australia now accounts for four out of every five jobs and it represents 20 per cent of our exports, or $31.2 billion in export revenue, in 2001. In 1999 the government released the study `Driving forces on the new Silk Road: the use of electronic commerce by Australian businesses'. Electronic trade in itself presents just one of the many challenges for modern exporting nations, and a clearly focused policy is vital to our future economic success. It is the linkages in policy development that are essential, and it is these linkages that this report sought. These linkages are essential to making the most of Australia's natural minerals and produce and to promoting Australian goods, services and products. My home state of Western Australia made a submission to this inquiry, which included the following observation:
... notwithstanding the global nature of the resources sector, there is much that governments can do to enhance Australia's competitive position in the area of trade and investment. The need for co-ordinated and co-operative State and Commonwealth government action to promote investment is a particular overriding requirement.
As this report outlines, we have had a long history of formulating industry plans and action agendas to map out the strategic direction and action plans for specific industries. There have been green papers and white papers. A number of different agencies at Commonwealth level—and, indeed, state level—assist with overseas trade and promote investment. However, in an increasingly competitive environment, a strong focus needs to be achieved if Australia is to maintain a strong export orientation.
In examining some of the overseas models for this inquiry, the committee heard from the former Irish Ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Richard O'Brien. In an outstanding presentation to the committee, he explained that the success of the Celtic tiger, now acknowledged world wide, required a consensus approach to government policy. A social partnership was forged between government, trade unions, employers, farmers, universities and other important agencies.
Significant elements of this inquiry have been echoed, as my colleague the member for Cook outlined in his presentation, in the task force established by the Prime Minister to review Australia's investment promotion activity. A copy of this report was released in August 2001. The Australian Financial Review outlined the main recommendations and went on to warn that `Australia would run the risk of falling further behind international competitors unless it reformed its investment program'. The conclusions of the task force were interesting, and Dr Blackburne, who headed up that task force, made some important comments. In summing up Australia's situation, he said that the decline in Australia's comparative effectiveness in winning international investment appears to be at least in part linked to the fact that we have been both outmarketed and insufficiently aggressive in the pursuit of opportunities.
This inquiry was indeed cut short, and that is a pity. But I would like to congratulate the former chair of the Trade Subcommittee, the Hon. Geoff Prosser, and all those involved in contributing to and finalising the report. I commend this report to the House.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—This morning I have had brought to my attention an independent report on education produced by Professor Tony Vinson. This report raises a range of conclusions about education funding in this country. For example, Australia's investment in education now ranks in the bottom quarter of OECD countries. Federal funding to private schools, however, has increased by 128 per cent. Australia appears to be the only OECD country in which school participation rates fell in the 1990s, yet we lavishly fund those private school systems with high participation and retention rates. Public schools educate the vast majority of children with special education needs, children from Indigenous communities and those who are socially disadvantaged. The great bulk of federal schools money now goes to private schools. Some private schools operate at levels of recurrent expenditure that are more than double that of many government schools, yet still taxpayers' money goes into them. The federal government spends 0.75 per cent of GDP on schools, but expenditure on public schools within this has declined to 0.26 per cent as the private school share has risen to 0.49 per cent. According to Professor Vinson's independent review, these policies are `creating a system in which inequalities are being exacerbated rather than ameliorated'. 
We on this side of the House accept the fact that we have a responsibility to fund private schools. However, in the circumstances this report produces some very worrying—(Time expired) ",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Education: Funding</title>,Statements by Members,1,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Given our time with the families of the victims of the terrorist attack in Bali last week, Prime Minister, can you inform the Australian people when you expect all Australian remains to be brought home? In particular, can you update the House as to how many of the remains of the Australian victims have so far been repatriated to Australia?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—Let me say at the outset that the opportunity that I had, accompanied by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to visit Bali last Thursday evening and Friday was I hope of some help and reassurance and—however inadequate—comfort to the people who have been so sadly affected by these terrible events. My dominant emotion was one of great humility to find in the face of such dreadful adversity people displaying enormous strength and enormous courage.
I know how upsetting it is that the remains have not all been repatriated. Indeed, the current information I have is that at this stage the remains of only one has been repatriated, but more should be, I hope, soon. I cannot tell the House or the Leader of the Opposition exactly how long it is going to take. He was present of course at all of the briefings I had. I should point out to the House that I invited the Leader of the Opposition to all of the briefings that I had from the officials in Bali, and I think it is fair to say that he and the Deputy Prime Minister and I operated as a team in Bali. We were there on behalf of the entire nation; we were not there representing individual political parties. I hope the House would see the visit in that context.
The process of identification will take quite some time. It is hard for the reasons I outlined to the House last week. I can only repeat again my profound understanding to people who are waiting on the repatriation of the remains of a child, a mother, a father, a brother, a sister or a mate. The latest advice I have is that serious concerns are now held for 92 Australians: 41 from New South Wales, 23 from Victoria, eight from Queensland, 15 from Western Australia, three from South Australia, one from Tasmania and one overseas based Australian. DFAT and AFP staff continue to work to reconcile all missing cases reported by families and friends. Resolving the number of unaccounted for Australians will, of course, remain the top priority. AFP and state police officers in Bali and in Australia are working as quickly as possible to expedite identification and repatriation of remains. Forty-three federal and state police are working on victim identification in Bali. State police are contacting relatives in Australia of potential victims to obtain information to assist in the identification process.
My understanding is that the process of contact and collection of DNA relevant material is already very well advanced. As a result I believe that, after an inevitable delay at the beginning because of the difficulty of immediate identification, the process can expect to pick up a little speed. But I should warn the House that we could reach the situation where some remains are never identified. That is a difficult thing to have to say, but it remains the case. I know that some of the families to whom I have spoken were themselves already contemplating that prospect, and it will only add to their grief. As identification occurs and people are repatriated, those who are left will assume a greater concern regarding that possibility. I do understand the sense of frustration but, unfortunately, the process has to go on to avoid the possibility of mistaken identification.
There are another 25 Australian Federal Police officers working on the investigation in Bali; and there is a total of 109 Australian police, from various forces, in Bali. There is a memorandum of understanding covering the joint investigation that we signed with the Indonesian police last week. The Australian Federal Police have collected 6,000 questionnaires from those at Bali at the time of the bombing to obtain information on the attack, and they are following up with interviews of 450 people. They have made good progress so far, but it is quite impossible to predict how long the investigation will take.
AusAID has been in close contact on the ground with the Bali medical authorities. Twenty-two tonnes of medical supplies from a range of sources have arrived in Bali since the bomb outrage. Local hospitals in Bali do not need any more medical supplies at this stage. AusAID will continue to assist with any specific medical needs, as it did with the provision of plastic surgery equipment and training, and this assistance will arrive this week.
I think all of us would have been seized of the spontaneous response that Australians gave to the national day of mourning yesterday. In different parts of the country, in different ways, according to their own particular desires, Australians marked this terrible event in a respectful, united, sensitive fashion, and it reflects enormous credit on our country that we can respond in that fashion with such genuine, heartfelt feeling.
As I announced last week, there will be an interdenominational national memorial service in the Great Hall of Parliament House on Thursday, 24 October, at 10 a.m. The House will assemble at 9.30 a.m. and then, by agreement between the government and the opposition, it will be immediately adjourned for the rest of the day, and parliament will not meet again until November. The families of those affected by the Bali tragedy have been invited to attend, and the government will cover the travel and accommodation costs of two family members to attend the memorial service. Arrangements can be made through the Ceremonial and Hospitality Unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I will announce further details of the service tomorrow, but I can indicate to the House that Bishop Tom Frame, who is the senior chaplain of the Australian Defence Force, has been invited by the government to officiate. I also inform the House that the service will include an address from myself and an address from the Leader of the Opposition to reflect in full the completely bipartisan character of the occasion. Other arrangements relating to the service will be announced shortly.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—During question time the Leader of the Opposition asked me about an approach from the International Commission on Missing Persons. In the time available I have been able to obtain the following information: after the atrocity there was an approach from that organisation. It was understood on the information provided that that would have involved the removal of tissue, and other human material which might assist in victim identification, to Sarajevo, where the commission operates. Further information was requested. There was some concern about the transfer of the tissue to Sarajevo. It was not thought on the information provided that the proposal would have accelerated the process, and there was some particular concern about the removal of the tissue to Sarajevo. As the international and domestic coordination of the identification is being undertaken at the AFP's Weston complex, once again in the view of the Federal Police on the information available, it is not apparent that that is going to accelerate the process. If I get any further information then I will make it available to the House.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—Mr Speaker, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Emergency Services) Bill 2002 sends a very strong signal to all Australians, and that is that community service of whatever kind is highly valued by this parliament. In recent years, with greater demands on people's time due to changes in the way we work, volunteerism of all kinds has been put under increasing pressure. We have to find ways to assist people to build stronger communities through public service, especially when it comes to battling flood, fire and other natural and man-made disasters.
With the summer bushfire season approaching, we know that we will be facing possibly one of our most difficult fire seasons ever. With the dry and dusty conditions across much of the east coast, our emergency volunteers are waiting, ready for the worst that nature can do. Our brave volunteer firefighters will once again be out in force saving lives and properties. They of course deserve our admiration but, just as importantly, they deserve our support. Serving the community by battling fire and flood and responding to tragedy is the epitome of what it means to be an Australian. We have seen this displayed magnificently in Bali, where volunteers instinctively turned out to help in any way that they could. It goes without saying that people do not put their lives at risk for personal gain—and they should not have to risk their jobs to do so.
I ask the government to put politics aside and support Labor's bill on this important occasion, because our bill contains important protections for people who give selflessly and in a dedicated fashion. Our bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to provide employment protection to employees who take part in emergency operations as members of an emergency services organisation. If an employee is absent from work while battling an emergency as part of an emergency services organisation, they will have a specific ground for an unlawful termination action. In other words, that person would be protected from being sacked unfairly because she or he was away from work attending to an emergency.
Under this bill, powers will also be given to the Federal Court to guard emergency services volunteers against victimisation. In addition, the bill restores the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make award provisions granting emergency services volunteers paid leave. These powers and existing award leave provisions were stripped away by the government with its 1996 industrial legislation. People who help their communities were denied previous protections. We want to put them back.
Most employers will support staff who volunteer to help their communities, but we cannot assume all employers will do the right thing—and that is also why this bill is called for. It is designed to complement laws that carry out similar functions for workers covered by the laws of New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the ACT. This bill will make sure that federal award employees have the same level of protection as their counterparts working under state and territory laws. State based emergency services organisations have been consulted. They welcome this measure and believe it will give volunteers and potential volunteers confidence that their jobs will be protected. Cases of victimisation and sacking of volunteers are rare, but this bill provides a backstop. All members of this House would hold our emergency services volunteers in the very highest regard.
Earlier this year the federal government joined with the government of New South Wales to ensure ex-gratia payments were made to volunteer firefighters who fought in the Christmas 2001 bushfires. It is that same spirit of bipartisanship that we seek again today in appreciation of our emergency services volunteers. I call on the government to support this very important bill as the danger period approaches again. 
Bill read a first time.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-10-21,"—The Plastic Bag Levy (Assessment and Collection) Bill 2002 provides the definitions and administrative requirements for the introduction of a levy of 25c per bag on plastic shopping bags. It does not provide for the imposition of the levy itself, as the rules of the parliament do not allow for a private member to introduce any bill that imposes such a levy. For this reason, I seek leave to table as a paper a version of such a levy bill, including the relevant financial provisions for that levy, and urge all members, but most importantly government ministers, to take the opportunity to study it.
Leave granted.
—Thank you. It offers the process for implementing this legislation if government is of the persuasion once the present self-regulatory voluntary process runs its course—and personally I do not believe such a process will turn this massive environmental crisis around. The levy will not apply in limited, exempted cases; for example, where the bags are used for baked goods, non-packaged fruit and vegetables or fresh meat and fish. Long term, I would like to see cellulose bags replacing plastic for even these exemptions.
There are enormous possibilities for our rural industries in utilising cellulose from by-products of the grain, timber and sugarcane industry. The levy will not apply to paper bags or other non-synthetic packaging such as cellulose bags, but other so-called biodegradable bags are not exempt. Funds collected will be paid into a national environment education fund targeting environmentally hazardous waste to minimise its impact. This aspect is covered in the second bill of this legislative package.
The main purpose of the levy is not to collect funds but to change customer behaviour and reduce the environmental impact of plastic bags used each year—3.3 billion from supermarkets alone. Plastic bags have a costly impact not only on Australia's environment but worldwide. Third World countries are literally strangling on plastic. From the start of this year, Bangladesh has banned the use of plastic bags in Dhaka, where 10 million bags are dumped each day. The rest go into drainage and sewer lines, causing backup and serious disease risk. The major floods of 1989 and 1998 in Bangladesh were exacerbated by plastic bag blocked drains. The disposable culture of the West has created an environmental nightmare in the Third World, with millions of Bangladeshis, like those in other countries, abandoning traditional jute and fabric bags. In India a few years ago I was horrified not only by the tens of thousands of bags littering roads and waterways but to see the sacred cows chewing blue or white plastic as they wandered the streets, many to be carted away dead on trailers as the plastic inevitably blocked their gut.
So too the ubiquitous plastic bag is floating across our oceans, catching birds and sea life in a deadly tangle and also being ingested with fatal results. The shores of the Greek islands are littered with thousands of plastic bags thrown overboard from cruise ships, ferries and the yachting fraternity—out of mind perhaps for the polluters, but never out of sight.
The imposition of similar levies has been notably successful elsewhere in the world. A levy of 15 euro cents, approximately 27 Australian cents per plastic bag, was imposed by regulation in the Republic of Ireland in March this year. Within five months it led to a 90 per cent reduction in plastic bag usage and succeeded in dramatically raising environmental awareness in that country, according to Declan Kelly, Ireland's Ambassador to Australia. Obviously, time will tell whether this change of habit is permanent, but the levy in Ireland appears to have been struck at just the right level to hopefully act as a permanent disincentive. A similar levy is contained in this legislation that I introduce today.
The Irish government also provided for exemptions similar to those contained in this bill, while Irish retailers are saving on the cost of supplying plastic bags as well as making money on the sale of `bags for life'. The Irish scheme also earmarks the levy for a special environment fund to support waste management. One problem with the Irish experience is avoidance by some retailers, but this bill contains provisions authorising the Commissioner of Taxation under sections 11 to 16 to deal with late and unpaid funds.
This bill is recognition that a financial disincentive is the most effective way to achieve real change in consumer habits. The levy will encourage the market to provide environmentally friendly alternatives to the plastic shopping bag and, in conjunction with the second bill that I am about to introduce, provides a comprehensive approach. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-10-21,"—I now introduce the second part of this legislative package. The Plastic Bag (Minimisation of Usage) Education Fund Bill 2002 establishes a fund for consumer education to complement the imposition of the levy on plastic shopping bags. A levy on its own will not be enough to change our retail habits, especially where weekly grocery shopping is concerned. During preparation of this legislation I received a submission from the Australian Retailers Association, outlining its shared concerns for the environment and for our wildlife. However, the ARA believes a levy like that introduced in Ireland will not be adequate to change people's habitual use of plastic bags. That habit, incidentally, is only about 20 years old—I think we can all remember the big brown paper grocery bags, and why not see them reintroduced?
The ARA says that the Irish experience is inconclusive because people were offered the alternative of free paper bags and current claims of success only relate to a three-month period. Essentially, the retailers say that plastic bag usage will only be combated by following the educational and partnership approach set out in the National Packaging Covenant (NPC) and National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM). However, the NPC is not specifically aimed at plastic shopping bags, some 3.3 billion of which, as I have said, come annually from supermarkets. The NPC is primarily designed to support self-regulation amongst producers, with a view to reducing packaging waste. Its definition of consumer packaging is:
 ... all products made of any material, or combination of material, for the containment, protection, marketing and handling of retail consumer products.
This does not seem to include plastic shopping bags, and so the covenant might contribute only marginally to a reduction in their use. A self-regulatory scheme such as this will not have the same effect in changing consumer habits as a financial incentive like the proposed levy.
The ARA recognises education as essential to the successful reduction of plastic bag use, and that is what this bill provides for. Indeed, Bathurst independent supermarket owner Mick Michel is reported in today's Western Advocate as saying that the merits of doing away with plastic bags outweigh the demerits. He says, however, that it will involve a cultural shift and an educational program, which is what these bills are about. Mr Michel appears more in tune with the mood and reality of this issue than the Retailers Association appears to be.
Mr Michel also reminded me of last week's Bathurst 1000, where bags in their hundreds blew across the track, cooking the motor of one leading car when sucked into the air intake and almost stopping eventual race winner Mark Skaife with a similar problem. Bathurst races might not be a bad place to start this education campaign. There is only one person more focused than a Holden fan who thinks he has been cheated—and that is a Ford fan. But all would be receptive, I would hope, to a plastic-free Bathurst 1000.
We therefore have a legislative package here that provides both the financial incentive and the consumer education that will overcome some of the shortcomings of previous efforts to combat the use of plastic bags. If anything, the ARA should support these two bills as they provide for the well-rounded approach to the problem that the ARA found lacking in the Irish experience.
Section 4 of this bill provides for the establishment of a fund to be known as the Plastic Bag and Other Waste Minimisation of Usage and Education Fund, which is a mouthful but says it all. Funds, as appropriated by the parliament, shall be contributed to the fund and controlled by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Expenditures will be made on the written authority of the minister for the purpose, as set out in section 5, of educating people `about or effecting minimisation of' damage and pollution caused to the land environment and aquatic environment and to wildlife and marine life by plastics bags.
Section 6 provides for the minister to report to each house of the parliament, not later than two months after 30 June, the expenditure of moneys credited to the fund. The fund will be targeted at education and effecting the minimisation of plastic bag usage, which may provide some leeway for the support of other measures, such as the support of biodegradable alternatives. One example, as I indicated in the earlier speech, could be bags made from cellulose obtained from agricultural grain or sugar cane, wood and wood residues, plants and grasses that will break down in the environment. I commend this bill to the House.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2002-10-21,"—In introducing the Fuel Quality Standards (Renewable Content of Motor Vehicle Fuel) Amendment Bill 2002, I wish to thank the 31 scientists who have given me over two or three hours of their time, in each case; the company Transfield, which approached the Queensland government in the late eighties; and hundreds of other people who have fought hard to bring forward these proposals. We are introducing here today legislation mirroring the amendments that were passed unanimously by the United States Senate—an amendment to the Energy Policy Act 2002 with the addition of a section 820, `Renewable content of motor vehicle fuel'. In the last two years this issue has been bitterly fought throughout Australia—in the grain belt, in the sugar belt and in the giant cities of Australia, where the issue of air quality is of significant importance.
In pushing this forward, we have been told that it will not mix; it has to be given to the oil companies to mix. We have been told that it ruins engines. We have been told that it has no power. We have been told that all we are going to do is ensure Brazilian imports into Australia. I do not have time to laugh, as all of the other people have laughed, at these comments which almost invariably are coming from the oil companies which do not wish to lose, naturally enough, 10 per cent of the Australian market—which they would lose under these proposals. Unless the parliament is prepared to mandate a 10 per cent ethanol blend then talking about it is a silly joke, and we would ask the government to desist from such hypocrisy in the future.
We cannot introduce money bills, of course, but there needs to be some money bill associated with this. An excise needs to be imposed upon ethanol—at the moment there is none—and an environmental rebate needs to be given to processors and farmers in Australia, grain and sugar farmers, who are going out of their way to produce this product. They need some sort of compensation for that, and so an environmental rebate should come into play. This has the incidental but not intended consequence of locking foreign ethanol out of Australia.
In the case of the sugar industry, this will provide an extra $100 a tonne, premium, for the price of sugar. Whether that $100 per tonne goes to the oil companies, to processors or to the farmers is a matter that should be determined by the government. Similar sorts of figures exist for the wheat industry, so we would urge in the strongest possible way the tightest oversighting by the government of these proposals. Germany, France, Canada, the United States, Brazil, China, Thailand and India have either moved or are in the process of moving down this pathway because the rest of the world realises, and is very conscious of the fact, that when lead was taken out of petrol aromatics were put in. Aromatics are extremely dangerous to people's health. In Australia we allow three per cent benzine content; it is one of the aromatics and it is a known human carcinogenic and should be removed.
If you removed the aromatics from petrol, the amount of power in your engine would fall substantially. To maintain the power ratio, you need to put something in its place and that, of course, is the 10 per cent ethanol blend. Not only does this introduce sustainability for 10 per cent of our fuel stream; it also enables us to meet the Kyoto protocols and removes dangerous aromatics, which affect humans as well as the environment, from our urban environment. It will create a new industry, with a net value of $1.3 billion to the Australian economy. This will profit our balance of payments and the nation as a whole, creating over 20,000 jobs which will be exclusively in the grain belt—the wheat growing areas of Australia—and in the sugarcane growing areas of Australia. It would be a magic move forward for these areas; $360 a tonne will enable our sugar industry to return to moderate prosperity.
Strategic self-sufficiency is influencing the United States. Within 12 years we will have only 40 per cent self-sufficiency in oil; we should be moving now to develop self-sufficiency, the same as the United States. It will also, incidentally and incredibly, reduce the price of petrol by 1c to 2c as well as reduce the price of sugar that Australia is able to sell on the world market, although I cannot go into the detail today. All of those magic benefits will flow if this bill is passed.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	condemns the sentencing of Amina Lawal to death by stoning by Shari'ah Courts in the Katsina province of Nigeria, for allegedly commiting adultery and bearing a child out of wedlock;
(2)	registers its strong opposition to all similar extreme sentences that discriminate against women; and
(3)	calls on the Government of Nigeria to do everything within its power to protect the basic human rights of Amina Lawal and all its citizens.
I thank the parliament for providing the time to discuss this important motion on human rights today. I felt compelled to bring this motion before the House for two reasons. The first reason is that, as chairman of the Australian parliament's Amnesty International group, I have a great interest in the protection of individuals' human rights. The second is due to my involvement in the parliament's Friends of Nigeria group. As chairman of that group, I am keen to see the relationship between Australia and Nigeria prosper. With the latter in mind, it was with great regret that I read recently about the plight of Amina Lawal, a young Nigerian woman who has been sentenced to a barbaric execution for the so-called crime of having a child out of wedlock. This is an appalling sentence—out of all proportion to the supposed crime committed.
In the context of the parliament, when we have had such an atrocious crime committed in Bali and when we have human rights crimes in Sudan, China, Vietnam and Cambodia, one could ask why we particularly are concentrating on this issue of Amina Lawal today. It relates to the fact that this is a crime against women who have been badly treated in many countries. This crime symbolises the way in which women have been so poorly treated and why we must do all we can to highlight this gross abuse, to identify what the basic problems are and to put as much pressure as we can on the government in Nigeria to reverse this decision.
We have celebrated in this building today the 17th national prayer breakfast. As a keen Christian, I know that the one that I follow had, as a prime parable, the story of a woman caught in adultery. The example that was given was that those who felt that they had no sin amongst them should cast the first stone. He simply said, `Go and sin no more.' The reality is that not everyone shares this view and that people come from different faiths, traditions and backgrounds. Nevertheless, we should focus on the fact that this is a gross abuse of human rights; it is a gross abuse of women's position in the community in Nigeria.
Amina Lawal was sentenced to death by stoning in March this year according to a fundamentalist Sharia interpretation of Islamic law. She had been arrested by a mob of villagers after having given birth to a child and was brought before the court. This sentence was upheld following an appeal in August and, failing any further future intervention, Lawal will be killed.
This case presents us with two serious issues: firstly, the cruel and unusual punishment. If Amina Lawal's sentence is carried out, when her young baby is weaned she will be buried up to her waist and hit with rocks and stones until she is dead. That appals all of us, just in terms of the barbarity in the way this woman is going to be treated. This clearly constitutes both cruel and unusual punishment. Nigeria has ratified the 2001 Convention Against Torture and as such has bound itself not to allow such punishments to proceed.
Secondly, we are concerned about it in terms of its discrimination against women. The case of Amina Lawal provides yet another example of a system that clearly discriminates against a female defendant. Sharia courts in northern Nigeria interpret Islamic law according to the Maliki school of thought, which considers pregnancy would suffice to condemn a woman for adultery or pre-marital sex. All a man has to do to disprove his involvement in such an activity is to swear an oath to that effect, which is what Amina's partner did. For the man's oath to be disproved, four other people have to swear that they saw an act occur—a ridiculous proposition.
We are concerned on several bases in terms of the atrocious way in which the woman is to be treated and the difference in the way the man is to be treated. We certainly would hope that the Nigerian government would recognise the outrage among men and women of Australia, particularly in this parliament, and do the best that they can to overturn this finding.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I second the motion. I begin by congratulating the member for Cook for moving this motion on human rights today. The fate of Amina Lawal depends very much on the way in which the world reacts to her case. I am sure this motion will receive the total support of this parliament and indeed the support of all Australians. The strong message sent to the government of Nigeria by the people of the world is the last hope for Amina Lawal.
When I recall the television images of Amina Lawal and her beautiful daughter Wasila, I feel great sorrow for Amina and for her children. I also feel anger towards those responsible for passing the sentence of death by stoning against Amina Lawal. I cannot begin to imagine her anguish, as the child at her breast is both the agent for her stay of execution and the proof that confirms her death warrant.
I can say as a woman that I am appalled that in the 21st century a woman could face such a sentence for an act that is not regarded as an offence in most countries in the world. Where the offence of having sex outside marriage is enforced, it is mainly women who are prosecuted. Rarely do men face prosecution, and even then the burden of proof is higher and the punishment more lenient. Amina Lawal is the face of all women oppressed by politically motivated systems of justice.
In Nigeria, 12 of the 36 states have adopted Sharia law. They are in the Muslim areas in the north of the country. While the federal courts in Nigeria have ruled that death penalty judgments by Sharia courts are unconstitutional, political pressure from state governors may lead to sentences being carried out regardless of the wishes of the federal courts. The position of Nigeria's Christian president, General Obasanjo, is crucial to the fate of Amina Lawal. His refusal to dispute the rights of states to use Sharia law and his dependence on electoral support from the northern states at next year's election makes his intervention less than certain. The Nigerian justice minister, Godwin Agabi, however, has pointed out to the states that a Muslim should not be subjected to a punishment more severe than would be imposed on other Nigerians for the same offence and, importantly for us, that Nigeria cannot be indifferent to international outrage over the sentence.
Australians have been outraged in recent years by what we see as abuses of women's basic human rights in countries such as Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia. While it seems offensive to us that religious law should have the same effect as criminal law, we cannot ignore the fact that, whether it is the push for Islamic law in Pakistan or the push for Hindu law in India, or for that matter the law of Moses in Israel, the motives to enforce these religious laws are largely political.
For Muslims, the moral code of Sharia is the path to a perfect society. Now, in the pre-election climate in Nigeria—and you could also say in some states in Australia—a return to harsh mandatory punishments is seen as a pathway to electoral success, if not a path to a perfect society. But that would be a path littered with battered skulls and severed hands. In truth, society is less than perfect and deterrent punishments have never been effective in keeping all citizens on the straight and narrow path, especially when there are many who stray but few are punished.
That was, after all, the message of the man described in the Koran as the prophet Jesus. When a woman caught in the act of adultery was brought to Jesus and he was reminded that the law of Moses required her to be stoned, his response was:
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
I would commend those words to President Obasanjo and the governor of Katsina state. Like all Australians, I would hope that their response would be to leave Amina Lawal and her children to live in peace—definitely to live in peace. That is what that woman deserves and that is what her children deserve.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights in Nigeria</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1,speech
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—I want to say from the outset that I totally support the comments of both my colleagues in this place today. As a member of the Human Rights Subcommitteeof the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I feel it is important that we all speak out about this. I know that in the past women's groups, and the European Union in particular, have been criticised by one of the provincial governors in Nigeria for speaking out when a previous case was in progress, but we all have the right to speak out about laws that are so unjust; laws that allow the killing of people in a very discriminatory way. In this case, the woman is the only one being punished. Not only is it bad that these provincial governments see fit to put people to death for such crimes but this case also involves something that we all abhor: the discrimination of women in these countries. So I feel no sense of wrongdoing in speaking out about this dreadful case, and I am sure my colleagues feel the same. 
In March 2002, a young Nigerian woman by the name of Amina Lawal was convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning in a Sharia court in Bakori, Katsina state. The sentence was appealed on 19 August 2002 but it was upheld by Judge Aliyu Abdullahi in a lower Sharia court of appeal in that state. We understand from all reports that in the past no-one has been stoned to death in Nigeria. But it concerns me that, in 1999, 12 Muslim states decided to extend sharia law to the criminal sphere, and that changes, in some respects, the landscape in relation to this case. Indeed, there is a great danger that Ms Lawal will be put to death. As we have heard, her execution will not take place until 2004 when her daughter, now eight months old, is weaned. Then the sentence requires that she be buried up to her neck and stoned to death. 
The federal government of Nigeria has declared the judgment unconstitutional; however, there are some concerns about the ability to successfully appeal this case because of those changes to the law. I was very pleased to know that the Nigerian government have opposed the laws and they have made statements in support of Ms Lawal. In fact, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer, met with the Nigerian High Commissioner to Australia, Dr Rufai Soule, to convey the deep concern of the Australian government and the community at the death sentence by stoning of Amina Lawal by the provincial Sharia court. I know there has been an outcry because I have been, as have my colleagues, the recipient of many phone calls, letters and emails in relation to this case. People are shocked that such a cruel sentence could be proclaimed on anyone. Mr Downer said:
... that the Australian Government considered death by stoning a cruel, inhumane and degrading practice and that the sentence had generated a great deal of concern in the Australian community. 
That has certainly been my experience. He went on to say:
There can be no excuse or satisfactory explanation for this inhumane and cruel practice and laws that are inconsistent in their application. In this case there is one law for the woman ... Ms Lawal and another for the male partner in this so-called “crime”.
I call on the federal government of Nigeria to do all in its power to ensure that the sentence is never carried out. This includes ensuring that Ms Lawal's defence lawyers are assisted to the maximum degree by the Nigerian government.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights in Nigeria</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1,speech
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I concur with other honourable members in this chamber and condemn the sentence to death by tribal elders of Ms Amina Lawal. Much has been said already about the nature of the sentence and the manner in which Ms Lawal is to have her life ended. I would also like to take this opportunity to inform the House that many Muslim organisations around the world have also condemned the misuse and abuse of Sharia law by politicians in northern Nigeria and have accused them of wilfully and deliberately seeking to make political gains through the misuse of what is considered by Muslims to be a comprehensive Muslim law which is derived from two sources: the Koran and the Sunna.
Sharia law covers every aspect of daily individual and collective living. Its purpose is the protection of individuals' basic human rights to include right to life, right to property, political and religious freedom and safeguarding the rights of women and minorities. This is not unfamiliar to our Western concepts of our inalienable human rights. Many Islamic leaders have expressed their concern about the way Sharia law is being administered in other parts of the world. Notably, the then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato Seri Anwar, noted in an interview in 1996:
Shariah courts have by their actions in many instances betrayed the ideals of justice on the basis of gender and other cultural prejudices that have no basis in Islam.
Violence against women and the manipulation of religion and religious codes in an attempt to exert control and to divide people is not a new occurrence, nor is it confined to Islam. We need to take a long, hard look at why women throughout time have been victims of violence and aggression, almost always at the hands of men and in many—if not most—cases in the name of religion.
Are we not all familiar with the cruelty and murder of innocent people, especially women, during the terror years of the Spanish Inquisition, when the god-fearing clergy ordered killings in the name of God? Was Saint Joan not burnt at the stake? Were women not the victims of the infamous Salem witch hunts? Are women not the victims of the machismo culture still prevalent in Latin American communities? Have women not been the primary victims of honour killings? Are not women predominantly the ones sold into slavery or sent into prostitution because families cannot afford to keep them? Are not female babies in many cultures subjected to drowning and killing at birth because their parents cannot afford to be burdened with dowries and other marriage requirements imposed by very poor and patriarchal communities?
I will go back to Amina Lawal and Sharia law. I guess the question is: who shall cast the first stone? Christianity, Islam, honour killings, machismo culture, dowries, female baby killings and on it goes. You have to ask yourself: what drives such behaviour? My understanding of it is that it is men needing to control and to possess. I might go a little bit further and suggest that this sort of behaviour towards women is an expression of some form of sexual perversion and misogyny—a view that women are mere possessions, objects to be used and abused and then punished, often in the name of God. We shudder at the inhumanity of Amina's case, but it should serve as a wake-up call that practices and behaviour long abandoned by the so-called civilised Western world are still rife in other parts of the world. The hidden agendas marking the true nature behind the actions of the politicians and Sharia court elders in northern Nigeria must be exposed and not go unpunished. As an international community, we must put maximum pressure on the President of Nigeria to enforce the expectations of the UN treaties his country has ratified, in particular the convention against torture.
As someone who represents a significant portion of Australian Muslims, I want to convey to this parliament their concerns and condemnation of this abuse of Sharia law. My constituents—like most of us—are concerned that these incidents vilify them and their Islamic way of life. The Islamic Council of Victoria and the Islamic Women's Welfare Council have condemned the decision to stone Amina Lawal to death. In particular, the Muslim women's groups are active in their fight to expose such abuse and discrimination against women and hopefully put an end to such violence. In relation to the Muslim community here in Australia, and given the events of the past few days and the past 12 months, it is very important that as broad and as diverse a spectrum of Australian Muslim leaders as possible be heard, because those who speak on behalf of Muslims and Islam have a responsibility to choose their words carefully.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—I rise today in this House to support the motion on human rights that has been moved by the honourable member for Cook and also to support other members who have spoken before me. This motion is about justice as much as it is about equality. It is about voicing concerns for a legal system that relies on hearsay evidence as an acceptable form of defence for one sex but judges subjectively the evidence of another sex. While Amina Lawal was sentenced to stoning to death for giving birth to a child nine months after she was divorced, her boyfriend of 11 months was dismissed for lack of evidence—he swore on the Koran that he was not the father. In condemning the decision of the Sharia court in the Katsina province of Nigeria and its sentence of death by stoning, we, as Australians, also demonstrate the freedoms and the rights, for both sexes, that are the embodiment of our particular system of democracy. We are indeed very lucky to live in this country. This story demonstrates just how lucky.
Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, with 120 million people evenly divided between Christianity and Islam. In 1999, after Nigeria returned to civilian law, 12 Muslim majority states in the northern part of the country controversially introduced Sharia law into their criminal code. Sharia law had not been instigated in Nigeria since the 19th century, before British colonial rule. Both the law and its sentences are considered tough, and the current sentence of Amina Lawal to death by stoning in 2004—after weaning her daughter—has further ignited worldwide criticism and indignation. In March this year, a woman was sentenced to death by stoning by a Sharia court in Nigeria, and she had her sentence quashed because of the international appeals for clemency. She was one of a total of four people, including Amina Lawal, who have been sentenced to this particular type of stoning. However, none of these sentences has been carried out.
Massoud Shadjareh, who is the head of the London based Islamic Human Rights Commission, last month called on Muslim intellectuals to speak out about this brand of Sharia law in Nigeria, which he considers inhumane. By adding his voice to the growing opposition internationally, he demonstrated the shortcomings of this law as an equitable means of justice. The advent of Sharia law in Nigeria's northern provinces has been seen both at home and abroad as something of a political tool. It is used to further divide the Muslim north from the more prosperous Christian south. By instigating this brand of Sharia law, northern leaders have been accused of attempting to secure the loyalty of Muslim voters ahead of next year's general elections. The use of this law as a political weapon to devalue the very quality of life of Amina Lawal and her child is appalling. It not just pigeonholes her as a victim but also is used as a push for power. Even Sharia officials in the Nigerian state of Katsina have questioned whether the use of the law in this state is being executed properly, declaring that adultery is not a crime against the state.
When I first heard of Amina Lawal's story, I was surprised and appalled at the resurrection of this extremely archaic law. My electorate office is being contacted by people who want to put their weight behind many others in calling for this inhumane sentence to be revoked. I also was pleased—along with many of my colleagues in this House—when the foreign minister conveyed these thoughts to the Nigerian High Commissioner and when the Prime Minister spoke directly to the Nigerian President on this very issue. It struck a chord with me not just as a woman but also as a mother and as an Australian. Amina Lawal has been made a scapegoat in a legal system that not only puts the rights of people behind the quest for power but also levies bias against women and devalues them. Former US President Bill Clinton alluded to this when he visited Nigeria recently and commented on this case. He said:
Islam from its earliest days sought to protect such rights for women and to protect children.
Sadly, the use of this law has nullified this protection. This motion is about justice and about equality. It is about the lack of those rights and the ability of the international community to convey their opposition to this in the strongest possible way.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I am very pleased to support the motion on human rights moved by the member for Cook. I congratulate and thank him for bringing the motion forward in the House today; it is a motion that many of us would have wanted to move. There is an enormous surge of support within the parliament for this motion today.
There are very few avenues for an individual to influence the human rights environment within sovereign states but, as parliamentarians, we do at least have the chance to make our voices heard and to place our protests on the public record. When all else fails, we have to place our faith in the weight of global public opinion. The circumstances of Amina Lawal's case in Nigeria are already very well known in Australia, and we can draw some hope from the high-profile nature of the case. I want to record my complete support for the contributions to the debate by the members for Cook, Fowler, Pearce, Calwell and Petrie. I am sure that the two members who are to follow will speak in equal terms.
Our protests are not about religion or about Islam. Our protests today are concerned with fundamental human rights and with systems of law that target women for arbitrary and excessive punishment. It goes without saying that the sentence imposed on Amina Lawal by the Sharia court in northern Nigeria is appalling and inhumane. Words seem inadequate. I cannot quite describe how I felt when I read of these reports in the newspaper. The death penalty alone is an affront to humanity, but death by stoning goes far beyond the bounds of punishment. The case of Amina Lawal shows the determination of some people in positions of power to degrade, terrify and ultimately subjugate women in their society. This is an issue that I hope to explore further during my visit to Nigeria next week as part of an official delegation of this parliament, travelling at the invitation of the Nigerian government. I look forward to finding an appropriate occasion to convey to the Nigerian government and to fellow parliamentarians in Nigeria the concerns expressed in this chamber today about the human rights situation in northern Nigeria. These are not issues that I can shy away from.
I believe that relations between sovereign states—and, in this case, between members of the Commonwealth—can and should tolerate discussion of difficult but important issues. It remains to be seen just how robust those human rights dialogues can be between Australian and Nigerian parliamentarians, but I will travel to Nigeria with all the goodwill in the world and with a strong sense of moral obligation to explain the deep worry that cases like this cause in Australia.
Other speakers have already referred to the fact that there will be many people in Nigeria—some of them members of parliament or, indeed, members of the government—who do not agree with this sentence against Amina Lawal. This is an opportunity for us to make our views and those of our community known and to encourage and support those people in Nigeria to continue to do what they can to have this decision overturned. Only that outcome will be considered as a success by any of us. We simply must support those people in Nigeria who I know do not agree with this. We must use this debate today to support and encourage them in what I know they will want to do, because they will not welcome the decision of the Sharia court on this or any similar case in Nigeria. I am very confident that, during the discussions next week, my colleagues on the delegation and I will have an opportunity to relate very clearly the unanimous views of this House and to offer them all the support we can to correct this and any future abuse of such law within their communities within Nigeria.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights in Nigeria</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1,speech
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—I rise to support the motion on human rights moved by the honourable member for Cook and to commend him for his concerns on human rights, in this instance in Nigeria. In recent times we have, sadly, been witness to an act of savage barbarity that is without precedent in our nation's history and which has killed and maimed many young Australians. It is a sad fact, however, that acts of savagery are all too common throughout various regions of the world.
Amina Lawal is a 31-year-old mother of three. She is the youngest of 13 children of a local farmer, and she was first married at the age of 14, when most young Australian girls are still at school. Having been divorced, she began a relationship with a man in December 2000, which lasted until November 2001 when she gave birth to her daughter, Wasila. In the last few years, 12 states in the north of Nigeria have adopted the strict Islamic Sharia law. Unfortunately, Amina lives in one of these states. Under Sharia law, a woman who is divorced and then has a sexual relationship with another man is considered to be guilty of adultery. This is considered the case even if the man is not married. The punishment for adultery under Sharia law is to be stoned to death. Amina Lawal has been so convicted. The thought of a sentence of death by stoning being carried out anywhere in the world in this first decade of the 21st century is positively sickening. Amina does not deserve to die, and she certainly does not deserve to die by the method handed down by the Sharia court. If the sentence were to be carried out, it would undoubtedly be an act of barbarism.
It is true that the government of Nigeria has, quite rightly, expressed its opposition to the sentence. President Obasanjo has apparently stated that he will `weep for Amina and Nigeria' if Amina is executed. I wish to commend the efforts of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his department for conveying the very deep concern of the Australian government and its people at this unjust sentence. I note the statement issued by Minister Downer on 29 August, in which he stated that the Australian government considered death by stoning a cruel, inhumane and degrading practice.
Dr Soule, Nigeria's High Commissioner to Australia, has suggested that the Nigerian Supreme Court, which does not operate under Sharia law, was most likely to reject the provincial court's sentence. We can only hope and pray that this will be so. The sentence also highlights the inequality of women being judged under Sharia law. As was noted by the International Federation of Women Lawyers, in cases where a conviction for adultery has been recorded the women were convicted while the males were discharged without penalty. For a justice system to be truly just it must apply uniformly to all citizens. The situation for the government of Nigeria is made more difficult by the fact that, in recent years, it has seen an increase in ethnic and religious violence.
Nigeria has, since independence, suffered a turbulent and often violent history, with short periods of civilian government broken by military rule. President Obasanjo was elected in February 1999 and faces many difficulties in governing his country. We understand this and we respect his position. Nigeria is a signatory to various international covenants and treaties, and it must understand that it is expected to honour those commitments. People around the world, and particularly here in Australia, have expressed their horror at the sentence handed down against Amina Lawal and similar sentences against other women in the northern provinces of Nigeria. We can only hope that, as I stated earlier, Dr Soule, the Nigerian High Commissioner to Australia, is correct in suggesting that the Nigerian Supreme Court may reject the provincial court's sentence. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights in Nigeria</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—Amina Lawal is a name that is now internationally recognised as human rights groups have focused on her plight and highlighted the extremist sentences that continue to be passed on women throughout the world. This issue is not about respecting religion in other parts of the world or imposing Western standards; it is about basic human rights. Despite the international outcry, the Nigerian government has failed to intervene. It amazes me that this issue is still in the limelight, particularly as Nigeria is a fellow member of the Commonwealth. To me, it is totally unacceptable. As previous members have said, Amina was sentenced by a Sharia court in the Katsina province of Nigeria to death by stoning because she allegedly had a child out of wedlock. This decision has been upheld on appeal and a further appeal is being made to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. If this appeal fails, Amina will be buried to her neck and stoned to death. Nigerian President Obasanjo has said:
There is nobody that has ever been stoned to death in our history, and I hope that nobody will be stoned to death.
What a bland statement by the leader of a county: `I hope that nobody will be stoned to death.' The Nigerian federal government will not intervene in this case as the states in Nigeria have independent legal systems. The Nigerian Minister of Justice declared the sentence as unconstitutional, but still no measures have been taken to prevent it. Meanwhile, Amina is left to contemplate her fate. As Amnesty International has stated:
The danger of human rights becoming the victim of politics is real.
The 1999 Nigerian Constitution confirms the sanctity of life and enshrines the right to have one's life and personal dignity respected. Nigeria is also a signatory to international and regional human rights declarations and conventions which recognise this right. The Nigerian government needs to do more than just state its opposition to this sentence; it needs to intervene—and intervene now—and uphold its pledge to the people of Nigeria in the 1999 Nigerian Constitution and its pledges to the international community in the international human rights treaties which it has signed.
On September 27, Amnesty International presented a 1,300,000 strong petition for Amina Lawal to the Nigerian officials at the London High Commission. A Tasmanian school—not in my electorate but in the electorate of the federal member for Denison; it has children from my electorate—the Sacred Heart College, recently contacted me to table a petition in this House opposing the sentence passed on Amina Lawal. The concern about this sentence has obviously reached beyond activists and the human rights movements throughout the world.
Death by stoning is a cruel and inhumane form of punishment. This punishment is degrading: it does not respect life or human dignity. Amina is the second of three women in Nigeria who have been sentenced to death by stoning for allegedly having a child out of wedlock. A couple have been condemned to death by stoning since Amina's sentence. The first woman was acquitted in a court of appeal on technical grounds. Women's and human rights groups in Nigeria have observed:
... the emerging pattern of people from poor backgrounds—particularly women—being the victims of cruel, inhumane and discriminatory sentences introduced by Regional laws in the states of northern Nigeria.
As the member for Calwell said, this is of great concern. Human rights are fundamental and should apply to all people regardless of race, gender or religion. Initially, Amina had no legal representation. Human rights lawyer Indidi Ekweke said:
She has not been given a chance to prove her innocence. That on its own has led to a miscarriage of justice.
The decision of the Sharia court to stone Amina is abhorrent and I strongly condemn it. The process that sees extremist sentences being passed on people of poor backgrounds, particularly women, is of great concern to me and other members of this place. I urge the Nigerian government to do all that is within its power to protect the basic human rights of all people in that country, as it pledged to do when it signed the various international human rights treaties and conventions. Perhaps the last words are best left to Amina, who said:
My only hope and prayers are to see that I get out of this trauma. (Time expired)
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is therefore adjourned and will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Human Rights in Nigeria</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—One of the greatest challenges for an opposition member of this parliament is being able to initiate change in your electorate when you do not have the numbers on the floor of the House. That is why it is necessary to be creative, to look to the community you represent in this parliament, to build on their strengths and to work with them to develop creative local projects and initiatives. In order to be able to successfully do this, you must do it in conjunction with your community and by basing any initiatives on what the people in these communities see as important to them and on what they want, not on what you think they should have. In order to achieve this in the Shortland electorate, I asked Jenny Boddy, a fourth-year social work student who attends Newcastle university, to undertake a research project in the electorate of Shortland. The research project aimed to identify what people living in the Shortland electorate aged over 55 years saw as being important to ensure a good quality of life and also to elicit project ideas that could be used for future community development work. I would like to acknowledge the fine work of Jenny Boddy and congratulate her on presenting a wonderful research paper. I would also like to thank the School of Social Sciences at Newcastle university. I would like to put on the record that the social work department at the university undertakes fine work and trains excellent students. I have had a long association with them, and I look forward to continuing the association.
The demographics in the Shortland electorate are quite interesting because Shortland is actually the 12th oldest electorate in Australia, with 17.34 per cent of the population over the age of 65. When you compare this to the national average of 12 per cent over the age of 65, it shows that Shortland is indeed one of the oldest electorates in the country. People over the age of 65 rely fairly heavily on government support. A high proportion are veterans, and another very large percentage are in receipt of the age pension. This is reflected in the fact that the Shortland electorate has the 10th lowest median income in Australia. The heavy reliance on income support by this older population shows that Shortland is indeed an electorate that has older people with particular needs.
I would like to talk a bit about the research project that Jenny conducted and the results of the survey. There were 560 people surveyed. Surveys were given to groups like Probus, pension groups and veterans and were sent out with some information through my office. There were two formal consultations, and Jenny met and discussed issues with people. They completed a questionnaire. Fifty-three per cent of the respondents were female, 45 per cent were male and two per cent did not identify their sex. The highest percentage was in the age group between 70 and 79, the next highest was 60 to 69, and 80 to 89 was the next highest after that. There were people from both Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast of New South Wales. The highest percentage were married, and the next highest percentage were widowed.
The survey asked questions relating to quality of life and asked people to rank the factors that they thought contributed to a good quality of life and the services they used, and the top three factors impacting on good quality of life. The themes that emerged in the needs and issues were health provision for people with disabilities or declining health, safety and security, social support in isolation, transport, financial concerns and shopping facilities. The other themes were community mindedness, hobby and exercise groups, adult education, support services, community programs and information, youth groups, entertainment and environmental care. Once again, it shows the strong sense of community of the older people in the Shortland electorate in that they are looking to the needs of youth within the area.
As I mentioned briefly earlier, health was identified as being by far the most important issue for older people within the electorate. The second highest ranked service was companionship, followed by security—and that includes both personal and financial security. The services most commonly used were clubs, libraries and social groups. I think it is important that I identify some of the issues that were raised when it came to health. Eighty-eight per cent of the people who completed the survey saw health as being very important. They emphasised the need for more doctors to bulk-bill, easier access to Medicare offices and improved hospital services. They felt that we needed better health facilities and more doctors within the area. Bulk-billing and accessibility of Medicare offices were constantly raised.
The other issue that was raised that was seen as being very important was aged care. That was linked to aged care facilities and the health issue. The overwhelming majority of people who completed the questionnaire identified that more accommodation in nursing homes and hostels should be available for those people who need it and that older people should also be able to access more help within their homes. Safety and security were important issues. It was very strongly emphasised by a number of the people who completed the survey that they needed personal safety and financial safety. I suppose the results of the survey were not necessarily unique or surprising, but they really emphasised that there are some areas that we can work on. Some of projects suggested were hobby and exercise groups, adult education, support services, programs for younger people, entertainment and environmental projects. I will return to this in just a moment.
I would like to digress for a moment and talk a little about issues that were raised at a meeting I recently attended with aged care providers, and link this to the quality of life survey. As I have already mentioned, health was identified as being the most important issue for older people in the Shortland electorate. At this meeting, managers told me about the burden that the documentation and paperwork is putting on all aged care facilities. They argued that the residential classification system was placing the wrong emphasis on care. Care should be based more on a social model not on a medical model. It should be designed to maximise social involvement and good health and it should reward the facilities for achieving this. The current system rewards sickness. The audits of the RCS punish facilities if they improve the health status of the people living there. Funding should be based on what they can achieve to improve quality of life for people. As I have already referred to in the results of the survey, the most important thing for improving people's quality of life was health. Our aged care facilities are being punished for achieving that. I would like to conclude by thanking all those people who completed the survey and who assisted Jenny with the research project. I would like to thank Jenny and the social work department of the University of Newcastle. My challenge now is to use this research to benefit the people of the Shortland electorate.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Shortland Electorate: Research</title>,Grievance Debate,14,1,speech

Turning to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], with regard to the government's supposition that unfair or fair dismissal legislation that exempts small business will create 50,000 jobs, the Federal Court in the Hamzy case referred to evidence which showed that employment in Australia in the 1990s had been at its strongest when federal unfair dismissal laws had been at their most protective. So the promise of job creation looks quite thin. But implicit in the Centre for Independent Studies report giving advice to the government is the notion of a trade-off of legal rights for a class of people in return for increased job creation. The government's case for this legislation rests on this principle of public interest trade-off. They say the public good would be best served by the creation of some 53,000 jobs set against the public harm of removing rights from a little over 2,600 federal small business unfair dismissal applications. With no evidence to support this, the argument that employment will be created by the removal of those rights and the removal of rights from particular employees based on business size is just not acceptable.  No legislation should rest on bad principle. A fair go is what should be given at all times. The argument, then, is flawed. But we need to look more closely at this magical 50,000 or 53,000 jobs.
The minister has no real basis on which to claim the accuracy of his rubbery figures, it seems. Whilst speaking on the 7.30 Report program of 20 May 2002, he was asked how he had arrived at this figure of 50,000 jobs. He replied:
It's a pretty rough and ready rule based on the fact that if just one small business in 20 employed one extra person as a result of the lifting of the unfair dismissal monkey from the back of small business, that would produce well over 50,000 jobs.
It sounds like monkey talk to me, Minister. On Meet the Press on 9 June this year, he was asked:
What's your evidence for that? Do you have evidence or is it just wishful thinking?
The minister replied:
Inevitably, it's an estimate, and these estimates are inevitably imprecise, but there are something like 1.5 million small businesses in Australia and if 1 in 30 of those took on an extra person because of changes to the law, there are your 50 000 new jobs.  
It sounds very imprecise to me. In the parliament on 17 June 2002, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism repeated the claim about 50,000 jobs but qualified it by saying that there would be `up to 50,000 jobs' created in those `1.2 million small businesses'. The reality for most Australians is that, without some reliable figures, some relevant mathematics and some assurances about decent outcomes, it all looks pretty unnecessary and unfair. This dodgy approach by the government shows they have no credibility on this issue. The minister knows that the government's own memorandum to the small business and other measures bill of 2001 pointed out that only 180,000 small businesses operate in the federal industrial system, not 1.5 million—not even 1 million.
Moreover, the minister knows that, in the period 2000-01, only 8,109 unfair dismissal applications were made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That is a long way from 50,000. He also knows that there is no evidence that loss of jobs in small business or failure to employ by small business is in any way linked to fair or unfair dismissal legislation. The Federal Court, in the case already mentioned, reached the conclusion that: 
In the absence of any evidence about the matter, it seems to us the suggestion of a relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven.
So why does the government still persist with this legislative ping-pong? One reason could be that it wants to see more workers covered by federal awards, and that fits with my understanding of this government's intention. At present the federal legislation, when compared with state legislation, is by far the most difficult for an employee who has experienced unfair dismissal. Access and chances of success are certainly limited under federal legislation. So perhaps the real aim is to make it tougher still for workers to have their basic rights to fair and decent treatment in the workplace enforced or upheld. But we must remember that this is a tough government, particularly when it comes to those who need the protection of government the most. 
If our laws are not tough enough, according to the minister, then how do they stack up against the rest of the world? This question was recently answered by the OECD in a report on the Australian labour market. It noted that Australia has consistently come out as one of the countries with the least stringent employment protection legislation of all OECD countries. An initial ranking in the OECD Jobs Study placed Australia in the bottom quintile in terms of employment protection legislation strictness. Australia was ranked particularly low on procedural requirements in cases of individual dismissal and on the criteria given for unfair dismissal as well. The OECD also noted that there are relatively low legal requirements in our country for notice periods and no requirements for tenure related severance pay in the case of individual dismissal. The 1994 Jobs Study reported that the `easy to dismiss' countries of the 21 assessed were, in order, the United States of America, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. When they updated this information in 2001, we were still in the bottom five. This means that, compared to the other major countries in the world, it is relatively easy to dismiss people in Australia, whatever the size of the business.
What other reasons could there be to justify the minister's obsession with this legislation? Why is he such a strong advocate for the need for this legislation? Why does he add it to every media release he sends out when visiting electorates around the country, calling on Labor members of parliament to support this legislation if they care about small business and jobs?  It is not really very difficult to explain the reason for this obsession, even though I am a relatively new member of parliament. Before this year is even out, the hidden political agendas that permeate this government's program are sadly predictable. What legislation does the government hold onto for possible double dissolution triggers? Workplace relations and immigration stick out like the proverbial sore thumb. Why would that be? This government is not just trigger happy; this government also thinks that unionism and the problem of asylum seekers are the bogeymen for the electorate, so its very own bogeymen play the fear cards as often as they can—fear cards that divide communities and thrive on intolerance, envy, hatred and disunity. This approach has to stop, particularly in light of the recent tragic events that we have had to endure. We need legislation that builds on our strengths, not legislation such as this that compromises our Australian principles of fairness and decency.
I oppose this legislation but, in responding to this debate, I want to put forward the reasons for that opposition. The key ALP reasons for opposition to this bill, and to other legislation in this ongoing saga, have been put forward many times, but I am happy to state them again. After all, this type of legislation has been before the House seven times. We believe that the basic rights of all employees ought to be the same, irrespective of the size of their employer. There is no excuse for any government in this country to put forward legislation based on such a dreadful and unjust ethos that takes rights away from one group. Any legislation to assist small business should be based on positive strategies such as initiatives that support the availability of well-trained employees, advice and training in human resource management for those in small business, taxation compliance and start-up funding assistance, support for small business networks and the development of regional strategies that reflect local small business needs in their own local market. These are the measures that a government would introduce if it had a genuine commitment to improving outcomes for small business. Sadly, this legislation has no such positive measures.
We on this side of the House know that there is no evidence to support claims that the federal unfair dismissal laws have acted as a significant brake on employment growth. We understand that statutory exclusions from the unfair dismissal regime are already quite significant and that the case for further exemptions specifically directed to small business fails to take these into account. I remind the House that changes to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission procedures, including those mandated during the life of the last parliament by way of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Act 2001, more than adequately addressed any legitimate small business concerns. Those of us who are genuinely involved with small business in our electorates know that federal unfair dismissal laws are well down the list of small business concerns. Small businesses are more concerned with correctly filling out their BAS forms than with dismissal laws and their requirements.
The proposed exclusions in this current legislation are out of step with relevant overseas practice and are potentially also at odds with Australia's international treaty obligations. Very few countries exempt small businesses from unfair dismissal laws, except tough and punitive ones like the one that put this legislation forward. We believe that sufficient legislation has already been enacted and that this particular piece of legislation is uncalled for. But, for me, the most important reason for opposing this bill is that it does nothing to actually create jobs in small businesses or to provide the climate for jobs growth that is so much needed in regions around Australia. As the member for Newcastle, creating employment in small and big business is the No. 1 item on my political agenda.
I would like to share with the House the contributions to the job creation debate by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on his recent visits to Newcastle. On the first occasion that Minister Abbott visited Newcastle this year, he told the region we should `keep talking it up' and eventually our unemployment situation would be solved. We wish it were that easy. On his visit to Newcastle the week before last, he tried to tell us that, if small business had the power to unfairly dismiss workers, our economy and employment would improve. `Rubbish!' was the response of Newcastle. This government has never proven any link between what it says about small business not hiring people and unfair dismissal laws. In my electorate, where small business has excellent representation through the Newcastle and Hunter Business Chamber, the Small Business Association and the Hunter Business Women's Network, just to name a few, I have not received a single representation from small business in Newcastle to suggest that this is a major problem for them.
The best way to help small business in Newcastle and in the Hunter region is to get people into work so that they have more disposable income to spend in small businesses. In my city, almost 20,000 people are unemployed and 40,000 people have health care cards. These people do not have extra money to spend in small or large businesses. After seven years of the Howard government, the mantra of `Blame the union' does not wash with us anymore. To assist small business in Newcastle, instead of unfair dismissal legislation the government should invest in job creation programs. We have plenty of those on offer: projects such as the Protech Steel venture, the Energy Australia redevelopment of the stadium and the multipurpose terminal for our port. The government perhaps should fund regional infrastructure projects so that our region can better compete. It should fund special education and training programs to make sure our youth are skilled for the jobs of the future. By creating jobs and getting more people into work, small business in Newcastle will certainly be the winner. In opposing this legislation, I encourage the government to genuinely take on the task of assisting small business by creating job growth in regions with continuing high unemployment, where small business is suffering the most.
I welcome and support the amendments put forward by the shadow minister for workplace relations. These amendments include positive strategies to really do something to help small business in the area of employment negotiations. The amendments include the removal of legal costs in the initial conciliation phase, so that negotiated resolution is encouraged. The amendments also give more encouragement to the Industrial Relations Commission to reject claims for damages rather than claims that seek the continuation of employment. They would enable the registration of paid agents operating under a code of conduct and would reduce the vested interest aspect of litigation. The amendments propose sensible time frames and the use of information systems and technologies that reduce the travel burden on parties involved in hearings. The opposition's amendments also target better information and education about dismissal management. Of course, the best way to avoid dismissal management is by putting in place successful performance improvement programs and conflict resolution programs. But the legislation before us has no suggestions of this kind or support for initiatives such as these. The arguments put forward by the government for this unnecessary and unjustified legislation are flawed and quite spurious. Again, it is a time for governments that lead, not for governments that shelter in the politics of disunity and inequality. I oppose the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2].",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—It is my very great pleasure to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This is going to be the beacon that stands out in the electorate demonstrating why the Labor Party are not connected to business and to the people who work in business. We have just seen the Labor Party go through the biggest mixer in their history—the first time in the history of this parliament that a Labor leader has lost the seat of Cunningham. The opposition leader, Mr Crean, came out and said, `We have got to start connecting with the public. We have got to start listening to what the people want. We have got to start letting them tell us what they need rather than having us tell them.' And what do they do? They stand up in this place and they say, after voting against this 14 times, `No, we are not going to support this.'
This is the biggest no-brainer that the Labor Party have come up with in the history of their opposition to things in this country—other than their opposition to the GST, and we know what happened with the GST. The Labor Party opposed the GST for three elections. Wasn't it magnificent? Keating opposed it, and Beazley opposed it twice. It took the Labor Party three times to get it through their thick skulls that they were on a loser. They are on a loser again, because unfair dismissal laws in this country are fair for the people the Labor Party purport to represent, because they will give them jobs. The Labor Party go on with all this social, class warfare stuff—`We can't allow them to be exposed to this and that'. This has nothing to do with fairness; it has everything to do with the fact that the Labor Party are wedded at the hip and tied by the ankle to the union movement. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, they are tied hand and glove to the union movement, so they cannot move on issues like this.
The quote is: `The risk of being poor is greater for those out of work'. Let us understand this: if you do not have a job in this country, you have a greater chance of being poor. What is the alternative? Work for the Dole is a good program, but it is certainly not as good as having a job. Welfare payments? No, that is not good; that is not having a job. The greatest thing you can do for a person in this country is give them a job. The Labor Party complain and say, `There's a chance of people being dismissed from their work under these unfair dismissal laws.' To be dismissed, you have to have a job first. How do you get knocked out of a job if you do not have one? This is a no-brainer on the part of the Labor Party. They have lost the plot. They have lost contact with the electorate and they have lost contact with small business.
The Labor Party have never been supporters of small business in this country. In fact, they see the small business community of this country as their enemy. Why? Because they cannot control it. They cannot control small business because they cannot mandate people into a union. Most of the members opposite in this House have either been members of unions or come from union backgrounds. We are told that they are all members of unions in any case, because you cannot be a member of the Labor Party unless you join a union. Talk about fifty-fifty! Fifty-fifty means five bob each way. The Labor Party cannot have it in this case because they are all members of unions. As a result, they have blinkered views in relation to these matters.
Because it is not the constituency of the Labor Party, the Labor Party have always burnt small business. You can see that with Mr Hawke's accord. The accord had nothing to do with creating a greater number of jobs for workers; the accord was about how to control the workers in conjunction with the unions—how to actually marshal the workers into the union's jurisdictions. That was what happened under the marvellous accord. When you look at the results of the accord, you see that we had an unemployment rate of over 11 per cent, and youth unemployment went through the roof—and there were all the social and economic spin-offs from that in this country. It was a tragedy, but the Labor Party keep mouthing these words about jobs for young people, jobs for people in business and job creation. We know that the only jobs they created were the $60,000 type jobs that Mr Crean created under his great Working Nation policy, which did nothing—`Bill Hunter, job ready, here we are.' None of it was productive, there was not much of a training element to it at all, and as a result unemployment in this country blew out to the levels we know about.
We have had all these hypocritical platitudes from the Labor Party in terms of looking after the workers, but we know in this country—and I have said it here many times—that the Labor Party are not interested in looking after the workers; they are interested in looking after the elites in the union movement. And how do they do that? They do that by making sure they get a heap of union dues. And how do they get a heap of union dues? They make sure that they all join the union. Unfortunately for the Labor Party, many of the people working for these small businesses with fewer than 20 people are casual employees, and because they are casuals many of them do not belong to a union. Many of them are schoolkids who are in part-time jobs et cetera and do not want to be part of a union. They work at the deli down the corner, help out at the garden centre down the road or work at the bread shop on a Saturday morning. They do not want to be a member of a union. So, of course, they are not people the Labor Party and their mates in the union movement really want to foster—because they are not part of their controlled group.
But, in comparison, let us have a look at one of the things that the government has done for jobs. In the building industry in Western Australia, for example, we see much of the building being done by subcontractors, and yet—talking about the way generic Labor treat the small business man, or the subcontractor, in this case—Labor were not opposed to the fact that these subcontractors were going to be locked into a bad tax regime, the 80-20 rule. Let us look even further at small business operators in Western Australia who employ fewer than 20 people. Mr Kobelke, the state Labor minister, recently did a little deal—quite publicly, believe it or not—with the big end of town. Building companies like BGC, J-Corp and Dale Alcock, the largest builders in Perth, have been given a guarantee or a surety that they will not face building indemnity problems. But what about the small subcontractors? There is no such indemnity from the state government. You might ask what this has to do with unfair dismissal laws. What it has to do with unfair dismissal laws is this: the small contractors who employ this handful of people are not getting the same treatment from a Labor government that is very wedded to the union movement in Western Australia.
We are saying that under federal law we would like to see a template for legislation which would provide fair dismissal. What is the alternative? We now have six Labor states controlling their labour laws. Let us have a look at what was brought in recently in Western Australia under the new Labor regime there. Maybe this is what the federal Labor Party would have liked to have seen happen if they had won the last election. Where there used to be a 28-day period to lodge a claim for being unfairly dismissed, they now have no sunset clause. No-one has actually said what the sunset period is on an unfair dismissal claim in the Western Australian state Labor jurisdiction. It is certainly not 28 days like it used to be. Is it the statute of limitations—six or seven years? Does that mean that six years later you can come along and say, `I recall that when I was employed at the kebab shop around the corner they were quite unfair to me and, as a result, I'm going to lodge a claim.' The bloke might have onsold his business and moved on, but he is still subject to a claim from somebody who has decided he is fair game for unfair dismissal prosecution.
The member for Newcastle said nobody knocks on her door about unfair dismissal. I have people knocking all the time and saying, `I would employ more people, especially young kids, if I didn't have to put up with being worried that, if I employ them and they do something wrong at my place, I can't do anything about them without it costing me a poultice.' There was even a case—as I mentioned when I last spoke on the bill—where somebody who had not even started the job put in a claim. He had been given verbal notice by the bloke who ran the fruit and veg part of a small supermarket. The bloke said, `Yes, you can start Monday,' but he did not start on Monday. He turned up on Monday and said he was not going to start and then he lodged an unfair dismissal claim. Of course, it was thrown out of court, but the owner of the business still had to go in and contest the claim because it had been lodged.
What do these sorts of claims cost? With legal fees, time off work and all the compliance that goes with them, they cost a minimum of $3,000 to contest. As they go on, many of these claims cost $8,000 or $10,000. The claim by many is, `I put it in because they said I would at least get something out of it; they said that there was a couple of grand in it for me.' It is disgraceful that the Labor Party continue to oppose a set of laws that would tidy up this rort which stops people being employed in the small businesses of this country.
There are plenty of checks and balances in this bill. We have already said that it applies only to businesses with under 20 employees. That is because of the definition of small business. I heard someone from the Labor Party saying, `I know a girl who was pregnant who was told that, because she was pregnant, she was going to lose her job.' That is just not true. It is not true at all. This legislation does not take away the elements of the law that relate to unlawful termination. Under the unlawful termination laws of this country, you cannot dismiss somebody for things like that, but you can dismiss somebody who has been stealing from you, not turning up or doing things that would be detrimental to the reputation of your business. You are not going to dismiss somebody because they have a disability or a sickness. You are certainly not going to dismiss apprentices.
The Labor Party have even said, `Under this legislation, apprentices and trainees will lose their positions.' That is absolutely not true. Enshrined in this legislation is the fact that apprentices and trainees will not be dismissed. In fact, they have very great protection. We are the party that wants to increase the number of apprenticeships and traineeships in this country. If you recall the speech I made the other day, I said that, under the Howard government, apprenticeship positions in this country have gone from 105,000 a year to 334,000. That is more than a doubling of the number of apprenticeships in this country. Compare that to what the Labor Party in government were doing: running down the skilled work force of this country. We are not going to put traineeships and apprenticeships in this country in jeopardy. We are about making it easier to employ these people. You will make it easier to employ people if you first of all give them a job.
One of the reasons we have a low unemployment rate in this country is that we have been able to get through a lot of workplace reforms. Throughout the world, people have acknowledged that the Australian work force has become far more productive. That has a lot to do with work force flexibility—to the extent that you can make arrangements through workplace bargaining rather than through collective bargaining, which is what the unions are endeavouring to take us back to now. So, for example, owners of the seaside restaurants at Cottesloe have flexibility if they cannot pay award rates of double time and triple time just because it is a Sunday. You would have heard the one about the old wharfies' picnic where the wharfie begins to tell his grand-daughter a bedtime story, saying, `Once upon a time-and-a-half.' That is almost endemic in the way they think. 
Flexibility gives young people the opportunity to get a job. You can make arrangements with your employer, creating a flexible work force which will suit both the employee and employer. Some people do not want full-time work. As I said, some people are students and some people are parents who want to work part time. People wish to make their own arrangements. Flexibility gives rise to greater productivity in the work force.
So that people do not have to go off and employ their relatives and friends in their businesses because they are too frightened to employ somebody from the work force, I suggest that the Labor Party get their heads out of the ideological trough, get up, get some air and see what the people of Australia really think about providing the opportunity of jobs to young people. I say this in light of the fact that those around this country who are taking their TEE are going to be finished shortly. A lot of young people will be wanting to get part-time work in small businesses—in local hardware stores or on lawn-mowing rounds et cetera. They will want to actually go and get these jobs and make sure that they can have some work before and after Christmas, during their holidays, and maybe as flow-on jobs after leaving school. As a result of Labor opposing these laws, we are going to see those young kids denied those opportunities.
The member for Newcastle was trying to decry the sort of research that has been done, but the research has been well done over years and years, and information from it shows that in my electorate, for example, one in five small businesses, given the opportunity of having these laws taken away, would employ another person. If they did not have the Damocles sword of unfair dismissal hanging over their heads, they would each employ one more person. In Canning where there is high youth unemployment and over 3,000 businesses, one in five equates to something like an extra 600 jobs. I want to see the Labor Party get its act together, get behind the government, especially in the run-up to Christmas, and get ideology and union control off its back, so that ultimately young people—in Australia generally and in my electorate of Canning particularly—will have the opportunity to get a job in the run-up to Christmas and after.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I am participating in the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] for a second occasion. I am somewhat surprised that the government continues to bring into this chamber bills that are fundamentally in disagreement with very basic notions of fair play and justice. Labor has already outlined its inability to support the government's so-called `fair dismissal bill' and does so on the grounds of important and fundamental principles.
I want to refer to three of those principles. The first is the general principle that it is a fundamental right of all Australian workers not to be dismissed unfairly from employment without recourse or remedy. The second principle that guides our position in this debate is the belief in the notion of a fair go all round—that is, in balancing the needs of employers, we also must balance fairness and justice for those who are employed. The third basic principle that we uphold in Australia is that all Australian citizens are equal before the law—put simply, that our laws, in whatever form they appear, should be applied equally to all, without fear or favour.
When you look at the contents of what the government is proposing, the outcomes offend against those basic tenets and principles. Essentially, the government is trying to deprive a very large group of employees in small workplaces of a statutory right to seek remedy against unfair dismissal. In our estimation, if the government's agenda were to see the light of day, an estimated 700,000 employees covered by federal awards would be deprived of this very fundamental right. The government's bill would also see an outcome where we would potentially create two classes of citizens in the one workplace with different rights of recourse against unfair dismissal. For example, in a small manufacturing plant in my electorate, clerical workers in the office might be covered by a state award and continue to have redress and recourse through the state system, whereas the tradespeople employed under a federal award in a small enterprise would have no recourse. So within the same enterprise you would create two classes of citizens with different rights under Australian law. The third outcome would be very much like a lottery, depending on whether you happened to work in an enterprise that met the magical figure. If you were employed in a small workplace of 21 people, you would retain your rights to redress, but if the number of employees happened to fall under the magical number of 20 and you were one of 19 employees, you would have no rights at all. It is very clear that the outcomes proposed in the government's bill would fundamentally run up against very basic principles the Australian community supports—that is, that all our citizens should be equal before the law, that everyone—employers and employees—should be given a fair go and that if you are unfairly dismissed there ought to be some recourse or remedy.
As I indicated in speaking on this bill when it was first introduced into this chamber, it reeks of Orwellian doublespeak. It is called a fair dismissal bill but there is nothing fair about what is proposed. What is fair about discriminating against a class of employees because they just happen to work in a small workplace? What is fair about providing one employee with a different set of rights from another? In the example I mentioned, this can include employees working at the same enterprise. What is fair about removing the safety net for employees, often those in the most vulnerable employment situation? What is fair about eroding job security at a time when we all know there is growing insecurity? And, fundamentally, what is fair about denying workers redress for capricious sacking? We have all been around long enough to know that, unfortunately, capricious sacking does at times occur. To cut to the quick, the government's bill would mean that there would be no remedy if you were unjustly sacked and you happened to work in a small enterprise. It is as simple and blunt as that.
In the course of the debate on the government's proposals, along with a lot of people on this side of the chamber I have looked to find some answers to very legitimate arguments that have been raised by small business about costs and procedures. I have no doubt that, not just in this area but in many areas of government law, the impacts of conforming with legislative decisions can very often be much more onerous for small business. It is the case that in many small businesses there is nobody with particular expertise in industrial relations or human resource management. So on this side of the chamber we have taken on board what small business has said and we have looked at how we might build some proposals and policies that take into account the argument about costs and procedures.
I think it is fair to say that, in accordance with concerns that have been expressed, the member for Hotham introduced a new bill on 26 August which in a very practical and pragmatic way went to the issue of the possibility of lowering costs associated with unfair dismissal procedures. The bill also looked at means of simplifying procedures and reducing the uncertainty and confusion that sometimes genuinely exists and that sometimes is pretty much driven by the ideological agenda of a government that is not, in my judgment, interested in looking for pragmatic and practical outcomes but is really playing this debate out on political and ideological grounds. We looked for practical solutions to address real and identifiable problems. In my own area, I consulted with the Illawarra Business Chamber to seek their views about how we might streamline procedures and reduce costs, and I am very pleased to say that several of their constructive proposals have been incorporated into Labor's response to this bill. I will deal with that a little bit later. Interestingly enough, too, there was a strong belief expressed by the business chamber and, I think, by other employer organisations that there was duplication of procedures and processes on a state by state basis. They have argued a solid case for harmonisation of unfair dismissal laws across state jurisdictions, but laws that are underpinned by a principled belief in the notion of a fair go.
The bill that was introduced by the member for Hotham not so long ago was driven by a genuine desire to fix a problem—that is, a problem that is perceived across a range of small businesses about costs and complexity. The minister's failure to take on board the suggestions that have been proposed by the leader of the ALP and by the shadow Attorney-General in his moving of the amendment surely highlights the fact that the minister's agenda is not driven by finding a solution to a problem but rather is driven by ideology and by assertions about the likely impact on employment growth if fundamental rights are withdrawn from workers. But again—and I think others have argued this quite substantially—the minister's assertion, whether it be that 52,000 jobs will be created or 50,000, is an assertion. It is not based on fact; it is hypothetical and it is a supposition. I think there have been many arguments that have demolished the premise on which that assertion is made.
Most members on our side of the chamber are driven by wanting to find a situation that provides a fair balance for all—a fair go all round. It is particularly important where I live, because 91 per cent of businesses in the Illawarra employ fewer than 20 workers. In total, that is around 14,368 small businesses that play an incredibly vital role in our regional economy and are themselves a substantial motor of employment growth. It is one thing to bolster, protect and enhance the ongoing viability of those small businesses and do what we can to ensure they succeed and flourish, but no small business person that I have spoken to believes that all this should be done at the expense of taking away fundamental rights of workers in their workplaces. I think, in general, there is a belief in the Australian community in the notion of a fair go all round. The test is how to find that balance. I argue that Labor's approach and the amendment that has been proposed by the shadow Attorney-General go to this issue of ensuring that genuine concerns are dealt with on a genuine basis.
I want to talk about some of those concerns and the constructive proposals that we have made, because they need to be addressed by government if the government is to convince small business that it is looking for solutions rather than relying on rhetoric and ideology in this debate. As I said earlier, we make the point that small business has said to us that it would like a situation where there is a reduction in cost and delays, and procedures are addressed. Labor have put forward a convincing response to that, and our proposals would keep those that we refer to as the `ambulance chaser' lawyers out of the equation, and consultants and paid agents out of conciliation talks. We also believe there should be a far greater emphasis on conciliation, with the parties directly involved in the dispute trying to reach a genuine outcome under the auspices of the commission. We think that the emphasis should be placed on reinstatement rather than on financial claims because we think this will reduce the incentive, particularly by ambulance chaser lawyers, to run speculative actions. In the overwhelming majority of cases—I am not saying in all cases—the motive must be to seek reinstatement. The system should not be there for financial recompense at the expense of a genuine desire to be reinstated when one has been unfairly and unjustly dismissed. We have also said in terms of length of proceedings that we ought to move towards the provision of indicative time frames for the resolution of unfair dismissal proceedings. It was not long ago in this House that many on our side of the chamber posed questions to the minister about the inordinate time that it had taken to deal with the unfair dismissal claims on behalf of workers employed by Rio Tinto in the Hunter Valley. From memory, I think some of those proceedings took around four years to resolve. I think it is a great shame on this government that there are proceedings involving workers at the Blair Athol coalmine that are still unresolved some four years down the track. Our proposals come up with practical solutions to the issue of cost reductions and delays that many small businesses have referred to in submissions.
Secondly—and this is an area where I am pleased that some of the input I had from the local business chamber has seen its way into Labor's response—there is a need for the commission to take into account time and distance constraints for businesses, particularly small businesses, which might be involved in unfair dismissal proceedings. I think the suggestion we have made about a greater use of telephone and videoconferencing procedures is a positive step in the right direction and one that should be seriously considered on the merits of the argument that has been put to you. Lastly, surveys have shown that many small businesses remain somewhat confused and uncertain about procedures and processes, particularly as state jurisdictions and their processes vary not just on a state by state basis but between state and federal jurisdictions. I think the government has exploited some of those genuine aspects of confusion because it suits its political agenda and response on this matter.
An information package for business and workers that would outline rights, processes and procedures is a very constructive thing to suggest. But, in reality, the principles of fairness in termination of employment can be fairly simply stated. If you tease out a lot of the hyperbole and rhetoric that we hear from the minister, the case can be stated quite simply, both to businesses and to employees. In the case of an employee who is performing at an unsatisfactory standard, the employee should be given a reasonable opportunity to improve their performance. In the case of an employee who the employer believes has engaged in misconduct, the employee should be given a reasonable opportunity of responding to any allegations against him or her. And in the case of a dismissal arising from the operational requirements of the business, the employer should consult with the employee regarding the proposed changes and provide the opportunity to explore any alternatives to dismissal. It is pretty basic and pretty simple.
It is not the case, as this government and the minister like to suggest, that `fair dismissal' means the employer is always wrong and is forced to pay `go away' money when an employee complains that they were sacked unfairly. Nor should it be the case, as appears to be the government's wish, that `fair dismissal' means an employee is instantly expendable and should be grateful simply to have a job. That is the kind of hidden message that is behind many of the statements that we hear from the minister and from government members. We believe the government could and should be playing a constructive role in helping both employers and employees understand and implement very simple principles of fairness in relation to potential termination of employment.
The government keeps coming back to this chamber with legislation that is obviously driven by a political and ideological agenda. If it is not, one is yet to hear a reasoned argument against the amendments that have been proposed by the shadow Attorney-General and those principles that were enunciated in the private member's bill brought to this House by the member for Hotham. Labor's approach is both principled and pragmatic, and I think you can have both. You can have fundamental principles that underpin a legislative package which is both reasonable and pragmatic and which provides practical solutions to genuine issues of concern that have been raised by the small business community. Labor's approach shows that fairness can be maintained and that we can adhere to fundamental principles and to the notion of a fair go all round, while at the same time improvements can be made to the system of dealing with unfair dismissal claims. Again, I want to state that a strong feeling of support was garnered when I had discussions with the business community about the need for harmonisation of unfair dismissal laws and regimes across state boundaries.
In conclusion, I think the government is again bringing to this House legislation motivated by ideology and by politics, based on some unstated and hypothetical assumptions about the nirvana that will come in terms of employment growth if rights were taken away from workers who, just by chance, work in a small enterprise. It offends against fundamental principles; it offends the notion of a fair go all round. It is for that reason that the opposition continues to argue against and to seek amendments to the legislation.

"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I wish to endorse the sentiments and the arguments of the previous speaker for the opposition, the member for Throsby, in her speech on the bill before us tonight, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I point out that the sense of balance, the sense of certainty and the entirely sensible approach to sorting through the issues with regard to the bill and the issues in the work force that she pointed to in her arguments throughout that speech—also the initiative the member for Throsby took in discussing with the business community in her electorate practical steps towards making the situation for people in small business even fairer than it has been in the past—have been grounded in her experience at the industrial level, not only in the early part of her career but of course in the latter part. It is a demonstration that people who are professionally involved in conflict resolution, people who are professionally involved in the Arbitration and Conciliation Commission, can bring to this House a deliberative sense that is also a constructive approach to solving issues between employers and employees. That is in contrast to the minister and the former minister, who do not bring a constructive approach to these matters but a destructive one; who do not bring a balanced, sensible, fair, reasonable and open attitude towards these matters but an ideologically driven one.
This bill has been before this House, in one slightly amended form or another, seven times. Doesn't the minister finally get the message about this bill—not once rejected but twice rejected, as I expect it will be in this form? It has been more than three months since its first introduction in this parliament. After this bill has been passed in this place and goes back to the Senate, I do not expect the Senate to endorse it, because the Senate previously passed the bill but with a series of amendments. The government refused to take on any of those amendments because they did not suit the basic tenor of their approach.
The minister was for some time—almost formally, I suppose, because he was a junior minister—a trainee of, or an apprentice to, former Minister Reith. I do not think there has been much change from 1996 onwards, whoever the minister has been, in the government's approach to these issues. It does no service to anyone in small business, whether employer or employee, to keep batting on in the way the government are, because there is no solution. This bill has been before this House seven times in one form or another—passed here, because the coalition is in government, but knocked over in the Senate. Those in the Senate are not completely silly. They have a series of reasons why they knocked the bill back previously, and these reasons are cogent. They essentially go to the question of whether or not the people who work for small businesses, medium businesses or large businesses—as long as they are Australians who have employment in Australia—should be given a fair go. They also think there should be a fair go for employers. They also have a basic understanding of the history behind all this and of the agenda. This government's agenda is not one that is sane, rational, sensible, cogent and coherent; it is an agenda that is utterly politically and electorally driven.
We have had different thematic approaches from 1996 to 1998 and then from 1998 to 2001. Throughout that time the former minister displayed the thread of a certain approach to industrial relations issues. There was the drive towards what the member for Throsby indicated would be the anticipated nirvana of the government, as it was during the time that they were in opposition, of having the great second wave in industrial relations come to save Australia. If it were not for the unions, if it were not for those terrible senators who will not pass this stuff and if it were not for the fact that the government cannot get a clean sweep in IR, everything would be absolutely perfect in the industrial relations garden.
It beggars belief that, after seven goes at this, the government would not sit down and say, `We can run with this as a trigger for a double dissolution. We can expect to make it as difficult as possible in the Senate, but we will have that trigger there because we know we will not get the bill through.' But you would think that, having met resistance for so long, they would say, `We should sit down and work out whether or not we are in fact being reasonable, sane, sensible and constructive in the measures we are attempting to put forward or whether there might not in fact be something fundamentally flawed at the base of what we are putting forward.' You need a rational government to do that, and in this area they are irrational, insane and insensible.
I think two things are driving them. One is the fact that, for some small business people, there is this issue of being able to tell someone, `You are gone. You are out the door, and I do not want any argument from you.' That is actually how some people want industrial relations to operate in the work force. But it is only a very small percentage of small business owners who would like to run their businesses that way. In the 19th century, I suppose a lot of businesses were run that way. When the Master and Servant Act was in full operation, you were either in or out. Where there were no protections provided by the British parliament or the colonial parliaments here, people did not have much recourse but to accept the conditions available to them or be put out the door, unless they were backed by the nascent unions in the second half of the 19th century or by other associations that developed into different forms of union groupings over time. Some of those succeeded in Britain and some succeeded here, but essentially it was the development of the unions and the leagues that led to them. Unless they had that kind of protection—and it was little enough in those days—they could only accept the provisions of the Master and Servant Act, which said, `You follow these instructions or you are out.'
Even in Great Britain—the place where the industrial revolution bit deepest and the place that gave rise to the reaction that Marx and Engels encompassed in the Communist Manifesto and the rest of the stuff they wrote that was based on how badly downtrodden the workers were when capitalism was untrammelled and not constrained by the national parliaments—I think they finally got the message that they might get a more productive work force if they were a bit fairer with people and if people were more evenly treated. We have seen in Britain, the United States and Australia over more than a century a battle between labour and capital. We have seen a battle that has taken place in the factories and on the streets. You have only to think of the enormous trauma that occurred in the United States in the 1930s, particularly in relation to the Ford company and the attitude that Henry Ford took. Workers were killed in the streets because they were protesting against what the Ford company determined to do, and there was an attempt to use government and police force to crush union protest at changes in work conditions. These changes were dramatic because the Great Depression had such immense depth and scope that people were potentially in the position of being put back into a situation similar to what they faced previously under the Master and Servant Act.
Capitalism has never liked people aggregating and trying to work towards getting some protection and improvement with regard to their working conditions. However, in the late 20th century and into the 21st century we expect that, even with a conservative government like this one—it is not a liberal government; it is a conservative one—the penny will drop and it will understand that, if you give people a better go, you might get more out of them in terms of productivity and profitability. The government should not approach things on the basis of `us and them'. This harsh, repressive and conservative ideological approach was counterweighted in the 19th century by Marxism. There are two opposing attitudes here: one takes the old 19th century conservative high Tory approach, and the other takes the harsh line of full communism. We can do without all of that; there is enough experience on the ground to indicate that that is not the way to go.
After seven goes at this bill and after changing it in a number of ways—I do not know how many times I have spoken on this bill; the member for Brisbane has spoken on it a number of times as have most people in the chamber during the 6½ years I have been here—you would expect some fundamental reassessment. This is the leitmotiv of this parliament. Having failed under the member for Flinders to get a one job lot first wave totally in place, the government had a second wave—as they had in Western Australia at the state level. The elements of the former minister's bill have been broken up, and we have a job lot of different bills being put before the parliament again, having been rejected by the Senate. This will be only the first of the double dissolution triggers. More importantly, breaking the bills up creates the effect of a cascading, fragmented collision of legislation, which is meant to give the impression that the problems in the industrial area are so enormous and so great. The only problem with the government's argument is that the economy is running pretty well. Every day they tell us that the economy is running pretty well and that people are being productive and working hard, yet at the same time they keep saying, `If only they'd let these bills through there would be a flood of tens of thousands of new jobs.' 
Fundamentally, I cannot understand—I could not understand it the first time I spoke on this bill, or the second time, and I still cannot understand it this time—how they actually think they can create jobs at the small business level by sacking people instead of investing some time and effort into getting the best work out of people. Labor have never said that, if people are not doing their job properly, it is not possible for them to be sacked. It has always been the case, from start to finish, that if people are doing poorly or not working hard the employer can put forward the case. We have made changes to our industrial relations approach, as needed, over time. It was found that, if you wanted to look for practical, pragmatic, sensible solutions, the best thing you could do was to talk to the workers and the employers and try to get them to improve the legislation you were putting before the House. If you took that kind of approach and made the modifications that the member for Hotham and our shadow ministers have suggested, both this time and previously, you would get a more workable situation at the small business level. 
I know for some employers that this is like a spur in the foot. It niggles away at them that they cannot just give people the flick and get rid of them at no cost whatsoever. For some employers, their experience in the past has been that they have had employees who they thought merited being given the flick, they have had a strong and substantial case against them and they have found that the process of going through a dismissal and the actions after that have been far too extended, far too costly and far too difficult. In particular, some small business people just give up and do not really try, which can then result in lower productivity because the employer cannot solve the situation at the workplace level. 
In our amendments, we have recognised that the centralised mode of hearings has been very difficult for people in regional Australia. Our amendments went to the fact that there should be a much more flexible hearing process so that people in regional and rural Australia could solve the problems they have with employees who are considered to be not doing the right thing. The tribunal would go to them rather than them losing time, money and business by having to go to Sydney or Melbourne to sort things out. 
Fundamentally, we know this: if you adopt a set of proposals and put them before the parliament, not to try to sort things out in the relations between workers and the people providing employment but just to drive an ideological agenda, you can only expect to get knocked over in the Senate. If a government minister were prepared to come to this table and say, `Let's have a fair look at what is being proposed in the amendments from the Labor Party and others in the Senate, work out what we can and cannot accept in this and determine a median way,' you could get a bill through that would sort out some of the underlying key problems that Labor recognises are still large in the minds of people, and you could do it on a fair basis. Unless the government are willing to do that, I do not think they are going to get these bills through. We might have to return to the fact that, time after time and year after year, with a different name and a different framework, these parts of the original whole will be thrown back into the place. 
It is not good enough to make the assertion that there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake in this bill. That has been stated in this place, and the government has wasted a lot of time before the Federal Court attempting to run that agenda. The Federal Court came back in the Hamzy case and said that the government was being unreasonable, that this was not the approach to take and that it was unfounded. These are assertions and allegations; they have not been proved. There has been no research at all into this area. Whether it was Professor Wooden, whom they relied upon in the Hamzy case, or whether it was Kayoko Tsumori from the Centre for Independent Studies asserting that there would be an employment gain, the background brief this time around points out, as it did last time, that actually employment has been fairly strong. And it is fairly strong now.
I think it was 1994 when the first set of unfair dismissal laws was brought into this place by Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, when he was minister. Most people in the coalition and most people within the business community would think that that was the time when these laws were most rigid. The legislation had just been introduced and there was not the flexibility the minister later introduced when, having heard what the business community and the workers were saying, modifications were made. Even at the point in time when the laws were introduced, the employment argument did not work. At the time the laws were strongest, employment growth was also very strong. That was pointed out by the Federal Court. If you want to put an assertion forward, let us have some evidence for it. Let us have an evidence based approach instead of an approach that is irrational, not thought out, ideologically driven and simply assertive.
The minister, from here until the end of this parliament, can continue with this bill and the other legion of bills that he has. It may suit his own purposes and his party's purposes to run in this way, but it will not help one small business employer in this country. They have been done a disservice ever since 1996, when the tag on this was `unfair dismissal', as it was in 1994 when the bill was originally introduced and when the notions were originally introduced. It does not do the minister any good to outdo the former member for Flinders in this area and enter the deep Orwellian world of doublespeak, newspeak and all of those other fashions that I have argued about previously in relation to this bill. You cannot just turn something on its head and make it its opposite. What is unfair cannot be made fair because the minister wants to put an argument, twist words or twist associations.
If the government were fair, sane, sensible, reasonable, constructive and rational in regard to this, these measures would pass, if amended appropriately. If the government were willing to take on the balanced and sensible amendments that Labor has put up, we would get an outcome that is fair and equal not only for small business but for the people they employ. It is very simple for the minister to do it. All he has to do is change his tack, stop being political about it, stop being ideological about it, be rational and sane, and seek a solution within the workplace that is fair, reasonable, open, constructive and cogent for everyone involved.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I want to cut straight to the chase in respect of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] because it has been around this parliament too many times. The bill is fundamentally flawed. It is inherently unjust, and that is why this parliament has, on seven occasions, rejected it in the last six years. We should have no misunderstandings about this: when I say the parliament, I do not mean simply the Labor Party. The Labor Party has certainly opposed this bill on every occasion, as it should be opposed. Most of the parties in the Senate have opposed it as well, which is why the government have not been able to get passage of the bill. The simple fact is that—as much as the government like to package the debate on this bill in their usual union-bashing rhetoric—this bill has not enjoyed the support of the Senate at any point in the process since the government were first elected in 1996, whether it was embedded in broader legislation, such as the then minister Peter Reith's first-wave laws, or whether it was separated as a bill in its own right. The reason for that is clear and straightforward: it is inherently unjust.
At the core of this bill is a proposal the government want to force upon workers in small business. It provides that they may be dismissed in circumstances which a court would find to be unfair but leaves them with no remedy, no rights and no redress. This bill seeks to empower employers in small businesses so that they have the right to, in an unfettered way, dismiss an employee in circumstances that a court would say are unfair, and yet it gives workers no rights whatsoever. That is what this bill seeks to do. It is little wonder that the parliament has rejected that principle on seven occasions, and it will continue to do so. The Australian people would regard us as derelict in our duties as members of parliament if we were to allow laws onto our statute books that enshrined the principle that you could be sacked—you could lose your livelihood and your capacity to earn income and put a roof over your and your family's heads—in circumstances that were unfair and yet the law of the land would say you have no rights whatsoever. That is what this bill does. That is what the government have sought to do on seven occasions now. Amazing though that sounds, they are precisely the provisions that the bill seeks to impose.
Labor has put forward alternative proposals. If time permits, I will go to some of those first. I want to expose, yet again, the problems with this bill and why this bill is so despicable and deserves to be spurned by this parliament an eighth time. The bill before the parliament at the moment seeks to change not one of the leftover Labor laws but a Liberal Party law. The law dealing with unfair dismissals in the federal jurisdiction now is the law that Peter Reith, as minister, wanted. Indeed, this is how he described it when he succeeded in getting it through the parliament:
We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round ... 
No longer do we have any pretence of `a fair go all round'. The government does not want a fair go all round; the government wants the opportunity for workers to be dismissed unfairly and yet have no rights. That is hardly a qualification for `a fair go all round', which is how Peter Reith, not usually known for his support of workers' rights, described these very provisions on unfair dismissal when his bill went through the parliament in November 1996.
It is important to also acknowledge that the bill Peter Reith put through—the law as it is now—was not a modification of Labor's first law. The previous speaker, the member for Blaxland, spoke about the introduction of these federal industrial relations laws in 1994, but the provisions for unfair dismissal were subsequently changed by the Labor government before the 1996 election. Version 1 of Labor's unfair dismissal laws was effectively watered down—that is, after some operation, faults were identified by the government, and people were taking cases that were not, in the view of the government, proper to be taken. The law was changed before the 1996 election to further reduce the opportunity for people to be protected by those unfair dismissal laws—that is, the field was tilted a little more in favour of the employer to fix up some of the inequities in the system.
We then had the third rewrite of those laws, which were the Peter Reith laws that the government said were fair. The government no longer regard them as fair. If you were to listen and take at face value the comments of Liberal and National Party members in this debate, you would think that these were abominable laws that restricted the operation of business in every facet of working life on every day of the week. The laws we are talking about are Liberal laws. Every one of those criticisms they raise is about their Liberal law. These points are not lost on the commentators out there who have followed this debate over the last six years. When the government reintroduced the bill earlier this year, the Canberra Times said:
The Federal Government has launched yet another attempt to change the unfair-dismissal laws. Once again it is going about it the wrong way. It wishes to exempt small businesses—those employing under 20 people—from the provisions. The change offends normal principles of equality before the law. Why should one employee get a different set of rights from another, just because their employer happens to employ a higher number of other employees? The principle should be that employees are treated fairly, irrespective of the nature of their employer.
So said the editorial of the Canberra Times. It is a fine principle, which I am sure all the readership of the Canberra Times—or, indeed, the readership of any paper in Australia—would say is fair and proper. But it was not good enough for this Liberal government—not good enough for John Howard, the man who in opposition said that he would knife the Industrial Relations Commission. The changes to industrial relations law, of which this is a part, is a core promise—even if only to himself and even if he did not take the rest of the Australian public into his confidence—that he would see through. And we are seeing that here.
Whenever this issue comes up, government members and ministers tell us that we must pass this legislation for a couple of reasons but, first and foremost, because it will create jobs. They are very precise about this; they can tell us how many jobs it will create. On many occasions, the former minister, the current minister and indeed the Prime Minister have said the legislation will create 50,000 jobs. I will not quote all of them, but I am sure those who have followed this debate are familiar with the citations. However, it is interesting that, when you ask these people—ministers of the Crown—to explain how they arrive at this figure, they get a bit coy. I will give two examples. On the 7.30 Report on 20 May this year, Jeremy Thompson asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations how he arrived at that figure. Mr Abbott said:
It's a pretty rough and ready rule based on the fact that if just one small business in 20 employed one extra person as a result of the lifting of the unfair dismissal monkey from the back of small business, that would produce well over 50,000 jobs.
That is what the minister had to say on 20 May. A couple of weeks later, on 9 June, he was asked the same question at a Meet the Press interview. The minister—obviously well across the subject, as we know he is in these matters—answered the question this way:
Inevitably, it's an estimate, and these estimates are inevitably imprecise, but there are something like 1.5 million small businesses in Australia and if 1 in 30 of those took on an extra person because of changes to the law, there are your 50,000 new jobs.
A couple of weeks earlier, when he was on the ABC, it was one in 20. When he was on Meet the Press, it was one in 30. The government cannot even get the lie correct. They cannot even work out the story-line.
There was one of those extremely rare moments of truth from the mouth of former Minister Peter Reith when he had to answer a question on notice—so it had to be in black and white in the Hansard. One thing that we know is that ministers are usually fairly careful about misleading the parliament, because that can bring consequences for a minister.
—He mustn't have read it!
—I suspect someone wrote the answer for him. But in a rare moment of honesty—and, indeed, for Peter Reith it was exceedingly rare—Peter Reith actually had this to say in answer to the question about how you calculate these figures. In answer to question on notice No. 2940 in the last parliament, he said:
It is not possible to specify the number of small businesses which would directly benefit from the Government's proposed exemption from unfair dismissal laws ...
`It is not possible'? Hang on! The story-line was that it was one in 20, and a few weeks later it was one in 30. But the former minister is on the record as saying it was not possible to calculate it.
I want to put on the record, yet again, where this figure of 50,000 comes from. The 50,000 figure, as has sometimes been admitted by ministers over the course of the last six years in this government, comes from an off-the-cuff comment made by Rob Bastian from the Council of Small Business Associations. I have no complaint with Rob Bastian; he is an advocate for his industry and he does a fine job. Good luck to him! But if you talk to him about these matters, as I did at some length, he will freely acknowledge that there is no research, there is no survey and there is no estimate. It was an off-the-cuff remark that does not even have so much as a postage stamp of data to back it up—zip, zilch, nil; absolutely no research whatsoever.
So it is little wonder that the current minister, Tony Abbott—who is a little wonder—would find himself unsure of whether it was one in 20 or one in 30. Frankly, for him to hold a thought for more than two weeks is a challenge. Clearly, he could not hold that central thought for more than two weeks. It is also the case that the former minister, Peter Reith, had the same problem, but at least when he had to answer a question on notice he came to the truth. So why do all of this, apart from the political spin of it? I will come to some of those reasons. It has always amazed me that the government actually succeeded in doing two things with this. The first is distracting small businesses' attention from the things that are important to them by what this government has burdened them with; this is the red herring to distract them. The second, to some extent, is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy—that is, it has said this so often that it has actually convinced some people that there is a problem where none existed before.
If this was such a big issue then you would think that, in the middle of last year, when the current minister went to meet the Retailers Association of Queensland, they would have actually headlined that. But if you have a look at the Retailers Association of Queensland bulletin from the time that they were meeting with the minister, which was July 2001, you will see that they wrote:
The RAQ will meet with Australia's Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Tony Abbott, on Monday (today) to brief him on issues that are of key importance in the lead-up to this year's Federal election.
This is not what they cited as being high on their agenda. Bear in mind that this is a peak organisation, in the lead-up to a federal election, getting a precious half hour to tell the minister what they want fixed. If this was a big issue, you might think it would be high on the list. It was not. They said:
High on the agenda will be consideration of doubling the number of days businesses have to remit tax instalments to the ATO at the end of every quarter.
It was the burden of the tax system that was on their minds. That was what they wanted to talk about. That was in the circular to their own members. In the lead-up to the election campaign that was their priority.
There are lots of surveys that get bandied around when it comes to this issue. Some of them are classic cases of push polling. Some of them are more innocent than others, but some are very deliberately constructed push polling. Others contain the sorts of questions whereby, if you went into a workplace and asked workers, `What is important in this workplace?' they might say safety or whatever. But if you went in and said, `Do you think you should get more money?' they would all say yes. If you asked, `Do you think you should have a cleaner work environment?' they would all say yes. It is a bit like that with the employers. If you actually look at the authentic surveys that have been done, you will see that they are small in number. Unfortunately, this government does not want to conduct serious broadscale surveys of the workplace.
The last major serious study of workplaces was released in about 1998, but it was actually a study that was done in 1995. It was AWIRS 95: the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey 1995. It was the most comprehensive survey of Australian workplaces that had been done in the last 10 years. Interestingly, it was done about a year or two after Labor had introduced these unfair dismissal laws. So it was not the Peter Reith watered down version, as it were; these were Labor's undiluted laws which the government—the Liberal Party—would have us believe were so hurtful to employment. In that survey small businesses were asked the reasons why they had not recruited employees. If you look at the responses from the small business community, you will find that the No. 1 reason given was that they did not need any more employees. That stands to reason. Sixty-six per cent said that. The percentage of respondents who said, `Not recruited due to insufficient work,' was 23 per cent. Again, that was a totally sensible response that you would anticipate. The level of respondents who chose the option, `Not recruited due to a lack of demand for the product,' was six per cent. Again, you would expect that.
There was in fact a response which identified unfair dismissals as the reason for not recruiting. The figure for respondents in that survey who cited that as a reason why they had not employed someone was 0.9 per cent—less than one per cent of respondents cited unfair dismissal laws. I can go through a series of other surveys to illustrate the same point. One that took my fancy was conducted in the minister's own electorate earlier this year. That survey found that 79 per cent of small businesses said that lack of need or insufficient work were the reasons that they had not recruited staff. Again, this confirms the earlier research. Furthermore, 52 per cent actually nominated the GST as the government policy that caused them the most concern—and that survey was conducted in February this year. Asked if their reasons for not hiring were other than those listed, not one respondent in Tony Abbott's own electorate cited unfair dismissals. That survey was done at the start of this year. Not one said that, but 52 per cent said the GST was the government law that most affected their business. So, if the government actually wanted to do something to assist small business, they could have a quick look at the operation of the GST and the impact it has had on small business.
I just want to cite one other survey—there are many that could be cited—done in Victoria in February 2001. Victoria is interesting because it basically has no state jurisdiction; so it is the Commonwealth system alone that you are looking at. Small business respondents were asked to indicate the degree to which 11 different factors affected their business. Top of the list was the GST. After that came government regulations and then labour costs. At the bottom of 11 factors came unfair dismissal laws. It was ranked 11th out of 11 issues; it was stone cold last. And that was in Victoria, where there is effectively no state system. That is important because it introduces the other critical factor into this equation. We are talking here about a federal law that affects maybe 20 to 25 per cent of the work force. Even if this law were to be passed, three-quarters of the Australia work force in the small business community would be totally unaffected by it.
In all of my years involved in this debate and speaking at employer forums, industrial relations societies and worker forums, I have had some people tell me horror stories of unfair dismissals where the employer got a raw deal. On the facts presented, if indeed that was the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I would agree with them that they got a raw deal. You know what? Invariably, in every single one of those cases that was presented to me over the years, not one of them was under federal jurisdiction. They were all under state jurisdiction. There may be a case that someone can cite, but I can stand here, having spoken at more forums than anybody, including the minister, on this matter, and say that not one under federal jurisdiction has been raised with me in any forum that I have addressed on these matters.
If the government were genuine about these things, it would not be pursuing this legislation for the eighth time. It would be looking at Labor's amendments and seeking to deal with some of the underlying problems. Business is increasingly sick of being used as a football by this government in terms of industrial relations. Labor has put forward alternatives that are fair and reasonable and that honour the principles of a fair go all round. In 1996 the government said that that is what this law that it now seeks to amend did. In 1996 this government said it wanted a fair go all round. Everything it has said and done about it since proves that that is not the case.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—Dishonesty in this Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] begins with its title. It used to be called the unfair dismissal bill, and now it is called the fair dismissal bill—yet it is the same bill that has been put forward on seven occasions. There is one small difference: the government has lifted the threshold under which these unfair provisions would apply to businesses with up to 20 employees. But dishonesty pervades the bill, and it pervades the government's handling of the issue in public. I refer to comments from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations as to the origins of these infamous 50,000 new employees that would magically spring up as a result of the passage of this legislation through the parliament. He said:
Inevitably, it's an estimate, and these estimates are inevitably imprecise, but there are something like 1.5 million small businesses in Australia and if 1 in 30 of those took on an extra person because of changes to the law, there are your 50,000 new jobs.
The fact is, of those 1.5 million small businesses, only 180,000 are in the federal system. So, if there are 180,000 in the federal system and you need 1.5 million small businesses to create 50,000 new jobs, we will just do a simple calculation. Even if the minister were right, the 180,000 in the federal system that would be affected by this legislation would create 6,000 jobs, not 50,000 jobs. That is as rough as the government's own estimates, because there are no official estimates.
The member for Brisbane is absolutely right; I too have had conversations with Rob Bastian, the former head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA. He told me that he was rung up one day and asked, `If this law were to come into force, what do you think the impact would be on job creation?' He told me that he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation, but I do not think he got out an envelope or a pen. He made up a number. That is what he told me. It was a guess. I think he was being a little generous. Once that number was in the public domain, the government latched onto it and sought, somehow, to apply some science to it. There is absolutely no basis for the claim that the passage of this legislation would create 50,000 jobs. By the government's own reckoning, by its own arithmetic, given that there are only 180,000 small businesses in the federal system, it could create, at a maximum, 6,000 jobs.
The dishonesty goes on, because the government has told small business employers that they would be able to dismiss employees whom they considered in any way troublesome, bothersome or inconvenient if this legislation went through. But that is not true—small business has been misled. The small business community of Australia has been misled by this government, because if this legislation somehow were to pass the Senate and there were to be an exemption from the unfair dismissal laws for small businesses with up to 20 employees, an employee who considered that he or she was hard done by would have recourse to another set of remedies. The common feature of each of these remedies is that it would be more costly and more time consuming.
When I talk to the small business community—and I have a small business background—what is the greatest fear? It is the time-consuming nature and the attendant cost of legal processes. That is what they are concerned about, because they have been told repeatedly by the government and by a number of business organisations that this is how they would be affected. I urged the small business community to ponder the sorts of responses and the legal avenues that would be available to employees—and are available right now—if they considered that they were harshly treated.
Employees could take out action under unlawful termination, under the antidiscrimination laws, under the common law or under state law, such as unfair contracts. They are just a few examples, and the reason that these various provisions are not widely invoked is because the unfair dismissal procedures are shorter and less costly from the point of view of the employee. But, if that remedy is removed, the employee would have no option other than to either cop it on the chin or pursue remedy through one of these four mechanisms, which would be more costly and more time consuming and, therefore, far more damaging to small business.
The small business community are being dishonestly told by this government that, if the unfair dismissal laws were changed in this way and they were exempted from them, everything would be sweetness and light and they would have no problem. The government should be responsible.
—You are costing 50,000 jobs.
—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration has continued, in his statements just now, with the ridiculous, baseless assertion that 50,000 jobs would be created with the passage of these laws. One thing that the government does reasonably well, when it gets on to a porky, is to tell it far and wide. If you are going to tell a porky, tell it often; that is what the government does. It distributes the porky list. The parliamentary secretary is now reading from the porky list and saying that 50,000 new jobs will be created if this legislation is passed. It is absolute rubbish and he knows it.
Labor, on the other hand, has proposed a series of remedies that deal with the procedural issues associated with the current legislation. The amendments that we are proposing involve, in the first instance, taking the emphasis away from cash payouts for employees who consider themselves to be unfairly dismissed and concentrating on reinstatement. This was the intention of the original legislation, but, over time, it has come to be used more often than not as a mechanism to extract a cash payment for unfair dismissal from the employer. Labor's first proposal says, `Let us go back to the original intent of the legislation, give the priority to reinstatement and, only if reinstatement is impractical because it is a small business and the two parties would not get on, then move on to the issue of cash compensation.' The second of Labor's amendments would require the commission to specifically consider the appropriateness of allowing paid representation in a conciliation conference. The point of this amendment is to keep costs low, to see whether the dispute can be conciliated, settled, at low cost to the employee and to the employer. This is a perfectly sensible proposal.
The third amendment proposed by Labor is for paid industrial agents to be registered with the commission. Labor does not want to see ambulance chasers profiting from the unfair dismissal laws. There are already plenty of examples of these paid agents, or ambulance chasers, seeking neither reinstatement nor a speedy resolution of the process, because the longer it goes the higher the fee that they are able to collect on a contingency basis, leaving not very much for the employee who has been dismissed and leaving the small business with large costs. Labor says, `Let us get the ambulance chasers out.' Finally, and importantly, Labor's fourth amendment would require the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to develop an honest information package, not the dishonest information that is disseminated by this government in its public statements to, and communications with, the small business community.
If this government were serious about assisting small business, it would come to the negotiating table with Labor. I have talked to the leaders of the various small business organisations in Australia, and they want a fair outcome. They do not want the political posturing of this government, which is using this legislation for one purpose only, and that is to obtain a double dissolution trigger. That is why the government will not sit down and talk with Labor about reaching some accommodation on the procedures associated with the current unfair dismissal laws. That would defeat its one and only purpose, which is to obtain a double dissolution trigger. We were all in this House at the end of the last session. It was about two o'clock in the morning when the minister for workplace relations said words to the effect that he had had advice that the legislation needed to go back to the Senate—that was in order to continue the processes leading to this bill becoming a double dissolution trigger. This is the seventh time that essentially the same legislation has been brought into this parliament. Does that not tell everyone what the government's true motive is? It does not want to reach an accommodation. It does not want to achieve a solution for small business. It wants to maximise its own political advantage and obtain a double dissolution trigger. Who will be the losers out of this? They will be the small business community, who genuinely want an accommodation between the parties on this.
A couple of months ago, I participated in a debate with the member for Moreton at a southside business community breakfast. It was quite instructive.
—You lost?
—It is marvellous to have someone sitting in the government seat asking dorothy dix questions. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration just asked me whether I lost that debate. I will tell you what happened, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, and through you I will tell the parliament of Australia. The debate went backwards and forwards, and at the end of the debate all of the business community who were represented at that breakfast, who knew the member for Moreton quite well—understandably, because the debate occurred in the seat of the member for Moreton—were asked their opinion on whether some sort of accommodation should be reached between the parties or whether the government should proceed with its bill. They were asked immediately upon the closing statement of the member for Moreton, who said, `We will never compromise on this; we will achieve a double dissolution trigger and then we'll push this legislation through.'
—And what did the businesspeople say?
—To a person, the businesspeople, when asked whether they were in favour of the two parties getting together and achieving an accommodation, all put up their hands. There was only one person in the room without his hand in the air: the member for Moreton. He counted the numbers—as he would because he is a good numbers man in his own electorate and in neighbouring electorates where there is a bit of branch stacking going on—and he found that he was the odd one out. So, very sheepishly, his hand rose in the air. By raising his hand in the air, he signalled a complete turnaround. Every argument that he had put at that breakfast was invalidated by his own action when he said, `I now reluctantly, because the numbers are against me, agree that the two parties should sit down and reach an accommodation on this matter.'
—Where is he now?
—He is not here, and he obviously has not had that conversation with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. On behalf of his own constituents, his own business community, he should come into this place and indicate to the parliament what he indicated to all those business representatives gathered at that meeting—that is, that he now, under the weight of numbers, favours the two parties getting together and reaching an accommodation to streamline the unfair dismissal procedures for small business.
We have four well thought out concrete proposals, four proposals that the small business community—in Moreton and around Australia—considers worthy of discussion and of being a basis for achieving an agreement between the two parties. But I say to the small business community: do not hold your breath, because the government is not interested in a solution and it is not interested in the welfare of small business. I say that for two further reasons. Firstly, the government has said repeatedly that it will cut red tape for small business. In 1996 the Prime Minister said, `We will slash red tape for small business by 50 per cent.' The government was going to reduce the size of the tax act. The streamlined new tax system for a new century was going to make everything easier for small business.
As the member for Brisbane has indicated, when small business are asked in surveys what has been the bane of their lives—what has been the No. 1 problem—their answer is the GST. The burden of the GST has fallen very heavily on the shoulders of the small business community of Australia. Labor took to the last election a proposal to radically simplify the GST for small business by application of what has come to be known as the ratio method. Labor followed that up with a private member's bill. The then Minister for Small Business commissioned his department to do a hatchet job on the ratio method. The department did produce a report—
 (Mr Lindsay)—The member for Rankin will return to the substance of the bill.
—The department produced a report, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that report was praiseworthy. But, of course, the minister found a couple of clauses, raced around the press gallery and said, `I'm going to leak you a little copy of this; don't tell anyone, will you?' The then shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition was rung by a range of journalists saying, `Ian Macfarlane is running around the place leaking us this document.' We obtained the document and it was supportive of the ratio method.
—The member for Rankin will return to the substance of the bill.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am now talking about the administrative burden of various government policies. The last one I want to deal with very briefly is superannuation choice. If the small business community thinks it has already been whacked with red tape by this government, it is right—but it ain't seen nothing yet. When it gets its eyes on the superannuation choice legislation, it will see that it is a maze that small business will never be able to navigate. It is time that this government showed a bit of honesty to the small business community and the Australian people. It is time it started barracking for small business and sat down with Labor to achieve a sensible accommodation on this legislation.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Corcoran, Ann, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—The bill before the House, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], attempts to exempt from unfair dismissal provisions workers in a business with fewer than 20 employees. The government argues that this bill is necessary because the present unfair dismissal laws are discouraging small businesses from engaging staff. I am arguing that, as this bill stands, it should be opposed on two grounds: firstly, that it unfairly treats employees on the grounds of the size of their employer's business; and, secondly, that there is no evidence that it will do what the government claims it will do.
It is interesting to note that this bill, in its various guises, has been around since 1997. At first the proposal was to deny access to unfair dismissal procedures to employees who had less than 12 months continuous service with a small business which had fewer than 15 employees. The bill in its various forms has been rejected by the Senate six times since then—and again this bill appears before us. This time a small business has been defined as a business employing fewer than 20 employees. There is an irony in the name of the bill, that irony being that it is not a bill about the fair dismissal of employees; it is about being unfair to a group of employees simply because they are employed by a small business. The concept of a fair go all round is the underlying philosophy of unfair dismissal jurisdictions, both at the state level and at the Commonwealth level. This bill flies in the face of the notion of a fair go all round. The government is seeking to deprive of a fair go a significant number of Australian workers.
If this bill were passed, no worker in a small business would feel secure. It would be possible for a worker in a small business to be sacked for no good or valid reason on the whim of an unscrupulous boss, and they would not be able to take any legal action through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission against their employer over their unfair dismissal. Under the provisions of this bill, if an employee—perhaps a young person in their first job, new to the work force and inexperienced in workplace matters—found themselves unwell for an extended period, they could be sacked for taking leave, because they worked in a small business and their employer decided they could not afford to carry someone sick. This person could face the sack: what would this employee be able to do? With little knowledge of their rights and, if this bill were passed, nowhere to turn for justice, they would have to walk away and perhaps into their next job, which might be a similar position with another small employer. It would not be fair to employees in small businesses for them to be this vulnerable to losing their jobs.
As I said earlier, the government has stated that the aim of this bill is to encourage small businesses to employ more people. It is argued that the present laws covering unfair dismissal are a deterrent to small businesses taking on new employees. The facts do not support this proposition. In November 2001, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry reported survey results for small businesses. These results showed that the frequency and complexity of changes to tax laws and rules following the introduction of the GST was of high concern to them. Following on from that were the levels of taxation, telecommunication costs and the complexity of government regulations. Only after these concerns was unfair dismissal mentioned.
In my own electorate, unfair dismissal laws are not on top of the list of the concerns of small businesses either. I have had a number of discussions with small businesses in a variety of forums. When asked what government could do to improve their lot, the small business people in Isaacs have talked about the frustration of not being able to win any government contracts, of difficulties in accessing research and development grants, of tariffs and exporting problems and of difficulties in accessing training. Small businesses in the Cranbourne area are frustrated about the fact that Cranbourne is outside the Melbourne call zone. These businesses face extra costs for telecommunications, despite the fact that Cranbourne is very much a part of suburbia these days. Unfair dismissal has never been raised with me as an issue by my local small businesses.
It should be noted that, if this bill ever becomes law, it will affect only 28 per cent of small businesses. It will cover only those small businesses that are incorporated and that are covered by a federal award. If this bill becomes law, it will not exempt an employer from liability for unlawful—as opposed to unfair—dismissal. Employers will still be liable for unlawful termination actions on the grounds of discrimination. Employees may still have access to expensive and complex common law actions. This bill will only achieve more uncertainty for the employer. It could also be argued that skilled and marketable workers will avoid small businesses because of the insecurity of the employment. This will be of no benefit to small businesses. If the government were serious about creating employment in the small business field, their efforts would be far better spent addressing other concerns first.
Given that the evidence says that this bill will not effectively achieve the stated objectives, I have to ask why the government are so hell-bent on this bill. Why are they so determined to restrict one group of employees' access to proper and just recourse to action if they think they have been unfairly dismissed? By excluding these employees, the government are saying to them, `You're expendable. You should just be grateful that you have a job,' and, `We don't care about your job security.' The government are clearly showing disdain towards workers by proposing legislation to make it okay for employers to sack workers without any accountability or justification. This sends a clear message to all employees, particularly those employed in small businesses, about what this government think about them and their job security.
I am not suggesting that the majority of employers will take advantage of the legislation. Indeed, it is my experience that most employers are keen to do the right thing by their employees—just as most employees do the right thing in their jobs and by their employers. This is borne out by the figures. In 2000-01, there were 2,676 unfair dismissal applications against small businesses—that is, less than 1.5 per cent of small businesses in the federal system had an unfair dismissal claim made against them. That translates to 0.3 per cent of all small businesses. Unfair dismissal laws are in place to ensure that workers are not dismissed unfairly. This does not mean that workers cannot be dismissed; it means workers cannot be dismissed unfairly.
As I said earlier, experience and research say that unfair dismissal laws are not on top of the heap in terms of problems for small businesses. Nevertheless, there are some pressures on small businesses in relation to unfair dismissal laws. Labor have recognised this fact, and we introduced a bill last August to deal with this problem. The concerns small businesses have with unfair dismissals are about time lost, red tape and costs associated with unfair dismissal action. The actions proposed by Labor to address the real concerns of small business include: reducing the cost by limiting the role of lawyers in the early stages of unfair dismissal claims; requiring sacked workers to seek, as one of the remedies, reinstatement—this is designed to discourage unfair dismissal claims aimed simply at achieving a pay-off rather than reinstatement and to reinforce the policy of a focus on job security, although the exception is where reinstatement is not sensible, for instance, where an employee has been subjected to victimisation; creating a register of industrial agents to allow the commission to deregister agents who act unethically or who abuse unfair dismissal processes; and requiring the minister to establish an indicative time frame to promote the quick resolution of unfair dismissal proceedings by the commission.
A study by the accountants body CPA Australia, released in March this year, puts the lie to repeated government claims that unfair dismissal laws are the biggest barrier to employment growth among small businesses. According to the study, only five per cent of small businesses nominated unfair dismissals as the main impediment to hiring new staff and only three per cent of small businesses nominated changes to unfair dismissal laws as something that would encourage them to employ more staff. By contrast, 25 per cent of small businesses nominated the lack of skilled or experienced applicants as the main impediment to hiring new staff.
The survey also shows that the government must make a much greater effort to educate small businesses as to the effect of unfair dismissal laws. An important issue for small businesses is lack of knowledge about their rights and responsibilities when it comes to employing and dismissing employees. It is clear that many small business operators have unnecessary fears about unfair dismissal laws. The government appears determined to exploit those fears, rather than to address misconceptions about unfair dismissal. The survey showed that 27 per cent of small business operators were worried that they could not dismiss a person even if they were stealing from them, and 30 per cent of small businesses thought that the employer always lost unfair dismissal cases—when the outcome of arbitrated cases is roughly even. Instead of just pursuing an exemption that will leave all small business employees without protection against unfair dismissal, the government needs to do more to educate small businesses about the real meaning of unfair dismissal laws. Most employers are reasonable and keen to do the right thing, if only they know what is required of them. It makes far more sense to offer this assistance than to continue the scare campaign that says all employees are potential problems and will be impossible to dismiss.
This bill is unfair to employees of small businesses. The bill, if passed, will not achieve the stated objectives of the government. So we are back to the question of why the government is pushing this bill. I can only conclude that it is being introduced again as a potential double dissolution trigger and as a means of expressing this government's extreme ideological opposition to unions. This obsession with unions underpins everything it does with respect to the Workplace Relations Act.
This bill is unfair to many Australian workers. It will not achieve the government's stated aim of smoothing the way for small businesses to employ more people and it may well have a detrimental effect on employment in the sector. There are no good reasons for supporting this bill and a number of good reasons for opposing it. This bill should be rejected once again.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—Tonight we are addressing the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2], another example of the government's use of Orwellian language to try to dress up something which is not pleasant by giving it a pleasant name. That trend was originally started by the former Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith. It seems to have become popular within the government, and so we get these rather bizarre Orwellian titles given to bills. We know that this bill has a lot of history. We know that we debated this bill earlier this year and that the bill was presented in various forms about five times before then. One thing we can say about this Orwellian bill is that the government has sure been persistent about it, and that makes you wonder why. You would think from the persistence involved that this is an essential piece of legislation, a bill that definitely needs to be passed. Otherwise, why would the government keep trotting along with it? Why would the government persist in the face of the consistent opposition to the bill in this House and the successful opposition to the bill in the Senate?
We know what it is about. It is about two things: one is to have a double dissolution trigger about the content of this bill; the other is for the government to try to shore up their declining support among small business in Australia. If the government were serious about helping small business, they would not be pursuing this particular narrow piece of legislation. They would be looking at a whole host of issues and not just focusing on the question of fair—or perhaps I should say unfair—dismissal. The legislation is not necessary. If you asked small business what they wanted, I do not think that they would give this particular piece of legislation a very high priority. Most small business people would give much higher priority to getting rid of GST red tape and giving assistance with the problems of falling consumer demand, not to mention relief from the drought, which is causing a lot of small businesses in the bush terrible trouble.
The reality is that this bill will only extend to incorporated businesses, and not many small businesses are incorporated. The corner shop is not an incorporated business. Small businesses that are incorporated make up only about 25 per cent of small businesses, and they are the ones at the top end of the definition of small business—the ones with the large turnovers and the large numbers of employees. Mom-and-Pop stores do not bother about getting themselves incorporated.
As I said when the last version of this bill was debated—and it is worth while repeating now—if you ask small business what their most important industrial issue is, those who think about the matter will tell you that they would prefer some harmonisation of federal and state industrial laws. The problem for small business people—in particular, for small unincorporated business people, many of whom are not in an employer organisation, particularly those in regional and rural areas—is that, if someone brings an unfair dismissal case against them, they can end up in the wrong jurisdiction. They are not experts in industrial relations, their employees are not experts in industrial relations, and the vast majority of employees who work in small business are not unionised, so they do not know where they are going either. So you have people on both sides of the argument, the respondent and the applicant, who really do not know how the system works. They do not know whether they are under a federal award or a state award. They do not know which award they are employed under, and it is that matter—that people are unaware— that causes most of the problems for small business. Because of this confusion you can end up in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales out in Orange and find, after having driven for half a day to get there, that you are really under a federal award and have to go somewhere else.
If small businesses had their way, they would like a simplification and harmonisation of the systems far more than a draconian law like this one the government is putting forward. This piece of legislation will make it harder to get harmonisation. It will not make it easier; it will make it harder. It will draw the Commonwealth and the state systems further apart. The minister then says you should do what they have done in Victoria and hand over the whole system to the Commonwealth. I do not think that many of the workers in Victoria think that is a good idea. A lot of the employers in larger states like New South Wales and Queensland are quite happy with the state industrial systems and would like to see harmonisation. They do not like the fact that the Commonwealth keeps tinkering with the system, making the two systems even further apart.
As I pointed out before, small businesses in country areas want better access to government services before they want the government changing the industrial laws once again. That is what they want from the government, not the ability to sack some people in certain circumstances without the fear of it costing them money. If they wanted to really help small business, a more positive thing might be for the government to institute something like a help line, because many small employers with a few or even one or two employees who are not unionised have no idea what they have to do or what they do not have to do, what rights their employees have or what rights the employer has. If the government had a helpline which genuine small business people could ring to get advice, it would save them a lot of time and effort.
Small businesses in the country want more important things than these changes to the industrial laws. They want a better telecommunications system, not just the rhetoric that tells them they have a better system when they know from their own bitter experience that they do not. They want access to robust computer operations which will allow them to more efficiently order goods and services. They want an efficient transportation system which will deliver goods to them on time. So what argument does the government put forward for this legislation? In his second reading speech, the minister said:
The government is reintroducing this bill to honour a commitment it has made to the people of Australia to free up the large number of small business jobs that are being lost because of the unfair dismissal laws.
The large number of jobs that have been lost by unfair dismissal laws in small business? This change applies to only 25 per cent of small businesses, so he is obviously not all that keen on doing too much. This is about the government getting back to wedge politics.
The minister referred to research that found that small businesses are reacting to the complexity and cost of unfair dismissal laws by not taking on additional employees. I am not as convinced as he obviously is about the veracity of this so-called research. Doubtless there are small businesses that are concerned about the costs and there are some that have had to try to meet the cost of court action, but I do not believe the problem—if it is a problem—needs fixing in the way that this legislation will fix it. The minister says that there is research. He does not produce too much of it, and a lot of the pressure from small business about this is apocryphal. If you ask most small businesses if they have had a problem with unfair dismissals, they answer, no, they do not but they know someone who does. Everyone knows someone who has, but not many of them say it has happened to them, because most small business people want to ensure, if they have good employees, that they keep them and, if they have duds, that they get rid of them. The system lets you get rid of the duds. And the system helps someone who is unfairly dealt with—someone who is victimised. It gives them the chance to get their job back. That is what the system should do. It should not end up being a system that, as the minister says, will create more jobs. What is he going to do: churn people through this? Are we going to have small businesses do what the telephone companies do with mobile phone systems: you work here one day and somewhere else the next, and they claim a new job has been created because you have moved from here to there and someone has filled your job?
The government seems to believe that if small businesses are exempt from the unfair dismissal laws, there will be more jobs available in small business. I do not see how this is going to work. I think what the minister means is that we are going to get back to this churning. We are going to have people moved with impunity in and out of jobs, and so the statistics will look a lot better. If Fred Nerk fired 15 people last month, that will not be recorded in the employment figures. They will show that Fred Nerk put on 14 new people—but they will not say that he got rid of them a few weeks later because they would not work nine hours a day or because they would not accept Fred's illegal sexual advances or because they would not take cash instead of a weekly salary. A lot of employees have to put up with a lot of iffy things from a lot of employers. Are we going to take rights away from these people? The minister's argument, to my mind, is that, by allowing 25 per cent of small businesses—not all small businesses, only those 25 per cent which are incorporated—to sack peoplewith impunity, that is going to create work. If the employers of this country think it is a good thing to put people on because they can fire them quickly, then I do not think they are the sorts of employers that we really want. Quite frankly, I do not think that is what most of the employers out there are about.
As I said earlier, most employers, particularly those in small businesses in the country, when they have a good employee, want to keep that person. They do not want to be freed up to be able to sack them tomorrow. Why should we allow people to do that? Why should we allow that sort of insecurity to develop in a quarter of small businesses? The other 75 per cent that are unincorporated are not going to be able to do this; only a quarter of them are going to be able to do it. If unfair dismissals are a problem for small business—and I do not believe they are—then that problem should be addressed. Maybe it is the way dismissals are dealt with that should be looked at. All the industrial jurisdictions around the country are looking at that. We ought to look at why these dismissals are occurring, what appeal mechanisms are in place and how they can be improved. If cases are expensive, we should be trying to do something to make them less so. A number of state jurisdictions are doing just that. There are a whole lot of aspects that should be looked at before embarking on this sort of legislation, which does not even begin to look at the underlying issues and which says to one class of small business employer that they have different rights to the other 75 per cent of small business employers. It should not say that one-quarter of those employees will have fewer rights than the other three-quarters.
When this legislation was last debated, one of the arguments in favour of the bill that was put forward by the government was that there were agents out there trawling for business on a no win, no charge basis and that that was a reason to take small business out of the industrial relations system. What people were talking about was that these agents were putting ads in newspapers trawling for non-unionised employees. Like ambulance chasers, these lawyers will always find a way to make a quid: you could have 10,000 lawyers and 10 lawyer jobs, and they will always find another way to extend the envelope. Some of these agents are actually qualified lawyers, but they have passed in their practising certificates so that they do not have to be bound by the Law Council's ethics. They get up to some pretty unethical activities. The unions involved in the system do not do this; it is these agents who do it. But there are only a few agents like this in Sydney and Melbourne, so if your aim is to get these agents out of the system it seems a pretty bizarre piece of legislation to be bringing in here, because all it is going to do is restrict 25 per cent of the market for those agents. The other 75 per cent, the  unincorporated small businesses, will still be able to be held to ransom under the current system, and these agents will be able to get their employees.
Since this legislation was brought in last year, it is interesting that one of the biggest agents in Sydney—the fellow who had three offices around Sydney and had ads in all the local newspapers—has downsized and outsourced himself. He has closed down one of his offices, he has put off most of his staff and he is now advertising himself as an employers' agent—he has joined the other side. The argument that was put quietly around the corridors of this place was that he was one of the reasons we needed this legislation. But this fellow has reduced most of his work, he has downsized himself and he is not even in the system half as much as he was. So wouldn't it have been bizarre if we had passed legislation last year because some people in the government said this particular agent was a big problem and there were others like him in Melbourne who were all getting on the bandwagon, and now we find that they have got out of that side of business and are offering themselves as employment relations advisers to employers? What are we doing? Are we going to have a piece of legislation to stop something that has already wound down?
When we look at this legislation we should also think about the rights of the people who are employed in small business. Shouldn't a person who, for instance, works in a corner shop in Lithgow or in some country town have the same rights as someone who works in Coles or Woolworths? Shouldn't they have the same rights if they are doing somewhat the same job—a shop assistant is a shop assistant is a shop assistant? But what the government are going to say is: `We will now have three different lots of shop assistants. We'll have the shop assistants who work in the Mom-and-Pop store that is not incorporated, and they'll have some rights. We'll have those who work in a small business that is incorporated, and they'll have no rights. And we'll have people who work in Coles and Woolworths, and they'll have rights.'
This is another attack on the rights of ordinary working Australians. But the interesting thing about this is that, normally, the person who works in Coles or Woolworths is less likely to be unfairly dismissed than someone who works in a small business. That goes back to my original argument that most small businesses have no idea what award they are covered by, and their employees do not know—they are non-unionised areas, and so the employees cannot get advice from their union about what their rights are. The large employers have processes and protocols in place to deal with grievances, but small operators do not. The government would be more helpful to small business if they provided training to small business operators on how to deal fairly with employees who are involved in disciplinary matters, in order to avoid the unnecessary divisiveness of dismissals.
The government are not helping small business by this divisive piece of legislation. This legislation is about scaremongering. It is about the government trying to create a climate amongst small business that there is some sort of terrible problem out there. And, after creating that climate, they will get out there and say, `There's this terrible problem, and we'll fix it for a quarter of you.' It is just typical of the approach of the government. The intent of this legislation is as Orwellian as the name of the legislation. The government say that somehow or other we are going to create more employment by allowing people to dismiss people more easily. We are going to start churning workers. What is behind this legislation is a gross piece of dishonesty from the government side. What it will do is create division between small employers and their employees. In particular, it will do very little, if anything, to help small business. All it will create is a whole lot more tension in the work force. Australians, whether they work for Coles, Woolworths or the corner shop, should have the same rights. We should not be creating a system where people who work in incorporated small businesses have fewer rights than people who work for any other employer. That is discriminatory, that is unAustralian—and that is what this legislation is.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—I rise tonight to speak out against the amendments put forward by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. The irony in the bill being proposed by the minister is that this bill does not seek to change the nature of workplace relations but, rather, simply to remove workplace relations procedures for an entire subclass of employees in this country—workers who trust us to give them fair and just wages and conditions. In a democratic society like ours, fairness is a fundamental tenet and should be reflected in the operations of our basic institutions and procedures. Workers should have the right to be able to work in an environment where they do not have to fear being treated unfairly, be that through acts of prejudice or simply poor management. Employees have the right to feel protected by the workplace relations laws of this nation and should be safe in the knowledge that they cannot be dealt with unfairly in the workplace.
In this bill the Howard government is attempting to undermine the rights of ordinary Australians. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, noted in his second reading speech that members would be familiar with the contents of his bill. Yes, Minister, we are familiar with the content: the Howard government has been trying to remove protection for workers in small business since the formation of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force in 1996. So why has the government failed on numerous occasions? The answer is that it is because its arguments are highly spurious and based on false premise. Let us examine the government position. The Howard government hangs its hat on the claim that excluding small businesses from the unfair dismissal laws will create over 50,000 jobs. This claim is so absurd that it verges on the ridiculous. The Howard government has produced no credible evidence that would suggest that properly formulated termination laws discourage small businesses from employing new workers.
The government claims that this bill will create 50,000 jobs. However, this figure is an estimate by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. It is not fact backed up by hard research. When we look at the research, the Howard government's position is blown out of the water. If the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, had bothered to research, he would have found that, in the 1998 Telstra Yellow Pages Small Business Index, unfair dismissal laws did not even get a mention when small business was asked to consider the barriers to taking on new employees. Unfair dismissal laws came on the radar only when small businesses were asked to highlight their major concerns, and then only six per cent of workplaces saw unfair dismissal laws as a major concern. It was, in fact, taxation that was considered to be the real issue, with over 40 per cent of small businesses highlighting it as their major concern. Furthermore, pre-election surveys showed that businesses were most concerned about tax laws, tax levels and the complexity of government regulations, not unfair dismissal laws. It is good to know that the Howard government has its finger on the pulse of the small business community!
These statistics only go to back up my own experiences in Stirling. As I have mentioned in a previous speech in this place, I support the role of small business with great vigour in the Stirling electorate. As a member of the Stirling Business Association, I am always eager to read the Chamber of Commerce and Industry review publications, and unfair dismissal issues rank a distant sixth. These statistics illustrate that businesses do not feel intimidated by current termination laws and that they feel much more pressing issues should be at the fore. Current laws exist only to stop employers who behave in an unlawful way. Therefore, a correctly run business has nothing to fear from a strong unfair termination law. Labor is utterly committed to furthering the interests of business owners who treat their employees correctly. We believe that making the industrial relations system more accessible and easier to deal with is a more practical and appropriate policy direction.
I would like to commend the work of the Stirling Business Enterprise Centre in my electorate on their workshops and seminars for small business. These seminars are well attended and have increased the skills and abilities of people running small businesses. The network of business enterprise centres across Australia has extensive experience in running programs to enhance the skills and abilities of people running small businesses, including the ability to manage and supervise staff, appraising staff so as to build their weaknesses into strengths and role models of good employment. These business people have respect for their workers and handle their employment relations in a responsible and accountable manner. These small business people are aware that they are members of a community and that they are responsible for making sure that the friends, neighbours and relatives they may employ are well supported in the workplace environment.
The Howard government has failed to identify the major issue facing small businesses. But what of the original claim that being unfair will create 50,000 jobs? Again, this is grounded more in ideology than in reality. The enactment of the 1993 Industrial Relations Reform Act by the Keating government marked the creation of the Brereton unfair dismissal provisions. Between 1995 and 1997, the ABS found that, out of their research group of 600,000 job seekers, all found at least one job between May 1995 and September 1996. Unemployment also fell from an annual average of 10.9 per cent to 7.5 per cent in 1998. It seems that the enactment of unfair dismissal laws by Labor governments did not have a detrimental effect on job creation. Furthermore, a substantial number of these jobs were created in small businesses. Between September 1995 and September 1997, 1.2 million wage/salary jobs were entered into by job seekers. Three hundred and sixty thousand of these jobs were in businesses with 10 or fewer employees, while 270,000 were generated by companies with from 11 to 50 employees.
What the Howard government fails to see is that this bill could have a damaging effect on youth employment. Figures show that, although young people have problems gaining employment, the more chronic problem is maintaining their employment status. Young people are overrepresented in shorter and minimal work experience groups, highlighting the fact that young people have fewer problems getting a job than they do keeping a job. Following this argument through, I fail to see how making it easier to dismiss employees will in fact address the problem of youth unemployment.
It is not just the Labor Party that believes the Howard government claim that treating people unfairly in the workplace will lead to more job creation is highly spurious. The full court of the Federal Court, in the Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants trading as KFC case, rejected Professor Mark Wooden's evidence that, if unfair dismissal laws applied to casual employees, there would be an adverse effect on job creation in Australia. The full court ruled that the `relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven' and that Professor Wooden's opinion was `an entirely theoretical construct'. This legislation is divisive and ill informed. The government has not shown any evidence that this bill is needed, or even wanted, by the business owners of this nation.
The Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants case highlights another glaring problem with this bill: the rights of casuals. If enacted, this bill would effectively shut out from the Industrial Relations Commission all casual employees employed under a federal agreement who have worked for an employer for less than a year. Previously, this has stood at periods of three and six months. The nature of casual employment itself is fundamentally short term, so it would be accurate to presume those who have held a casual job for longer than six months are well entrenched in the business and therefore deserving of full protection from unfair termination. This legislation is aggressively trying to cripple the rights of many casual workers in this country.
Casual workers' lack of rights and job security already disadvantage them significantly. The number of casual workers in this country, as with most other countries, is growing at an incredibly fast rate. The groups of people predominantly in this category of worker are often those at greatest risk of being treated unfairly in the workplace. The ABS measures casual employment differently to the way this legislation would; however, these statistics are still telling. Nearly one-third of all women in the work force are casually employed. Most significantly, nearly two-thirds of all 15- to 19-year-olds in the work force are casuals. Constituents come to me when they are offered redundancy or have their contract cancelled because they want assistance to keep their jobs. They are usually young people.
The number of young people the government is attacking in drafting this bill is further accentuated by the fact that many of the corporations under federal workplace agreements are dependent primarily on youth labour. To give a practical example, in 1993 90 per cent of McDonald's Australia's employees were aged younger than 21. The casual industry in this country is one reliant upon the young people of this country. The minister is trying to expose thousands of young people in jobs on federal agreements to employers who would now be in a legally unaccountable position.
Under the former Labor government, casual workers were considered `short term' if they had worked in a company for a period of less than six months. We on this side of the House feel that anything greater than that is more than enough time for an employer to have gauged the efficiency of a worker and that, as such, termination protection should be full by this point in the employment relationship. The 12-month period that this government has installed encourages bad employers to take a cavalier attitude to employment of casuals, particularly young people. It will leave these workers in a dangerous and unprotected environment in the workplace.
In the state of Western Australia I have encountered many examples of casual workers being forced to leave without necessarily being sacked. For example, in a cafe in the western suburbs of Perth, a worker who had been working 40 hours a week for two years had her hours cut overnight to make way for one of the owner's family members. In another example, again from a cafe, an employee had regularly worked 25 hours a week for a year and a half. When the employee made one inquiry about the inequity of the roster, her hours were slashed to two hours a week. Is this fair and just behaviour on the part of the employer? I think not. Is it fair to give more power to employers who may not always act fairly? I think not.
There is also a very real danger that employers may force Australian workplace agreements on to workers with the threat of dismissal. Take the example of two Western Australian cleaners, Lin Watts and Mary Nelson, who had worked as casuals for 12 years before their employer told them to sign an AWA or face the sack. Lucky for them they were union members and successfully fought the employer's unfair behaviour. As it stands, I believe that there are already ample opportunities for business to avoid the full effects of unfair dismissal laws within the existing legislation. We on this side of the House fail to see the need for the federal government to abandon all workers in small businesses and casuals, who are the most vulnerable group in today's work force.
I have tried to grasp the motivation for this bill. I thought it may have been because, after many years of progressive Labor governments in the 1980s and early 1990s, our employment protection legislation had surpassed that of other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. I went and looked up the OECD report into the Australian labour market. The report provided a damning critique of Australian employment protection legislation, EPL. It stated:
Australia has consistently come out as one of the countries with the least EPL in the OECD area.
It goes on to note:
Australia was ranked particularly low on procedural requirements in the case of individual dismissal, and on the criteria given for unfair dismissal. 
The report also classified Australia as an `easy to dismiss' country. Only the US, New Zealand and Canada had legislation which provided less protection. It is disgraceful that a developed, Western country such as ours rates so poorly. I know the Howard government likes to mimic everything American, but this does not absolve it from its responsibility to develop a system of governance that is second to none.
Finally, I would just like to point out some contradictions in the government's position. By defining small business as a company with 20 or less employees a business might, in an attempt to retain their exemption, maintain their work force at 20 or less. Alternatively, it may encourage some firms to downsize so they can cash in on the exemption. It is also feasible that bigger businesses may split into numerous separate companies of 20 or less so they can hire and fire at will. This is not such a far-fetched idea. Burswood casino in Western Australia used a similar strategy to avoid its legal commitments. Burswood casino entered into an enterprise bargaining agreement with the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union. To avoid its legal obligations under the agreement, Burswood set up a separate company and made all its workers join it and sign AWAs. The new company was not bound by the previous agreement, allowing Burswood to successfully circumvent its legal obligations. It is already the case that businesses create other companies in an attempt to escape from their legal obligations, and I fear that this bill will only reinforce this practice.
The Labor Party is not in the business of making life harder for employers. We are genuinely supportive of the rights of employers to hire and fire in the interests of their business. However, this proposed bill does not affect employers doing the right thing. An employer who is fair in the employment of casuals—and, indeed, the dismissal of casuals—has nothing to fear from a strong and effective unfair dismissal system. In fact, all the evidence suggests that it is not even a major issue or a hindrance to job creation. Furthermore, the Labor Party believes it has the support of the business community when it says that this legislation is unnecessarily endangering the young people of this country. Business owners, like employees, are also mums and dads; as such, they do not want a system where their children or their family members can be discriminated against, harassed and made to feel inferior by bad, unscrupulous employers protected by this government's approach to workplace relations.
I would like to remind the minister and the House that casual employment in this nation is growing rapidly. Between August 1988 and August 1998, 69 per cent of net growth in the number of workers was in casual employment. This trend will almost certainly continue for the foreseeable future, and, as such, this government has an obligation to the casual workers of this nation to protect their rights in a fair and equitable manner. This bill will create a two-tiered industrial system where a worker in a company with 21 employees will have more rights than a worker in a company with 20 employees. I believe that all Australians are entitled to be treated equally and to be given a fair go, and that this should not change when they step into the workplace. The Labor Party is particularly concerned about this legislation's potential to allow the workers of employers with federal agreements to work with the threat of unfair dismissal. Labor's commitment to the youth of Australia will not allow the acceptance of such vexatious policy.
There are myriad options that the Howard government could pursue to assist business, particularly small business. These options include taxation reform, shifting the focus in unfair dismissal from compensation to reinstatement, and simplifying the system itself. However, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, is letting his ideology rather than the public interest drive workplace relations policy. This bill has the potential to cause the sacking of a significant number of Australians for no justifiable reason. It seems that Mr Abbott is not only content with workers having bad bosses with poor skills; he has also given them the means to be without a boss at all.
This bill is vexatious to the confidence of a significant number of Australian workers. Before you give an organisation, individual or group an automatic exemption, you should have to justify it by proving it is in the public interest. This has not been done. In fact, this bill will disadvantage the most vulnerable members of the community. If no justification can be found, and we are just exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws because they want to be exempted, then should we also exempt them from paying tax and superannuation, because I am sure they would like that also? I oppose the passage of this bill and encourage the minister to go back to the drawing board, consult with workers and bring in amendments which are constructive, practical, fair and just.
The government should spend the money that they are wasting on advertising some of their workplace relations reforms by giving funding to the business enterprise centres so that they can continue to run their excellent programs in skilling up small business people in the running of their businesses—including the skills to appraise, support, supervise and deal with workers in the context of performing for their business. They should do that rather than continue with these amendments, which give a very strong message to the community that casuals, contract workers and young people are expendable on the whim of someone who may lack the skills to be a good employer and who thinks they have a right to do this because of whatever is happening in their business. I oppose the amendment and hope it does not go through—like the previous one.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2002-10-21,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] has been before this parliament in one form or another since 1996. It is a pleasure to follow the member for Stirling, who has clearly outlined the Labor Party's position. It is also a pleasure to follow the member for Watson, the member for Isaacs, the member for Rankin, the member for Brisbane, the member for Blaxland and the member for Throsby—all the Labor Party members who have spoken since the previous government member spoke on this piece of legislation. The Labor Party are prepared to come into this parliament and to stand up for their convictions and argue their points of view, but it seems as though the government members have deserted this legislation and are not prepared to debate it.
This legislation is designed to remove the protection that people who work for larger companies have from being dismissed unfairly for workers employed by smaller companies. The legislation is not an attack on the trade union movement, as so much of the government's legislation is; it is an attack on the rights of individual workers, as a large number of people who work in small businesses do not belong to trade unions. It is an attack on workers who are most vulnerable—those who do not have the protection of a trade union movement. In his second reading speech, the minister boasted that one million jobs had been created since the government came to office in 1996. We do not argue that job growth is not good, but there is no evidence that job security has increased over the same period of time. We must remember that most of the job growth has been in the part-time and casual labour market and in low paid jobs. How many extra jobs would be created if small business were exempt from unfair dismissal legislation is pure conjecture, and I will speak about this later in my speech.
One assumes that employers are careful when they select their employees. The need to sack workers for a misdemeanour would, I believe, be rare, and both sides, I think, would be careful. The employer would be careful, and I think most employees are responsible workers, so they would not put themselves in a position whereby they would have to be dismissed. In my view, the time spent by an employer in handling the rare case of an unfair dismissal would pale into insignificance compared with the many managerial decisions that small business managers accept as part of running their business. The minister uses a very weak argument in his second reading speech—that many small business owners are not confident that they know how to comply with the dismissal laws. I believe that that is an insult to small business people. Is the minister suggesting that small business owners are dills? These are the very same small business owners that run complicated business enterprises and that have to come to grips with the GST and other complicated legal issues concerning their businesses.
It is just a red herring to suggest that unfair dismissal legislation is more complicated and time consuming than other aspects of running a small business—it is not. It is certainly not an argument to change the laws. It is a demonstration that the government has not done its job properly in informing small business owners of how the current laws work. It is an argument for better education from the government; it is not an argument for changing the laws. Sure, small businesses try to reduce their administrative costs—we accept that—as part of running a business. But do we suggest that they do not have to pay their taxes or council rates? Small businesses, indeed all business people, are required to pay large fees to solicitors, tax agents and accountants as part of their normal running costs. I believe that the rare occasions on which small businesses would have to handle an unfair dismissal claim would be fairly minute. If a single small business is facing unfair dismissal claim after unfair dismissal claim, then perhaps they need to examine their own employment practices. Of course, most small businesses are not facing repeated unfair dismissal claims, if they face any at all.
Having previously spoken several times on this legislation, I would like to reiterate in general terms some of the compelling arguments that I have used previously in opposing the principles of this bill. The principal argument, going to the unfairness of the changes proposed in this bill, is that it leaves a significant section of the work force without the basic protection enjoyed by workers employed in medium to large businesses. It is fair to say that the proposed changes will have only a marginal impact, if any, on the viability of small businesses. I believe that most workplace disputes and most cases of unfair dismissal are settled reasonably.
In one of my earlier speeches, I spoke of a constituent who had been dismissed from a small panel-beating workshop. This worker had worked for this company for a number of years. He had a couple of days off sick and, when he returned to work, he was dismissed. When the worker inquired as to why he was being dismissed, the employer said, `There are a couple of reasons I can give, but the easiest for me is to simply say that there is insufficient work,' even though the worker had been working considerable overtime prior to his dismissal. This worker made a claim for unfair dismissal and was prepared to settle for his award entitlement. He was given a week's pay when he left the company. The commission awarded him another two weeks pay, which was his award entitlement. This is a case of a fair settlement to an unfair dismissal case.
The government would argue that a financial settlement for people who have been unjustly dismissed places an unfair cost on employers, but what about the massive salaries and redundancy payments that directors and CEOs get—the golden parachute, as it is now called? It is all relative: the more the top end of the town sucks out of the system, the less there is for the small end of town. Just to emphasise that particular point, in the 90-second statements today I referred to Deborah Katnic, a constituent of mine who is having a dispute with Warringah Mall relating to her right to park her car on the employer's premises. One of the things that made the workers very agitated in this particular dispute was the fact that the AMP—the company that was making these people pay $4 a day to park their cars—was the same company that was paying its chief executive some $7 million in a redundancy payout. That simply shows the unfairness of the situation.
Most small businesses work for large companies—for example, an engine component manufacturer in my electorate works for the big car companies. It is important to remember that small businesses do not necessarily operate in isolation; they are, in many cases, contracted to big businesses. The government wants to stop workers in small enterprises from getting their award entitlements—a few weeks pay when they are unfairly sacked—but does not seem to be doing much when a director runs a large company into the ground, threatening the jobs of thousands, and then gets a multimillion-dollar bonus.
When I spoke on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 on 20 February this year, I finished my remarks with the statement:
The bill should and will be consigned to the rubbish bin of history.
The minister has reached into the bin and pulled out the crumpled bit of paper, flicked off the bits of stale orange peel and sandwich crumbs, tried to smooth it out and make it presentable and has moved it yet again. All told, in various forms, I believe this is the eighth attempt to bring in this particular piece of legislation. Of course, it will not work because, no matter how the minister likes to dress it up, this legislation is simply a piece of garbage. This legislation tries to take away the rights of some Australian citizens. It tries to create two classes of workers: those with rights and those without rights. There is no logic to this bill—none whatsoever. Why should someone be penalised and have fewer rights simply because they work for a small business? Why pick on them? Why single them out for special treatment? It makes no sense.
This legislation is antiworker and anti-Australian. The government have a history and a habit of bashing workers who join trade unions. With this piece of legislation, they have turned their attack on workers who are not members of trade unions. As I have said, most workers in small businesses are not members of trade unions. It is not the business of the Labor Party whether or not a worker is a member of a trade union—that is their right—but we stand by their side. We want to protect all workers whether or not they are trade union members.
It does not seem to matter to the government. They want to attack, denigrate and remove the rights of all workers whether or not they are members of trade unions. This legislation is a clear example of this. There can be no more startling evidence of the difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party than the issue of protecting workers' rights. We want to protect; they want to destroy. The feudal system was dismantled centuries ago, and those who believe they are the lords and masters have been trying to turn back the clock ever since. Workers have rights, and those rights have been recognised in struggle after struggle over the years. Any attempt to take away those rights is an undemocratic and backward step in society's evolution.
The Labor Party recognises that small business is the engine room of the economy. Small business must flourish to create jobs and improve the outcomes for workers—for ordinary Australians. To emphasise this point, I will quote from the speech by the shadow minister, Mr McClelland. In recognising the role of small business, the shadow minister said:
In total, 3.1 million people work in small business as either proprietors or employees. It is the major driver of jobs growth in the economy.
This is something we all recognise. He continued:
We recognise that and, for that reason, we have said on a number of occasions that it is imperative that the burdens of unnecessary paperwork, complexity, legal form and procedure be removed from small business so they can get on with the job of creating successful businesses and employing people. 
The member for Stirling made the point quite clearly, when talking about the complexities of the many issues that small business have to contend with, that the taxation system is far more complicated, time consuming and expensive for small business to operate than any form of unfair dismissal.
We also acknowledge that the system is not perfect. Changes have been made, and will need to continue to be made, to adjust to changing circumstances. However, the sledgehammer approach taken by this government of simply stripping away a person's basic rights is not the way to go. A sledgehammer is a weapon of destruction, not a tool of construction, and a government needs to be constructive in order to build a better society. Nobody ever built anything with a sledgehammer. The real and necessary reform that must take place in this area is being hampered by the government's blinkered ideology. This legislation is more about politics than it is about industrial relations. This is the eighth time this legislation has come up and on seven previous occasions it has been rejected. That should tell you something about the quality of the legislation and the government's argument. It has been up eight times and it has been exactly the same legislation each time, except for a slight definitional change that redefined a slightly larger business as a small business when the proposal was changed from 15 employees to 20 employees. This legislation has not changed because the government refuses to negotiate, refuses to compromise, refuses to look at any alternative view or suggestion and refuses to do anything positive at all. On any other legislation, negotiations take place, differing views are accommodated, and compromise is made; that is the nature and essence of democracy. With this legislation, none of the normal practices of government—none of the practices of democracy—have taken place, and as a result we must ask the question: why? One must question the motivation behind this belligerent stand.
Once again, Labor will be moving substantive amendments to this bill during the committee stages. These amendments are designed to reduce procedural red tape for small business and to reduce costs imposed on small business while still protecting workers' rights and entitlements. It will be a win-win situation. If the government were prepared to accept the amendments moved by the Labor Party, you would have a more efficient small business sector as well as satisfied employees who had better job security. They are positive, constructive amendments designed to address the problems associated with unfair dismissal and its burden on small business. These amendments, like all the others we have moved in the past, will not be accepted by the government—I am afraid to say—primarily because they actually address the problems, they are positive and they are logical. If the amendments were accepted and the legislation passed, then the government would lose its double dissolution trigger; and quite clearly that is what it is all about. It would lose the chance to score petty political points by spreading the lie that Labor is anti small business—we are not.
The government does not want this legislation passed. It wants to be able to create this climate of a double dissolution and to then hold over this parliament the possibility of a further election. It has shown that by its refusal to consider any one of these amendments moved by the Labor Party. The real obstruction to reasonable and decent unfair dismissal laws in this country is the federal government. No matter how the government tries to dress it up, regardless of the spin it is the government itself which is stalling this legislation. I say to the government and to the minister: leave the spinning to Shane Warne and start working constructively to make the system fairer for everybody involved.
Labor have listened to the concerns of small business, and we have learnt a thing or two about the issue. Our amendments address the concerns that small businesses have. If the government were serious about finding a solution to this problem, it would sit down and listen to small businesses as well. There is absolutely no proof that the current system costs jobs—none whatsoever. On 15 November 2001, in Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants, the Federal Court said:
It seems unfortunate that nobody has investigated whether there is any relationship between unfair dismissal legislation and employment growth. There has been much assertion on this topic during recent years, but apparently no effort to ascertain the factual situation.
That is the legal system of this country speaking. Once again, to back up that particular decision, the shadow minister said in his speech:
Insofar as this bill proposes to exempt employees from federal unfair dismissal laws, when you analyse it you find it is not the answer. The reason I say that is that to be covered by federal unfair dismissal laws a small business must be both a corporation and covered by a federal industrial award. On the basis of research I have seen, it is estimated that around 27 per cent of small businesses are in that category.
It is only 27 per cent. There has been no effort to obtain the facts on this issue—none. What has this minister been doing? If he believed in his position so utterly, he would have put in place a study to find out what the factual situation is. But there is no study. There has been no inquiry—not even one with a bodgie set of terms of reference that has been stacked with his mates, like the government's efforts with Telstra.
You would think that, if the government felt so secure in its position, it would have produced some kind of documentation, some set of statistics from somewhere that would back it up. But it has not. It is a pretty damning critique from the Federal Court of this country. But, as I have said, the government does not want this legislation to pass because it is more useful to it politically to have the legislation remain on the shelf or in the bin, as the case may be. This government is more interested in its petty political games than in addressing the concerns of small business owners and workers across the country. This is a bad piece of legislation. It should and will be consigned to the rubbish bin of history—until the next time the minister reaches in, drags it out, flicks off the stale orange peel, tries to flatten out the wrinkles and puts it up to be knocked over once again. God loves a trier.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2002-10-21,"—I rise tonight to speak on the subject of schools. Firstly, I congratulate two schools in my electorate which were short-listed for the Australian's best schools of 2002, Unley High School and Brighton Secondary School, both excellent schools which provide a very positive learning environment for students in my electorate.
I want to speak tonight on the issue of Coromandel Valley Primary School. Coromandel Valley Primary School celebrates its 125th anniversary this year, but students are currently learning in transportables which are 25 years old. In July 2001, I was delighted when the then federal minister for education, Dr David Kemp, wrote to me approving the payment of $1.2 million for permanent classrooms at this primary school. I was able to announce the funding at that time, and it was agreed that the South Australian state government would make a contribution so that the school would receive a $2 million upgrade—a very significant upgrade for a primary school in my electorate. It was due to commence in May 2002 and to be completed in 2003. In January this year, the then South Australian state Treasurer, Rob Lucas, committed to maintaining the $2 million allocation for the redevelopment of the school if re-elected.
You can imagine the school's disappointment when, in July 2002, Jeff Walsh, the new chief executive of the South Australian Department of Education and Children's Services, wrote to them and announced that, as $17 million over four years had been reallocated to other schools, the proposed project for Coromandel primary school was going to be deferred. After meeting with Glen Phillips, the chairperson of the Coromandel Valley Primary School council, and being made aware of this, I contacted Dr Brendan Nelson and wrote a letter on 26 July with the local state member, the Hon. Iain Evans, asking the minister to use whatever powers he had to ensure that the federal government's $1.2 million was spent on the school that it was given to.
Mr Speaker, you would be aware that there are similar projects at Gawler Primary School and Orroroo Area School in the electorate of Grey which have also been deferred. Dr Nelson has advised me that the Commonwealth will withhold an amount equivalent to these grants until the state undertakes the works they have already received money for. The states may not remove a project from the list of approved Commonwealth funding without Commonwealth approval—and it appears they did this. They also may not divert money without Commonwealth approval—and it appears this has happened. Where is the $1.2 million that was given for the school? In his letter to me, Dr Nelson also says:
While there are some instances in which capital projects must be deferred for legitimate reasons, I am yet to be convinced that this is the case for most of the South Australian projects in question. I cannot accept confirmed Commonwealth payments being diverted to other purposes by the State while the needs of schools like Coromandel Valley Primary School are perpetually deferred.
I could not agree more. 
There are two issues here. Firstly, there is the reallocation of money which was originally given for Coromandel Valley Primary School. Secondly, and more disturbingly, I have now become aware that the state minister, Mrs Trish White, has stated that the state government are committed to completing the project by December 2004, yet the state department's capital works group is unaware of this commitment and has not allocated any funds to complete the project. It is not good enough. I will continue to raise the issue of Coromandel Valley Primary School until the money which has already been given by the Commonwealth government to the state government actually goes to the school that it was given for.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Boothby Electorate: Coromandel Valley Primary School</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech
