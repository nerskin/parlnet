"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-07,"—by leave—I move the motion as amended:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5), (6) and (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003
Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003
Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8) 2003",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-07,"—Despite the fact that a number of bills have been taken off this list by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, we still have included the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003, and I note from the list that has gone around that there will be four speakers on that bill. I point out that no committee has considered that bill and there has been no widespread consultation, as there ought to be, with the community, including the legal community. It is a far-reaching bill. It in effect extends Australian law to Australians who are serving the country overseas in various ways at the expense of the domestic law in whichever country they may be serving. For example, it will cover Australian personnel working in Iraq so that if they commit a crime while in Iraq they will be brought to justice under Australian law rather than Iraqi law. There are good arguments for and against that, but this bill is quite a deal wider than the New Zealand equivalent, which extends, in the case of that country, to personnel from New Zealand in the Solomon Islands. But behind it is the whole matter of the jurisdiction of countries that have a controlling interest, for one reason or another, over domestic countries and who may get into trouble and then their law becomes supreme over that country's domestic law.
Where is the international debate about this? What are the United Nations's norms on this? Why is it that under this legislation we suddenly are going to cover the whole world instead of just the Solomon Islands and/or Iraq? These are matters that we ought to be hearing a debate on. There should be a Senate inquiry, and there should be reference to international experts on the matter. Instead of that, we are getting the cut-off here, the bill being brought in and debated this afternoon, the bill passing and its becoming law. I think that is a wholly inefficient way of dealing with an extremely important piece of legislation like this. It has very great ramifications in international law as well as our domestic law. It is on that basis that the Greens are opposing this cut-off motion. It simply denies the Senate both the right and the obligation to adequately confer with the experts in the field on this matter.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-07,"—It is within the Senate's capacity to send any bill to a committee. We have the Selection of Bills Committee process, as you, Mr President, would know from your own experience as the chairman of that committee for many years. Any senator can initiate the reference of a bill to a committee through that process. It is virtually automatic if you do that. If you cannot get it through there, you bring it to the floor of the chamber. I think anyone who stands up in the Senate and says that a bill cannot get proper scrutiny when it comes to the Senate—
—I'm saying it hasn't had proper scrutiny.
—There is no reason why this bill could not have had more scrutiny if someone had sought it. I am not sure, because I do not have the information at my fingertips, but I understand that no senator sought that this bill be referred to a committee. If Senator Brown, after consideration of it, after the selection of bills meeting and after all of the processes of the parliament, has decided that it should go to a committee, he has obviously woken up to it a bit late, but no other senator has shown any interest in having this bill referred to a committee. 
Not every bill goes to a committee. Back in the old days, in the nineties, in the last millennium, I think—and I am speaking off the top of my head—something like 15 per cent of bills used to go to committees. I think that about 30 per cent now do. That is a good thing for the scrutiny of legislation by the parliament. It frustrates government sometimes when bills go to committee and take a long time to come back, but the reality is that good committee consideration of a bill is good for the legislation. It usually picks up things that the government, bureaucrats and draftspeople have not picked up, and it generally can improve bills. It allows the community, as Senator Brown has said, to have a say on legislation. So it is a good process, but not every bill needs to go to a committee. Roughly, 30 per cent of bills do; 70 per cent of them do not. This one has fallen into the 70 per cent category. And, of course, when it gets into the parliament, it can have proper scrutiny through the committee stage here. I commend my motion to the Senate.

I note for the record that these amendments are close to identical to amendments also distributed by Senator Brown on sheet 3112. These amendments are very important. They continue the debate that we had in the last sitting fortnight about the importance of recognising a broader definition of `dependant' and a broader definition of `spouse' in both superannuation and tax law. These particular amendments go to the heart of the discriminatory provisions in that they deal with not just the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act but also the Income Tax Assessment Act. 
We raise two issues here. One is the definition of `spouse', which we dealt with extensively on the last occasion. I would reiterate the very strong view of the Democrats that the definition of `spouse' in federal superannuation law is archaic and needs to be updated. It has now been updated in all state legislation to ensure that de facto couples, regardless of their sexuality, are given equal treatment, and it is time we do it at the federal level. We have had this debate in this place on 11 previous occasions—in fact, 12 occasions including the last sitting fortnight—and I do not propose to raise it again, but I do believe it is a matter of importance for human rights and I certainly commend these amendments to the chamber.
We also include in these amendments, probably for the first time in the 12 times we have debated these issues in the chamber, a second category of definition, which is the definition of what we call an `interdependency relationship'. An interdependency relationship is defined as a relationship between two people that is acknowledged by both and which involves residing together and being closely interdependent and having a continuing commitment to mutual emotional and financial support. This definition is a very important one. It draws on section 238 of the Migration Act, so it is recognising a well-defined area of law at the moment. It picks up not just the area of spouses but also the broader area of family or genuine domestic relationships where there is a genuine commitment to each other, a genuine sharing of financial resources and also a genuine notion of interdependence. That is very important. Under the current superannuation act, under the definition of `dependant', which is also replicated in section 27AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the issue of dependence has been found by the courts to come down to the issue of not just full financial dependence but partial financial dependence. 
So we are getting down to the situation where it has been found in some of the cases that payment of maybe $25 or $35 board a week to another person makes that person dependent on them for the purposes of tax and super law. So we are getting down into an area of picking up some of these very complicated genuine domestic relationships that exist out there. But the whole notion of where there is interdependence, shared financial resources, shared emotional resources and shared living resources is not yet picked up under the act. The Democrats come from the fundamental point of view that we do not believe that tax law or super law should ultimately dictate who you can and cannot leave your death benefits to and whether or not those death benefits should be taxed. I hope at some stage the government will consider this fairly fundamental issue on its merits—the notion of whether tax law should dictate which types of relationships, which types of families, which types of households are respected for the purpose of superannuation law and which types of death benefits are or are not taxed for the purposes of tax law. 
This definition at least will include and broaden out that area of partial financial dependency, which is currently reflected under the tax law, and take it out to include interdependency, which includes people who have made a decision to share their resources and their lives with each other. It may not be spouses living together, but it covers situations of mothers and sons living together, brothers living together and very old friends living together who have chosen to make a commitment of financially and emotionally supporting each other. Under migration law this area has been well established. It has resulted in a great deal of fairness and equity being added into migration law in this country. I certainly commend these provisions to the chamber.
I acknowledge that, if these amendments were passed, regulations would need to be established, as exist under the Migration Act, to broaden out what these definitions apply to. It is a very important area. I come back to my fundamental point that, if the government believes in providing more choice in superannuation, choice should extend to not just what happens to your super when you are alive but what happens to your super when you are dead. If the government is fundamentally opposed to death duties, as it has said in many leaflets criticising the Democrats over many years, then it should also start raising the question as to why certain death benefits of superannuation are taxed and why some are not. This amendment tries to get to the bottom of that by taking out the notion of partial dependency, which is currently recognised at law, to include interdependency. It is an important amendment. It is an important advance. I hope that, on this particular occasion, we will eventually get government support for it.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-07,"—I rise to speak in favour of the amendments moved by Senator Cherry. I would like to revisit briefly part of the debate we were having in this broad area when we last sat on 18 September 2003. Later that day when I returned to my office I received the following email, which I would like to read with the sender's consent. I was contacted by Mr Bruce Baker, who is President of Boutique Financial Planning Principals Groups Inc., which he notes is a small AFS licensees association. We were debating at the time the notion raised in part by Senator Harradine that perhaps one way to deal with this would be for superannuants to leave their moneys to a will. Mr Baker raised the following points with me, and he makes a good point which has not been covered in much of the discussion we have had so far. His email says:
While driving yesterday, I heard (on NewsRadio) part of the discussion regarding how a person who is a member of a super fund might make arrangements for their dependants in the event of this person's death.
I heard part of what you had to say. 
He is referring to me when he says `you'. The email continues:
I had the impression there was a belief that a person's Will could direct a super fund trustee to pay superannuation death benefits to the person of their choice (as long as they were a dependant as defined under the SIS Act). This is not so—for 99.99% of super funds. In the vast bulk of cases, a Will might record the member's wishes but does not have the force of law to compel the super fund trustee to comply.
In the vast majority of cases, a member may nominate a death beneficiary, but the trustee has discretion (after taking the member's wishes—and the needs of other beneficiaries into account) as to whom the benefit is paid. This is quite problematic and can readily lead to death benefits being paid to others than those intended—in a range of circumstances. Trustees' discretion in this matter has also led to a range of complaints to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.
To try to deal with this problem, the SIS Act was amended a few years ago to allow a fund to offer a binding death benefit nomination—to increase the certainty as to whom death benefits were paid. However, this still leaves 2 problematic issues:
* First a large proportion of superannuation funds do not offer binding death benefit nominations.
* Second, a binding death benefit nomination lapses if not refreshed every 3 years. If the super fund member suffers dementia (i.e. legal incompetence) during these 3 years, he/she cannot refresh their death benefit nomination—
and it lapses—
and the death benefit may (depending on the trust deed of the fund) revert to trustees discretion. Clearly the people to whom binding death benefit nominations are most important (older people) are also the people most likely to suffer dementia. This is a very serious weakness in the SIS Act. If a Will does not lapse after 3 years if not refreshed, a binding death benefit nomination should not lapse after 3 years if not refreshed. Wills and Binding Death Benefit Nominations are very similar instruments—so there should be similar rules—to help reduce the confusion that the public has about these matters—and to just be consistent. 
I would appreciate it if you could raise this issue in the Senate.
And I am pleased to have done so. In the context of that email, obviously I reiterate my strong desire for this issue to be resolved in the manner the chamber is articulating—three or four different sets of amendments, some of which have been passed and another which we have before us—and to go to the heart of this matter, rather than try to circumvent the issue by trying to, if you like, launder superannuation death benefits through a will. I have already said that there are several problematic reasons with that. Mr Baker has rightly pointed out there are further reasons which I was not conscious of at the time and on which I now have better information. For that reason, the amendments that Senator Cherry is advocating ought to be strongly supported.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-07,"—The Australian Greens support these amendments and have some complementary amendments. The committee is dealing with superannuation legislation to which these amendments have been added to eliminate discrimination against same sex and dependent partners in the field of superannuation insofar as we can both in the public sector and the private sector. Labor, the Greens and the Democrats have moved and are moving a series of amendments which, put together, would have that effect. For the reasons that Senator Greig has just outlined and, before him, Senator Cherry, you see quite clearly that leaving the legislation as it is is totally unsatisfactory and discriminatory. For example, if a mother and daughter have depended on each other and lived together for many years in the same household, superannuation going to the daughter will have accrued, but if the daughter were to precede her mother in dying and if the mother did in fact receive the superannuation benefits they would be taxed. 
We have been talking about same sex couples who, despite decades together, cannot be assured that when one dies the other will be the beneficiary of superannuation. What they do know is that in that process they may lose 30 per cent of the superannuation in taxation, whereas heterosexual couples do not have that applying to them. So it is very discriminatory. The process in these amendments is basically to bring justice to all citizens who earn and pay for superannuation and want to see the same value come from their superannuation contributions as would be the case for any other citizen. That is what this suite of amendments would do.
In the two-week period since we last debated this there has been some press speculation that the Democrats are not going to insist on these amendments. It would help if we could have the air cleared on that, because the process we are debating now is an important one. It appears that these amendments will go through. They will go to the House of Representatives. The government is not going to accept them. We will then be in a position where the legislation comes back to the chamber and the chamber has to decide whether it will stand firm on the amendments. It may be that the Democrats have not decided what they will do at that stage, but it would certainly help the process of this legislation if we knew whether a decision had been made on the matter.
I should say that the Democrats have been champions in this field for many years. What has changed is that the Labor Party has changed its past objections to amendments like these and is now supporting them. That has created a difficult position for the Democrats, because they were supporting the government's package of legislation—influenced and improved by the Democrats—but these amendments have now been added and are a very important third component of it. I would like to know the direction in which we are headed as far as this important component of it is concerned, and I know that many people in the community would as well.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-07,"—The Labor Party will be supporting the amendments moved by the Democrats that we are currently considering. I think Senator Brown still has his amendment. We will deal with that shortly. When we debated this issue in the last sitting week I moved an amendment to remove the discriminations that apply to superannuation in respect of same sex couples. I do not want to go back through that debate at any great length, but there are two important issues. One is the important principle of removing discrimination against same sex couples in a range of areas in our society. In order to do that with respect to superannuation, the amendments that we are now considering—and the amendment we have already passed and, indeed, Senator Brown's amendment—need to be carried.
There is an additional argument with respect to superannuation—that is, superannuation is the individual property of a person. Government does not interfere with the property rights of individuals and to whom they would choose to leave their property in any other circumstance that I can think of. The one area where government—the state—does interfere and attempts to change the wishes of an individual is in respect of superannuation, which is the individual's own property. That is fundamentally wrong. In moving the amendments successfully in the last sitting week and in supporting the amendments today, Labor has taken the view that, because we have a package—an agreement—between the government and the Democrats, there is at least a reasonable chance that we will be able to progress this issue.
I do not know what the future holds. Senator Brown has asked Senator Cherry to clarify on behalf of the Democrats what they will be doing when the message returns from the House of Representatives. Given the statements on the record by the minister, Senator Coonan, and subsequently in the media following the last sitting fortnight, presumably the government will reject the amendment that Labor successfully moved, the amendment that will be passed here that the Democrats have moved and the amendment that will be passed that Senator Brown has moved. The government will reject those; there will be a message to the Senate. It would be useful to know what the government's position and Senator Cherry's and the Australian Democrats' position will be.
Secondly, Senator Greig has read an email communication from a financial planner. There was some discussion about at least some of these issues on the last occasion. The binding death benefit is a partial solution. Very few people enter into a binding death benefit with respect to superannuation. I do not have the statistics, though I have tried to find out, but I understand that it is very rare for a person to enter into a binding death benefit with respect to superannuation. Therefore, it is not a solution to argue that people should enter into a binding death benefit. They simply do not do it. Most people do not even know it exists, so it is not a solution.
Senator Greig today has drawn our attention to an issue that we did not discuss on the last occasion, though it was an issue I was aware of. Generally, most people in the community are not aware that their will can be overridden by superannuation trustees whether they are part of a same sex couple or not. The issue has occasionally been raised with me where a will has indicated the property distribution of an individual, and I have found that people in the community are not aware that superannuation trustees do not have to take any notice of the will. Generally, they do. From my discussions of this issue with trustees over the last couple of weeks, I know that they generally follow the will. But they do not have to. In some cases, of course, where they are not legally required to take notice of the will, there can be very debilitating, lengthy and costly legal proceedings involving the superannuation trustees and very difficult disputes where the trustees choose to ignore the wishes of the will—if there is one.
The other process is that, when most Australians join a superannuation fund, they can indicate on the form that goes to the superannuation fund their preferred beneficiary. Again, I have checked this. Apparently, less than half of the Australians who are in a superannuation fund actually nominate a preferred beneficiary and, where they do, they often do not change it afterwards if there are changed circumstances. Generally, Australians do not change the death beneficiary on their superannuation.
Given the amount of moneys in superannuation—that is, the total of the savings, which is increasing over time—and particularly given issues relating to death and disability insurance, this can become a very messy area. It can become an area of significant disputation for not just same sex couples but all people in the community who have superannuation. I am not sure what the answer is, to be frank, for the general community or how to address the difficulties people have if they do not nominate a beneficiary of their superannuation or if they do not have a binding death nomination. I am not sure what the solution to this problem is. However, we are dealing with amendments moved by the Democrats that I think deal conclusively with ending discrimination against same sex couples in respect of their superannuation. As I said, I support them on behalf of the Labor Party. I think it is appropriate that we progress the issue in this area. This is an opportunity to do so on a package of bills we know the government wants. We know the government wants this legislation, and the Democrats obviously want the legislation because they are party to some signed-up document that I have not seen but that the minister has referred to. I hope we can progress this issue.
I notice that some in the media have analysed some comments made by, amongst others, the minister, Senator Coonan, before she entered the parliament. Those comments are on the public record. I notice there has been some examination of comments made on the public record by some other people, such as Mr Abbott and Dr Nelson. Dr Nelson's public comments on this issue do not surprise me; I guess I was a little surprised at Mr Abbott's public utterances on this issue.
Labor is hopeful that we can progress this issue via these amendments. I would hope that, since we last debated the issue two weeks ago, the government has had a change of heart. I would be interested to know from the minister whether this matter has been re-examined in the last fortnight and whether what I think have been convincing arguments and debate in the chamber around this issue have led to a change of attitude by the government. I could ask for the details of the debate that I hope occurred around the cabinet table since the committee last met, and I could ask for an outline of Senator Coonan's recommendations, Mr Abbott's position and Dr Nelson's position—and I am sure there are a number of others who expressed a view—but I would not get it because of cabinet confidentiality. It would have been interesting to have been a fly on the wall in that debate, if it occurred, in cabinet in the last two weeks. Labor will support the amendments before the chair.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-07,"—I rise to put on the record on behalf of all of the Democrats, and to clear up any confusion about it—and there has been some confusion and some misinformation as well about what the Democrats' approach is to both the issue before the chamber at the moment, the Democrats amendments, and the legislation more broadly—the Democrats' position on this issue. The amendments before the chamber, as Senator Sherry quite rightly said, clearly and effectively address the discrimination currently faced by same sex couples in aspects of superannuation law. That is only one aspect of the discrimination against same sex couples in many areas of Commonwealth law. As has been acknowledged, the Democrats have been trying for a long time to address that discrimination across the board rather than in bits and pieces. It has been a matter of intense frustration to us as a party that we have not been able to make progress on that through the Senate with either of the major parties. It is therefore significant and welcome that Labor is supporting these and other amendments that address discrimination against same sex couples.
It is worth noting, and I suspect it is not completely irrelevant, that Labor have chosen to support amendments such as these to a bill they do not support. That support is, of course, crucial with respect to their willingness to support these amendments, which deal with discrimination against same sex couples. But it is nonetheless welcome and it signals to the Democrats that there has been—potentially—a change of heart in the ALP, and we will redouble our efforts to move appropriate amendments to other legislation where possible to address discrimination in other areas. I would have to say that superannuation is probably not the largest area where discrimination affects same sex couples. I would say taxation is the biggest, but there are plenty of other areas as well: immigration law, the social security and welfare system, superannuation and other financial areas and the affairs of veterans and defence forces. That is to name just a few areas where there are Public Service rules. I happily signal to the chamber—and it is worth the government noting this in terms of other issues they may wish to progress—that the Democrats will further utilise the potential shift in attitudes of the major parties to try and remove some of this discrimination in a whole range of areas.
To indicate the Democrats' view on what we will do once the government has considered these amendments, I can simply say—as has been suggested—that we have not decided what we will do if the government decides to insist. At this stage we want to maximise the pressure on the government to not insist, particularly with respect to these amendments. It is worth noting, of course, that the government does change its position, despite what it may say in this chamber or publicly. There is no easier example of that to point to than the significant changes in position in relation to health issues and the area of medical indemnity insurance—an area in which Senator Coonan herself made quite strong and unequivocal statements. The government's position has changed. That is not a criticism of Senator Coonan. If anything, it is a word of praise that this government is willing to change its view given further reflection, further consideration and further assessment of the political realities and the policy issues. I do not think it is accurate to say that there is no prospect of any change in the government's attitude. I do not even think it is particularly worth while getting further indications from the minister at the moment about what she or the government may do, because obviously it is a matter for the government to consider more fully once it has the final legislation before it after it has passed through the Senate.
I think the debate should now focus on finalising the legislation and getting it passed through the Senate. We have been debating it for quite a period of time, and I think many people in the community thought it was passed a couple of weeks ago. Of course we still have some matters to deal with, but no doubt we can deal with those today. It is an issue that the Democrats are obviously keen to progress because—unlike the ALP and, as I understand it, the Green party—we do support the significantly amended legislation, including the same sex amendments. It is a significant win for low-income earners—a significant amount of money has been removed from high-income earners and has been dramatically expanded in providing savings assistance to low-income earners. It is not a magic solution to everything, but it is a significant step forward and a significant achievement that the Democrats have managed, and we are keen to see it progress.
It is no secret to anybody in this chamber or in the community that we are also keen to see the issue of the removal of discrimination against same sex couples progressed. We will continue to examine every parliamentary and political opportunity to progress that issue. It is a significant area of injustice in our society, which has been identified for a long period of time but which continues to be resisted at the federal parliamentary level. To get those changes through, of course, we have to get parliamentary approval, and this is a good opportunity for the Senate to try to advance the chances of that outcome.
As I said before—and I signal now to the government and the minister—there are plenty of other bills and issues on the table, some of which the Democrats will be pivotal in enabling or otherwise the passage of. It is an issue which the government will need to continue to confront, particularly if the ALP's position remains consistent in removing discrimination against same sex couples. Whether or not that approach will continue consistently on bills that the ALP support as opposed to bills the ALP oppose, we shall have to wait and see. But that is part of the unknowns that we will be seeing in the near future in this chamber and that, amongst other things, will determine what the Democrats' approach will be to the future outcome of this legislation—should the government not agree to the amendments that the chamber makes. But that, as is not uncommon, is an issue to be considered down the track rather than predetermining what we will do. It is obviously less than ideal to predetermine what we will do in relation to a particular outcome when there are so many different factors in play and so many potential and possible responses from a variety of players, including not just the government but the opposition.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-07,"—Senator Bartlett—I do not think deliberately—misrepresents our position. We are considering two measures: one is the exclusive tax cut on superannuation for high-income earners. It is an exclusive tax cut that only applies to those Australians whose taxable income is greater than $95,600—I think the figure is. The Labor Party do not support that approach in respect of an exclusive tax cut. We do not support that, Senator Bartlett, and I have said that very consistently over a long period of time.
The second measure, which the Labor Party do support, is the low-income earner co-contribution. We support that because it is an improvement that is reasonably well targeted. I have subjected the minister to a range of questions about who exactly benefits from the measure. While I have some concerns about at least some of those who will benefit from the measure actually being low- or middle-income earners—I think there will be some areas where higher income earners will take advantage—on balance Labor agree with the co-contribution for low-income earners. I might say that this co-contribution proposal is in fact a very much watered-down version of the Labor Party's proposal of 1995-96. In 1995-96, the Labor Party proposed a co-contribution of three per cent from government and three per cent from the employee for all superannuation fund members—guaranteed.
In 1997, this government dropped that and substituted a so-called `savings rebate' which then was dropped approximately a year later. We were left with nothing. So the chamber is considering today what is a very much watered-down version of what Labor initially proposed. To give you some comparative figures: the Labor Party's co-contribution of three per cent from the government and three per cent from the employee would have delivered into superannuation for everyone—not one in 10, but for everyone—an additional $4½ billion from government and obviously a matching contribution from employees. That would have meant an additional $9 billion a year in superannuation savings in this country. The Liberal government scrapped that in 1997 and have brought back a very much watered-down version which delivers a benefit for approximately one in 10 of the lower to middle-income earners in this country—approximately one in 10.
Effectively what we have seen is Labor proposing 10 steps forward and the government abandoning that and now taking one step forward. However, the Labor Party is confronted with the reality that the government have bundled together both the exclusive tax cut for high-income earners and the low-income earners co-contribution. That is the government's call, not the Labor Party's. They have bundled together two quite different measures. The Labor Party do not agree with an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners, so ultimately we will have to make a call on the package when we have the final vote in the Senate on the measures before us.
In conclusion I want to emphasise that, despite our critical analysis of at least some of the beneficiaries of the low-income earners co-contribution, it is effectively an idea that was advanced by the Labor Party in a much more rigorous and expansive form back in 1996. For that reason, we support it in principle.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-07,"—It does seem like the Greens are the only ones who know exactly what they will be doing now and next time, and that is to oppose the legislation, with the exception of supporting the amendments for same sex couples and co-dependent partners regardless. That becomes an important and pre-eminent issue. It will be interesting to hear what the government has to say on the matter. The breakthrough there is absolutely crucial if you are looking for social justice. What we find with the legislation in itself, as Senator Sherry has just been indicating, is that it is very much weighted to high-income earners. Even the copayments at the lower level will be picked up by partnerships in which there is a high-income component more readily than partnerships in which two people are on very low incomes. That being said, it is going to be very important and will set the parameters for a debate going into next year, should the Democrats allow the government to say, `Hold on, we will review this matter and at some later time introduce legislation which, in part or in full, gets rid of discrimination against same sex couples and co-dependent partners.' I can predict that what will happen then is the government will see this as an opportunity to get rid of the spectre of a double dissolution, which it is not all that keen on, to be able to leverage much greater concessions from the Democrats further down the line in return for a much delayed but inevitable change to the law to get rid of discrimination right across the field in Australia. That will be a catch-up not only with the States but with just about every equivalent country in the world in terms of ending discrimination against same sex couples and people who are in co-dependent relationships.
I would advise very strongly against that, because the government will drive an extremely hard bargain. There are a number of bills it wants to get through but which face the hurdle of a double dissolution because they have been set aside by the Senate for being manifestly unfair, in one way or another, as far as the Australian people are concerned. The politics of this is very important. I think people should seize this opportunity. It comes about because the Labor Party has always blocked it before but has now changed direction, as Senator Bartlett said, and decided to come on board with the Greens and Democrats in moving to end discrimination against same sex partners and people in co-dependent relationships. It is an opportunity and it should be taken up and insisted upon by the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I have two questions for the minister, which she may be able to get some advice on, relating to issues that have been raised with me in the last fortnight. They are not in the area of same sex couples. Firstly, I understand that the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 applies to Norfolk Island. I had a call from someone on Norfolk Island who asked why the surcharge tax reduction bill did not apply to people on Norfolk Island. I know it is a very specific question. I presume the surcharge does not apply on Norfolk Island, but I was asked to confirm whether that is the case because of the unique arrangements that apply to Norfolk Island.
Secondly, in the Treasurer's announcement of the surplus for the last financial year there was a two-line note announcing that the surcharge tax revenue that was collected had gone up in the last financial year by some $290 million—I think that was the figure. If that is the case, does that mean the tax reduction in the surcharge bill, which we have passed, will cost more? Was that increased revenue taken into account when calculating the costs to budget of the loss of revenue with the passing of the reduction in the rates for the surcharge tax bill? The circumstances of the increase in tax collection from the surcharge tax in the last financial year may have been unique to that financial year and therefore will have no longer term impact, but it is an issue that has, again, been specifically raised with me in the last week. If the minister is able to provide an answer either now or at some later time, I would be interested to know it.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-07,"—There are a number of issues that I will very briefly address. Firstly, a number of speakers this afternoon have referred to the need for the government to be flexible. I think the mere fact that we are here debating these bills with some prospect of them getting through either now or later is an indication of the government's flexibility and determination to concentrate on the policy purpose of these bills, which is, of course, to assist those earners of particularly low incomes to have opportunities to save for their retirement.
In relation to the same sex issues that have taken up a great deal of the debate, what I want to say very clearly is that there does appear—whatever the merits or otherwise of everything that has been said about same sex couples—to be a misunderstanding about the intended operation of these particular bills and their application to same sex couples. I want to place on the record very clearly again that the co-contribution and surcharge measures in the bills only apply to the individual. The bills do not distinguish between eligible individuals in same sex relationships or those in any other relationship. The co-contribution, for example, is just as available to an eligible gay or lesbian person as it is to an eligible married person or an eligible single heterosexual person. The same sex amendments, therefore, have no application to these bills because there is no possible discrimination in respect of the operation of these bills. I think that is the critically differentiating point. The government will honour the agreement it has with the Australian Democrats, which is confined to the subject matter of these bills. I do trust that this has clarified the basis of the government's decision.
There are a couple of other issues that I will deal with very briefly. I note the couple of issues raised by Senator Sherry. I do believe that Norfolk Island has some unique tax arrangements, and I suspect that that is the basis for the distinguished position in relation to the surcharge, but I will obviously check it. My understanding is that this was probably a one-off in relation to the increased revenue in this year's budget, but I will also check that. The information I have is that the surcharge revenue outcome was $299 million higher than expected in 2003-04, and the stronger than expected accrual outcome largely reflects a change in the accounting treatment for unfunded liabilities in respect of defined benefit schemes. Previously the liabilities associated with these schemes have not been recognised in the revenue estimates and outcomes. The recognition of unfunded liabilities reflects the change in accrued liabilities for unfunded defined benefit schemes since the introduction of the surcharge. In the 2003-04 year, the change in receivables for the surcharge will only include the change for the year.
That means that the figures in the supplementary explanatory memorandum have not been revised, and no change has occurred to the proportion of benefits flowing to the co-contribution compared to the surcharge rate reduction. It brings me to an earlier point: that the benefits still remain at 66 to 34 in favour of co-contribution, as we earlier put on the record. The figures have been estimated on a cash and not an accrual basis, and the change in the final budget outcome relates to an accrual basis, not a cash basis. That deals with the figures, but I will check the Norfolk Island issue.
There are a couple of other points that I want to raise. Senator Bartlett quite rightly alluded to the fact that issues to do with same sex relationships are not confined to superannuation. Indeed, it may be one of those areas where there is not so much an issue as perhaps in other areas of the law. If you were to get down to look at this, you would see it obviously requires further work and examination. Obviously, in those circumstances, you could also look at what to do with preferred beneficiaries and binding death benefits but, in any event, the government is not persuaded that changing definitions is an appropriate way to deal with the bills currently under consideration.
Without pre-empting Senator Brown's amendment, I do just want to say something very briefly about the amendment being moved by Senator Cherry. Senator Cherry is moving an amendment to section 10(1) of the SI(S) Act to amend the definition of `dependant'. I simply draw to the Senate's attention that the Democrats have already supported Senator Sherry's amendment to the same definition. It certainly would be helpful if we could clarify just what definition the Senate hopes to insert, because otherwise I think we will have a conflict. I raise it in the context of Senator Brown also bringing forward a similar amendment. We want a definition that does not conflict.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-10-07,"—In answer to Minister Coonan's previous question, the difference between my amendment and Senator Sherry's amendment is only the addition of the recognition of interdependency relationships. It takes Senator Sherry's amendment from the last debate and adds words at the end to ensure that the definition of `dependant'picks up the notion of interdependency. I do have a question for the minister about the issue of interdependency generally, and it is about her understanding of the tax treatment of dependants' superannuation benefits. Is it her understanding that spouses are currently included in the definition of `dependant' for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the concessional treatment of taxation?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-07,—The answer to that is yes.,SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-07,"—I would like to respond briefly to part of the minister's contribution a moment ago where she argued—and I am paraphrasing—that this effectively was not the right bill or the appropriate bill to look at same sex couple amendments because it does not deal with relationships. The minister said—and again I am paraphrasing—that this bill does not discriminate against an individual on the basis of their sexuality. I think that is a disingenuous argument. It is not the case.
I would make two points here. Firstly, all superannuation bills that come before this chamber are appropriate avenues to try and address this issue. The minister said—in what I took as a disparaging way—that we had debated the issue of same sex couples for some considerable time and at great length on this bill. The reality is that we are going to be debating same sex couple issues until we get a resolution. It is, in my view, the last great human rights movement, following the black civil rights movement and the wave of feminism. Certainly from my perspective—and obviously I have a personal interest—the most outstanding human rights issue in terms of lack of legislation is the way in which we acknowledge lesbian and gay people and their relationships. As a Western democracy, we fall far behind comparable jurisdictions in the way we do that. So I would say to the minister: yes, we have debated this at great length, but it is not the end of it, by any means. If it should fail on this occasion then there will be another and another and another. Persistence is what it is all about.
More importantly, the specific point I wanted to make was that it is not the case, in my view, that this bill is not one which ought to be addressed in terms of same sex couple amendments. I would argue that, should it pass, somebody taking advantage of the co-contributions under this scheme, whether they are a low- or high-income earner, may like the opportunity down the track or believe they have the right to leave the benefit they have gained under this scheme to their same sex partner. That is when the discrimination will come into play. This is an opportunity to attach these amendments. It is an opportunity to progress the debate and the issue, and it is a bill to which we ought to be considering these relationship amendments.
It is true, as the minister said, that there are many other areas of discrimination under Commonwealth law, not just quarantine and superannuation. There is similar discrimination in social security, taxation, veterans' affairs, the Federal Police, immigration and industrial relations. The only opportunity we have to debate all of those things fully, in a comprehensive and holistic way, is with an omnibus bill that deals with that. I remind the Senate again that we Democrats have such a bill and would dearly love Senate time and the opportunity to debate that thoroughly. That has not been the case to date. If the minister is indicating that the government might perhaps offer that opportunity in the future so that we could discuss all of these things in a comprehensive way, to the point of having a thorough debate and a vote on those issues, then I would very much welcome that. But, failing that, the only opportunity for those of us trying to prosecute this human rights agenda is with amendments to piecemeal pieces of legislation, and this is but one of them.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-07,"—Senator Greig is absolutely right. The figures are rough, but I want to bring that home. Under this legislation, if a copayment from the government is worth $1,000 with an extra contribution of $1,000 made by a low-income person to her superannuation fund and she wishes to leave that to her same sex partner, that same sex partner, in the event of her death, will get hit with 30 per cent tax. So actually $700 of the copayment, and $700 that the person has put in, will flow over rather than the $1,000. The discrimination that sits there in superannuation law flows into these amendments. The amendments coming from the Greens, Labor and the Democrats reverse that. These amendments, which end discrimination, flow back into superannuation law to get rid of discrimination altogether.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-07,"—by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1), (2) and (3) on sheet 3104:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 32), after item 9, insert:
9A Schedule (Form of Trust Deed) subrule 7(4) (definition of spouse)
Repeal the definition, substitute:
spouse, in relation to a member, means a person who is legally married to the member and includes a person who, although not legally married to the member, ordinarily lives with the member as his or her husband or wife or partner, as the case may be, on a permanent and bona fide basis.
9B Schedule 1, paragraphs 9 (c) and (d)
After “husband or wife” (twice occurring), insert “or partner”.
9C Clause 12
Repeal the clause, substitute:
12.	In spite of anything in this Part, a partner in relation to a person means a person who, whether or not of the same sex as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basic as a partner of the person.
(2)	Schedule 1, page 9 (after line 14), before item 16, insert:
15A At the end of subsection 8B(3)
Add:
	; or (e)	if the person at the time of death was the partner of the person.
	(4)	For the purposes of this section, partner, in relation to a person, means a person who, whether or not of the same sex as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis as a partner of the person.
(3)	Schedule 1, page 11 (after line 14), at the end of Part 1, add:
Superannuation Act 1990
24AA The Schedule (clause 1.1.1, paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the definition of spouse)
After “husband or wife” wherever occurring, insert “or partner”.
24AB The Schedule (clause 1.1.1, after the definition of partially dependent child)
Insert:
partner, in relation to a person, means a person who, whether or not of the same sex as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis as a partner of the person.
As the minister indicated, these are amendments which go to the matter of adding the definition of `partner' to the definition of `spouse'. They are self-explanatory. After the term `husband and wife', where it occurs, the amendment inserts the term `partner'. It goes on to say on two occasions:
In spite of anything in this Part, a partner in relation to a person means a person who, whether or not of the same sex as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basic as a partner of the person.
You will note that that does take into account co-dependent people—such as mother-daughter, father-son, brother-sister relationships—where superannuation should flow if a person has earned the money and wants it to go to a particular person with whom they are sharing their life but not a sexual relationship. So it is a definition that enforces the understanding that we are talking of here about the right of a person who is a superannuant to pass that superannuation on to a person with whom they have a relationship regardless.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-07,"—As I have already indicated to the chamber on two previous occasions, the opposition supports these amendments. I have one final comment, which I should have mentioned earlier. Senator Brown would be well aware that in Tasmania we have recently had a debate on a package of measures to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. Whilst the total package did not pass, the area of superannuation was absolutely non-contentious. The removal of discrimination against same-sex couples for superannuation purposes in the state public service, where state government law applies, I do not think was even debated. It was accepted broadly by a very conservative upper house. There was no argument or resistance to ending the discrimination in superannuation in the state public sector funds in Tasmania.
I think Tasmania is probably the last state to remove discrimination in superannuation at a state government level. I am not absolutely sure about that. Certainly, I think that almost every other state and territory has removed the discrimination at a state level. As I say, as conservative as our state upper house in Tasmania is—the legislative council is notoriously conservative—the members accepted that it was time to end discrimination in the area that we have under debate here today.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-07,"—by leave—I move government amendments (1) and (2) contained on sheet QG220:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 22), after item 13, insert:
13A Section 16 (notes 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Repeal the notes, substitute:
Note 1:	Section 61 deals with individuals who request transfer of account balances to RSAs or superannuation funds.
Note 2:	Section 65 deals with individuals who retire because of disability.
Note 3:	Section 66 deals with individuals who have turned 65.
Note 4:	Section 67 deals with individuals who are not Australian residents for income tax purposes etc.
Note 5:	Section 67A deals with individuals who have permanently departed from Australia.
Note 6:	Section 91E deals with debiting of accounts to recover overpayments of Government co-contributions.
(2)	Schedule 1, item 25, page 12 (line 6), omit “2002”, substitute “2003”.
I will be very brief. These amendments include a technical correction and also provide for the deferral of the application of the amendments in the consequential amendments bill. Amendment (2) provides for the deferral of the application of the consequential amendments to other acts that give effect to the co-contribution measure. This date is now 1 July 2003, compared with 1 July 2002. For example, the tax offset that the co-contribution is replacing will now be repealed and will affect contributions on or after 1 July 2003, rather than on 1 July 2002. The other amendment is a technical correction of a previous omission in that it adds further notes to the provisions of the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-07,"—That was a short disagreement by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. The opposition are particularly disappointed with the government's response to the Senate's amendments. We would have preferred a much better and different outcome for the Australian populace, or perhaps a better explanation as to why those amendments were not accepted by the government. The amendments moved in the Senate would have demonstrated a genuine commitment on the part of this parliament to ensure that the law gives greater protection to potentially pregnant, pregnant and breastfeeding women. The need for a change to the law was demonstrated by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Susan Halliday, in her role in the 1999 report entitled Pregnant and productive: it's a right not a privilege to work while pregnant.
For all the Prime Minister's rhetoric on this issue about work and family, his government shelved that report for 17 months and took more than 2½ years to draw up the legislation. You could hardly argue that this government has embraced policies on work and family; in fact, you could easily draw the conclusion that the government has not embraced the issue and has not seen fit to deal with it in any substantive way. Perhaps what is worse is that the Howard government's legislation does not expand the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act to give greater protection to potentially pregnant, pregnant or breastfeeding women. The government's response to that report was less than weak. In the answer provided in the chamber today, I had hoped for a more broad explanation as to why the government has rejected the amendments and why it has decided not to pursue a broader approach on this issue.
The report clearly highlighted the issues, and I addressed them during the second reading contribution that I delivered on behalf of the shadow minister. Unfortunately, though, we ultimately find ourselves in a position of having to support the bill as printed. It is extremely disappointing that this government is not prepared to reconsider its weak response to these serious concerns. We have been placed in this position because of the inability of this government to pick up these work and family issues and progress them. It is acknowledged that the changes to the bill do assist but not to the extent that the report of the then commissioner, Susan Halliday, or the amendments proposed in this Senate could have. On that note, rather than prolong the issue any further, on behalf of the opposition I advise the Senate of our extreme disappointment. The government has again shown to the broader community a lack of commitment to work and family issues.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-10-07,"—Senator Ludwig is correct: it is not only disappointing; it is extraordinarily disappointing. It was bad enough that the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002 was almost a couple of years after the significant recommendations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Not only were the amendments piecemeal but they were pretty much clarifications of the existing provisions in the act. A number of the recommendations put forward by HREOC in an attempt to alleviate and/or prevent discrimination against women who were pregnant were left out. So we had a piece of legislation that did not do much but did a little bit. Thus, everyone now feels compelled to vote for it because women in the workplace who have faced this sort of discrimination have waited so long for such legislation. The fact that fundamentally important policy suggestions and recommendations put forward by HREOC were left out of this legislation has made aspects of it a joke. That is why we had a detailed, impressive and effective discussion about this legislation. That is why the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party moved amendments that would put into the legislation some of those badly needed changes—that is, the recommendations contained within the HREOC report. That is why the amendments should be insisted upon today but, as I have said, and certainly as Senator Ludwig articulated before me, because this legislation contains such urgent, necessary reform, people feel compelled to let it pass.
When we debated this legislation last time, some of the amendments that were passed by a majority of the Senate included expanding the coverage of the act to federal statutory employees, judicial office-holders and members of parliament; extending the coverage of the act to unpaid workers; extending protection to employees who intend to or are in the process of adopting a child; removing the exemption of religious educational institutions—I acknowledge that that amendment, put forward by the Australian Democrats, was amended by the Labor Party and that that amendment passed the Senate—a provision that set out pregnancy discrimination standards, again with a further amendment by the Labor Party to the Democrat amendment; allowing complaints about discriminatory advertisements to be made notwithstanding that the complainant is not a person directly affected by that advertisement; allowing the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory awards to the Industrial Relations Commission without the requirement that he or she had received a written complaint; and a change to the bill's title to read: `A bill for an act relating to pregnancy and work and for related purposes'. That is, of course, from the original bill for an `Act to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and for related purposes'.
Beyond that, the Australian Democrats moved—unsuccessfully—a number of amendments that dealt with our ongoing concern that there is no national paid maternity leave scheme in this country, once again making Australia one of two OECD countries that do not have what is a basic work entitlement for its working women, and the impact it has on women in the work force, whether it is in relation to discrimination, people giving up their jobs—women's largely increasing expertise in the workplace being underutilised because they have to leave their jobs—or indeed deferring having children. Evidence tells us that this is having an impact on fertility rates in Australia, but this government keeps teasing women with the prospect of work and family reform. I think it is four times now that, publicly, our Prime Minister has teased Australian working women with the notion that they might get an entitlement that other women around the world take for granted, as they should.
Other Democrat amendments that were unsuccessful related to the issue of breastfeeding and the right of women to breastfeed in the workplace. But they would of course need certain entitlements to do so—for example, a place where women could express milk, store milk et cetera. Unfortunately those amendments were not successful. But the ones that were successful and have been rejected by the House of Representatives should be insisted upon. They should have been part of legislative reform not just today but years ago. I think everyone in this chamber knows that, so I still do not quite understand why the government has rejected the amendments. I am not talking about the paltry excuses that have been offered by the House of Representatives today and last time we had this debate.
I think this feeds into a broader debate, a debate that was probably touched on in the last debate that we just had in this chamber on superannuation. That is the fact that this country does not provide for full equality for all people. Equality denied includes equality that is delayed, and we have been delaying these amendments and these much-needed reforms for working women and for pregnant women, just as some people in this chamber very broadly would have the rights of gay and lesbian people denied as part of other debates, but I am sure we will get back to that.
The bill currently only clarifies existing provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and it ignores changes that would be more meaningfully able to assist Australian women. While the government's legislation implements only three of the 12 HREOC recommendations relating to the act, our amendments—and I am talking about the Democrat amendments with Labor support or with Labor amendments, or indeed the Labor amendments—would have incorporated most of those outstanding recommendations into the legislation. The rejection of the Senate's amendments is the government's latest refusal to deal with the needs of working women in this country. I have mentioned paid maternity leave and the broader issue of work and family balance. While I was not surprised that my amendments to this legislation to try and enact a national paid maternity leave scheme for the first time in Australia were not successful, that will not stop the Democrats continuing to campaign on this issue—indeed, continuing to promote the fact that we do have historic legislation tabled in this chamber ready to go that implements a scheme of paid maternity leave. 
There are a range of other issues affecting working women and women who are not in the work force as well. I look at the issue of gender pay gaps, which has been highlighted recently. It is 30 years since we have had the equal pay for work of equal value campaigns, yet the women's and men's wages disparity continues to increase. We have seen in the last week a new census of Australia's top 200 companies that reveals that women make up only 8.8 per cent of executive managers compared with 15 per cent in the United States. Only four of these 200 companies have a female CEO. Of the 1,300 directors in these companies, only 109 are women. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency found that the percentage of company boards that do not contain any women increased from 46.7 per cent to 47.3 per cent in the last year. So it is getting worse, and I cannot say that federal legislation is doing anything to assist this process. In fact, dare I suggest that in the 21st century we are actually going backwards when it comes to women's rights in the workplace and women's rights in this country generally.
So, if I seem a little angry about this legislation, it is because I refuse to say that I am simply disappointed. I am angry. This legislation is long overdue. It was long overdue years ago, yet this government dillydallied around with actually putting anything into legislation. And, when they do, women of Australia and men of Australia too are supposed to be pathetically grateful that they have finally seen the implementation of the recommendations contained in that Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. And what are they? Three of the 12—and most of them are technical changes or clarifications to the act. If that is the best this government can do for Australian working women, I have no idea how they continue to get support from women and indeed men. If anyone in this chamber and anyone in this community cares about equality for all, not only would they be insisting on these amendments but the government would not have to be forced to make these changes, they would have initiated the changes. So not only is this disappointing but it certainly is an indictment on this government's record in relation to working women in particular, and specifically women who are pregnant. These are the same kind of women and the same kind of so-called family values that our Prime Minister is the first to boast about, the first to invoke, when he wants to talk about good values.
There is not much good news in this legislation for women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant and who do not want to face what seems to be in some workplaces inevitable workplace discrimination on that basis. So, yes, I am disappointed that the government did not take the opportunity to enact better legislation thanks to Democrat and Labor amendments, but I am pretty angry that it is trying to fob us off with what is a piecemeal piece of legislation that does not make much difference to the lives of Australia's working women.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-07,"—As I said in my speech on the second reading of the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Pregnancy and Work) Bill 2002, it was a disappointing bill for the reasons that the previous speaker outlined in terms of taking into consideration so few of the HREOC recommendations when framing the bill that was presented to the Senate some time ago. When that bill was presented to the Senate, the Senate improved the legislation to deal with many of the other HREOC recommendations put forward to deal with discrimination that women face in the workplace. It also put forward something on the public agenda that this Prime Minister has constantly ignored, which is the need for a national maternity leave scheme. The Greens supported that improvement to the legislation to ensure that women did have security in terms of their workplace and did have the capacity to balance work and family that this Prime Minister so constantly talks about, in a way which truly recognises the contribution that mothers make to the raising of children in this country.
We saw yesterday in the Australian newspaper the Prime Minister commenting further on this issue. In his comments he again argued against the $213 million a year scheme put forward by the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, saying that he did not believe that it would increase fertility rates. We have had the previous speaker talk about the way in which it is already in fact having an impact on fertility rates. But to speak just about fertility rates within this debate is to miss the main point of the debate. It is about ensuring work entitlements for women who seek to balance work and family responsibilities. These are the improvements the Senate put into this poor piece of legislation that came before us. The Greens believe we should be insisting on these amendments so that we can have at least some steps towards improving the capacity for working mothers to be able to balance their family and work responsibilities.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-07,"—My question is to Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Can the minister confirm the government receives daily mortality reports from the master of the stranded sheep carrier MV Cormo Express? How many sheep have died since the vessel left the port of Fremantle 63 days ago? And how many sheep have died since the government facilitated the repurchase of the sheep last Wednesday?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I note that the minister is unable to answer some parts of the question. I would ask him, if the matters are not in his brief, to seek information from the minister confirming, firstly, that the government receives daily mortality reports and, secondly, the number that have died since the vessel left port 63 days ago and the number that have died since the government facilitated the repurchase of the sheep last Wednesday. Can the minister also advise how many sheep are expected to die on any return journey forced by Minister Truss's inept handling of negotiations to secure an alternative port?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-07,"—I thank Senator O'Brien for raising what is an issue of very grave concern to all Australians. The welfare of those animals is something that does concern the Australian government, and that is why we have gone to extraordinary lengths to look to their welfare and safety. The live cattle export trade is worth $1 billion to Australia and employs, directly and indirectly, some 9,000 people. It is a very important part of the pastoral industry generally in its overall health. It does, of course, substantiate and assist with the development of rural and regional Australia. That is why we are so concerned about this particular issue. 
It is probably important, in answering Senator O'Brien's question, to highlight the fact that these sheep were bought from Australia by a foreign businessman, loaded onto a foreign ship and taken offshore. Some would say that it is not then a matter for the Australian government, but because we have a concern for the welfare of the sheep we have taken a very direct and concerned interest in it. 
Senator O'Brien asked me for some particular details about the number of sheep that have died since the ship left Australia. Mr Truss, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, gave a press conference in Brisbane on Saturday where he clearly gave all these figures. If you were interested in the issue, Senator O'Brien, you could have had a look at them.
—What are they, for the Senate? The Senate is interested to know.
—I could send you the transcript, Senator Sherry, if you are interested in this, but I know that you are not interested in this sort of thing. You are not interested in anything that has anything to do with rural and regional Australia.
—Would you ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair. Senator Sherry, you know that interjections across the chamber are disorderly.
—Thank you, Mr President. I appreciate the honourable senator from Tasmania has no interest in rural and regional Australia or this issue or the welfare of the sheep, but in answering Senator O'Brien's question the information given by Mr Truss on Saturday is that 5,000 sheep have died since they left Australia about 58 days ago. There are a number that do die every day and that is, they tell me, normal in this situation. It is a situation we had hoped would not have occurred because the sheep would have been offloaded.
It is also important in talking about this matter—and I am sure Senator O'Brien would be interested in this—to note that not only have Australian veterinary surgeons given the shipment a clear bill of health but indeed an officer from the international organisation that looks after the welfare of animals internationally has also been on board and inspected the sheep at close quarters and has signified and certified them to be in good condition for sale, in good condition for import and in good condition for consumption by human beings. These are issues of concern to the Australian government, and we do what we can each day. Mr Truss has been very open with the Australian public about the issues as they evolve and the steps that the Australian government are taking to resolve this very complex and difficult issue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-07,"—We do receive daily reports—I am sorry for omitting that. I did indicate to Senator O'Brien that 5,000 was the number since the sheep had left Australia, as Mr Truss indicated in his news conference last Saturday. There are sheep that die every day. I am afraid I do not have those reports today on how many died last night, but they do die. I have indicated that to Senator O'Brien. What was the other part of your supplementary?
—Since the government facilitated the repurchase of the sheep last Wednesday, how many sheep have died?
—I am afraid I do not have that detail, Senator O'Brien. I can get it for you, if how many is the big issue of the day. But you did ask how many would die between now and when the ship got home. Again, I cannot say that. We are hoping to sell them at a place near the point where they are currently, and that work is going on. Senator O'Brien criticises Mr Truss. I have not yet heard one sensible suggestion from Senator O'Brien on what should be done. For some time Mr Truss has struggled with this issue and I look forward to Senator O'Brien's suggestion.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-10-07,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Campbell, and I congratulate him on his appointment to the ministry. At the United Nations General Assembly last Tuesday, the National Health and Medical Research Council made a statement which failed to take a stand against the cloning of human embryos for destructive experimentation. How is it that a statutory organisation, at arm's length from the government, can speak on behalf of the government on an issue of grave importance to the whole of humankind? Did the minister responsible for the cloning issue approve, or was he even consulted on, the text delivered by the National Health and Medical Research Council to the United Nations? Was not the action of the NHMRC, whose agenda is to pave the way for cloning of human embryos, in direct conflict with the prohibition on human embryo cloning which this parliament passed overwhelmingly only last year?
—Senator, that was a very long question.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Human Cloning</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-10-07,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question on two things. Firstly, could the minister advise the Senate whether or not the minister responsible for the area of cloning was consulted in respect of that document? Secondly, could the minister confirm whether whoever gave him that briefing used the words `therapeutic cloning'? Does the minister realise that the Australian Health Ethics Committee has stated to the National Health and Medical Research Council that the words `therapeutic cloning' are misleading and deceptive—hardly therapeutic for the human embryo that is cloned? Could the minister take up those matters?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Human Cloning</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-07,"—I thank Senator Harradine for the question. I have sought some information on this issue. Firstly, I am not aware of what consultation might have taken place between the minister and the NHMRC. Senator Harradine talks about whether or not they speak on behalf of the government. I would be surprised if they did; as an independent agency, I think they speak on their own behalf. As to whether they represent the government's views, if I accept what Senator Harradine has said—and I have not read what they said at the General Assembly—and if it is in conflict with the government's position, which I will now define to the Senate, then clearly they do not.
The government's position is that we will continue to work towards a convention that is consistent with the act passed by this parliament—that is, the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act. We support the urgent development of a convention to ban human reproductive cloning. We are concerned that, given the absence of a consensus in the working group on this, attempts to develop a convention to ban all forms of cloning immediately may delay a ban on human reproductive cloning. While the Australian legislation bans both human reproductive and therapeutic cloning, we are also required to undertake an independent review on the operation of this legislation. That review, as most senators will recall, commences in December 2004. 
To put it succinctly: the government's actions at the UN are in fact in total harmony with what the parliament wanted to do. We are pursuing the convention on the prohibition of human cloning. We understand that to pursue the further ban on cloning would actually hinder that progress. What we are doing is in harmony with what the parliament said. Also, because the parliament itself spoke on the issue of a review of therapeutic cloning, our activities in the UN to pursue the ban on human cloning convention and not to progress the other until our review has taken place are in fact—in the limited time I have been briefed on this—entirely in harmony with the parliament's will as well. That is the government's position and that is the position that the foreign minister communicated, as I understand it, to the UN. I will get back to the Senate in relation to what capacity the NHMRC speak at these international fora and also what consultation took place between the minister and the NHMRC on this issue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Human Cloning</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation (Senator Ian Macdonald) and the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (Senator Ian Campbell) to questions without notice asked by Senators O'Brien and Crossin today relating to live sheep exports and the Cormo Express.
In moving so, I should say at the beginning that in my third question to Senator Ian Macdonald I inadvertently suggested Mr Truss announced the completed import risk analysis in Perth last week; it was in fact an announcement he made at a press conference here in Parliament House on the same date. I apologise for misleading the Senate to that extent.
I wondered whether Senator Ian Macdonald was going to do the same thing when he stood up following question time to refer to some additional information he had. Certainly, in answer to the second question I asked of him at question time today, he advised that the process of completing an import risk assessment had not been concluded and that, when it was, he thought that information would be available. The fact of the matter is that, on 30 September, Minister Truss announced that a scientific import risk assessment had been done—that is, at the end of last month, the assessment to which I was referring in my question had been done. Obviously Senator Ian Macdonald had not been advised of that in his brief and was put in the embarrassing situation of misleading the Senate. I think that, on reflection, he will look at his answers and find the need to come in and correct the record because, unfortunately, I suspect that Minister Truss has again left one of the ministers in this place hanging out to dry.
The four questions we asked today were about the Cormo Express matter. The questions concerned sheep mortality aboard the livestock carrier, the quarantine risks associated with the return of the sheep and consideration of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as an offshore quarantine facility should the repatriation of the sheep proceed. Consistent with its behaviour throughout the Cormo Express crisis the government, and particularly Minister Truss, refused to provide comprehensive answers to the Senate on these important matters, and Senator Ian Macdonald's failure to provide precise mortality figures, including the projected mortality from any repatriation, is frankly no surprise.
Senators will recall the government's disgraceful response on 18 September this year to a Senate order for the production of documents related to sheep mortality on the Cormo Express. The government refused to comply with the order of the Senate due to `sensitive negotiations' on the fate of the sheep. That is a fair while ago, of course, and the negotiations have achieved nothing. But the government knew then how many sheep had died, as we now know they do get daily reports—that was admitted by Minister Macdonald. The government was quite prepared to divulge that information to foreign governments during negotiations to offload the sheep, but refused to comply with its obligations to the parliament. On 17 September, the Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Taylor, similarly failed to provide a committee of this Senate with advice on mortality, claiming that he had been in Sydney and had not caught up with the latest news. Mr Taylor's trip must have been pretty exciting because the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee has waited 21 days, and counting, for the promised advice—it still has not arrived.
The second matter addressed in Labor's questions on live sheep concerned the import risk analysis related to the proposed return of the sheep to Australia. As I have touched on, it is clear that an analysis exists, yet Senator Ian Macdonald suggested in his first answer that it did not. He is obviously now clear that one does exist, and hopefully he is now in no uncertain terms advising Minister Truss's office that if he is to be briefed on these matters he should be properly and fully briefed so that he does not mislead the Senate.
Serious views are held about the potential quarantine risks associated with the return of a shipload of sheep that have spent at least six weeks in the gulf region. Dr Bill Gee, a former Commonwealth director of animal hygiene, a foundation director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Health, a former director of AQIS and a past president of both the Australian Veterinary Association and the world animal health organisation, the OIE, has expressed grave fears about the risks posed by the return of the sheep. The current president of the AVA has expressed deep concerns about this matter, as have important rural commodity and representative groups with regard to their imports, as well as meat processors in various parts of the country, given the impact that this is having on our exports of lamb to Europe and beef to Japan. In relation to this important import risk assessment, I have been calling for it from at least 24 September, but clearly the minister has put it in the public domain in the sense that it existed from 30 September. It should be released today. I look forward to it.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-10-07,"—I think what Senator O'Brien has outlined in his contribution to this debate this afternoon reflects the view that all of us share in relation to this issue as it affects Australia's rural industries. The wool industry and the live sheep industry have had a terrible 10 years. This is not, of course, the first time that the live sheep trade to the Middle East has encountered difficulties. In fact, in the early 1990s—I think during Senator O'Brien's period as a member of the government at the time—the live sheep trade to the Middle East was suspended for some years. Prior to my coming into this place, I was a member of a delegation that visited the Middle East during the period in which the live sheep trade had been suspended. We visited Saudi Arabia and spoke with a number of representatives there. It was very clear that this was a particularly complex issue and that the answers were not simple. Fortunately, on that occasion, the live sheep trade was able to be resumed and has continued to this day.
This ship aside, there are other shipments of live sheep that have gone to the Middle East and are being sold and unloaded without difficulty. At the moment the ship is in Kuwait and is reprovisioning. Notwithstanding the small fire that occurred on the ship a couple of days ago, it is due to leave this week. Hopefully by that time there will be some resolution of the issue and a new buyer for the sheep will have been found. Arrangements have been made to have an AQIS veterinarian and two experienced stockmen on board the vessel when it does sail from Kuwait later in the week.
Interestingly enough, while the ship has been in port, an independent veterinary inspection has been conducted by a veterinarian who reported that, notwithstanding the amount of time that these sheep have been in international waters—a very long time; I think we all agree that it is far too long—they are clinically fit and healthy. They are free from disease and are suitable for admission to any country in the region for human consumption. As I understand it, the veterinarian who carried out this inspection is from the animal version of the World Health Organisation, the OIE. As well, and importantly, this veterinarian reported that there was no evidence of scabby mouth on the sheep.
The Australian government's priority remains finding a home for these sheep. With so many countries looking for food, it is hard to believe that an acceptable resolution to this matter cannot be achieved. I understand that all options are being pursued to locate a suitable port so the sheep can be unloaded and transported to a new destination. However, in the event that there are no suitable ports in the region, work is continuing on the option to bring the sheep back to Australia, which I am sure is a resolution that nobody wants.
Nobody wants those sheep to have to travel back to Australia. There are a number of difficulties related to that, and some of them were outlined today by the minister. It is very clear that bringing them back is not the best option either for the sheep or for those growers in Australia, who do not want the sheep or any of the diseases that the ship may now be carrying coming back to dock in our port. However, at this stage we have three days when the ship will be in port in Kuwait. I know that the minister and other senior ministers in the government are focused on finding a resolution to this very difficult and complex question for the sake of the animals and for the sake of a very important and very valuable industry to Australia.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-10-07,"—It was some 63 days ago that 57,000 Western Australian sheep left the port of Fremantle. Ever since that time, they have been travelling around the Middle East looking for a new home. As we now understand it, they are in Kuwait, where the ship is being resupplied with feed and provisions. There are now, at most, 52,000 sheep. The minister indicated that, when the ship, the MV Cormo Express, docked at Kuwait, the government would use the time it took for the ship to be resupplied with feed and provisions to find a new purchaser and, if an alternative port were not found, the sheep would return to Australia.
The return of the sheep to Australia and their welfare are the main concerns. As Senator O'Brien pursued today, the government needs to come clean with the import risk assessment. The government also needs to come clean with any of its quarantine arrangements, which are part of that import risk assessment, if they return to Australia. If they are to return to Australia, the Howard government must address all the potential risks associated with that return. Those risks include quarantine from fodder- and insect-borne diseases. As we all know, the Middle East is one of the riskiest areas in the world for animal diseases, and the existing Australian import protocols prevent the importation of live sheep from that region for any reason. In fact, the Australian import protocols prevent the importation of live sheep from anywhere other than New Zealand.
For all we know, the sheep aboard the MV Cormo Express may have been exposed to exotic diseases, including bluetongue. The return of these sheep without adequate quarantine protocols would be inconsistent with the conservative quarantine regime Australia has maintained quite proudly for some 200 years. We need to ensure that Australia's livestock industry enjoys continuing freedom from the many pests and diseases endemic in many other countries, particularly bluetongue. I know that that is of concern to my home state government in Western Australia. As has been outlined before, the Northern Territory government has expressed similar concerns and therefore has looked at ruling out accepting the return of the sheep.
The Western Australian government has advised that, if the sheep were returned to Fremantle or some other port, it would demand an ironclad assurance from the Commonwealth that there was not an unacceptable level biosecurity risk—that is, risk of disease or quarantine breaches. That is a particularly important issue not just for the long-term security of the industry but also for public confidence in what is quite a controversial industry and quite a controversial trade. Indeed, it was Labor that ensured an independent review of the live sheep trade at the Primary Industries Ministerial Council in Perth on 2 October. It was Labor that pursued these issues, not the Howard government. It is Labor that supports a humane trade in live animals but recognises the future of the industry is at stake if the Commonwealth cannot give certainty in animal welfare outcomes to the Australian people as well as to our overseas markets.
In view of the adverse international media coverage of the MV Cormo Express and the other incidents that have been alluded to, it is vital to the interests of all Australians and to our international trade that the Commonwealth reviews its current arrangements to provide for much greater transparency in reporting and public confidence in animal welfare outcomes. During this debacle the remaining sheep have now been repurchased by LiveCorp. LiveCorp is mainly an industry body. It is my view and Labor's view that there does not appear to be an appropriate separation of regulation from the direct industry involvement. There has been an outright criticism of LiveCorp in that it plays both the role of industry representative body and regulator. In a situation like this, that is inappropriate.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-10-07,"—I am disappointed that the Labor Party, the official opposition, has taken the stance of criticising the devastation that has been caused to the live sheep export trade without offering any solutions whatsoever. As a grower of wool for many years on a reasonably large scale and as an exporter of sheep, I feel as if I have some authority on this subject and can speak about it in this chamber. The troubles with the live sheep export by this particular ship, the Cormo Express, started perhaps before it slipped the hawsers in Fremantle and the sheep ceased to belong to Australia. On inspection, the sheep had an estimated 0.035 per cent scabby mouth. Scabby mouth can be brought about by a disease factor—it is contagious—or an appearance of it can be brought about through eating hard pellets, which often causes abrasions to the sheep's mouth and passes as scabby mouth. 
The sheep have been inspected in the gulf prior to the proposed unloading and after they had been rejected by Saudi Arabia. Because there was no scabby mouth found or any other disease, the sheep were offered to other countries. Other countries, most notably with significant Muslim populations, all rejected the sheep for one reason or another. I am at a loss to say why Saudi Arabia rejected the sheep when they were owned by a Saudi Arabian. I am at a loss to say why they should not have been purchased by another country. I am also at a loss as to why they should not return to Australia and that action be endorsed by this chamber if those sheep are found to be disease free, which they are at the time of speaking. Not only are those sheep disease free but they are actually putting on weight on the ship. 
If the sheep are not sold, I understand tomorrow or Thursday is the arbitrary time given for when they will be returned to Australia. But I understand that countries on the east coast of Africa have also been approached. There may be a sale to the countries on the east coast of Africa; I am unsure of that. However, I do know that Cocos (Keeling) Islands are suited to the unloading of these 50,000 sheep.
—They are not.
—People are becoming sudden experts on these matters who have had no input into primary production or no primary production experience whatsoever. It amazes me that people with a union background who are not associated with rural or primary industries suddenly are becoming experts on them. I can tell you this, Mr Deputy President: the feedlots on which these sheep are fattened and the feedlots to which they go in Saudi Arabia and other areas in the Middle East are infinitely smaller than that proposed on a place like Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and that destination is a place they could be tested for any disease that is not apparent now. There are no identifiable diseases in the sheep at the moment. Yes, I would be a purchaser of those sheep if they came to the mainland, not if they are on Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The sheep are fit and healthy and they are free from disease, as I said, at the time of speaking. They were passed for slaughter in the regions of these destinations and they are also passed for human consumption. There is no evidence, according to the veterinarians on the ship, of scabby mouth. I say that because perhaps the experts on the other side with trade union backgrounds, disassociated from primary production, have a different opinion. It is ludicrous that you should be speaking like this and adding further damage to an industry that has made hard-won gains in the past two years.
Senator O'Brien has different points of view on this on different days depending on what day you actually speak to him. He was reported on the ABC on 1 October as saying that bringing the Cormo Express to Australia poses a quarantine risk but if the dangers can be managed the plan has his support. The next day he said:
Obviously if it can be done, and it's in the interests of the welfare of the sheep, then the opposition will support any sensible outcome in this matter.
Now he is saying that he does not want them to come back to Australia. He has already said that they should come back. Then on AM on 2 October, the next day, it was reported that the federal opposition had called for the sheep on the Cormo Express to be slaughtered at sea. He has suddenly become an expert on this.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-10-07,"—I rise to take note of the answers from Senator Ian Campbell this afternoon in relation to the sheep overboard affair, or perhaps not `overboard' but they should be overboard. It is a pity that such attention was not given to others that lay wanting at sea over the past couple of years under this government. But let us get to the issue at hand. It seems that anything trapped at sea under this government really has no prospect of a good future. 
In relation to whether or not these sheep ought to be offloaded on Cocos (Keeling) Islands, it was very disappointing of the minister, in answer to his first question as minister, not to be able to categorically rule out that Cocos Island would be used. It is very sad to see, and let us hope that Minister Campbell is not going to continue the legacy of poor relationships that this government has had with Christmas and Cocos islands as we have seen under Senator Ian Macdonald and Mr Tuckey. I was hoping we might have had at least a change of heart under this minister. One waits to see whether that is going to be the case. Here was his perfect opportunity to stand up and say that he would categorically rule out the sheep being offloaded on Cocos Island, but he did not do that. In fact, he said, `I would not want to rule it out.' That is very disappointing. 
Why can't the sheep go to Cocos Island? For starters, there is no port for the ship to moor in in order to offload the sheep. I assume they would have to be dumped into rubber dinghies or into patrol boats and taken ashore 100 at a time. But there is actually no port at Cocos Island because it is a coral atoll. It is West Island we are talking about, which is only 600 metres wide by 14 kilometres long. There is an old quarantine station on Cocos Island that has not been used for that purpose for many years. It was used to house 70 Sri Lankan asylum seekers some years back but it has not been used as a quarantine station for many years. 
In fact, earlier this year during the estimates process and during a parliamentary committee meeting with the department of territories looking into the annual reports of Christmas and Cocos Islands, a question was asked about the quarantine station, the unused facility on the islands. Labor representatives believe that this is a facility that should be handed back to the Cocos shire. When officials were asked earlier this year in a parliamentary committee hearing whether or not they believed that should happen, their view was yes, and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service representative said that, although the site was currently listed as a Commonwealth asset, it had no value attached to it. The official also advised that the facility was so degraded that it could not be used without major structural upgrades.
The shire of Cocos Island have been calling for a long time for this facility to be handed over to them so that they can actually use it. There are a couple of hundred acres of land and it is very overrun; the grass was extremely tall and overrun the last time I was there. This is a section of land that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council could well use, but no-one wants to use it to offload this government's problem and 50,000 sheep. I might add that there are 600 people on Cocos Island so, at this rate, they would all get 900 sheep each on a per head of population ratio. They would all get 900 sheep each. That is pretty well enough roast legs of lamb to last them about 18 years, so maybe at the end of the day they could do well out of this. I do not think that a big rush on roast lamb is what is needed on Cocos Island.
What is needed is for this government to sit down and talk to the people on Christmas and Cocos islands. That would be an unusual event for this government, because this government have constantly used the Indian Ocean territories to dump their problems. It is a kind of out of sight out of mind view regarding Christmas and Cocos islands. Cocos Island is not an appropriate place to put the sheep. The CEO of the shire council, Mr Jarvis, said so last Saturday. The island is too small and the facilities are inadequate. You could not get the sheep off the ship, let alone house them or feed them.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-07,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 612.
I have moved this suspension of standing orders because the matter has urgency, is extremely germane to the current business of this country and is extremely important in the matter of the country having a right to believe that its leadership is dealing with it directly and honestly in, above all matters, the decision to use its armed services—in this case 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel—to invade another country. The Prime Minister has deceived Australia in this matter. In March this year the Prime Minister announced that Defence Force personnel from this country would be joining those sent by President Bush from the United States and Prime Minister Blair from the United Kingdom to invade Iraq. The Prime Minister did that on the basis—and I quote from his speech to the nation:
We are determined to join other countries to deprive Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, its chemical and biological weapons, which even in minute quantities are capable of causing death and destruction on a mammoth scale. 
We know that the Prime Minister was wrong in those matters, that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction and therefore was not able to create the death and destruction from weapons of mass destruction on the mammoth scale asserted by the Prime Minister, which of course led to a response of some considerable fear in this country. The Prime Minister then went on to make his second claim, that these weapons threatened Australians. He said:
Iraq has long supported international terrorism ... International terrorism knows no borders ... Australia and Australians anywhere in the world are as much targets as any other Western country and its people. 
Therefore the possession of chemical, biological, or even worse still, nuclear weapons by a terrorist network would be a direct undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its people.
It was under those circumstances of imminent, direct, undeniable and lethal threat to the Australian people that Prime Minister Howard asked our defence forces to take part in the invasion of Iraq. Now with the passage of history it has become abundantly clear that the Prime Minister was not just a bit wrong but totally wrong. Never before in the history of this nation has a leader sent the defence forces of this country to a war, much less the invasion of another country, on a deception, on a complete fabrication which did not relate to and was not germane to the truth of the circumstances in Iraq. This is a matter of enormous moment for this nation. This is a matter of extreme concern for all those who believe that, in a democracy, ultimately one has to depend on the honesty and truthfulness of the leader of the country relying on the available intelligence before putting even the potential for sacrifice of Australian lives at threat.
We know now that Australia was not threatened by Iraq. We know that Australian lives were put at risk unnecessarily. We know that this Prime Minister, even when faced with the truth of those matters, seems to be in denial. He seems incapable of coming to grips with the fact that he was central to this deception. He took upon himself the authority—through his word, which has been shown to be wrong—to send Australians into this invasion. It is, therefore, absolutely imperative that the Prime Minister be censured. It is important that this debate take place; that the Senate look at the record of the last six months and before that, and make a decision to support this censure motion. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>IRAQ</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-07,"—The Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003 makes amendments to the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964. The 1964 act provided that certain criminal laws applying in the Jervis Bay territory apply to Australian citizens and residents serving overseas under arrangements made between the Commonwealth and the United Nations. This bill would amend the 1964 act to ensure that these same laws also apply to Australian non-military personnel working under a variety of agreements, and in a variety of roles, in any jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth of Australia.
As the opposition does not oppose this bill, I will not take up a significant portion of time tonight—not that we have it available in any event—but it is necessary to make a number of brief statements about the bill and to raise a couple of issues that we will pursue later in the committee stage. The amendments contained in this bill intend to extend the operation of the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 to cover two categories of Australian non-military personnel working outside the Commonwealth of Australia. It is not necessary for the bill to cover military personnel because members of the Australian Defence Force are already covered by the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 that establishes a regime of extraterritoriality along the same lines as the jurisdictional regime outlined in these amendments.
The first category of personnel covered by the proposed amendments is personnel working under agreements where multilateral or bilateral agreements, signed by Australia and the relevant host state, specifically grant immunity for criminal offences to Australian personnel operating in these jurisdictions. These amendments are uncontroversial in that regard and are supported by the opposition. The opposition recognises these amendments are necessary to ensure that Australian personnel operating with immunity overseas are, nonetheless, held responsible for criminal acts committed while they are covered by immunity agreements. The opposition, as I have said, supports these amendments because such an extension of jurisdiction is necessary to close the jurisdictional gap that currently exists for Australian non-military personnel operating with immunity.
Although the overwhelming majority of Australian personnel who undertake roles associated with the Commonwealth government overseas do so professionally and also with the highest regard for the laws and customs of the nations in which they operate, it is an issue—unfortunate as it may be but inevitable in some instances—that a very small minority break local laws while serving under an immunity agreement. As such, it is necessary for Australian courts to have the ability to apply Australian criminal jurisdiction over individuals accused of offences covered by immunity agreements.
This extension was expressly recommended by a unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, handed down in 1999. This report recommended that the Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 `be amended to extend its jurisdiction to Australian civilians serving overseas in situations not covered by the agreement of the United Nations'. Just as the opposition supported this recommendation in 1999 we continue to support amendments to the 1964 act that close the jurisdictional gap and ensure that no Australians are above the law. Rather than a condemnation of the great service of Australians who have represented this country in dangerous and challenging roles, the opposition believes that these amendments affirm the integrity of the vast majority of fine Australians who have represented Australia overseas by holding them to the vigorous test of the rule of law. This is a test which they have passed with flying colours and which, in many cases, they have been instrumental in upholding and strengthening in the nations in which they have served.
The second category of personnel covered by the amendments contained in this bill are Australian non-military personnel who are serving in overseas jurisdictions under agreements that do not specifically grant immunity or who operate in countries without any agreement involving the host nation and Australia. In these circumstances the Attorney-General has the power to declare an agreement under which Australians are serving, or a country in which Australians are serving, a declared agreement or a declared country. This prescription by regulation, at the discretion of the Attorney-General, automatically activates the jurisdictional provisions of this act. Once again, this amendment implements a recommendation of the unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade handed down in 1999, which recommended `replacing “under agreement between the United Nations and the Government of that country” with, “a prescribed arrangement”'. The opposition supported the recommendation handed down by the joint committee then and continues to support an amendment that implements this recommendation now.
The use of the principle of extraterritoriality in criminal law matters is not without precedent in either Australian law or the laws of other nations, and the opposition believes that this instance is one of the occasions when the utilisation of this novel jurisdictional strategy is not only legitimate but, in the circumstances, demanded by the principles of justice. Australian law already utilises this principle of extraterritoriality in the prosecution and punishment of child sex offenders who commit offences outside the criminal jurisdiction of Australia. The requirements of justice in the case of offenders who commit sexual offences against children in countries where they are effectively above the law demands that the principle of jurisdiction be interpreted in such a way as to facilitate their prosecution when they return to Australia. The factual contingencies contemplated by this bill also demand such an interpretation of the principle of jurisdiction. However, in this case the principle of extraterritoriality needs to be applied offensively in the pursuit of Australian non-military personnel guilty of committing offences in countries where they enjoy immunity and defensively in the protection of Australian non-military personnel who are the subject of hostile or mala fide prosecutions.
The opposition also cites the recent moves by the American legislature to implement a similar regime regarding its own civilians posted overseas in connection with the United States Department of Defense as evidence of the growing trend among nations concerned with protecting the rule of law to implement legislation to ensure that no-one escapes liability for unlawful acts by falling through the jurisdictional gaps opened up by the increasing overseas posting of non-military personnel. In particular, the opposition draws the Senate's attention to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000, enacted by the United States Congress on 22 November 2000. This act was designed to extend federal criminal jurisdiction over civi-lians who are accompanying the armed forces and who commit serious offences overseas when a host country does not exercise criminal jurisdiction.
For the reasons that I have already cited, the amendments proposed by the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003 are supported by the opposition. There has not been a committee stage in this bill. There was an issue raised by Senator Brown earlier today because he was curious about why we did not go through that stage, and I think I have clearly explained that this matter was dealt with by a joint standing committee as far back as 1999. It has taken a little while for these matters to come forward but they are embodied in these amendments now. The difference is that they apply to non-military personnel. 
If I understood Senator Brown correctly when he raised this matter today, he was talking about military personnel, and I think it was necessary to draw the senator's attention to whom the amendment to this bill will cover and the operation in relation to which it will be utilised. Of course, the committee matter was dealt with by the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in 1999, when it made a unanimous report. It was supported by the opposition and therefore this bill is non-controversial in nature and has gained the support of Labor. I will conclude on that note.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES (OVERSEAS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-07,"—The Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003 seeks to ensure that Australian citizens working overseas under an agreement between Australia and an international organisation, or between Australia and another country, are subject to Australian criminal law rather than the criminal law of the country in which they were working. As the briefing provided by the government notes, the bill responds to recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade regarding a possible jurisdictional gap for Australian non-military personnel serving overseas.
In its present form, the Crimes (Overseas) Act provides for the application of Australian criminal law to Australian civilians working in a foreign country as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force. It requires there to be an immunity agreement between the UN and the government of a foreign country. In recent years, and particularly in recent months, we have seen Australia's foreign policy develop in such a way that it is now not unusual for non-military personnel to be deployed to other countries under arrangements that do not involve the United Nations. The example cited by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade was the Bougainville peace monitoring group, which operated under an agreement between Papua New Guinea and a range of other countries, including Australia. That agreement expressly provided that members of the peace monitoring group were immune from the laws of Papua New Guinea and subject to the laws of their own country in relation to any offence that they might commit.
This bill extends the scope of the Crimes (Overseas) Act to four additional categories of Australians, depending on the arrangements under which they are working in a foreign country. Firstly, the bill applies to Australians working in a foreign country who have been granted diplomatic and consular immunities or who have been granted immunity due to their relationship with an international organisation. This extension of Australian criminal law is clearly necessary in order to fill a jurisdictional gap. If a person working under these arrangements were to commit a crime, there is a risk that that person could not be prosecuted either under the law of the foreign country or in Australia. The passage of this bill will rectify that situation. 
Secondly, the bill applies to Australians working in a foreign country under an arrangement or agreement between Australia and another country or between Australia and the United Nations where that person is not subject to criminal proceedings as a result of the agreement. Thirdly, the bill applies to Australians working in a foreign country under an agreement or arrangement between Australia and another country or between Australia and the United Nations which is a declared arrangement or agreement. The government may make regulations providing that a particular agreement or arrange-ment is declared an agreement or arrangement for the purposes of this particular legislation. 
The fourth category of persons to whom this bill applies is very broad. This category covers any Australian working overseas, not necessarily on behalf of the Commonwealth but simply on terms determined by the Commonwealth or pursuant to commitments or directions given by the Commonwealth. Such Australians will be subject to Australian criminal law if the country in which they are working is a declared foreign country. Again, the government may make regulations providing that a particular country is a declared foreign country. These third and fourth categories are wide ranging and will enable Australian law to be applied to public servants such as AusAID staff working overseas as well as to private consultants and the employees of private companies who perform contractual work for the Commonwealth. They essentially enable the Australian government to unilaterally declare a particular agreement or a particular country for the purposes of this legislation, whether or not there is any agreement with the foreign government which provides immunity for Australians.
Unlike the first and second categories, which contain express provisions addressing the issue of double jeopardy, these additional categories do not appear to address that issue and it is unclear to the Democrats why that should be the case. This double jeopardy rule is an important safeguard which protects individuals against the cost, anxiety and uncertainty associated with repeated criminal trials, let alone multiple convictions and sentences for the same offence. The basis for the rule also extends to broader considerations relating to the integrity of the criminal process, as it is vitally important for the community to be able to have confidence in the final outcome of a criminal trial. It is imperative that Australians who might be prosecuted for an offence in a foreign country do not face the prospect of being prosecuted for the same offence under Australian law. The Democrats will be moving amendments to put that beyond any doubt.
Our other concern in relation to the bill is the proposed retrospective commencement of schedule 1 from 1 July 2003. On 26 June 2003, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Customs issued a joint media release in which they announced the legislative changes contained within this bill. The release referred specifically to Australians deployed to Iraq and stated that, in relation to Iraq, the act would commence from 1 July this year.
As the Scrutiny of Bills Committee noted in its Alert Digest No. 11 of this year, the explanatory memorandum does not provide any reason to justify the retrospective commencement of the schedule. The only obvious point of reference is the joint press release of 26 June, but it remains unclear why the government chose 1 July as this commencement date. The Democrats agree with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that this appears to be yet another example of `legislation by press release', which has become a frequent practice of the government in recent times. The Democrats strongly oppose this practice as it seeks to usurp the democratic process by assuming that the parliament will vote a particular way before legislation has been introduced. This is an example of the government's arrogance and the Democrats take this opportunity to make it very clear to the government that it cannot and must not make pre-emptive assumptions about how the parliament will vote on any given piece of legislation.
While there have been some occasions when the Democrats have been prepared to support retrospective provisions, these have been limited to circumstances in which there is an overwhelming, imperative justification for retrospectivity and provided that there is no significant retrospective alteration to the rights and liberties of individuals. This bill does not meet those requirements. The government has failed to provide any compelling reason for the retrospective commencement of the schedule and, in this case, the bill does involve a very serious retrospective alteration to the rights and liberties of individuals. What we are talking about here is criminal liability—in other words, liability to be sentenced to imprisonment. This is not something which, as a legislature, we can tinker with retrospectively. I find it incredible that the government expects us to consider this seriously in the absence of any genuine and compelling reason for retrospectivity. The government ought not to pre-empt the decisions of the parliament as the Attorney-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice purported to do on 26 June. Ministers should refrain from making announcements which ultimately depend entirely on the decision of the parliament as a whole, otherwise the veracity of their media releases needs to be questioned.
The support of the Democrats for any retrospective legislation can never be assumed. In fact, the government should assume that we will oppose such legislation unless it can provide a compelling reason in support of retrospectivity. In this case, it has failed to do so and, unless the minister is able to provide any additional information during the committee stage, we Democrats will move amendments to remove the retrospective operation of this legislation.
Although we oppose the retrospective commencement of the bill, we Democrats are generally supportive of the thrust of the bill itself. As I understand it, the primary motivation behind the bill is to protect the rights of Australians working in countries whose criminal law does not provide the same level of protection as that afforded to an accused person under Australia criminal law. Australia's criminal law does incorporate a range of important protections—the independence of the courts, the right to silence, the presumption of innocence and the right to legal representation—although it should be noted that a number of these rights have suffered blows as a result of the government's antiterrorism measures. It is also important to remember that, if convicted of an offence under Australian law, individuals do not face the prospect of the death penalty as punishment for their crime.
In my view, it is completely hypocritical for the government to grant these protections to some Australians in foreign jurisdictions but not to others. I think, in particular, of David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, who remain locked up by the US military in Guantanamo Bay. The government has ignored the consistent calls from the Australian Democrats to bring Mr Hicks and Mr Habib home to Australia and either charge them and try them under Australian law or release them. The US's treatment of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib flies in the face of the most basic concepts of justice that Australians take for granted, even after the passage of the ASIO legislation.
Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are among 600 others, including a number of children, who have been held at Guantanamo Bay for over 18 months without charge. They have been stripped of their rights under international and domestic law, with the US refusing to recognise them as prisoners of war or charge them with offences under US law. They are housed in tiny wire cages which are exposed to the elements on all sides. For the first few months of their detention, they were released just once a week for a one-minute shower. This was eventually increased to a five-minute shower and 10 minutes of exercise once a week. From the outset, it was alleged that some of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay had no involvement whatsoever with terrorism. This was confirmed earlier this year when more than 40 of them were released without charge, including two elderly farmers who were taken into custody because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
A few months ago, the US announced that Mr Hicks would be among the first of those to be tried before a secret military tribunal. Despite that announcement, Mr Hicks has still not been charged with any offence, and there is no indication as to a likely time frame for the commencement of his trial. If and when any trial does ensue, the rules governing the proceedings will be the very antithesis of those that apply in criminal proceedings under Australian law. Apart from being completely secretive, the entire proceedings will be subject to presidential direction. They will have been set in motion as a result of a directive from the President and, if the President disagrees with the ultimate finding of the tribunal, he can simply reverse it. All the while, the government passively watches on, allowing Australian citizens to be treated in a way that would no doubt provide grounds for repatriation if they were being held in certain other countries.
It was only as a result of increasing community pressure and outrage that the Minister for Justice and Customs was eventually despatched to the United States to discuss this with the US authorities. Although some concessions were won, they were very minor. The government proudly announced that it had secured an assurance from the US that the death penalty would not be applied to Mr Hicks. However, when questioned further, it reluctantly conceded that no such assurance was secured in relation to Mr Habib.
I take this opportunity to again make the point that the government should seek to protect the rights of all Australians who are alleged to have committed crimes, not just those covered by the scope of this legislation. If Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are guilty of acts of terrorism then of course they must be brought to justice and punished accordingly. But, at this stage, they are merely alleged to have committed acts of terrorism, and it appears that the US is struggling to bring together enough evidence with which to prosecute them. It is imperative that the allegations against these men are tested and proven beyond reasonable doubt in a fair and independent trial according to law.
Finally—and I understand Senator Stott Despoja will speak to this further—it is important for the government not to simply confine its efforts to protecting the rights of Australians but to be a vigilant defender of the rights of all human beings. Unfortunately, the government's track record on human rights in recent years has left a lot to be desired and, although his record on the rights of asylum seekers does not bode well, I hope that the new Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, might demonstrate greater concern for the protection of human rights than did his predecessor.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES (OVERSEAS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-10-07,"—In speaking in this debate on the Crimes (Overseas) Amendment Bill 2003, Senator Greig has raised the question of Mr Habib and Mr Hicks, a matter I was personally involved in. I point out to the Senate that the President of the United States had indicated that Mr Hicks was eligible for trial. Mr Habib was not in that category. In fact, his status is yet to be determined. Discussions about what might transpire or how he might be dealt with were therefore somewhat premature. In relation to Mr Hicks, the situation was quite different, because we were looking at a situation where he had been determined to be eligible for trial. A number of concessions were obtained and the undertaking by the United States not to impose the death penalty was a major one. But the reason it was obtained for Mr Hicks was that he was eligible to stand trial. Mr Habib was not in that category. Therefore, the same level of negotiation could not take place in relation to Mr Habib as could take place in relation to Mr Hicks.
The government stand by our record in relation to that. We obtained a good many agreements and undertakings in relation to how Mr Hicks would be dealt with in the event of a trial. One of the agreements—or concessions, if you like—obtained was that if any other country might obtain a benefit which was greater than that which we obtained for Mr Hicks then Mr Hicks would enjoy the same benefit. So if the United Kingdom, for instance, obtained some benefit for one of its citizens which Mr Hicks did not enjoy then the United States agreed that he would have that benefit. We thought that was a very good catch-all concession. Negotiations have been continuing between Washington and officials here in Canberra, and the matter is being progressed, as of course the United Kingdom is progressing its discussions with the United States. That really does not concern the bill, but Senator Greig raised that issue and I thought I should just clarify those issues.
The government believes that this bill will protect Australian civilian personnel who are deployed overseas in a number of circumstances. This includes operations which are currently being conducted in Iraq and the Solomon Islands. I saw first-hand recently, with the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, the great work that is being done by our personnel in the Solomon Islands and also the reaction of the people of the Solomon Islands. They greatly appreciated the efforts that were being made. It was obvious that the decision that we took was the right one.
Without this amendment, Australian civilians may be at risk of becoming subject to the local criminal justice system of the country to which they have been deployed in certain situations. In many cases, the local criminal justice system may be unstable or in a state of collapse, making prosecution of deployed Australian civilians by local courts undesirable. For some overseas operations, the Australian government has been able to negotiate immunity for deployed Australian civilian personnel. In cases where Australian civilian personnel are immune from prosecution in a foreign country it is important that Australia has the ability to exercise jurisdiction over crimes which may have been committed during that deployment. If Australia is unable to exercise its own jurisdiction, Australia may face pressure to waive immunity and to allow the overseas courts to prosecute. If Australia does not waive immunity, a jurisdictional gap exists. The amendment bill resolves this jurisdictional gap and ensures that Australia is able to prosecute Australian personnel who are accused of offences while on overseas deployment.
In other cases, Australia may be unable to negotiate immunity for Australian civilians serving overseas but may be able to ensure that Australian jurisdiction will take priority over the jurisdiction of the local courts in that country. In these cases, it is important that Australia has the capacity to exercise jurisdiction over Australian civilian personnel who are deployed on overseas operations by the Australian government. If Australia is unable to exercise jurisdiction, Australian civilian personnel deployed overseas in such circumstances will be subject to prosecution in the local courts. This amendment will become particularly relevant in the future as Australia is faced increasingly with calls to send civilian experts, including policing experts, to overseas deployments. Of course we are seeing that in relation to New Guinea.
Australian Defence Force personnel are already protected by a similar provision in the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. The Australian Defence Force has long understood the importance of protecting ADF personnel through provisions like this, and it is now appropriate that Australian civilians who perform humanitarian, security and law enforcement duties should be similarly protected. The amendment bill will ensure that the Australian civilian personnel who are working with diplomatic, consular and similar immunities in foreign countries can be brought to justice in Australia. This will address the jurisdictional gap that such personnel are currently subject to. It is in Australia's interests to protect Australian civilian personnel deployed overseas by the Commonwealth. This bill ensures that protection.
There has been some comment as to why this took so long. A range of issues have been involved. Firstly, the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was handed down in 1999. Of course extensive consultation had to take place, and in 2000 the government responded to that report. Policy approval was given in January 2001, and of course the bill had to remain in abeyance while the Intelligence Services Act 2001 was dealt with.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-07,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
As these questions deal with matters that are the responsibility of the Australian Taxation Office, I have asked the Commissioner for advice. The advice in relation to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Reports are kept of all matters considered by the Part IVA Panel. These reports contain taxpayer information and therefore cannot be released. Individual taxpayers may request access to the reports through the Freedom of Information Act.
(2)	The loan arrangements referred to generally give rise to a liability that is claimed to be deductible although it is not, in fact, fully paid. The difference between the loan in Lau and the loans in co-operative investment projects are as a matter of law a question of fact and degree. In lay terms the differences may be barely perceptible, in terms of the actual tax consequences there are marked differences.
