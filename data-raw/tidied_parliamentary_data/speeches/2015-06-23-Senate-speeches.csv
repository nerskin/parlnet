Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:32):  I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. This bill seeks to amend the National Health Act 1953 to implement measures in the PBS Access and Sustainability Package. My colleagues in the other place have talked about the failure of this government to consult Labor over substantial amendments to this legislation. In the time the legislation has moved from that place to this one, the level of consultation has not improved at all. So I am glad that the economics committee did have the opportunity, albeit a very short one, to have a look at the bill in more detail. This is an important piece of legislation because it includes changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and it includes measures that give effect to agreements with the generic medicines industry of Australia and Medicines Australia and, of course, the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, the new five-year agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.


Labor is rightly concerned about potential unintended consequences because of the lack of consultation and the lack of scrutiny. This is becoming typical of this government; it is their way of operating. They make changes to legislation that have the potential to harm some of our most vulnerable Australians, but they shut down conversation until the very last minute and then try and ram it through an hour before midnight. In the case of this bill, Labor was only made aware of the detail the night before it was tabled in a briefing from the department. The government knew that the existing pharmacy agreement was to expire on 30 June but have yet again shown their inability to have good-faith negotiations with those they need to. This incompetent and chaotic government has had 12 months to negotiate a new pharmacy agreement. The Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement clearly sets this out. It says: ''Negotiations for a new community pharmacy agreement will commence 12 months prior to the expiry of the agreement and will conclude by 31 March 2015.' But we know that negotiations did not start until just four months ago and only concluded earlier this month, just one day before the bill was rushed into parliament. And now we have just seven days to give this important legislation, a commitment to spend $18.9 billion, the attention it deserves in the Senate before it is passed. As you would expect from an opposition which is reasonable and responsible, Labor believes it is worth taking the time to have a good look at the detail of this bill in the Senate as we did in the other place.


I now go to the elements of the bill—the PBS package initially. Unlike previous pharmacy agreements this bill seeks to bundle up a series of other measures not directly linked to the remuneration of pharmacists. This is called the PBS Access and Sustainability Package. The government says that this package of measures is designed to deliver 'a more sustainable pharmaceutical benefits scheme with better value for taxpayers, cheaper medicines for consumers and approved access to innovative medicines'. Labor is always concerned when the government talks about sustainability because, as night follows day, it almost always results in massive cuts such as their cuts of almost $800 million to the flexible funds or new taxes such as the current GP tax, which is in fact worse than the original proposal for a GP tax. We know that the government is cutting $800 million from the flexible funds that support vital programs such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation services, mental health services and peak organisations like Mental Health Australia and the Consumer Health Forum. It is also cutting more than $2 billion in Medicare rebates over the forward estimates, something we know from health professionals will see bulk-billing rates decline and many more vulnerable patients facing not insignificant out-of-pocket costs.


According to the government, this access and sustainability package contains more than 20 measures and is designed to achieve $3.7 billion in net savings over five years. It includes $6.6 billion in savings 'across the entire pharmaceutical supply chain', partially offset by $2.8 billion of these savings going back into pharmacies as part of the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. Of the remaining $3.7 billion, the government is promising, though not budgeting for at this stage, that some of this money will be invested in new drug listings. In other words, cuts to the prices paid to drug companies are being used to both prop up the budget and fund the additional money going into the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. The industry newsletter Pharma in Focus declared that 'research pharma companies are by far the hardest hit in contributing to the $6.6 billion in total savings'.


The key components of this package are new PBS pricing policies to reduce the price paid by the Commonwealth for innovative medicines—that is, F1 or formulary 1 medicines—and generic F2 medicines; a supposed increase in pharmacy competition by allowing pharmacies to discount the co-payment; the removal of some over-the-counter medicines from the PBS, which I note may see some patients paying more in out-of-pocket costs; a change in the structure of pharmacy remuneration to remove the link to PBS prices, something that also may increase out-of-pocket costs for some patients; and a provision for pharmacy to expand its role into the community. The government expects the majority of savings achieved by these measures to come from PBS pricing changes. 


Firstly, I go to the F1 five per cent reduction issue. Around $1 billion of the cuts from this package come from the inclusion, for the first time, of a statutory price reduction for patented or F1 medicines. The price paid for all patented medicines that have been listed on the PBS for at least five years will be cut by five per cent on 1 April 2016. This is expected to affect 400 medicines. Newer medicines that reach their five-year anniversary on the PBS following that date will take a five per cent price cut on the following April. 


The government argues that delaying the price reduction for five years after listing is intended to give manufacturers time to recoup their investment cost. Prior to this agreement, Medicines Australia argued that drug companies had been forced to take significant cuts in recent years, most notably as a result of expanded and accelerated price disclosure, and reductions could put at risk Australia's access to innovative new medicines. The industry argues that it is in the F1 phase that it recoups its research investment. It says it would affect the listing price of new drugs, because part of the price struck was directly related to the price of comparable drugs. It also warned that the proposals made it more likely that some medicines would be delisted and could impact on research and development worth over $1 billion.


However, the 2013 report by the Grattan Institute found the opposite—that Australia is paying more than many Western countries for pharmaceuticals in general and more than New Zealand for patented as well as generic drugs. I also note that there is some uncertainty about the status of the agreement with Medicines Australia, largely due to the incompetence of this government and its obvious inability to work with industry collaboratively or negotiate in good faith.


Secondly, I go to the question of F2 price disclosure. Generic and off-patent medicines, also referred to as F2 drugs, are, as a result of Labor's reforms, subject to accelerated price disclosure, which requires the suppliers of these medicines to advise the Department of Health of the prices at which they are selling their brands. The government then uses this information to move the price paid by the government closer to the price at which the drugs are supplied in the market. 


Under these changes, expected to save $2 billion, from 1 October next year the market price of medicines listed on F2 for three years or more will no longer take into account the originator brand of the drug. This should see lower prices for both government and consumers, as originator or premium brand names tend to maintain higher prices than generic competitors, which draws the average price up. As well as an expected 50 per cent reduction in the price of generic medicines, prices should also fall for general patients, though not for concessional patients, who make up around 80 per cent of PBS prescriptions, as all PBS prescriptions are priced above the concessional co-payment of $6.10.


The third issue is price disclosure. Another change, expected to save $610 million over five years, is the closing of a loophole relating to combination drugs that allows them to avoid price cuts from price disclosure in certain circumstances. The bill has provisions to close this loophole so that price disclosure reductions for component drugs of combination drugs on F2 will flow on to the combination drugs, starting on 1 April 2016.


Perhaps the most significant and the least understood change in the package is what is referred to as a technical amendment relating to 'PBS listing for bioequivalent and biosimilar medicines', which is expected to save the Commonwealth another $880 million. This continues to be an area of significant contention. It involves the insertion of a new subsection into the act allowing bioequivalent or biosimilar medicines to be taken as having the same drug effect as a listed brand.


Another technical amendment allows the minister to determine that a brand is equivalent to another brand for the purposes of substitution by a pharmacist and requires the minister to have regard to any advice on equivalence given by the PBAC. Exactly how this will operate is still unclear, with even the industry at this stage unsure as to the full details of the move. However, on the surface it does appear to be designed to promote across-the-board substitution. This appears to contradict the TGA's biosimilar guideline. While this is currently under review, the existing July 2013 guideline specifically says that a biosimilar's product information should include a statement ruling out substitution. Labor will always support moves to make the PBS sustainable and medicines cheaper for patients, but this issue has not been explained well by the government. In fact, the government has handled this issue very, very poorly indeed.


All of the measures that I have detailed to this point are, in effect, the lead-in to the real reason for the legislation: the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. This legislation encapsulates how the government has, in the words of one commentator, basically raided the drug companies to pay for the additional funding promised as part of the sixth agreement. However, it is deeply disappointing and of great concern to Labor that, while the government boasts of how it has ripped $6.6 billion out of health as a result of these cuts across the pharmaceutical chain, just $2.8 billion is going back into the health system by way of increased payments to pharmacists. The government has made vague promises about some of that money being made available for new drugs, but there is no mention of that in the legislation.


I now move to the pharmacy location rules. A key component of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill is the extension of the pharmacy location rules for another five years. These rules generally restrict a new pharmacy from opening within a certain distance of an existing pharmacy—usually 1.5 kilometres in metro areas or 10 kilometres in more remote locations. These rules prevent pharmacies from being placed either within or in a position directly accessible from a supermarket. I do understand the arguments about competition and prices, but Labor believe that community pharmacy plays an important role in our society that goes beyond dollars and cents and, therefore, the location rules deserve our support. As such, Labor do support amending the existing legislation, which sets a 30 June 2015 expiry date for the location rules, to 30 June 2020, but we do so in the context that these rules will be reviewed independently over the course of the next two years. This, of course, is the main reason this bill is now being forced on the parliament with such haste. Were this bill not to pass this month, the location rules notionally would expire on 30 June and, in theory, anyone could apply for the right to open a new pharmacy in any location.


Easily the most contentious part of this legislation is the proposal to allow pharmacists to be allowed to discount the PBS co-payment by up to one dollar for every dispensed medicine from 1 January next year. From the moment this proposal first became public, it prompted a furious backlash from pharmacists, who have argued that it will harm chronically ill patients as it will take them longer to reach the PBS safety net and they will thus be paying for medications for a longer period. This is because the safety net is not, as many have assumed, set at a certain number of prescriptions but set at a dollar amount. In the case of a concession card holder, for example, that is $366. Therefore, with cheaper drugs it means it will take longer to reach the safety net. It is this delay which explains how the government expects to save more than $360 million over five years through this measure.


A couple of points can be made here. First of all, the discount is entirely voluntary. Unlike the cuts applied to drug companies, chemists can choose whether or not to offer this discount to their customers. As the safety net is unchanged, ultimately no-one can be worse off. No patients can pay a cent more for their prescriptions under this proposal, and many, indeed, may pay a bit less. The average concession card holder fills 40 scripts a year, and 80 per cent do not reach the safety net. If their prescriptions were all filled by a chemist offering the discount, that is a saving of $40 a year, which, for many pensioners, is quite a significant amount. I note that the Pharmacy Guild has indicated that it supports the package, 'with the exception of the discounted co-payment, which is a matter for government'. But the fact is that this co-payment is embedded in the package and cannot be dealt with in isolation.


One thing that concerns me about these changes is that people living in rural and regional areas may end up paying more because pharmacists are less likely to discount co-payments where the costs of doing business are higher and competition is lower. No-one will doubt that the costs of living for everyone are higher in rural, remote and regional Australia, but the government are happy to drive costs up even further because, despite the rhetoric, they, frankly, just do not care. I also am concerned about the impacts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote areas.


Finally, I wish to go to the question of pharmacy payments. The previous five-year agreement was costed at $15.4 billion; this one, we are told, will cost $18.9 billion over the next five years. That is an increase of $3.5 billion, or 22 per cent, at a time when every other part of the health sector is being cut to the bone and forced to accept a freeze in indexation. This is an increase, but it is an increase in real terms, running at close to double what would have been the case had the amount been linked to inflation; and this does not include an estimated $4.8 billion paid direct to chemists for scripts at below the PBS charge. In total, the government therefore estimates the potential revenue for this sector from the PBS to be $23.7 billion over the next five years. As the Australian Medical Association has pointed out, at the same time as pharmacists are receiving a significant increase in funding and a dispensing fee that for the first time will be indexed to inflation, GPs are being asked to accept no indexation and no increase to their funding for four years, while other sectors such as specialists and radiographers could see their income frozen for five years or more.


This is a proposal that just does not make sense. The government recognises that chemists cannot be viable without a significant increase in funding, while other parts of the medical profession can get by with no change in income for four or five years. The answer, of course, is that they cannot, and it is patients who will pay the cost, either through even higher gap payments or by being denied bulk-billing. This is, of course, just the GP tax by another name. Instead of an up-front charge of $7, it is now a back-door charge of over $8—according to the Medical Journal of Australia—by freezing doctors' incomes and forcing them to pass on the cost to their patients. 


Labor welcomes the decision to recognise the work done by chemists and reward them with a living wage, but it is the height of hypocrisy for the government to recognise this in one sector of the health profession while denying such recognition for everyone else. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-06-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:52):  I rise to speak today to the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. It is a very problematic piece of legislation for the Senate to deal with. It is problematic because we have a whole range of measures that are packaged as part of this omnibus bill. Many of these measures have huge implications for the health budget and patients. You have to wonder about whether this is a strategic or deliberate tactical decision to force the Senate to pass this package of legislation as a whole rather than allow us to unpack it and deal with each piece of legislation on its merit.


The Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement is one of the most important measures in this agreement. It is a major component of the legislation. It is worth almost $20 billion and, I suspect, that is part of the reason we are here today, on the eve of the Senate breaking for the winter period, in a rush to pass all this legislation. We did not get the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement signed off in time. The result is that we are in a panic to pass the bill by 30 June. The reason for that is, if the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement does not get passed the location rules that exist in the fifth agreement lapse and, as a result, we end up with a huge disruption to community pharmacy. The Senate should be concerned that we have had very little time for scrutiny of the bill or any scrutiny of the community pharmacy agreement. We are being asked to rush through a major piece of legislation because we did not conclude the negotiations around the community pharmacy agreement in a timely way.


Importantly for me, as somebody who has expressed concern over the criticisms levelled at the previous agreement, the Senate has been asked to take the government's word that the failings in the last community pharmacy agreement have been rectified. The audit into the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement was one of the most damning indictments ever handed down by the audit office and it was a shock to me to read of it. The auditor found that there was very limited basis for assessing the extent to which the fifth CPA met its key objectives. It failed at that very basic level. There was no straightforward means for the parliament or other stakeholders to know the expected or actual cost of the key components. It did not document that some of the $2.2 billion—of $13.8 billion that the Commonwealth was supposed to deliver for pharmacy remuneration—was sourced from co-payments, which were not a cost to government. There were a whole range of things.


The initiatives in the fifth agreement promised $1 billion in savings. They only delivered $400 million. There were a lot of questions about how money was transferred. There were $277 million from professional programs put into a grant to the guild. The audit office could not explain why these programs were transferred or why they became grants. There were all sorts of problems. A number of key government negotiating objectives were only partially realised. There were major shortcomings in record keeping by the department. We had a situation where the meetings between the department and the Pharmacy Guild occurred without minutes being taken. When they prepared the initial agreement the department did not develop a risk-management or probity plan and did not consult with a probity adviser. The list goes on.


Those criticisms were made by the National Audit Office and, to my knowledge, they have not been dealt with in an open and transparent way. The last discussion we had in this chamber around the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement was about the findings of the audit office. The next time I stand in the chamber is to sign off on a new agreement, without any clear understanding about whether those shortcomings have been addressed. I have grave concerns about that. I have grave concerns about the way the agreement was negotiated and whether we have a framework now to ensure the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, which is an essential piece of this legislation, meets its key objectives.


We are now being asked to approve the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement with $19 billion—because of this rush to do so before the 1 July deadline. A much more sensible thing would have been for the government to remove the pharmacy location rules from the bill, for us to have passed that measure so that we get some certainty in community pharmacy and then to start unpacking the various pieces of this legislation and have a genuine hearing into the merits of each. Instead, we have been told to pass all of this—effectively, with a gun to our heads.


If we do pass this bill, the effect will be that a $19 million agreement goes through with almost no scrutiny. It is fair to say there was a committee process. It went for two hours while the parliament was sitting, while the division bells were ringing. It is remarkable to think that we could have a bill of such importance and with such a truncated committee process. It denies us in this chamber the opportunity to interrogate the legislation in any meaningful way. My concern is that we will end up passing some good reforms—I think there are some sensible reforms in the bill—but deny the parliament the opportunity to ensure we have it right when it comes to the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. I do not make any direct criticism of the guild, in this, because I do not know whether what was negotiated was in the interests of patients or not—and we are being denied the opportunity to do that.


If we look at some of the other measures in the bill, there was the $6.6 billion in savings across the entire pharmaceutical supply chain. That will be partially offset because a chunk of that, $2.8 billion, is returned to pharmacies through the Sixth Community Pharmaceutical Agreement and the remainder, $3.7 billion, is going to be invested in new PBS drugs. That is a good thing, provided it happens. That is not part of this legislation. We are very keen to ensure that that is what that $3.7 billion is allocated to do. We understand that the bill amends the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by implementing agreements with the Generic Medicines Industry Association and Medicines Australia—that the government at least wants to do that—and the bill, as a result, sees a new PBS pricing policy that reduces the price paid by the Commonwealth for drugs on the F1 formula by five per cent after five years, and that measure alone is expected to affect about 400 listed drugs.


Another complex part of the legislation is the change to F2 drugs. From October 2016, the market price of medicines listed on the F2 formulary for three years or more will no longer take the originator brand of the drug into account, and that will deliver significant savings: $2 billion. Another $610 million is saved by closing loopholes relating to combination drugs that allow companies to avoid price cuts as a result of price disclosure. They are measures, by and large, that have our support. They are sensible measures. We think they are changes that will ensure that consumers will pay less for their medications and we think that is a good step forward.


On the other side of that equation there are a number of reports that suggest that five million people using the most commonly prescribed medications will see prices rise—in one report by up to 39 per cent. That is of huge concern to us. When we tested that, one of the arguments that was made was that competition will ensure that we do not see price rises when it comes to medicines, but of course, as we discussed through Senate estimates, there is very little competition, particularly in rural and regional areas where there may only be one pharmacy. It is hard to see what incentive there is for pharmacies to pass price savings on to consumers.


The rise in the cost of medications is a consequence of the introduction of the new handling fee to chemists as part of the agreement. The Greens in general will support one of the positive measures that we think is in that agreement, and that is that the pharmacies will now discount the co-payment by $1 for the provision of generic medicines. We think that is important. However, we do know that the health department wanted to implement a $3 discount policy and we know that the guild fought against it. Again, because of the secretive nature of these negotiations, we do not know how the price of $1 was reached. The total lack of transparency through these negotiations means: could we have got a better deal for consumers? And, if we could have, why didn't we do that? What was the reason that we settled on the $1 discount? It is opposed by the Pharmacy Guild and I think that says a lot about the way this negotiation was reached. I have to say that it is disappointing that the guild would oppose a very small $1 discount on concession card holders. We think that is good policy, particularly when you contrast that with the fact that there is a significant increase relative to the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement and we now have an agreement with the guild that is worth around $19 billion.


One of the most contentious parts of the bill is the amendment to the PBS listing for equivalent and biosimilar medicines. It is a change that is expected to save the government about $880 million. It is worth exploring what biosimilars are before we get into the economic argument. With regard to biosimilars, you have a number of new medications—really effective medications for some cancers, some autoimmune conditions and so on—that are made from biological products, living cells. They are very big and complex molecules. They are very different to other existing medications which have small molecules—drugs like aspirin, paracetamol and so on. They are not drugs that are particularly complex—only a few changes in atoms—and they are easily replicated. You can replicate the manufacturing process in a way that ensures that you get exactly the same product every time, regardless of where it is made, providing that the manufacturing facility conforms to a uniform set of standards. But, when it comes to biosimilars, because they are such big and complex molecules and they are very highly sensitive to the environment in which they are manufactured, it is almost impossible to create a molecule that is identical to the molecule that you are trying to copy. So biosimilars are the generic version, if you like, of the original biological medication, but, unlike generics, it is very difficult to guarantee that what you are getting is exactly the same molecular structure, and what flows from that is whether you are going to get exactly the same physiological effects. Every biosimilar medication does have to undergo a range of clinical trials. They need to demonstrate safety and they have to go through the same process that the originator biological product had to go through to show that there are not any clinically meaningful differences.


That brings us onto the issue of substitution. If the chemicals are not identical, should we be able to substitute the original drug with the biosimilar drug? This is where the contention lies. Under this bill, the substitution provision allows pharmacists to substitute a prescribed medication—that is, the original biological medication—with a biosimilar or bioequivalent medication. There is some debate about this in the scientific community. It is true that we do permit substitution for generic medication, but the technical amendment in this bill ensures that it is allowed to happen at a pharmacy level for biosimilar medications. There is a lot of contention about this. One of the things that concern me is that Australia will be one of only a few countries that allows this substitution to happen at a pharmacy level. I do recognise that a number of concerns have been raised about this aspect of the policy. Our understanding is that the TGA's existing guidelines, which I think are currently under review, state that a biosimilar's product information should include a statement ruling out substitution. There are some experts on biosimilars who claim that pharmacy level substitution:


… is not only moving away from best practice but seemingly is about to set itself on a path that will see patients at unnecessary risk.


On the other side of the argument, agencies like the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the PBAC—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee—will not allow biosimilar substitution unless there is evidence that that can occur.


What this suggests, though, is the debate that exists within this area of biological medications and substitution is not settled. That is always a cause of concern for me. I would have appreciated the opportunity to vote on this legislation after having had some time with the various academics and experts in this field to get some assurances that what we were doing is not putting patients at risk. We were denied that opportunity. We were denied it because this bill is packaged as a whole and you have to support the whole thing. Otherwise, we will have an issue with pharmacists getting remunerated and with location rules.


On balance, though, there are, as I said, a number of measures that we support. Cheaper medication for patients at a time when out-of-pocket costs are rising is a positive step forward. We do worry about some of the measures in the bill that will increase the cost of medicines. It is almost certain for a number of common prescription medications. You have to wonder why the government allowed that to occur in its negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild. We think that was a mistake. But, again, it is very difficult to make any firm judgements on that when the only people involved in the negotiations are the guild and the department. There is very little opportunity for any transparency, scrutiny or accountability of that extremely significant and very expensive agreement.


In concluding, we will support this bill, but we do so with the reservations that I have just expressed. We are being asked to pass legislation governing some pretty cutting-edge scientific debates around whether we can substitute one drug for another and what that does in terms of risk to patients. I want to put on record that we hope that some of the concerns expressed by people in this area do not materialise and that we would have liked the opportunity to interrogate those potential risks a little further. We do not think it is good practice for senators who have limited understanding in this area—and I am fortunate that I have more than most—and who want to interrogate this further to be denied the opportunity for a decent committee process where this sort of evidence can be presented and discussed.


Also, we do not think that passing the bill simply because we did not reach an agreement with the Pharmacy Guild in time is good practice. We think that needs to be taken into consideration. We should not be rushing these bills through the parliament. I am concerned about the way the Community Pharmacy Agreement was reached and I am concerned about the issue of substitution when it comes to biosimilars. On balance, though, those other measures are important. We think they are worthwhile and we welcome them. We will support this bill because of the benefit that those measures will deliver for consumers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-06-23,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:12):  I rise to speak against passage of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. I do so in full awareness that the bill is a proper curate's egg—good in parts—and contains measures designed to increase price competition and deliver PBS savings to the government. In some cases, they may even result in cheaper medicines for consumers. However, the bill also continues the operation of the pharmacy location rules for another five years—a powerful anti-competitive measure. I put on record my opposition to this piece of opportunistic rent-seeking because it benefits the Pharmacy Guild at everyone else's expense.


Both Labor and the coalition support the continuation of the rules which require a pharmacist to obtain federal government approval to open a new pharmacy or to move or expand an existing pharmacy. I hesitate to suggest a direct link, but I note that the guild is a very significant donor to both parties. Generally, a new pharmacy cannot be opened within a certain distance of an existing pharmacy—usually either 1.5 kilometres or 10 kilometres, depending on the area. These rules also ban pharmacies being placed either within or in a position directly accessible from a supermarket.


Several reviews have recommended the rules be abolished. In March, the review of competition policy led by Professor Ian Harper found the rules were anti-competitive and unnecessary, restricting consumer choice and suppliers' capacity to respond to consumer demand. Last year, the National Commission of Audit recommended the pharmacy sector be opened to competition through the deregulation of location and ownership rules. Such reform would produce more efficient service delivery and allow the development of alternative retail models such as pharmacists dispensing medicines at supermarkets.


A decade ago a Productivity Commission review found that pharmacy regulation increased costs for consumers, taxpayers and the wider community. Poor Tony Shepherd: every single good idea he had at the National Commission of Audit has been ignored by the government that commissioned his services. I suspect, however, that repeating the findings of various reviews cuts no ice with many people, because they fail to see the human cost of the pharmacy location rules. To that end, I am going to do what economic reformers and analysts rarely do: I am going to tell a story—or several stories.


In my first story, it is night. A fever takes hold and a mother starts to worry. A bathroom cupboard is raided, but it is full of medicine past its use-by date. A child is bundled into a car. A waiting room is endured. Then a GP provides a prescription. With child in arms, the mother returns to the car then scratches her head: where is a chemist that would be open at this time of night? Should she drive around in the hope of finding a chemist that is open? Driving past the lit-up supermarket, the mother wonders, 'Why is it so hard to find a chemist?'


In my second story, the enthusiasm of a young pharmacist slowly seeps away. She is at home, twiddling on her iPhone, passing the time. She had a short shift today. They are always short shifts. She is just a temp. She used to dream of running her own pharmacy. The dream took hold during her years of business and pharmacy studies. It lingered on after graduation as she did stints in pharmacies far and wide, working for the man. But now the dream of working behind her own counter, building her own reputation in her own neighbourhood and community, is gone. It was a silly dream.


In my third story, over at the Pharmacy Guild headquarters on National Circuit, David Quilty, the guild's executive director, reclines in his office chair. His late-night meeting with the health minister went well. The guild's members, the owners of pharmacies across Australia, will be pleased. The next Community Pharmacy Agreement—a five-year deal between the guild and the government—is much like the last one, and the one before that. The deal will see pharmacy owners continue to enjoy regulations to protect them and subsidies to enrich them. Mr Quilty recalls how he had to explain the regulations to the health minister: 'They ban new pharmacies within 10 kilometres of an existing pharmacy. Of course, this exclusion zone is reduced to 1½ kilometres if the new pharmacy is to be near a GP or supermarket, 500 metres if the new pharmacy is to be in a large medical centre or small shopping centre and 200 metres if the new pharmacy is to be near four GPs and a supermarket. And two pharmacies are allowed in large shopping centres with more than 100 shops; three are allowed if there are more than 200 shops. Naturally, pharmacies that are directly accessible from a supermarket are banned. And the regulations require any new pharmacy to be approved by an authority that includes incumbent pharmacy owners nominated by the guild.'


Mr Quilty chuckles as he recalls the health minister's bemused look. As the Commonwealth car drives off into the night, the health minister shakes her head in the back seat. She ponders the numbers thrown around in the meeting just gone. More than $18 billion from taxpayers to around 5,000 owners of pharmacies over five years: nice work if you can get it, and well above the hundreds of thousands of dollars that the Pharmacy Guild provides in political donations. A wry smile passes over her face as she heads back to the comfort of Parliament House, a place where deals usually involve the government getting something in return for giving something away. She is philosophical. No previous health minister has been able to cut the taxpayer funds flowing to pharmacy owners or remove the anticompetitive regulations that grant them protection—and perhaps no health minister ever will.


This is corporate welfare in its purest form, corporate welfare in response to a sustained campaign of rent seeking. That is, it involves the Pharmacy Guild spending money on political lobbying for government benefits or subsidies, thereby gaining a chunk of wealth that has already been created while imposing regulations on competitors. This, more than anything else, brings free market capitalism into disrepute, not because there is anything wrong with free market capitalism but, rather, because certain industry players are happy to kick everyone else in the teeth while engaging in the economic equivalent of pillage. The rent seeking, opportunism and overregulation in this bill ought to be condemned.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:20):  I support the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. And, just as Senator Leyonhjelm has his position in relation to the Pharmacy Guild, I support community pharmacies, and I do so unashamedly. In relation to the location rule that Senator Leyonhjelm will be putting up an amendment about, of course he is entitled to do so. I think debate is healthy in relation to this. I was involved in a case for a constituent who had a pharmacy. I do not think he will mind me mentioning it. It was the Midnight Pharmacy in Adelaide, on Frome Street.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I have been to that place many times.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Hanson-Young has been to that pharmacy many times, and I think many others have as well. It is the only late-night pharmacy, and if you happen to be there between 10 pm and midnight, when all the other pharmacies in the metropolitan area seem to shut down, and hardly any others are open, you will see the Midnight Pharmacy full of parents with their young kids, or maybe the kids are in the car with the other parent. They are getting some urgent medications. This is the sort of situation Senator Leyonhjelm mentioned.


In my constituent's case, the Midnight Pharmacy was in breach of the location rules and had all sorts of technical difficulties in relation to that. But fortunately ministerial intervention prevailed, because there is a safety valve in the legislation. I am grateful to the former minister, Minister Dutton, for appropriately using ministerial intervention in relation to that, because there was a compelling case for that pharmacy to be open. It provides a community service late at night. It is open from 7am to midnight—the longest hours of any pharmacy in South Australia, as I understand it. So there is a discretion. There must always be a discretion in terms of hard and fast rules, but I think, on balance, the location rules do provide a basis for pharmacies to invest and to make a contribution to the local community by providing a service. I do not support, under any circumstances, Coles and Woolworths having pharmacies in their stores or controlling pharmacies. I think that would lead to a race to the bottom. That is my fear. I would rather it be run by as many small community businesses as possible. There are some chains or franchises, such as Terry White, but my understanding is that the Terry White pharmacies are owned by individual franchise owners. So I do not think this image that Mr White owns 150 pharmacies is accurate at all.


This piece of legislation is important, as the Pharmacy Guild points out. This gives effect to the PBS Access and Sustainability Package, which was formally announced by the Minister for Health on 27 May 2015. The government has made it clear, according to the Pharmacy Guild, that the bill's passage is a prerequisite to commencing the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement on 1 July 2015. I agree with the guild when it says that this agreement is critically important to securing the future of Australia's 5,450 community pharmacies, the jobs of their hardworking staff and the health care of the millions of patients who rely on them for their medicines. Without the investment contained in the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, community pharmacies face an unsustainable future due to the flow-on impact on the remuneration from PBS reforms.


I think it is fair to say that, on any reasonable analysis, the heavy lifting, in terms of cutbacks in health, has been borne disproportionately by the community pharmacy sector. I disclose that I happen to have two cousins who are pharmacists, and they tell me first hand of the pressures they face in their businesses. They are not gilding the lily. They tell me about the pressures that they face as community pharmacists—about the hours they have had to cut back for staff, as a result of accelerated price disclosure. I disagree fundamentally with the government for going back on its word in terms of accelerated price disclosure. The shocks were too sharp and too severe for community pharmacies in this country. Price transparency is of course unambiguously good thing, but the way it was implemented caused a lot of harm to the community pharmacy sector. We know that there have been a number of layoffs from the 60,000 employees. I have spoken to a number of pharmacists who are really, genuinely doing it tough. The goodwill of their businesses has been destroyed at the stroke of a government pen. All I ask is that there be some equity in this. If there are going to be savings and cutbacks in the health system it needs to be done in a way that is proportionate and fair and does not adversely impact on consumers and patients. That is my concern in relation to this. I unambiguously think that we need to have that debate.


I welcome Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment about the location rules. I think it is healthy to debate and discuss these issues. I have had one experience with location rules. Peter Angelos operates Midnight Pharmacy on Frome Street in the city near the corner of Wakefield Street. I am not sure if I am allowed to give a plug to a business as this is being broadcast through the national broadcaster, but I will say that he, like many other community pharmacists, provides a valuable service. This service is a good service because it is there for consumers who, after being in hospital or having taken their kids to the Women's and Children's Hospital, invariably get referred, late at night, to the Midnight Pharmacy on Frome Street.


I think we need to be very careful about changing the location rules, because, with 425 country towns only having one pharmacy operating, the consequences of losing a pharmacy in such a community could be devastating. It could also be very concerning in a particular suburb, where people have to travel even further to see a local pharmacist to get the quality advice in terms of that frontline of medical services that pharmacies give.


I think that the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, whilst by no means ideal, does give some breathing space for community pharmacies. I think there needs to be transparency. Let us see how they are doing. I think they are very happy to open their books in terms of how pharmacies are doing, as other members of the medical profession should be. But if you look at the savings in the health sector, it seems that community pharmacies have borne a disproportionate burden in relation to that.


I want to raise one issue with the minister, which has been raised by the Generic Medicines Industry Association in a circular letter to senators. They have asked us to consider and remember that the proposed legislation makes a technical amendment to the National Health Act that will enable substitution to occur if appropriate. It does not mandate that that substitution will happen, and therefore the questions that I put to the minister—and I hope she is in a position to answer them—are, and I am quoting directly from the GMiA letter of June 21:


Do you trust the TGA to assess medicines for quality, safety and efficacy?


And the letter states:


Just like all medicines in Australia, biosimilars have to be approved by the TGA and meet stringent quality, safety and efficacy standards. Therefore Australians can be assured that biosimilars used in Australia have passed the test for safety. There are no special leave passes on safety for biosimilars.


The next question is:


Do you trust the PBAC for all products that are currently available and publically funded?


The commentary in the GMiA letter is:


The PBAC is an independent committee of experts who make decisions on a $10 billion annual budget. Over five years, this is a bigger budget than the Community Pharmacy Agreement. If you trust this committee to make decisions to list new medicines on the PBS, why wouldn't you trust them to follow the same principles of evidence-based decision making for biosimilars?


The GMiA says that if the answer to these questions is yes they urge us to support the passage of the legislation. So I just wanted to get some clarification in relation to that. In terms of biosimilars, I think it is reasonable to ask what the safeguards are—that you are actually getting precise substitutions so it is the same medication and it will have the same effect on the patient. I think these are important issues that need to be considered. Having said that, I look forward to the passage of this particular bill, and the debate in the committee stage.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-06-23,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:29):  I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill, the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. I can assure the Senate that this government understands the importance of the bill not only to senators and to the people in the states and territories they represent who use PBS medicines but also to the pharmacies, manufacturers and distributors who supply them.


Australians rely on the PBS for affordable access to medicines wherever they may live, whether occasionally or often or for acute illness or chronic disease. It is becoming clear that it is no longer a case of whether you are rich or poor when it comes to many new medicines. The new treatments people are seeking are so complex and expensive that they are out of the reach of almost everyone without subsidy under the PBS.


The amendments in this bill support eight elements of the broader access and sustainability package of measures that will help the PBS to meet the challenge of listing of new medicines. The package is the result of extensive consultations and negotiations which, for the first time, included stakeholders from across the PBS supply chain. It reflects the input and ideas of all sectors and contains savings from all sectors. Those negotiations have resulted in the government making the sixth community pharmacy agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and signing a five-year strategic agreement with the Generic Medicines Industry Association. The agreements recognise that everyone must contribute in order to share the benefits.


In relation to biosimilar medicines—and I note the issues raised by Senator Xenophon—when it comes to deciding whether and on what basis medicines should be listed on the PBS, the government relies on the expertise and independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC has been very forthcoming and transparent regarding its proposed approach to biosimilars. It released information from its April 2015 meeting and a statement on the safety of biosimilar medicines last week. The PBAC has indicated that it will consider a biosimilar for listing only if it has been approved by the TGA as having comparable safety and effectiveness to the original biological medicine. The PBAC will take its information into account, along with other relevant information, when assessing whether a biosimilar should be listed to allow substitution by a pharmacist.


We should note that the changes in the bill relating to substitution are technical only and are designed to provide clarity for all stakeholders. In fact, the proposed changes relate to any medicines, not just biosimilars. The changes align with the department's current practice and will ensure a transparent and legally robust framework in which decisions regarding the substitutability of PBS medicines can be made. With or without these amendments, the PBAC will continue to advise on the PBS medicines that can be designated as schedule equivalent—that is, substitutable by a pharmacist.


This has been a difficult topic to navigate during the debate both inside and out of the chamber. There has been a lot of information and perhaps some misinformation circulating on the merits or otherwise of the use of biosimilar medicines. As my department has advised the Senate previously, the PBAC always intended to hold a stakeholder forum to discuss and consult on implementation. Invitations to the forum were sent last week to stakeholders, including consumers, clinicians, the pharmaceutical sector, state hospital advisory bodies and the TGA. The forum will be held on 7 July 2015. The PBAC is keen to hear views regarding the application of its recent recommendation about biosimilar medicines and receive feedback on how it will work in practice.


Senators can be assured that the government is confident that reliance on the expert advice of the PBAC is an appropriate way forward. The PBAC will recommend listing or substitution of biosimilar medicines on a case-by-case basis only after their own assessment and where the data is supportive of this. Importantly for consumers, the PBAC will continue to carefully consider the balance of issues, including timely access to new biosimilars, lower costs and the appropriate safeguards for prescribing and patient use. In concert with the work of the PBAC, the Therapeutic Goods Administration is also undertaking consultation on its guidance with respect to biosimilars.


This government, the department and the PBAC recognise the importance of this issue to stakeholders and the importance of this issue globally. To complement the PBAC's stakeholder engagement, the government has committed up to $20 million that will enable an education campaign for consumers and specialist clinicians on the efficacy and safe use of biosimilar medicines. I hope that this assists in providing information to senators, in particular in response to Senator Xenophon's queries.


In relation to other measures, we have heard arguments both for and against pharmacy location rules—how they impact on competition and how they are important for maintaining access to medicines across our cities, country towns and rural centres. This government supports their continuation over the life of the next agreement. This government also supports transparency and evidence based decision making. The review of pharmacy remuneration and regulation, including location rules and wholesaler arrangements, will provide the information needed to ensure that the components of the PBS supply chain are remunerated and regulated appropriately and can operate effectively.


There are also a range of views regarding the merits of community pharmacy expanding its role in health care. An important aspect of introducing new programs is that they will be piloted and evaluated to make sure that these expanded health services are cost-effective and clinically appropriate in the pharmacy setting. In the meantime, the sixth community pharmacy agreement will provide revised remuneration arrangements that will enable pharmacies to innovate and transition from a focus on medicine supply to a focus on medicine management and pharmacy services.


I appreciate the points made in support of our pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. Providing access to new medicines and breakthrough treatments will continue to be a major driver for the PBS. We certainly cannot do it without the innovation and quality provided by our innovation and generic medicine sectors or the efficiency provided by the PBS distribution network.


The PBS is designed to pay a fair price for effective medicines, but that is only part of the equation. As you have heard before, the PBS comes at a price. We have an ageing population and increasing rates of chronic disease. New medicines are increasingly complex and expensive. The savings from price reductions in F1 and F2 will continue to support subsidies for new and innovative products. This government has improved listing times for medicines on the PBS and will continue to do so.


The changes in this bill are the result of extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, and they are reasonable. The package contains savings contributions from all sectors of the pharmaceutical supply chain, with benefits to consumers through cheaper medicines, enhanced pharmacy services and funding for access to new and innovative medicines. The measures in the package move the focus of PBS funding towards treatments that would otherwise be out of reach for individuals and important advances in therapy and expensive, complex medicines for serious conditions.


I thank senators again for their comments and I thank all the stakeholders who have worked with the government to develop the proposals and agreements, and who will continue to work with us during the implementation phase. This is a balanced package of measures which provides fair outcomes for pharmacy, the medicines industry, patients and the Australian community. These changes deserve to be supported. They will help strengthen the PBS into the future. They are reasonable, they are necessary and they are needed now.

 (New South Wales) (13:38):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7734:

   Repeal the subsection, substitute:


(1) This section applies in relation to a decision of the Secretary under section 90 rejecting an application by a pharmacist for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises, if the application was made on or after 1 July 2006.

31A


Subsection


99K(2)



   Repeal the subsection.




31B


Section


99L



   Repeal the section.


These amendments, of necessity, work as a whole and are intended to achieve the following. They remove the location rules under which the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority makes its recommendations regarding applications for new pharmacies. They remove the requirement for the secretary to comply with recommendations of the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority regarding applications for new pharmacies. They allow the minister to override a rejection by the secretary of an application for a new pharmacy. The intention here is to remove the possibility that the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority, making recommendations on a whim rather than on the basis of location rules, would continue to prevent new pharmacy approvals. 


The net effect of my amendments to this bill would be twofold: first, it would allow people to open a pharmacy wherever they like, including in a supermarket; second, it would turn a mixed bill into a good bill. As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, there are many good things in this bill: price disclosure, reducing the cost of single brand drugs and the closing of the price disclosure loophole with respect to combination medicines—a notorious rort ably identified by Philip Clarke, Melbourne University Professor of Health Economics. These are all good and to be commended. But, as the bill currently stands, it leaves untouched the worst rort of all—the Community Pharmacy Authority's location rules. 


In March this year, Senator Di Natale, in response to a string of damning reports about the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement, made clear his astonishment that 'an agreement worth more than $15 billion could be negotiated with seemingly no transparency, accountability or appropriate process'. I concur with Senator Di Natale's view. There are many things wrong with the community pharmacy agreement. All I can hope to put right is the anti-competitive nonsense of the location rules.


To recap, the rules mean that a new pharmacy cannot be opened within a certain distance of an existing pharmacy, usually either 1.5 kilometres or 10 kilometres, depending on the area. They also ban pharmacies being placed either within, or in a position directly accessible to, a supermarket. They mandate a complex application process to allow would-be pharmacists to go into business. It is this last point to which I want to draw your attention now. In what universe is it legitimate to tell people that they may not go into business? That kind of injustice is worthy of the old Soviet bloc: 'Dear Mr General Secretary of the Communist Party, please may I open a shop?' And not just any shop—a perfectly legal, well-regarded sort of shop—a pharmacy, for crying out loud. 


Repealing the pharmacy location rules will lead to more competition, cheaper medicines, better services. All of that is true and, as I and many others have said repeatedly, it is to be encouraged. However, beyond all that, repealing these rules will allow qualified pharmacists to do one of the most basic things available to free people in a free society—to go into business, to open a shop. If this government is to have any pretensions to being a government for small business then the least it can do is let people go into business. I commend my amendments.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (13:42):  For the record, I should indicate that the Labor Party will not be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments, which would in fact remove all of the longstanding arrangements we have had about pharmacy location rules in this country. I acknowledge Senator Leyonhjelm's motivation is based on the liberal approach to the market. But can I suggest that there is another consideration that we need to take into account. This is not a simple shopfront; this is a service that is provided by a service provider, a very well trained person who has an understanding of how medicines work. 


As I said in my speech on the second reading, most pharmaceuticals are dispensed to elderly people, to chronically ill people. When pharmaceuticals are dispensed to that cohort of patients, we understand—and I have seen it with my own eyes—that pharmacists speak with the patient to ensure that any contraindications, any mismatch of drugs, is well understood by the patient. Pharmacists do take that responsibility seriously. Sure, if you are healthy man like Senator Leyonhjelm and you turn up and get a drug over the counter you probably do not need to have that conversation but we should think of those people who are prescribed a number of pharmaceuticals. Certainly a doctor is having a good look at that, but having that second set of eyes look over that list of medicines is a good thing. I suggest that we should not be making decisions about the location of pharmacies based simply on market economics. We have to include in that consideration another value, and that is the value of medical advice—and that is what pharmacists bring to this equation. For those reasons we cannot support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:45):  It is important that we remember that location rules are used to determine where a pharmacist can provide access to PBS-subsidised medicines. The ownership of a pharmacy is still a matter for state and territory government legislation. I certainly thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his proposed amendments and clearly for the amount of thought and consideration he has given to this matter. 


The Pharmacy Location Rules have been important in the supply of medicines to all Australians, in particular in rural and remote regions. Under the current rules we have had growth in pharmacy numbers from 5,100 to 5,450. As someone who lives in a rural area, I am particularly pleased to note that this includes an increase of 119 in rural locations alone. The location rules represent a balance between access for consumers, competition for the sector and viability for individual businesses. The proposed amendments would not only cease the location rules as of 30 June 2015; they would preclude any government from determining any rules that the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority could take into account when determining whether or not a pharmacist should be approved to dispense PBS medicines. This government has continued to make known its public support for location rules, and it is joined in this regard by Labor. 


However, this government does recognise that the concerns raised in relation to location rules by the National Commission of Audit, the ANAO, the Productivity Commission and other stakeholders need to be addressed. That is why, as part of the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, an independent, public and comprehensive review of remuneration and location rules will be undertaken within the first two years of the agreement. The review will commence in September 2015 and will invite input and submissions from across the sector and across the community. I am sure Senator Leyonhjelm would welcome that. Its findings will be made public by March 2017. The government is committed to evidence-based decision making and transparency, and this approach will ensure this occurs while also ensuring continued access to PBS medicines for all Australians. Again, I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his proposed amendments but indicate that the government will not be supporting them.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7734, moved by Senator Leyonhjelm, be agreed to.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (12:32):  I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. This bill seeks to amend the National Health Act 1953 to implement measures in the PBS Access and Sustainability Package. My colleagues in the other place have talked about the failure of this government to consult Labor over substantial amendments to this legislation. In the time the legislation has moved from that place to this one, the level of consultation has not improved at all. So I am glad that the economics committee did have the opportunity, albeit a very short one, to have a look at the bill in more detail. This is an important piece of legislation because it includes changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and it includes measures that give effect to agreements with the generic medicines industry of Australia and Medicines Australia and, of course, the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, the new five-year agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.


Labor is rightly concerned about potential unintended consequences because of the lack of consultation and the lack of scrutiny. This is becoming typical of this government; it is their way of operating. They make changes to legislation that have the potential to harm some of our most vulnerable Australians, but they shut down conversation until the very last minute and then try and ram it through an hour before midnight. In the case of this bill, Labor was only made aware of the detail the night before it was tabled in a briefing from the department. The government knew that the existing pharmacy agreement was to expire on 30 June but have yet again shown their inability to have good-faith negotiations with those they need to. This incompetent and chaotic government has had 12 months to negotiate a new pharmacy agreement. The Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement clearly sets this out. It says: ''Negotiations for a new community pharmacy agreement will commence 12 months prior to the expiry of the agreement and will conclude by 31 March 2015.' But we know that negotiations did not start until just four months ago and only concluded earlier this month, just one day before the bill was rushed into parliament. And now we have just seven days to give this important legislation, a commitment to spend $18.9 billion, the attention it deserves in the Senate before it is passed. As you would expect from an opposition which is reasonable and responsible, Labor believes it is worth taking the time to have a good look at the detail of this bill in the Senate as we did in the other place.


I now go to the elements of the bill—the PBS package initially. Unlike previous pharmacy agreements this bill seeks to bundle up a series of other measures not directly linked to the remuneration of pharmacists. This is called the PBS Access and Sustainability Package. The government says that this package of measures is designed to deliver 'a more sustainable pharmaceutical benefits scheme with better value for taxpayers, cheaper medicines for consumers and approved access to innovative medicines'. Labor is always concerned when the government talks about sustainability because, as night follows day, it almost always results in massive cuts such as their cuts of almost $800 million to the flexible funds or new taxes such as the current GP tax, which is in fact worse than the original proposal for a GP tax. We know that the government is cutting $800 million from the flexible funds that support vital programs such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation services, mental health services and peak organisations like Mental Health Australia and the Consumer Health Forum. It is also cutting more than $2 billion in Medicare rebates over the forward estimates, something we know from health professionals will see bulk-billing rates decline and many more vulnerable patients facing not insignificant out-of-pocket costs.


According to the government, this access and sustainability package contains more than 20 measures and is designed to achieve $3.7 billion in net savings over five years. It includes $6.6 billion in savings 'across the entire pharmaceutical supply chain', partially offset by $2.8 billion of these savings going back into pharmacies as part of the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. Of the remaining $3.7 billion, the government is promising, though not budgeting for at this stage, that some of this money will be invested in new drug listings. In other words, cuts to the prices paid to drug companies are being used to both prop up the budget and fund the additional money going into the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. The industry newsletter Pharma in Focus declared that 'research pharma companies are by far the hardest hit in contributing to the $6.6 billion in total savings'.


The key components of this package are new PBS pricing policies to reduce the price paid by the Commonwealth for innovative medicines—that is, F1 or formulary 1 medicines—and generic F2 medicines; a supposed increase in pharmacy competition by allowing pharmacies to discount the co-payment; the removal of some over-the-counter medicines from the PBS, which I note may see some patients paying more in out-of-pocket costs; a change in the structure of pharmacy remuneration to remove the link to PBS prices, something that also may increase out-of-pocket costs for some patients; and a provision for pharmacy to expand its role into the community. The government expects the majority of savings achieved by these measures to come from PBS pricing changes. 


Firstly, I go to the F1 five per cent reduction issue. Around $1 billion of the cuts from this package come from the inclusion, for the first time, of a statutory price reduction for patented or F1 medicines. The price paid for all patented medicines that have been listed on the PBS for at least five years will be cut by five per cent on 1 April 2016. This is expected to affect 400 medicines. Newer medicines that reach their five-year anniversary on the PBS following that date will take a five per cent price cut on the following April. 


The government argues that delaying the price reduction for five years after listing is intended to give manufacturers time to recoup their investment cost. Prior to this agreement, Medicines Australia argued that drug companies had been forced to take significant cuts in recent years, most notably as a result of expanded and accelerated price disclosure, and reductions could put at risk Australia's access to innovative new medicines. The industry argues that it is in the F1 phase that it recoups its research investment. It says it would affect the listing price of new drugs, because part of the price struck was directly related to the price of comparable drugs. It also warned that the proposals made it more likely that some medicines would be delisted and could impact on research and development worth over $1 billion.


However, the 2013 report by the Grattan Institute found the opposite—that Australia is paying more than many Western countries for pharmaceuticals in general and more than New Zealand for patented as well as generic drugs. I also note that there is some uncertainty about the status of the agreement with Medicines Australia, largely due to the incompetence of this government and its obvious inability to work with industry collaboratively or negotiate in good faith.


Secondly, I go to the question of F2 price disclosure. Generic and off-patent medicines, also referred to as F2 drugs, are, as a result of Labor's reforms, subject to accelerated price disclosure, which requires the suppliers of these medicines to advise the Department of Health of the prices at which they are selling their brands. The government then uses this information to move the price paid by the government closer to the price at which the drugs are supplied in the market. 


Under these changes, expected to save $2 billion, from 1 October next year the market price of medicines listed on F2 for three years or more will no longer take into account the originator brand of the drug. This should see lower prices for both government and consumers, as originator or premium brand names tend to maintain higher prices than generic competitors, which draws the average price up. As well as an expected 50 per cent reduction in the price of generic medicines, prices should also fall for general patients, though not for concessional patients, who make up around 80 per cent of PBS prescriptions, as all PBS prescriptions are priced above the concessional co-payment of $6.10.


The third issue is price disclosure. Another change, expected to save $610 million over five years, is the closing of a loophole relating to combination drugs that allows them to avoid price cuts from price disclosure in certain circumstances. The bill has provisions to close this loophole so that price disclosure reductions for component drugs of combination drugs on F2 will flow on to the combination drugs, starting on 1 April 2016.


Perhaps the most significant and the least understood change in the package is what is referred to as a technical amendment relating to 'PBS listing for bioequivalent and biosimilar medicines', which is expected to save the Commonwealth another $880 million. This continues to be an area of significant contention. It involves the insertion of a new subsection into the act allowing bioequivalent or biosimilar medicines to be taken as having the same drug effect as a listed brand.


Another technical amendment allows the minister to determine that a brand is equivalent to another brand for the purposes of substitution by a pharmacist and requires the minister to have regard to any advice on equivalence given by the PBAC. Exactly how this will operate is still unclear, with even the industry at this stage unsure as to the full details of the move. However, on the surface it does appear to be designed to promote across-the-board substitution. This appears to contradict the TGA's biosimilar guideline. While this is currently under review, the existing July 2013 guideline specifically says that a biosimilar's product information should include a statement ruling out substitution. Labor will always support moves to make the PBS sustainable and medicines cheaper for patients, but this issue has not been explained well by the government. In fact, the government has handled this issue very, very poorly indeed.


All of the measures that I have detailed to this point are, in effect, the lead-in to the real reason for the legislation: the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. This legislation encapsulates how the government has, in the words of one commentator, basically raided the drug companies to pay for the additional funding promised as part of the sixth agreement. However, it is deeply disappointing and of great concern to Labor that, while the government boasts of how it has ripped $6.6 billion out of health as a result of these cuts across the pharmaceutical chain, just $2.8 billion is going back into the health system by way of increased payments to pharmacists. The government has made vague promises about some of that money being made available for new drugs, but there is no mention of that in the legislation.


I now move to the pharmacy location rules. A key component of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill is the extension of the pharmacy location rules for another five years. These rules generally restrict a new pharmacy from opening within a certain distance of an existing pharmacy—usually 1.5 kilometres in metro areas or 10 kilometres in more remote locations. These rules prevent pharmacies from being placed either within or in a position directly accessible from a supermarket. I do understand the arguments about competition and prices, but Labor believe that community pharmacy plays an important role in our society that goes beyond dollars and cents and, therefore, the location rules deserve our support. As such, Labor do support amending the existing legislation, which sets a 30 June 2015 expiry date for the location rules, to 30 June 2020, but we do so in the context that these rules will be reviewed independently over the course of the next two years. This, of course, is the main reason this bill is now being forced on the parliament with such haste. Were this bill not to pass this month, the location rules notionally would expire on 30 June and, in theory, anyone could apply for the right to open a new pharmacy in any location.


Easily the most contentious part of this legislation is the proposal to allow pharmacists to be allowed to discount the PBS co-payment by up to one dollar for every dispensed medicine from 1 January next year. From the moment this proposal first became public, it prompted a furious backlash from pharmacists, who have argued that it will harm chronically ill patients as it will take them longer to reach the PBS safety net and they will thus be paying for medications for a longer period. This is because the safety net is not, as many have assumed, set at a certain number of prescriptions but set at a dollar amount. In the case of a concession card holder, for example, that is $366. Therefore, with cheaper drugs it means it will take longer to reach the safety net. It is this delay which explains how the government expects to save more than $360 million over five years through this measure.


A couple of points can be made here. First of all, the discount is entirely voluntary. Unlike the cuts applied to drug companies, chemists can choose whether or not to offer this discount to their customers. As the safety net is unchanged, ultimately no-one can be worse off. No patients can pay a cent more for their prescriptions under this proposal, and many, indeed, may pay a bit less. The average concession card holder fills 40 scripts a year, and 80 per cent do not reach the safety net. If their prescriptions were all filled by a chemist offering the discount, that is a saving of $40 a year, which, for many pensioners, is quite a significant amount. I note that the Pharmacy Guild has indicated that it supports the package, 'with the exception of the discounted co-payment, which is a matter for government'. But the fact is that this co-payment is embedded in the package and cannot be dealt with in isolation.


One thing that concerns me about these changes is that people living in rural and regional areas may end up paying more because pharmacists are less likely to discount co-payments where the costs of doing business are higher and competition is lower. No-one will doubt that the costs of living for everyone are higher in rural, remote and regional Australia, but the government are happy to drive costs up even further because, despite the rhetoric, they, frankly, just do not care. I also am concerned about the impacts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote areas.


Finally, I wish to go to the question of pharmacy payments. The previous five-year agreement was costed at $15.4 billion; this one, we are told, will cost $18.9 billion over the next five years. That is an increase of $3.5 billion, or 22 per cent, at a time when every other part of the health sector is being cut to the bone and forced to accept a freeze in indexation. This is an increase, but it is an increase in real terms, running at close to double what would have been the case had the amount been linked to inflation; and this does not include an estimated $4.8 billion paid direct to chemists for scripts at below the PBS charge. In total, the government therefore estimates the potential revenue for this sector from the PBS to be $23.7 billion over the next five years. As the Australian Medical Association has pointed out, at the same time as pharmacists are receiving a significant increase in funding and a dispensing fee that for the first time will be indexed to inflation, GPs are being asked to accept no indexation and no increase to their funding for four years, while other sectors such as specialists and radiographers could see their income frozen for five years or more.


This is a proposal that just does not make sense. The government recognises that chemists cannot be viable without a significant increase in funding, while other parts of the medical profession can get by with no change in income for four or five years. The answer, of course, is that they cannot, and it is patients who will pay the cost, either through even higher gap payments or by being denied bulk-billing. This is, of course, just the GP tax by another name. Instead of an up-front charge of $7, it is now a back-door charge of over $8—according to the Medical Journal of Australia—by freezing doctors' incomes and forcing them to pass on the cost to their patients. 


Labor welcomes the decision to recognise the work done by chemists and reward them with a living wage, but it is the height of hypocrisy for the government to recognise this in one sector of the health profession while denying such recognition for everyone else. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-06-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:52):  I rise to speak today to the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. It is a very problematic piece of legislation for the Senate to deal with. It is problematic because we have a whole range of measures that are packaged as part of this omnibus bill. Many of these measures have huge implications for the health budget and patients. You have to wonder about whether this is a strategic or deliberate tactical decision to force the Senate to pass this package of legislation as a whole rather than allow us to unpack it and deal with each piece of legislation on its merit.


The Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement is one of the most important measures in this agreement. It is a major component of the legislation. It is worth almost $20 billion and, I suspect, that is part of the reason we are here today, on the eve of the Senate breaking for the winter period, in a rush to pass all this legislation. We did not get the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement signed off in time. The result is that we are in a panic to pass the bill by 30 June. The reason for that is, if the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement does not get passed the location rules that exist in the fifth agreement lapse and, as a result, we end up with a huge disruption to community pharmacy. The Senate should be concerned that we have had very little time for scrutiny of the bill or any scrutiny of the community pharmacy agreement. We are being asked to rush through a major piece of legislation because we did not conclude the negotiations around the community pharmacy agreement in a timely way.


Importantly for me, as somebody who has expressed concern over the criticisms levelled at the previous agreement, the Senate has been asked to take the government's word that the failings in the last community pharmacy agreement have been rectified. The audit into the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement was one of the most damning indictments ever handed down by the audit office and it was a shock to me to read of it. The auditor found that there was very limited basis for assessing the extent to which the fifth CPA met its key objectives. It failed at that very basic level. There was no straightforward means for the parliament or other stakeholders to know the expected or actual cost of the key components. It did not document that some of the $2.2 billion—of $13.8 billion that the Commonwealth was supposed to deliver for pharmacy remuneration—was sourced from co-payments, which were not a cost to government. There were a whole range of things.


The initiatives in the fifth agreement promised $1 billion in savings. They only delivered $400 million. There were a lot of questions about how money was transferred. There were $277 million from professional programs put into a grant to the guild. The audit office could not explain why these programs were transferred or why they became grants. There were all sorts of problems. A number of key government negotiating objectives were only partially realised. There were major shortcomings in record keeping by the department. We had a situation where the meetings between the department and the Pharmacy Guild occurred without minutes being taken. When they prepared the initial agreement the department did not develop a risk-management or probity plan and did not consult with a probity adviser. The list goes on.


Those criticisms were made by the National Audit Office and, to my knowledge, they have not been dealt with in an open and transparent way. The last discussion we had in this chamber around the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement was about the findings of the audit office. The next time I stand in the chamber is to sign off on a new agreement, without any clear understanding about whether those shortcomings have been addressed. I have grave concerns about that. I have grave concerns about the way the agreement was negotiated and whether we have a framework now to ensure the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, which is an essential piece of this legislation, meets its key objectives.


We are now being asked to approve the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement with $19 billion—because of this rush to do so before the 1 July deadline. A much more sensible thing would have been for the government to remove the pharmacy location rules from the bill, for us to have passed that measure so that we get some certainty in community pharmacy and then to start unpacking the various pieces of this legislation and have a genuine hearing into the merits of each. Instead, we have been told to pass all of this—effectively, with a gun to our heads.


If we do pass this bill, the effect will be that a $19 million agreement goes through with almost no scrutiny. It is fair to say there was a committee process. It went for two hours while the parliament was sitting, while the division bells were ringing. It is remarkable to think that we could have a bill of such importance and with such a truncated committee process. It denies us in this chamber the opportunity to interrogate the legislation in any meaningful way. My concern is that we will end up passing some good reforms—I think there are some sensible reforms in the bill—but deny the parliament the opportunity to ensure we have it right when it comes to the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement. I do not make any direct criticism of the guild, in this, because I do not know whether what was negotiated was in the interests of patients or not—and we are being denied the opportunity to do that.


If we look at some of the other measures in the bill, there was the $6.6 billion in savings across the entire pharmaceutical supply chain. That will be partially offset because a chunk of that, $2.8 billion, is returned to pharmacies through the Sixth Community Pharmaceutical Agreement and the remainder, $3.7 billion, is going to be invested in new PBS drugs. That is a good thing, provided it happens. That is not part of this legislation. We are very keen to ensure that that is what that $3.7 billion is allocated to do. We understand that the bill amends the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by implementing agreements with the Generic Medicines Industry Association and Medicines Australia—that the government at least wants to do that—and the bill, as a result, sees a new PBS pricing policy that reduces the price paid by the Commonwealth for drugs on the F1 formula by five per cent after five years, and that measure alone is expected to affect about 400 listed drugs.


Another complex part of the legislation is the change to F2 drugs. From October 2016, the market price of medicines listed on the F2 formulary for three years or more will no longer take the originator brand of the drug into account, and that will deliver significant savings: $2 billion. Another $610 million is saved by closing loopholes relating to combination drugs that allow companies to avoid price cuts as a result of price disclosure. They are measures, by and large, that have our support. They are sensible measures. We think they are changes that will ensure that consumers will pay less for their medications and we think that is a good step forward.


On the other side of that equation there are a number of reports that suggest that five million people using the most commonly prescribed medications will see prices rise—in one report by up to 39 per cent. That is of huge concern to us. When we tested that, one of the arguments that was made was that competition will ensure that we do not see price rises when it comes to medicines, but of course, as we discussed through Senate estimates, there is very little competition, particularly in rural and regional areas where there may only be one pharmacy. It is hard to see what incentive there is for pharmacies to pass price savings on to consumers.


The rise in the cost of medications is a consequence of the introduction of the new handling fee to chemists as part of the agreement. The Greens in general will support one of the positive measures that we think is in that agreement, and that is that the pharmacies will now discount the co-payment by $1 for the provision of generic medicines. We think that is important. However, we do know that the health department wanted to implement a $3 discount policy and we know that the guild fought against it. Again, because of the secretive nature of these negotiations, we do not know how the price of $1 was reached. The total lack of transparency through these negotiations means: could we have got a better deal for consumers? And, if we could have, why didn't we do that? What was the reason that we settled on the $1 discount? It is opposed by the Pharmacy Guild and I think that says a lot about the way this negotiation was reached. I have to say that it is disappointing that the guild would oppose a very small $1 discount on concession card holders. We think that is good policy, particularly when you contrast that with the fact that there is a significant increase relative to the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement and we now have an agreement with the guild that is worth around $19 billion.


One of the most contentious parts of the bill is the amendment to the PBS listing for equivalent and biosimilar medicines. It is a change that is expected to save the government about $880 million. It is worth exploring what biosimilars are before we get into the economic argument. With regard to biosimilars, you have a number of new medications—really effective medications for some cancers, some autoimmune conditions and so on—that are made from biological products, living cells. They are very big and complex molecules. They are very different to other existing medications which have small molecules—drugs like aspirin, paracetamol and so on. They are not drugs that are particularly complex—only a few changes in atoms—and they are easily replicated. You can replicate the manufacturing process in a way that ensures that you get exactly the same product every time, regardless of where it is made, providing that the manufacturing facility conforms to a uniform set of standards. But, when it comes to biosimilars, because they are such big and complex molecules and they are very highly sensitive to the environment in which they are manufactured, it is almost impossible to create a molecule that is identical to the molecule that you are trying to copy. So biosimilars are the generic version, if you like, of the original biological medication, but, unlike generics, it is very difficult to guarantee that what you are getting is exactly the same molecular structure, and what flows from that is whether you are going to get exactly the same physiological effects. Every biosimilar medication does have to undergo a range of clinical trials. They need to demonstrate safety and they have to go through the same process that the originator biological product had to go through to show that there are not any clinically meaningful differences.


That brings us onto the issue of substitution. If the chemicals are not identical, should we be able to substitute the original drug with the biosimilar drug? This is where the contention lies. Under this bill, the substitution provision allows pharmacists to substitute a prescribed medication—that is, the original biological medication—with a biosimilar or bioequivalent medication. There is some debate about this in the scientific community. It is true that we do permit substitution for generic medication, but the technical amendment in this bill ensures that it is allowed to happen at a pharmacy level for biosimilar medications. There is a lot of contention about this. One of the things that concern me is that Australia will be one of only a few countries that allows this substitution to happen at a pharmacy level. I do recognise that a number of concerns have been raised about this aspect of the policy. Our understanding is that the TGA's existing guidelines, which I think are currently under review, state that a biosimilar's product information should include a statement ruling out substitution. There are some experts on biosimilars who claim that pharmacy level substitution:


… is not only moving away from best practice but seemingly is about to set itself on a path that will see patients at unnecessary risk.


On the other side of the argument, agencies like the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the PBAC—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee—will not allow biosimilar substitution unless there is evidence that that can occur.


What this suggests, though, is the debate that exists within this area of biological medications and substitution is not settled. That is always a cause of concern for me. I would have appreciated the opportunity to vote on this legislation after having had some time with the various academics and experts in this field to get some assurances that what we were doing is not putting patients at risk. We were denied that opportunity. We were denied it because this bill is packaged as a whole and you have to support the whole thing. Otherwise, we will have an issue with pharmacists getting remunerated and with location rules.


On balance, though, there are, as I said, a number of measures that we support. Cheaper medication for patients at a time when out-of-pocket costs are rising is a positive step forward. We do worry about some of the measures in the bill that will increase the cost of medicines. It is almost certain for a number of common prescription medications. You have to wonder why the government allowed that to occur in its negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild. We think that was a mistake. But, again, it is very difficult to make any firm judgements on that when the only people involved in the negotiations are the guild and the department. There is very little opportunity for any transparency, scrutiny or accountability of that extremely significant and very expensive agreement.


In concluding, we will support this bill, but we do so with the reservations that I have just expressed. We are being asked to pass legislation governing some pretty cutting-edge scientific debates around whether we can substitute one drug for another and what that does in terms of risk to patients. I want to put on record that we hope that some of the concerns expressed by people in this area do not materialise and that we would have liked the opportunity to interrogate those potential risks a little further. We do not think it is good practice for senators who have limited understanding in this area—and I am fortunate that I have more than most—and who want to interrogate this further to be denied the opportunity for a decent committee process where this sort of evidence can be presented and discussed.


Also, we do not think that passing the bill simply because we did not reach an agreement with the Pharmacy Guild in time is good practice. We think that needs to be taken into consideration. We should not be rushing these bills through the parliament. I am concerned about the way the Community Pharmacy Agreement was reached and I am concerned about the issue of substitution when it comes to biosimilars. On balance, though, those other measures are important. We think they are worthwhile and we welcome them. We will support this bill because of the benefit that those measures will deliver for consumers.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-06-23,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:12):  I rise to speak against passage of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. I do so in full awareness that the bill is a proper curate's egg—good in parts—and contains measures designed to increase price competition and deliver PBS savings to the government. In some cases, they may even result in cheaper medicines for consumers. However, the bill also continues the operation of the pharmacy location rules for another five years—a powerful anti-competitive measure. I put on record my opposition to this piece of opportunistic rent-seeking because it benefits the Pharmacy Guild at everyone else's expense.


Both Labor and the coalition support the continuation of the rules which require a pharmacist to obtain federal government approval to open a new pharmacy or to move or expand an existing pharmacy. I hesitate to suggest a direct link, but I note that the guild is a very significant donor to both parties. Generally, a new pharmacy cannot be opened within a certain distance of an existing pharmacy—usually either 1.5 kilometres or 10 kilometres, depending on the area. These rules also ban pharmacies being placed either within or in a position directly accessible from a supermarket.


Several reviews have recommended the rules be abolished. In March, the review of competition policy led by Professor Ian Harper found the rules were anti-competitive and unnecessary, restricting consumer choice and suppliers' capacity to respond to consumer demand. Last year, the National Commission of Audit recommended the pharmacy sector be opened to competition through the deregulation of location and ownership rules. Such reform would produce more efficient service delivery and allow the development of alternative retail models such as pharmacists dispensing medicines at supermarkets.


A decade ago a Productivity Commission review found that pharmacy regulation increased costs for consumers, taxpayers and the wider community. Poor Tony Shepherd: every single good idea he had at the National Commission of Audit has been ignored by the government that commissioned his services. I suspect, however, that repeating the findings of various reviews cuts no ice with many people, because they fail to see the human cost of the pharmacy location rules. To that end, I am going to do what economic reformers and analysts rarely do: I am going to tell a story—or several stories.


In my first story, it is night. A fever takes hold and a mother starts to worry. A bathroom cupboard is raided, but it is full of medicine past its use-by date. A child is bundled into a car. A waiting room is endured. Then a GP provides a prescription. With child in arms, the mother returns to the car then scratches her head: where is a chemist that would be open at this time of night? Should she drive around in the hope of finding a chemist that is open? Driving past the lit-up supermarket, the mother wonders, 'Why is it so hard to find a chemist?'


In my second story, the enthusiasm of a young pharmacist slowly seeps away. She is at home, twiddling on her iPhone, passing the time. She had a short shift today. They are always short shifts. She is just a temp. She used to dream of running her own pharmacy. The dream took hold during her years of business and pharmacy studies. It lingered on after graduation as she did stints in pharmacies far and wide, working for the man. But now the dream of working behind her own counter, building her own reputation in her own neighbourhood and community, is gone. It was a silly dream.


In my third story, over at the Pharmacy Guild headquarters on National Circuit, David Quilty, the guild's executive director, reclines in his office chair. His late-night meeting with the health minister went well. The guild's members, the owners of pharmacies across Australia, will be pleased. The next Community Pharmacy Agreement—a five-year deal between the guild and the government—is much like the last one, and the one before that. The deal will see pharmacy owners continue to enjoy regulations to protect them and subsidies to enrich them. Mr Quilty recalls how he had to explain the regulations to the health minister: 'They ban new pharmacies within 10 kilometres of an existing pharmacy. Of course, this exclusion zone is reduced to 1½ kilometres if the new pharmacy is to be near a GP or supermarket, 500 metres if the new pharmacy is to be in a large medical centre or small shopping centre and 200 metres if the new pharmacy is to be near four GPs and a supermarket. And two pharmacies are allowed in large shopping centres with more than 100 shops; three are allowed if there are more than 200 shops. Naturally, pharmacies that are directly accessible from a supermarket are banned. And the regulations require any new pharmacy to be approved by an authority that includes incumbent pharmacy owners nominated by the guild.'


Mr Quilty chuckles as he recalls the health minister's bemused look. As the Commonwealth car drives off into the night, the health minister shakes her head in the back seat. She ponders the numbers thrown around in the meeting just gone. More than $18 billion from taxpayers to around 5,000 owners of pharmacies over five years: nice work if you can get it, and well above the hundreds of thousands of dollars that the Pharmacy Guild provides in political donations. A wry smile passes over her face as she heads back to the comfort of Parliament House, a place where deals usually involve the government getting something in return for giving something away. She is philosophical. No previous health minister has been able to cut the taxpayer funds flowing to pharmacy owners or remove the anticompetitive regulations that grant them protection—and perhaps no health minister ever will.


This is corporate welfare in its purest form, corporate welfare in response to a sustained campaign of rent seeking. That is, it involves the Pharmacy Guild spending money on political lobbying for government benefits or subsidies, thereby gaining a chunk of wealth that has already been created while imposing regulations on competitors. This, more than anything else, brings free market capitalism into disrepute, not because there is anything wrong with free market capitalism but, rather, because certain industry players are happy to kick everyone else in the teeth while engaging in the economic equivalent of pillage. The rent seeking, opportunism and overregulation in this bill ought to be condemned.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:20):  I support the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. And, just as Senator Leyonhjelm has his position in relation to the Pharmacy Guild, I support community pharmacies, and I do so unashamedly. In relation to the location rule that Senator Leyonhjelm will be putting up an amendment about, of course he is entitled to do so. I think debate is healthy in relation to this. I was involved in a case for a constituent who had a pharmacy. I do not think he will mind me mentioning it. It was the Midnight Pharmacy in Adelaide, on Frome Street.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I have been to that place many times.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Hanson-Young has been to that pharmacy many times, and I think many others have as well. It is the only late-night pharmacy, and if you happen to be there between 10 pm and midnight, when all the other pharmacies in the metropolitan area seem to shut down, and hardly any others are open, you will see the Midnight Pharmacy full of parents with their young kids, or maybe the kids are in the car with the other parent. They are getting some urgent medications. This is the sort of situation Senator Leyonhjelm mentioned.


In my constituent's case, the Midnight Pharmacy was in breach of the location rules and had all sorts of technical difficulties in relation to that. But fortunately ministerial intervention prevailed, because there is a safety valve in the legislation. I am grateful to the former minister, Minister Dutton, for appropriately using ministerial intervention in relation to that, because there was a compelling case for that pharmacy to be open. It provides a community service late at night. It is open from 7am to midnight—the longest hours of any pharmacy in South Australia, as I understand it. So there is a discretion. There must always be a discretion in terms of hard and fast rules, but I think, on balance, the location rules do provide a basis for pharmacies to invest and to make a contribution to the local community by providing a service. I do not support, under any circumstances, Coles and Woolworths having pharmacies in their stores or controlling pharmacies. I think that would lead to a race to the bottom. That is my fear. I would rather it be run by as many small community businesses as possible. There are some chains or franchises, such as Terry White, but my understanding is that the Terry White pharmacies are owned by individual franchise owners. So I do not think this image that Mr White owns 150 pharmacies is accurate at all.


This piece of legislation is important, as the Pharmacy Guild points out. This gives effect to the PBS Access and Sustainability Package, which was formally announced by the Minister for Health on 27 May 2015. The government has made it clear, according to the Pharmacy Guild, that the bill's passage is a prerequisite to commencing the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement on 1 July 2015. I agree with the guild when it says that this agreement is critically important to securing the future of Australia's 5,450 community pharmacies, the jobs of their hardworking staff and the health care of the millions of patients who rely on them for their medicines. Without the investment contained in the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, community pharmacies face an unsustainable future due to the flow-on impact on the remuneration from PBS reforms.


I think it is fair to say that, on any reasonable analysis, the heavy lifting, in terms of cutbacks in health, has been borne disproportionately by the community pharmacy sector. I disclose that I happen to have two cousins who are pharmacists, and they tell me first hand of the pressures they face in their businesses. They are not gilding the lily. They tell me about the pressures that they face as community pharmacists—about the hours they have had to cut back for staff, as a result of accelerated price disclosure. I disagree fundamentally with the government for going back on its word in terms of accelerated price disclosure. The shocks were too sharp and too severe for community pharmacies in this country. Price transparency is of course unambiguously good thing, but the way it was implemented caused a lot of harm to the community pharmacy sector. We know that there have been a number of layoffs from the 60,000 employees. I have spoken to a number of pharmacists who are really, genuinely doing it tough. The goodwill of their businesses has been destroyed at the stroke of a government pen. All I ask is that there be some equity in this. If there are going to be savings and cutbacks in the health system it needs to be done in a way that is proportionate and fair and does not adversely impact on consumers and patients. That is my concern in relation to this. I unambiguously think that we need to have that debate.


I welcome Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment about the location rules. I think it is healthy to debate and discuss these issues. I have had one experience with location rules. Peter Angelos operates Midnight Pharmacy on Frome Street in the city near the corner of Wakefield Street. I am not sure if I am allowed to give a plug to a business as this is being broadcast through the national broadcaster, but I will say that he, like many other community pharmacists, provides a valuable service. This service is a good service because it is there for consumers who, after being in hospital or having taken their kids to the Women's and Children's Hospital, invariably get referred, late at night, to the Midnight Pharmacy on Frome Street.


I think we need to be very careful about changing the location rules, because, with 425 country towns only having one pharmacy operating, the consequences of losing a pharmacy in such a community could be devastating. It could also be very concerning in a particular suburb, where people have to travel even further to see a local pharmacist to get the quality advice in terms of that frontline of medical services that pharmacies give.


I think that the Sixth Community Pharmacy Agreement, whilst by no means ideal, does give some breathing space for community pharmacies. I think there needs to be transparency. Let us see how they are doing. I think they are very happy to open their books in terms of how pharmacies are doing, as other members of the medical profession should be. But if you look at the savings in the health sector, it seems that community pharmacies have borne a disproportionate burden in relation to that.


I want to raise one issue with the minister, which has been raised by the Generic Medicines Industry Association in a circular letter to senators. They have asked us to consider and remember that the proposed legislation makes a technical amendment to the National Health Act that will enable substitution to occur if appropriate. It does not mandate that that substitution will happen, and therefore the questions that I put to the minister—and I hope she is in a position to answer them—are, and I am quoting directly from the GMiA letter of June 21:


Do you trust the TGA to assess medicines for quality, safety and efficacy?


And the letter states:


Just like all medicines in Australia, biosimilars have to be approved by the TGA and meet stringent quality, safety and efficacy standards. Therefore Australians can be assured that biosimilars used in Australia have passed the test for safety. There are no special leave passes on safety for biosimilars.


The next question is:


Do you trust the PBAC for all products that are currently available and publically funded?


The commentary in the GMiA letter is:


The PBAC is an independent committee of experts who make decisions on a $10 billion annual budget. Over five years, this is a bigger budget than the Community Pharmacy Agreement. If you trust this committee to make decisions to list new medicines on the PBS, why wouldn't you trust them to follow the same principles of evidence-based decision making for biosimilars?


The GMiA says that if the answer to these questions is yes they urge us to support the passage of the legislation. So I just wanted to get some clarification in relation to that. In terms of biosimilars, I think it is reasonable to ask what the safeguards are—that you are actually getting precise substitutions so it is the same medication and it will have the same effect on the patient. I think these are important issues that need to be considered. Having said that, I look forward to the passage of this particular bill, and the debate in the committee stage.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-06-23,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (13:29):  I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill, the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015. I can assure the Senate that this government understands the importance of the bill not only to senators and to the people in the states and territories they represent who use PBS medicines but also to the pharmacies, manufacturers and distributors who supply them.


Australians rely on the PBS for affordable access to medicines wherever they may live, whether occasionally or often or for acute illness or chronic disease. It is becoming clear that it is no longer a case of whether you are rich or poor when it comes to many new medicines. The new treatments people are seeking are so complex and expensive that they are out of the reach of almost everyone without subsidy under the PBS.


The amendments in this bill support eight elements of the broader access and sustainability package of measures that will help the PBS to meet the challenge of listing of new medicines. The package is the result of extensive consultations and negotiations which, for the first time, included stakeholders from across the PBS supply chain. It reflects the input and ideas of all sectors and contains savings from all sectors. Those negotiations have resulted in the government making the sixth community pharmacy agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and signing a five-year strategic agreement with the Generic Medicines Industry Association. The agreements recognise that everyone must contribute in order to share the benefits.


In relation to biosimilar medicines—and I note the issues raised by Senator Xenophon—when it comes to deciding whether and on what basis medicines should be listed on the PBS, the government relies on the expertise and independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC has been very forthcoming and transparent regarding its proposed approach to biosimilars. It released information from its April 2015 meeting and a statement on the safety of biosimilar medicines last week. The PBAC has indicated that it will consider a biosimilar for listing only if it has been approved by the TGA as having comparable safety and effectiveness to the original biological medicine. The PBAC will take its information into account, along with other relevant information, when assessing whether a biosimilar should be listed to allow substitution by a pharmacist.


We should note that the changes in the bill relating to substitution are technical only and are designed to provide clarity for all stakeholders. In fact, the proposed changes relate to any medicines, not just biosimilars. The changes align with the department's current practice and will ensure a transparent and legally robust framework in which decisions regarding the substitutability of PBS medicines can be made. With or without these amendments, the PBAC will continue to advise on the PBS medicines that can be designated as schedule equivalent—that is, substitutable by a pharmacist.


This has been a difficult topic to navigate during the debate both inside and out of the chamber. There has been a lot of information and perhaps some misinformation circulating on the merits or otherwise of the use of biosimilar medicines. As my department has advised the Senate previously, the PBAC always intended to hold a stakeholder forum to discuss and consult on implementation. Invitations to the forum were sent last week to stakeholders, including consumers, clinicians, the pharmaceutical sector, state hospital advisory bodies and the TGA. The forum will be held on 7 July 2015. The PBAC is keen to hear views regarding the application of its recent recommendation about biosimilar medicines and receive feedback on how it will work in practice.


Senators can be assured that the government is confident that reliance on the expert advice of the PBAC is an appropriate way forward. The PBAC will recommend listing or substitution of biosimilar medicines on a case-by-case basis only after their own assessment and where the data is supportive of this. Importantly for consumers, the PBAC will continue to carefully consider the balance of issues, including timely access to new biosimilars, lower costs and the appropriate safeguards for prescribing and patient use. In concert with the work of the PBAC, the Therapeutic Goods Administration is also undertaking consultation on its guidance with respect to biosimilars.


This government, the department and the PBAC recognise the importance of this issue to stakeholders and the importance of this issue globally. To complement the PBAC's stakeholder engagement, the government has committed up to $20 million that will enable an education campaign for consumers and specialist clinicians on the efficacy and safe use of biosimilar medicines. I hope that this assists in providing information to senators, in particular in response to Senator Xenophon's queries.


In relation to other measures, we have heard arguments both for and against pharmacy location rules—how they impact on competition and how they are important for maintaining access to medicines across our cities, country towns and rural centres. This government supports their continuation over the life of the next agreement. This government also supports transparency and evidence based decision making. The review of pharmacy remuneration and regulation, including location rules and wholesaler arrangements, will provide the information needed to ensure that the components of the PBS supply chain are remunerated and regulated appropriately and can operate effectively.


There are also a range of views regarding the merits of community pharmacy expanding its role in health care. An important aspect of introducing new programs is that they will be piloted and evaluated to make sure that these expanded health services are cost-effective and clinically appropriate in the pharmacy setting. In the meantime, the sixth community pharmacy agreement will provide revised remuneration arrangements that will enable pharmacies to innovate and transition from a focus on medicine supply to a focus on medicine management and pharmacy services.


I appreciate the points made in support of our pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. Providing access to new medicines and breakthrough treatments will continue to be a major driver for the PBS. We certainly cannot do it without the innovation and quality provided by our innovation and generic medicine sectors or the efficiency provided by the PBS distribution network.


The PBS is designed to pay a fair price for effective medicines, but that is only part of the equation. As you have heard before, the PBS comes at a price. We have an ageing population and increasing rates of chronic disease. New medicines are increasingly complex and expensive. The savings from price reductions in F1 and F2 will continue to support subsidies for new and innovative products. This government has improved listing times for medicines on the PBS and will continue to do so.


The changes in this bill are the result of extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, and they are reasonable. The package contains savings contributions from all sectors of the pharmaceutical supply chain, with benefits to consumers through cheaper medicines, enhanced pharmacy services and funding for access to new and innovative medicines. The measures in the package move the focus of PBS funding towards treatments that would otherwise be out of reach for individuals and important advances in therapy and expensive, complex medicines for serious conditions.


I thank senators again for their comments and I thank all the stakeholders who have worked with the government to develop the proposals and agreements, and who will continue to work with us during the implementation phase. This is a balanced package of measures which provides fair outcomes for pharmacy, the medicines industry, patients and the Australian community. These changes deserve to be supported. They will help strengthen the PBS into the future. They are reasonable, they are necessary and they are needed now.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


This question time has been an example of the chaos that lies below the very, very thin veneer that this government represents. Everything you look at with this government is about chaos, deception and deceit. The questions answered today have to be looked at in the context of the two budgets that this so-called government has delivered. The first budget was an absolute disaster. The first budget was about attacking families, attacking education, attacking health and attacking those who have the least capacity to look after themselves—the weakest people in this community. That is what underpins the modus operandi of this government.


They have gone from the first budget to the second budget. The first budget was an absolute disaster; the second budget is simply out there as a political lifeboat to try to keep the government afloat long enough to get to an election. Nobody should have any doubts about what this second budget was about. They have gone from Milton Friedman—a right-wing, hard-nosed economic position—to Keynesianism in the second budget, and it is simply a political lifeboat to try to make themselves look like they care about families in this community. We know they do not care about the families in this community. You only have to look at all the things they have done since they have come to government. What have we seen recently? We have seen this green paper, where they continue attacks on the health systems in this country. They continue attacks on education. They continue their attacks on child care. No-one can trust the government; they are an untrustworthy mob if ever we have seen one—an absolutely untrustworthy mob. They are the mob who said, through their now Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to the pension, no cuts to SBS and no cuts to the ABC. Yet what have we seen? Everyone of those promises has been thrown overboard. The lies, the deceit and the mistrust just permeate the government.


Then we have the Minister for Human Services. What we see here is another attack on workers' wages and conditions. The Minister for Human Services, Minister Payne, has not stood up for the workers in the Public Service once. What has been happening to them? They have been told that they can get this modest pay increase that would mean they would lose money; they would lose pay. They are told, 'You have to accept this. We're going to strip your agreement bare. Your job security provisions in the agreement will disappear. Your working hours will increase. Your rostering will change to suit the boss. Your rights of representation by your union will disappear. Performance management and call monitoring will increase. Your personal leave will be cut. Your pay, superannuation, salary advancement and broadbanding will be moved out of the agreement. Your allowances will be diminished. There will be more part-time workers.'


We know what this government is about. This government is about Work Choices, and we see another example of Work Choices in the attacks on the Department of Human Services. This is a mob that is out of control. This is a mob that is controlled by extremists—the extremists out of the Prime Minister's office and on the back bench of the Senate. They are the ones who control this government. They are out of control. The sooner they go, the better. (Time expired)

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2015-06-23,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (15:06):  I rise to take note of answers by ministers to all of the questions of the opposition today. May I say, I am disappointed that Labor live in the past. They continue to think of this year's budget as a replay of last year's budget, so all they can do is reheat and replay the rhetoric of last year. This is a budget which has had a wonderful reception because it has done things to promote greater investment in child care. It has done things to promote greater investment in small business through the instant asset tax write-off and the tax cut to small business.


I am disappointed that Labor cannot come onboard. In fact, there is a real dissonance here between Labor's rhetoric and Labor's actions. Today, Labor have agreed with the coalition to pass the indexation of fuel excise, which is an important reform, which will stop the real price of fuel going down and which will be a compensation measure as well as a revenue-protection measure. 


Labor should stand up and admit what their actions actually betray. We have had budget issues in this country. You have a government that is moving to address those budget issues. We thank Labor for the fact that today they have agreed to support the reintroduction of indexation of fuel excise. We just want them to come on board and embrace the bipartisanship of fixing Australia's problems. Simply admit it. They are not prepared—ever—to talk about spending cuts. They are always talking about where they will raise more tax. We want lower, simpler and fairer tax where possible. Labor should get on board and admit what their actions today indicate. They know in their hearts there are budget issues that have to be addressed.


There was discussion today about the forthcoming white paper on reform of the federation. We face real issues with our federation. There are many services provided by the states but the states do not have the revenue to meet those service needs—whereas we as a federal government have access to income taxes. We raise the goods and services tax, which we pass onto the states. We have much more resilient tax bases than the states. There is where we need to have a debate. That is what the white paper on federation reform is all about. The fact that we have raised options about what may happen with health and education is an indication—not that any particular option will get up, but we need to have the discussion about how we best rearrange roles and responsibilities so that those who raise the revenue have responsibility for delivering the service and vice versa. As you know, if the revenue comes from somewhere else you may not have the same responsibility for rolling out the service as efficiently and effectively as possible.


It was the coalition that introduced the goods and services tax and the proceeds from that go to the states to fund essential community services. This is what the debate is all about. This is the debate about resilient tax bases to help, among other things, fund an appropriately sized public sector. Senator Cameron, sadly, is wrong when he talks about government policy being captured by ideologues and others. It is captured by pragmatic consideration of what we need to do to make the federation sustainable and, at the state level, for governments to be able to do their jobs. 


There are some state governments on the other side of politics—in this case, South Australia, led by Jay Weatherill—who had something to say about the forthcoming white paper on federation reform. It is only a discussion paper. Mr Weatherill said: 'We've been asking them to canvas the broader range of options.' He added: 'There's a broad debate going on about Commonwealth-state relations, which is a good thing.' I was in South Australia over the weekend with some of my colleagues. It is clear that South Australia faces particular issues and concerns. They know they have to front up to more radical reform than may have been necessary in the past, and they are prepared to do things that are radical in order to bring about an improved economic performance. 


It is important for us as the federal government to be open to doing what we can to bring about that better performance. Ultimately, Labor—to be electable again—will need to have a genuine reform agenda and not simply say 'no' to everything that the coalition puts up.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  This feels like deja vu—day after day; same old same old—these guys, cutting everything to blazes and pretending they are not doing it: another question time, more unanswered questions and more obfuscation. Today Senator Brandis, the minister in this place, played politics instead of answering the questions put to him. He even refuted the validity of a medical journal. Senator Payne did not quite achieve the outcome she wanted and tried to dance around the issue of rights and conditions of public servants while holding up the next enterprise agreements for human services staff. Despite harking back to the Commission of Audit and alluding to the importance of budget control, Senator Brandis has a very short memory. The fact that the Treasurer has doubled the deficit—adding $68 billion in just 18 months—seems to elude those on the other side. It is a fact from which they run every single day.


There is not a week that goes by, in this place, that we do not hear about some service or other that this government wants to tear apart to fund an ever-increasing black hole. It is hard to fathom how they could be growing the deficit at the same time as cutting health and education to the tune of $60 billion. This is what comes naturally to the government of this day: to cut. The government's green paper that we have been hearing about, that Senator Brandis ran away from as fast as he could as soon as he was asked questions, is less of a discussion paper about the role of federation and more like a Liberal Party manifesto of the things they want to cut. 


Cutting the federal government out of education and charging families for public schools was the debate yesterday. Today, we hear more cuts from hospitals are on the horizon; there will be $18 billion per year cut from hospitals. We have just heard the senator for South Wales speak about the fact that John Howard did bring in the GST and the money comes to the Commonwealth, but here we have the Prime Minister saying, 'I don't want to have to pay for that stuff. Good on you states; you're on your own.' Reports today reveal that this government wants to cut nearly $1 billion from early-childhood education. They are considering walking away altogether from funding preschool and kindergarten. This would be an absolutely devastating blow to children's development and a huge hit to family budgets.


Children in preschool and kindergarten are just the latest targets of Tony Abbott's assault on the good things that sustain this nation. Instead of being the mature government they promised to be—answering questions put to them—they hid, again, today behind their hypocritical attacks on Labor, blaming everyone and anyone but themselves and refusing to answer questions, running from them in the most arrogant way.


Today, however, we did see one revelation—a revelation that Labor has known all along but from which the Liberal government continues to hide. Despite the government extending Labor's program of federal funding for preschool and kindergarten, we know that was just to get them past the last election. That was until they could begin to get to a point where they feel they could wipe their hands of that responsibility altogether. The Liberal Party is so despicable in government that they are seeking to hide behind the smokescreen of this green paper so that they can abandon $840 million in funding that guarantees four-year-olds 15 hours of preschool each week, with a $129.4 million cut from the industry in New South Wales. Tony Abbott has already said, 'We have a Federation reform white paper and that will look at the question of who is going to take primary responsibility for preschool going forward,' and this government has indicated at every turn that they are not up for the job of responsibility. Blame they are good at; increasing the deficit, doubling the deficit and running from answers they are good at; but they are not good at telling the truth and they are certainly not good at looking after the essential things that every Australian needs: access to education, access to decent health and access to preschool so that you can grow up in a great nation with a vision for the future. Instead, we see this despicable act played out day after day by a government that has a miserly and myopic view of the future of this nation. It is fear driven. They use fear-laden rhetoric every day, taking away the hope and the business confidence of a generation.


Ninety per cent of the brain development of young people happens in their first five years, but it does not matter to this government that looks like it is set to rip away funding from a vital sector: the education sector of this country.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-06-23,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  I have to put some things on the record. Senator Cameron was talking about truth, integrity et cetera. Just recently we had a state election in New South Wales. There was a big board that said: 'Vote Nationals, get coal-seam gas. Authorised by Senator Doug Cameron.' It is amazing in that northern coastal area of New South Wales with the controversy over coal-seam gas. It was the previous Labor government of New South Wales that approved all the exploration licences. Every one of them was approved by the Labor Party. Mr Ian Macdonald—not the good Senator Ian Macdonald—is of course well known for his ICAC investigation, along with his colleague Mr Eddie Obeid. Perhaps Senator Dastiari might be able to fill us in a bit on them. But we were talking about integrity and honesty, and there were placards, posters, saying: 'Vote Nationals, get coal-seam gas', all approved by the Labor Party of New South Wales; none by the coalition. We talk about honesty and integrity.


Let's talk about growth. Those opposite in the Labor Party are saying that growth was 3.5 per cent for the March quarter of 2014. That is true: 3.5 per cent; it was a good year. Let's go back to March of the year before and go through the quarters of growth. For the June quarter of 2013, it was 0.6 per cent. Labor was in government. Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you will note that in the September quarter it was just 0.6 per cent. Who was in government? Labor. Then came the December quarter—and in September there was a change of government—and growth went to 0.8 per cent. Who was in government then when growth rose? Then we get to the March quarter of 2014—1.1 per cent. The figure of 3.5 per cent was a good figure. It was just 1.2 per cent when Labor was in government and almost 2 per cent in the six months of the Abbott-Truss government. So, if Senator Bullock wants to ask questions about growth, employment et cetera, he should look through the details and give us the facts, not just the blurry summary of what he thinks. It is amazing.


There was some good news today. Mr Shorten, the opposition leader, is going to back our changes to the indexation of the fuel excise. The money will go into roads. That is good news for people like us who have dirt roads in front of our front gate. I wonder if any of those on the opposite side, when they go out the front gate of their house, have a dirt road to drive on. Probably not. Incredibly—Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you might be interested to hear this—they are going to put this money back into the Roads to Recovery program, a great coalition program where money is directed to councils to do local roads. But when the land transport bill came to the House of Representatives, the Roads to Recovery program bill, Labor voted against it. They did not want the Roads to Recovery program. They said, 'We'll vote this down.' Of course, if the Senate had not changed over, if the Greens and Labor had stuck together, we would have lost the Roads to Recovery program. The member for Richmond, Justine Elliot, was so grateful when the Roads to Recovery program went through here, but she voted against it in the other place.


Labor is now saying, 'Yes, we'll back the indexation of fuel.' So they should. We need our roads fixed. Let's look at the history of fuel excise with the Labor Party. When Mr Bob Hawke won government in 1983, there was just 6.4c a litre excise on a litre of fuel. Thirteen years later, when the Hawke government was thrown out and it was the Keating government at the time, it had climbed to a massive 34c cents a litre. From 6.4c a litre to 34c a litre—that is how your fuel tax is under Labor. It then grew from 34c to 38c—



Senator Urquhart interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Hear me out. You will be interested to hear this.




Senator Conroy:
  What answer are you talking about?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  We are talking about taxation.




Senator Urquhart:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do not recall that we had a question on fuel excise. Could you draw the senator's attention to the motion, which is about all questions, but it did not include a question on fuel excise.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Urquhart. Senator Williams, I just remind you of the question before the chair.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Of course, Mr Deputy President. Thank you for the reminder. We will go to fuel indexation because the hypocrisy is amazing. Senator Cameron was talking about honesty and integrity. Big cuts in health—that is simply wrong. You had a dream spend on health for the next 10 years when you were in government, knowing full well you were going to lose government—a dream figure that was never budgeted for. In total, the spend in the 2015-16 budget for investment in health and sport increased to $69.7 billion. This is an increase of $2.3 billion, or 3.4 per cent, from the 2014-15 estimate. This also compares with the original forecasted amount in 2015-16 of $68.5 billion. Why do you say there are cuts in health and education? That is simply wrong. It is misleading; it is not the truth. The figures go up all the time.




Senator O'Neill:
  It's what Treasury said at estimates.

 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:22):  Well, here we are. Senator Williams talks about being honest. What a joke!




Senator Williams:
  What have I ever been dishonest about?




Senator URQUHART:
  Can I just remind you that, before the election, the Prime Minister of Australia went to the people with a proposition. That proposition was, if I recall, no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Remember all that? And now we have those opposite talking to us about honesty. I cannot believe it. The Australian people listened to what the Abbott government said at the time prior to the election.




Senator Williams:
  They weren't in government then.




Senator URQUHART:
  But they are now. The Abbott government are there now. Mr Abbott went to the election as the opposition leader, Senator Williams, on the basis that he told the Australian people there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts the ABC or SBS. But how they have quickly turned their backs on those promises and turned around completely to betray the Australian people that voted them in on the fact that those promises would be honoured. The Australian people voted this government in on the basis that they accepted that those promises given prior to the election would be kept. But, no; we have seen the cuts to health, we have seen the cuts to pension, we have seen the cuts to education and all the attempts to undermine all those promises. In fact, in getting the keys to the ministerial wing it did not take those opposite long before they changed their agenda completely and backed away from all of those promises. They completely backflipped. They had broken promises and bad policy in the area of health. That is what this appalling, sneaky and mean Abbott government have done.


Firstly, what did they do with hospitals? They ripped $50 billion out of hospitals in last year's budget. Then they attempted—not once, not twice—three times to levy a GP tax on Australian people.




Senator Conroy:
  How many?




Senator URQUHART:
  Three times, Senator Conroy. Three times they attempted to bring in a tax on the sickest people in our community. For that first point of health care, where people go and need assistance, they go to their GP. But, no; what did this mob over there want to do? They wanted to tax them. They wanted them to pay to seek medical advice at that very pivotal point when people get health care. So none of that worked. The $7 GP tax on all patients did not work. Then we had the $5 GP tax on non-concessional patients and then a $20 cut in rebates for short visits. Each time, what was the reason we were told? It was because they needed to make Medicare sustainable. But that was despite the fact that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report shows that Australian health expenditure was actually growing. It was growing at its lowest level since records began 30 years ago. But, no; this mob wanted to cut it.


They have stood up here today and said they have a green paper, it is a draft and it is going to have lots of things in it. How can we trust them? How can we trust this government when they say, 'We are not going to do this,' when everything they said before the election they have backflipped on? They have backflipped on no cuts to health; they have backflipped—absolutely backflipped—on no cuts to education; they have backflipped on no cuts to the ABC; and they have backflipped on no cuts to SBS. Yet they stand here and say, 'This is a draft green paper; believe us when we say we are not going to cut hospitals.' Let us get it very clear: we do not believe what you say. Nor do the Australian people believe what you say. The people out there who believed what you told them before the last election are not going to believe what you are telling them now. And nor should they because you have not been trustworthy with them. You have not earned the trust of the Australian people. You have broken so many of those promises that they will not believe you now and they will not believe you in the future. That is a sensible thing for them to do because you cannot be trusted. Your word is broken every time. (Time expired)

The Greens are strongly committed to improving the welfare of animals across Australia, and share every compassionate Australian's abhorrence and despair at the continuing horrors and deep suffering borne by animals used for food, clothing, entertainment and profit.


Again and again, we keep seeing animals suffering sickening cruelty under the Government's ineffective Export Supply Chain Assurance Scheme.


Terrified cattle cowering and slowly dying under the blows of sledgehammers; throats sawn agape; eyes gouged; tendons slashed; living beings stabbed, kicked, trussed and thrown; crying in pain and terror, buried or butchered alive.


Thousands of animals in a festival of slaughter. Thousands of animals debilitated in their own excrement on oven-baking ships. Thousands of animals dying horrific suffering deaths.


Time and again, our live export companies cover up, lie and mislead, and excuse the horrific brutality suffered by Australian animals.


Time and again, successive Australian governments and Ministers charged with growing the export market have turned a blind eye to systemic abuse, with the industry claiming humane care and state of the art facilities, even as Animals Australia and other investigators record the torture and terror being meted out to our animals in those slaughterhouses and in those markets.


Under the present system not a single company or person has been penalised. Not one banned.


Across Australia systemic abuse of animals continues: terrified animals used as live bait for racing greyhounds; hens suffers in tiny dark and filthy cages; pigs spend their lives in metal crates they can barely lay down in; ducks living in their own excrement without the water they need to function; cows milked beyond normal capacity with their tiny calves removed and killed as surplus to requirements; kangaroos mis-shot in the dead of night with their joeys killed by being swung by the tail – often ineffectively - against the back of a ute, or left to be torn apart by foxes or suffering a frightening death over many days.


And the response to such systematic cruelty across Australia?


In last year's budget, this Liberal-National Government withdrew the minimal $5 million funding and dissolved the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy which sought to provide a national framework to prioritise and coordinate actions to improve animal welfare across animal use sectors.


It disbanded the Australian Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, an advisory group that provided consensus advice to government on animal welfare, and which comprised representatives from the livestock industries, vets, animal welfare advocates and researchers.


It discontinued the Live Animal Exports – Improved Animal Welfare Programme, which supported training in improved animal welfare in the countries importing Australian live animals.


At the same time the Government invested an extra $100 million to expand agricultural markets and profitability, and reopened notoriously cruel live export markets in the Middle East.


The Greens' Bill, Voice for Animals (Independent Office of Animal Welfare) Bill 2015, establishes the Office of Animal Welfare as an independent statutory authority, with responsibility, through its CEO, for advising upon the protection of animal welfare in Commonwealth regulated activities.


This Bill removes the Agriculture Minister, the industry and their excuses, from the current equation that has them effectively condoning the animal abuse that is continuing right now under this government, and which continued under the purview of the previous Labor governments.


The Office of Animal Welfare will assist its CEO in his or her functions, which include the review, inquiry, monitoring and reporting of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock and the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. The CEO is also responsible for undertaking inquiries and preparing reports about the activities and effectiveness of the Live Export Advisory Group.


The CEO will monitor, investigate and report on animal welfare issues that impact the Commonwealth, on the work of animal welfare committees and review animal welfare laws and policies. The CEO will also implement of the Commonwealth's animal welfare laws, with the power to do all things necessary to be done to perform his or her functions.


The Bill also establishes an Office of Animal Welfare Advisory Committee to assist the CEO and his or her Office of Animal Welfare in performing its duties to the best possible standards.


The Committee's members will consist of the CEO and representatives of non-governmental animal welfare organisations, consumer groups, scientists and ethicists specialising in animal welfare issues, the Department and commercial producers or purchasers of animals or animal products, and two other members as considered appropriate by the CEO.


The CEO will provide reports to the Minister with recommendations which must be tabled in Parliament. The Minister will be required to respond to any recommendations made in the reports, and to table the response in Parliament.


These reports may review the work of key animal welfare committees, propose reforms to animal welfare legislation and standards and advise the Commonwealth on harmonisation of animal welfare laws of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.


The Bill directs the CEO to make the Office a Centre of Excellence for the collection and dissemination of information about animal welfare issues that impact the Commonwealth.


The CEO, supported by the Office, will also undertake inquiries, commission research and prepare reports about animal welfare issues.  This will include protecting and promoting animal welfare in the export of live animals and the effectiveness of Commonwealth laws that apply to the export of live animals.


The examination of the sustainability and animal welfare issues that arise in respect of killing kangaroos for commercial purposes also falls under the CEO's remit.


The CEO may also inquire and report on the Commonwealth's animal welfare policy, and scientific and legal issues and potential animal welfare issues that arise in respect of that policy; and the importation of animals and animal products and management of animal species introduced into Australia will also fall under its remit.


The CEO will develop and reintroduce an Australian Animal Welfare Strategy that will provide a national framework to identify priorities, coordinate stakeholder actions and improve consistency in animal welfare across all animal use sectors.  He or she will consider animal welfare issues that arise in respect of the Model Codes of Practice for the welfare of animals and contribute work towards the harmonisation of animal welfare laws of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.


The CEO may also inquire into and report on the activities of the Department that relate to monitoring compliance with the Commonwealth's animal welfare laws.  The effectiveness of these laws and their enforcement, and the effectiveness of the Department's implementation of the Commonwealth's animal welfare policy may also be examined and reported on.


The Office of Animal Welfare, directed by its CEO,  would have the ability to truly independently examine and report on the continuing frameworks that perpetuate and excuse infliction of terrible suffering on other living beings – the animals we eat, we wear, we use for entertainment and profit.  It would effectively give voice to those animals, where the Coalition and Labor have refused that voice.


Currently before the Senate sits Coalition Senator Back's repulsive Private Members' Ag-gag Bill that would prosecute without need for proof, animal welfare investigators who take visual recordings of systemic animal cruelty on Australia's factory farms, in greyhound training grounds, in live export slaughterhouses, shearing sheds and laboratories, and other animal use industries. While Labor does not support passage of the Bill, it has not condemned that Bill and the attempts to silence revelations of systemic cruelty in animal use industries.


The Greens have before the Senate a bill that would end the cruel live export trade. We continue to work to gain the Coalition and Labor's support of the bill.


The Greens also have before the Senate a bill that would end the import or use of animal-tested cosmetics and their animal-tested ingredients.  We continue to work to gain the Coalition and Labor's support for the bill.


This Bill provides a new opportunity for the Coalition and especially Labor, to show Australians that they too believe the terrible suffering of animals in animal use industries is not acceptable and that things can and must change.


In 2012 the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Caucus endorsed the Caucus Live Animal Export Working Group to develop a model for an Office of Animal Welfare, which reported back to the then Labor Agriculture Minister in 2013.


In a time-honoured buck-passing statement the then Labor Minister of Agriculture responded to the Greens' questioning about the Office that ""there is work to be done in this area but the primary responsibility for animal welfare issues does remain with the state and territories"".


This bill allows a constitutionally valid federal response to animal cruelty issues around Australia.


It reinstates the Coalition Government's dissolved Animal Welfare Strategy and its advisory group.


It would begin the long but so easily do-able road to protecting the wellbeing and welfare of the animals that we use.


This is what Australians want.  It is what they expect.


There is nothing to stop Labor supporting this bill, and verifying its political will and the strength of truth of its asserted – but as yet unproven – commitment to the welfare of the animals that are captive to our care and good will.


I commend the Greens' Voice for Animals (Independent Office of Animal Welfare) Bill 2015 to the Senate.


Debate adjourned.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:47):  Yesterday we found out that, along with this proposed radical new plan for our public schools that will see them become ghettos if it sees the light of day, the Abbott government wants to scrap Commonwealth funding for public hospitals. This is what leaked documents tell us. What I can say today with absolute certainty in this place is that when it comes to health, and in particular public health, Liberal governments, whether they are state governments or whether they are Commonwealth governments, simply cannot be trusted with our health. They have an appalling record. We all remember when Mr Abbott stood up before the election and said there would be no cuts to health. What an absolute mistruth and broken promise that has been because we have seen agency after agency scrapped; we have seen good programs lose their funding, and it would seem there is no end in sight based on this latest leaked proposal to scrap Commonwealth funding to our public hospitals.


I do not know where the Abbott government think the states would get funding from to fund public hospitals—he must think that these funds are just going to fall from the sky—but let us have a look at what they have done to health in the very short time they have been the government of Australia. There is the GP tax and the rumours around that: we had version 1 and then version 2 and we now have version 3 by stealth. We have already seen in this country the Abbott government impose a tax on people when they go to the doctor. We have seen the closing of Medicare Locals. What a huge success story they were, but, no, they were put there by a Labor government so that is enough for the Abbott government to say they have to go. We have seen the largest increase to private health insurance premiums in a decade, and just with the stroke of a pen they were able to go out. We have seen that the price of our pharmaceuticals will go up. We have seen cuts to preventative health research; we have seen cuts to chronic disease prevention; we have seen cuts to rural outreach. And, on top of this, what we saw yesterday in that leaked document is that it is the Abbott government's intention to go even further and to scrap Commonwealth funding to public hospitals. I am sure you will hear them get up in here today and deny that. That is the pattern of the Abbott government: first you leak the proposal, then you deny it like crazy and then maybe you tweak it a little bit and then in it comes. That is their record on health.


Let us take a look at Western Australia. Fancy asking a state government that has had its credit rating reduced to pick up any funding for public health. What kind of a game is that? The people who will be worse off are Western Australians because the Western Australian government has shown itself to be absolutely incapable of running a public health system, in the same way that the Abbott government has shown itself to be incapable of running and funding proper health services in this country—good, preventative health services. The Western Australian government is well and truly up there in terms of simply not being anywhere near competent in running public health. The projected midyear deficit in Western Australia is $1.3 billion, but does the Abbott government care? No. It is going to try to foist the cost of running public hospitals in my home state onto a government that has no money at all because of its absolute mismanagement. And that deficit in Western Australia is projected to blow out to $2.7 billion.


And it is a government cannot run a hospital. We have seen debacle after debacle with the Fiona Stanley Hospital—a flagship hospital developed and paid for by the previous Labor government. First of all, what the Barnett Liberal government did was privatise that hospital to a company that runs prisons and detention centres. So we have our flagship hospital in Western Australia on a 20-year contract with Serco—a 20-year contract! Serco have never run a public hospital in this country before, but that does not stop the Liberals; no, they give it away.


We have seen debacle after debacle: 18 months over its due opening date; almost half a million dollars a day in debt in the cost overruns in that hospital; an IT system that was so inadequate the state had to take it back—goodness knows what that cost; and, more recently, in the last four to six weeks, the sterilisation issue—an absolutely integral part of a public hospital, keeping patients well and giving them good surgical outcomes. It has been debacle after debacle: instruments going up to theatre all bloodied; instruments going up to theatre with bits of bone on them. It was so bad, despite the Liberal state health minister saying, 'Nothing wrong here,' but finally they conceded. Serco have lost that contract. They have lost two contracts in the very short space of time they had that hospital—first the IT system and now the sterilisation.


This Abbott government want to hand the funding of public hospitals over to the Western Australia government—what a joke. Neither the federal Liberal government nor the state Liberal government can run hospitals. It does not stop there in Western Australia. In 2008, it was proposed that the Royal Perth Hospital would close and it would close because Labor had a flagship hospital, Fiona Stanley, which the Liberals have since dragged through the mud. But, no, the Barnett Liberal government made a great promise to the people of Western Australia that they would turn Royal Perth Hospital into a 400-bed emergency type hospital. Guess what? That is not happening anymore. It was completely scrapped last year—a broken promise there. And there were great plans to upgrade our rural hospitals. Guess what? They have been scrapped as well. 


So in Western Australia we have seen public hospital after public hospital absolutely lose funding. The latest Barnett debacle was to give the public hospital in the eastern suburbs, a poor area, to the Catholics, to the St John of God Health Care system. Guess what happened to reproductive technology? It is gone. 'Oops' said Mr Barnett, 'We didn't realise that St John of God wouldn't do any reproductive health.' They will not do terminations; they will not do sterilisations—no, no, no. So Mr Barnett says, 'It's all right, we'll build a stand-alone facility in the grounds of this privatised hospital.' St Johns said to them: 'Oh, no, you won't. We're not having those services next to our hospital.' What a bungle by the Liberal state government, and this is exactly what this government is trying to do. It does not matter how much they stand up in here and say they have not cut the federal health budget; they absolutely have. 


What a low blow yesterday: the leaked document which says they are trying to get out of Commonwealth funding of public hospitals. The health status of Western Australians is already in a parlous state because of the constant bungling and the cost overruns by the Barnett government. Goodness knows what will happen to Western Australians if this latest move comes into being. That is the record of the Abbott government—deny, deny, deny. Remember the GP tax? 'We're not going to do that.' Deny, deny, deny and suddenly there it is: a GP tax. That is exactly what will happen here. I am telling you, Australians will not stand for it. Our public hospitals and our public health systems used to be world leaders. Under this Abbott government, they are slowly and surely being dragged down to levels that are completely unacceptable in a country as wealthy as ours.


On preventative health, we have heard front-line service after front-line service lose money under this government. On drug and alcohol services, we hear so much about their ice program, but there needs to be a preventative focus. The Abbott government do not seem to understand that, as they rip front-line funding away from services like that. We have seen them deny this and they will continue to deny it, but the truth gets out. This is a disgraceful move, particularly from a government that said in the lead-up to the election, 'There'll be no cuts to health.' That is completely untrue. We have seen nothing but attack after attack after attack on good preventative services. This latest move to scrap funding to our public hospitals is disgraceful.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-06-23,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (15:57):  Well, Mr President, there you have it. There we have it yet again—the Labor Party, again, never letting facts get in the way of what they think is a good story, because their entire premise of the MPI is incorrect. If those in the Labor Party were opposite, they would be truthful with the Australian people. What they are referring to is something contained in a media report, which is pretty much where they take most of their information. If they were being honest with the Australian people, they would be saying the facts, that this is a draft green paper. It is an options paper only. It is a discussion paper. It is not government policy. So if the opposition were going to be honest with the Australian people, that is exactly what they would be saying today.


We are a democracy. What we do in this nation is we discuss issues. We raise ideas. On this side of the chamber, this government, the Liberal and the National parties, actually encourage discussion. We actually want debate. We actually want people to put ideas forward and have a national conversation about that. Not from the other side. Indeed from the other side, apparently, according to Senator Doug Cameron, we see zombies. On that side of the chamber, they are not allowed to have an individual thought. On this we encourage debate and discussion. On the other side, they shut it down. Indeed, Senator Cameron said: 'We don't want zombie politicians.' Indeed, in 2010, he described serving in the Labor government as: 'A bit like having a political lobotomy. You can't speak your mind. You can't think about some issue because they are all off the agenda.' I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, on this side, in this government, we encourage debate and discussion. If those opposite were being honest with the Australian people, they would have said exactly what they were referring to and use some facts.


Interestingly, we have even seen the South Australian Labor Premier, Jay Weatherill, referring to this particular issue saying, 'It's only a discussion paper. We've been asking them'—that is, the government—'to canvass the broader range of options. There is a broad debate going on about Commonwealth state relations, which is a good thing.' Perhaps those on the other side should spend a little bit more time listening to some of their Labor Party colleagues in other states.


The scaremongering from the Labor Party knows no bounds. When we look at the facts—and again I come back to the facts—hospital funding is increasing. It is increasing by 25 per cent over the next four years. It is increasing by $3.8 billion. We might need to say it a few more times for others around the chamber who maybe were not listening today to the excellent responses from Senator Brandis: health funding for hospitals is increasing. That is a fact. I know the Labor Party does not like dealing in fact, but it is a fact.


The former Labor government claimed that they would increase hospital funding by over 10 per cent a year—when they were in government, that was their promise. That was going to take the costing from $15 billion to $40 billion within a decade. And where was it going to come from? This is magic money—money that was off in the never-never; money that Labor now talks about this coalition government cutting. It was never there; it was magic pudding money. It was Labor hocus-pocus of promised money that they knew they were never going to have to deliver. Magic money is a standard Labor tactic. They were going to pretend they would fund health and education by billions and billions of dollars of fake magic money, and then scream when the government is said to be cutting their fake, unfunded promises. It is about time the Labor Party started to be truthful with the Australian people.


I feel a bit sorry—or very sorry, actually—for the hard-working people in the health sector who are out there saving people's lives and working hard. I have to pay tribute to all our front line health workers across the country. They do a fantastic job. And they believed the cruel Labor hoax that there was some magic pot of money coming their way down the track. Of course, it was never there, because Labor have absolute form on this. The irony of Labor talking about future funding! They could not manage the economy when they were in government, let alone manage delivery of any future funding. They have absolutely no idea how to manage the economy. On this side, this coalition government realises we have to be economically responsible managers. We have to make sure that, going forward, this country is secure and the economy is strong and robust. But on the other side they have no idea. What did they leave us? A trajectory to debt of $667 billion. For them to come in here and talk about future funding without any reference to the facts of the case is absolutely gobsmacking. I will note that you are nodding in agreeance, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. Thank you. We were left $123 billion worth of deficits by the previous Labor government. What a mess this coalition government has had to fix up! We are going to do that because we realise that the future of the nation is at stake.


Because of the previous Labor government we are paying $1 billion a month in interest. We are paying this because of the failed economic management of the previous Labor government. That is a billion dollars a month that we cannot spend on all those things that people out in our electorates, out in our states, right across the country, are asking us to do. It is because of the mess Labor left us. I know those opposite do not like us referring to that, but it is a fact. Facts are something those on the other side refuse to believe.


When we look at the economic mess we need to look no further than to the failed former finance minister, Senator Penny Wong. As finance minister all she delivered was debt and deficit, with no effective plan to bring the nation's finances under control. This was under Labor, under Senator Wong as finance minister at the time. Senator Wong said in her first speech as finance minister, in 2010, that a return to surplus in 2012-13 was not negotiable, yet her promised surplus never turned up. It never turned up because she failed to rein in the spending, and she presided over the most rapid escalation of debt in Australian history.


For those on the other side to come in here today and talk about future funding—and indeed, as I said at the outset, the MPI is based on a false premise—is absolutely gobsmacking. It is about time that those opposite in the Labor Party started to talk facts to the Australian people; that they started to be truthful with the Australian people when it comes to issues that affect them so enormously. We only have to look at some of the decisions that were taken under the previous Labor government to realise why this government is the economically responsible manager of the nation's finances. We look at things like the pink batts program, where $2 billion was mismanaged. We had FuelWatch and Grocery Watch—nearly $30 million was spent setting them up.




Senator Di Natale:
  Oh really? You are not going there! It is embarrassing! Pink batts?




Senator NASH:
  I am going to take the interjection from the leader of the Greens, who is saying: 'Oh really? You are not going there!' Unfortunately for the leader of the Greens, they have very little in terms of economic foresight, as well. No wonder the leader of the Greens is happy to sit there and go, 'Oh really, are you going to mention that?' It actually matters. It matters to understand why we are in the situation we are in. It matters to have some foresight and to be able to take the country forward. Perhaps Senator Di Natale could stop interjecting and maybe put some ideas and plans for some forward economic foresight, because we have not seen any yet.


It is most interesting that it is this side, this coalition government, that is going to make the economically responsible decisions for the future of this nation. The people out there across Australia compare and contrast. That is why they elected us in 2013—to fix the economic mess that Labor left us. For Labor to come in here and talk about future funding, the irony is gobsmacking. It is this coalition government that is going to lead the nation forward in a sustainable way and an economic way for the strength of the nation.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-06-23,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:07):  During the dying days of the last government, after the soap opera that was the change of leadership and so on, I remember someone saying to me, 'Can things get any worse?' At the time I wondered whether they could. You only need to look at this government's record on health policy to know that the answer to that is an emphatic: yes, they have got much, much worse. The health policy that the government has introduced through the course of the past two years is a litany of missteps, mistakes and utter chaos. Things got particularly bad under the previous minister, who has shown himself to be as inept in Immigration as he was in Health.


We had the co-payment policy, which was floated—it seemed like it was a thought bubble at the time—with no consultation. That got buried very quickly. Then we had version 2 of the co-payment policy, and for a while it looked as though that was flavour of the month where the government was concerned. Then that was ditched. The argument was that we needed to make sure that we sent a price signal, which later became a value signal, which was really code for saying, 'We've got to make it harder for someone to see a doctor because we think that people aren't that crook,' to use the words of the chair of the Commission of Audit. Then we had version 3 of the co-payment policy. That hung around for a while and eventually that was ditched. In the end, the policy went to where so much of this government's political agenda has ended up, and that is in the graveyard of bad ideas.


The one idea that did see the light of day and is having an impact right now—in fact, it is biting pretty hard—is what this government did to the funding of hospitals. It is true that reports that have been floated in the green paper are simply suggestions—if we are to believe the government—about possible reforms by a future government. You do not need to look at the green paper, because the reality of what is happening within our hospital system right now is much more frightening than what has been described in that green paper. We have half the facts out there. It is true that the government has increased funding to the states to ensure that our hospitals can continue to function. But that is only half the truth. The problem in this place is that most of the information that flies around is half fact or is opinion dressed up as fact.


The reality is that demand for hospital services is increasing. It is increasing as a function of a couple of things—improved health technology and growing population—and the funding is not meeting that demand. What that means, and it is very straightforward, is that people are going to have to wait longer in emergency departments, they are going to have to wait longer to have surgery done, it is more stress on staff, mistakes will happen and patients who need urgent care are going to miss out.


If this trajectory continues—and this is not speculation, this is the reality, which is far scarier than we have seen in the green paper—the hospital system will simply collapse. They are not my words. They are the words of the former secretary of the health department, now the head of the health program at the Grattan Institute, Stephen Duckett. In his words it is completely unthinkable that this policy could continue because the result would be a total collapse of the hospital system. There will be a change at some point or our hospitals will indeed fall over.


The simple issue is that federal governments have an important responsibility to fund our hospital sector. They cannot vacate the space as this government has done, and they cannot vacate it for a few reasons. It is all very well to have an ideological position that says, 'State governments should look after hospitals; we'll take care of Medicare and aged care.' What that position ignores and fundamentally misunderstands is how the system works. The entry points into the system are through primary care, a federal government funded responsibility. The exit points are through aged care, which, again, relies on federal government funding. You cannot have a situation where you have these divided responsibilities that create all sorts of perverse incentives to shift costs from one jurisdiction to another. It results in a very inefficient system, and that is at the heart of the problem here. We have divided responsibilities.


It must be said that the previous government, despite having extremely ambitious targets when it came to what it would do to reform our hospitals, at least made some progress. For the first time we had federal governments with some skin in the game who had an incentive not to shift costs to state governments. Likewise, state governments had an incentive not to shift costs across to federal governments. That is one of the big cancers in the system at the moment. By the federal government meeting half the costs of growth funding, what we saw was both parties finally working together to try and solve some of the issues that exist within our public hospital system and within our health system more generally. This helped the system work better.


This government is taking us in the opposite direction to where we should be heading when it comes to ensuring we have a decent system. It is a system, and the different parts of it have to work together. We cannot carve out state responsibility for hospitals in one area, federal responsibility for primary care in another area, aged care in yet another area and expect the system to somehow work properly. It makes for a patient experience that is fragmented, that leads to care being sub-adequate and that is ultimately expensive for the taxpayer. This is an ideological pursuit for no good reason. We need to start taking a much more responsible and mature approach to this situation and recognise that if we do not work in partnership with state governments right around the country we are going to return to the bad old days where a government, in the lead-up to an election, waved the chequebook around, rolled out some pork and said, 'We'll fund a hospital here or a few beds over there,' and the system continued to flounder. That is the problem that we have got right now.


It must be said that it is not just about hospitals, though, where this government has failed on health. There are so many other areas. Let us look at the flexible funds, which are funds that are given to a whole range of programs that do important work out in the community. There has been a $600 million cut in funding for the Flexible Funds program. What does it deliver? It delivers services to people with substance abuse issues. The government is running around talking about the ice epidemic, about how critical it is that we do something to address the scourge of ice, and yet they are cutting $8 million from programs that fund substance abuse. Tell me how those two messages are consistent.


The government says: 'Domestic violence is a national priority. Good on Rosie Batty for being a champion for domestic violence! But do you know what we'll do just quietly? We'll cut funding for domestic violence programs, many of them delivered in the health space. We'll cut funding for mental health. We'll cut funding for dental health.' Despite the fact that we have a huge inequity in our health system, which means many people across the country cannot get access to decent dental care, we have huge cuts in dental health as well. This is extremely short-sighted. One of the most significant causes of presentations to both general practices and emergency departments is untreated dental disease. It has a huge impact on the rest of the body—and we are cutting funding for dental health!


We have seen a funding cut for the Preventive Health Agency—'Forget that prevention stuff! It's namby-pamby stuff! Why would we care about things like obesity, smoking and alcohol? Why would we care about those things? It's really up to individuals. It's all about personal responsibility.' Well, if you are a young child being brought up in a home where alcohol is a big part of the family environment, you are already at risk of running into problems yourself later in life.


The truth is that we can afford to have decent health care in this country. Don't believe the nonsense that our health system is unsustainable. It is one of the best health systems in the world. As a proportion of GDP, we spend less than the average health spend of other OECD countries when it comes to health—and we get really good value for money. We need to start having a conversation in this country about whether our governments are investing in things that our community want, need and deserve. When it comes to health care, the Australian community speaks with one voice: 'Yes, we believe that our taxes should support a decent health system and a decent hospital system and it's the federal government's responsibility to deliver that for us because we're who they are working for.'

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:17):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on this matter of importance, particularly because it is a signature policy area for Labor. We believe in public health and we have committed to it in every form and with great vigour in every government we have ever formed—and we will need to become a government once again to help this country recover from the damage that is being inflicted right now by this shameless and shameful Abbott government which is determined to tear apart access to public health. In this environment of cuts and austerity that is currently being imposed upon the Australian people by a callous coalition regime, if this government cares at all about health and the Australian people it is time for a debate; it is time for them to listen to some of the experts and some of the evidence and some of the advice that is been proffered. But based on the Liberal Party's policies any conversation about public health care needs to start with a very good warning: the Liberals cannot be trusted with public health care—and neither can their coalition partners the Nationals. Yesterday Labor actually welcomed one comment from the health minister, Susan Ley, which was a long overdue admission that the Abbott government has ripped over $60 billion from public hospital funding. At least now we are part of the way to some disclosure of the truth that they run and hide from every day in this chamber. Every single day they run away from the facts.


At the 2013 election the Abbott government committed to maintaining Labor's funding guarantee for public hospitals. They guarantee that they would support it. They said: 'A coalition government will support the transition to the Commonwealth providing 50 per cent growth funding of the efficient price of hospital services.' That is what they said. And on the day before the election they backed it in with a promise of 'no cuts to health'. Well, we know that that promise was worth absolutely nothing—from a government that is determined to rip out the heart of a health system that has served the nation, and continues to serve the nation, very well. Yesterday Minister Ley also confirmed that she is planning an additional $1.3 billion in cuts to the Australian health system to replace the $5 hike in prescription charges which has stalled in the parliament. Like so much of the government's failed policy objectives, we have cuts, cuts and more cuts.


Labor is deeply concerned about the ongoing uncertainty created by this $1.3 billion in health cuts being planned by Minister Ley. That is in addition to cuts around the Flexible Fund. I acknowledge the comments by Senator Di Natale. He is 100 per cent right. The government is running around the country screaming that we have got an ice epidemic and we need to respond. I agree that we need to respond to drug and alcohol problems in our community—but we do not respond to them by cutting funding for rehabilitation services! That is hardly the right response—yet it is the response of this government. There are 16 flexible funds. It is like the government is playing them off against each other—'Let's tell them the money is going to go, and see who screams the loudest. We might give them a little bit just to keep them quiet.' Going around the country I have heard from health professionals who are almost being given hush money—a three-month extension to keep them quiet for a bit longer. Or it may be a six-month extension. Or if they have a really good friend they might get 12 months. The chaos and the cuts to funding are destroying an entire system.


The disclosure from Minister Ley that confirms this government is not content with a $60 billion cut last year and the $2 billion that they added to that, and another $1.3 billion, just reveals that there is no boundary to how much they will take out of the health system. Make no mistake, with these ongoing cuts the Abbott government is absolutely dismantling universal health care access as this country knows. Labor believes, I believe and Australians believe that we should be able to get the health care that we need—not the health care that Tony Abbott decides he can afford to give you. If you are wealthy, well good on you: 'You can top it up and have the health care that you really need.' But if you are not wealthy, if you are disadvantaged or even if you are working and you get a chronic illness: 'Too bad, so sad, you're just going to get cut out, you'll have to miss out, sorry.' That is not the Australia that was envisioned when we put in Medicare. This government has invented a budget crisis as a cover-up to impose an ideological agenda on an unsuspecting public. Australia will certainly be the poorer and the sicker for it. 


Building and supporting a public healthcare network is in Labor's DNA. It is a very central part of being Labor. We stand proudly on our record. From Medibank to Medicare to the NDIS, Labor has delivered and expanded our public healthcare system to provide for all Australians—not just some, not just the wealthy, not just those lucky enough to be born into good health and a wealthy family. For Labor, universal public health care is an inalienable right. 


There are people in this country who do not know what it was like before Medicare came on the scene. But we have heard evidence from leading health economists who have been around for a long time. Bankruptcy was what happened to people who were sick and went to a hospital and did not have any money. Their houses were sold out from under them. People chased them around the country to recover the money to repay the debt. That was the reality that faced Australians in the good old days, a reality to which this government, the good old boys, would take us back. Their networks are flush with cash from the sorts of systems that they set up, but they do not care about ordinary Australians, particularly vulnerable and sick ones. 


We do not believe that public health care is a privilege to be whittled away by a deceptive government. We do not believe that it should be denied to people who are unable to afford it. Regardless of age, gender, wealth, ability or locality, access to a decent, universal public healthcare system is a non-negotiable principle for Labor. It is a principle we fought for long and hard, to establish, expand and deliver. We fought harder still to protect it from the many efforts of those who would have it dismantled and wind it back. 


The hospital funding cuts that are the topic of discussion today are $60 billion cut out of the 2014-15 budget. They will swear black and blue to your face that there are no cuts to health. 'No, they're increasing.' Except that every state government knows that they are trying to manage a budget of reduced funding. Every state government knows how much pressure they are under because this mob, who were supposed to be delivering a fifty-fifty commitment to health in the states, balanced by the money from the federal government that states would get from the GST, said, 'We'll do a partnership; we'll shake hands with you'—until they got to government. Within moments of being here, within a breath of arriving here, they ripped up the national partnership agreements and walked away. And they have tried to back it in with this green paper. They are going to run away from that as well. 'No, it's only a draft,' they say. But in the green paper the possibility—which I would say their actions reveal to be a probability—is that they want to walk away from a joint responsibility with the states for the fundamental access to health care that Australians need. 


They are ready to rip up any agreement. They are ready to walk away from any commitment. There is no deception that they will not prosecute if it is in their own self-interest. They are cutting like crazy, but they are not cutting in the right places. They are cutting from the vulnerable. They are cutting from the sick. They are cutting from those who live in lower socioeconomic areas. They are cutting from the bush and trying to keep quiet about it. Just a couple of weeks ago I was in Broken Hill with the Select Committee on Health. We were out there, and the head of the local health district, which runs the hospital, actually sent out an email to his senior executives and told them that, if they were contacted by the Senate Select Committee on Health, they were not to participate. That is a cover-up by any name. That is a gag. That is an attempt to hide the facts from the Australian people. These guys, if they are good at anything, are good at that. They are good at hiding the facts from the people—sadly, in complicity with some of the media who are not telling the truth.


I know this government does not want people to understand what they are really doing, but the Australian people are smarter than the government give them credit for. They have longer memories than the government give them credit for. They actually believed the government when they said that there would be no cuts to health and no cuts to education, no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to SBS. They believed you, but they will not believe you again because they will not allow their families and friends to have health care ripped out from underneath them by a shameful government.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-06-23,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:27):  The greatest threat to the wonderful healthcare system we have in Australia at the moment is exemplified by the speech that anyone who might have been listening has just heard, from a Labor politician who lives in fantasy land and will say anything and do anything and use every emotive word, no matter how untrue, to try to fool the Australian public to believe the Labor line.


The facts—the actual numbers, the figures—prove the lie to everything that you have just heard from the previous speaker. First of all—and I know that my colleagues have raised this, as has been explained countless times at question time—the proposal in the green paper is one of many proposals for discussion, requested by the state premiers, including three or four who are Labor premiers. You have all heard, and I will not repeat again, how Mr Jay Weatherill, the Labor Premier of South Australia, has congratulated the government on this white paper. It does not necessarily mean that the option that talks about more Commonwealth spending and less state spending will happen. It does not necessarily mean that the option of more state spending and less Commonwealth spending will happen. These are just two alternatives that the state premiers asked to be put in the discussion paper. That is what happened 


So, in spite of explicit evidence not just from Liberal and National Party ministers and leaders but from Labor Party premiers—in spite of all those assurances—the Labor Party continue this massive scare campaign in the hope that it will in some way get Mr Shorten looking better against the constant attacks from his colleagues on the ABC program The Killing Season. We cannot wait for this evening and another gripping episode of how dysfunctional the Labor Party are in opposition, which is how incompetent and dysfunctional they were when in government.


That is why this nation needs two or three terms, at least, of Liberal and National Party governments to get the country back on track. Labor, starting with a $60 billion credit—with $60 billion in the kitty for a rainy day—not only spent that $60 billion but ran up debts that would, if not addressed, approach $700 billion. That is a turnaround of some $760 billion. The previous speaker made a comment about the health system that 'Tony Abbott decides he can afford to give to you'. I remind Labor people, because they did not understand this when they were in government, that governments do not have any money at all. Governments do not own a single cent. All they do is use taxpayers' money. So it is not 'the government's money'; it the taxpayers of Australia's money, and they demand—and the Liberal and National parties will bring—proper and careful management of their taxation moneys.


I know these figures have been given before, but perhaps with enough repetition they might just sink through the minds of Labor Party speakers in this debate. Total budgeted health spending has this year increased from $67 billion to $69.7 billion. That is an increase of 3.4 per cent, more than the inflation rate, since last year. Public hospitals in 2005-06 were being supported to the extent of $8 billion. This year, public hospitals are getting $16 billion. In spite of what the previous speaker said, I am sorry, you cannot argue against the figures—and the figures are all there. PBS spending has gone up from $6 billion in 2005-06 to $10 billion in 2015-16, an increase of some 59 per cent. And the figures just continue. This government is concerned about health but wants to have a sustainable and financially viable health system—because, again, it is not the government's money; it is the taxpayers' money that has to be spent properly.


If you want to understand just how mischievously misinformed the Labor Party speakers are, we heard this comment that, back in the good old days before the Commonwealth took a greater funding share of public health expenditure, people had to sell their houses to go to hospital. Of course, the speakers should remember that in most states, and certainly in my state of Queensland, there was a free state hospital system—run by the Golden Casket, would you believe? It was always there, and so that sort of scaremongering misinformation that you get from Labor speakers clearly and typically exemplifies why Labor should never be trusted with money and should never be trusted with our health system. Our health system will continue to grow and continue to be even better, but it will be done in a financially responsible way. At the same time, we will look after taxpayers' money properly so that they are not paying more than $3 million each and every day in interest on loans borrowed during the Labor period. Good health means good coalition government. (Time expired)

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:34):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the matter of public importance today and about the important role the Commonwealth plays in funding public health services and, indeed, public hospitals across the country. The Commonwealth is the largest funder of health services across the country and provides just over 60 per cent of all government funding going into health, which currently exceeds $100 billion per annum between the state, territory and Commonwealth governments. I think it is absolutely appropriate, with the issues that continue to be leaked into the papers at the ends of sitting days, that we do respond to those issues as they emerge. The concerning one yesterday was about a withdrawal of funding from public schools or means-testing parents; today it is about the Commonwealth walking away from funding public hospitals.


I note other speakers have used the Premier of South Australia in their defence of the indefensible, saying that Mr Weatherill congratulated—I think that was the language that Senator Macdonald used—the government on the issues potentially being raised in the green paper. That is not an entirely correct representation of Premier Weatherill's comments. Indeed, Premier Weatherill, in expanding on his comments today, made the point that, when it comes to health funding, the Commonwealth, states and territories need to remain working together in a cooperative fashion. We are in a sense, to use Premier Weatherill's term, joined at the hip. You cannot have one funding partner in the health system potentially remove themselves from it when they have policy and funding responsibilities in other respects. The Commonwealth has responsibilities in primary health care, in GPs and in the MBS. It also has funding responsibilities in relation to aged care, disability and community care. We need all of the partners who work with the hospitals, which are the entry and exit points for a lot of the people using those services, to be supported financially by both the national and the state governments. We both need skin in the game. For one to remove itself from one element and believe it will not impact on the services is unbelievable. To say that the state and territory governments have 100 per cent funding responsibility for hospitals—what is the incentive to run efficient community care, GPs or disability and aged-care services when there is no incentive to make sure that services at the hospital are running efficiently?


Tony Abbott wants out of schools and hospitals, and it appears he wants out of preschools as well. This is off the back of saying that there would be no cuts to health. All we have seen in the last two budgets, which is all we can measure this current government on, is a walk away from funding commitments relating to health. If I use the ACT as an example, in the 2014-15 budget the ACT lost—and it updated in this year's budget—about $228 million in funding that we expected to get, from the Commonwealth, to run public-hospital services in the ACT.




Senator Seselja:
  No it didn't!




Senator GALLAGHER:
  Senator Seselja interjects, but he does not understand hospital funding. He does not understand that estimates of projected growth are that we are getting less than what was estimated in the Commonwealth budget paper. This goes to the point that those opposite will say there have been no cuts. Reduced growth funding is a cut in health. It is a cut, no matter which way you dress it up. 


If hospitals and expenses are growing at over five per cent and one of your major funding partners is funding at 1.7 per cent, that is a cut. That is a cut of three per cent that will be felt within the hospital system. This is how hospitals have been funded since the Commonwealth, state and territory governments resolved modern funding arrangements. There was an estimated growth cost. Find me one state or territory budget that has been handed down, in the last month, that funds public-hospital growth at 1.7 per cent. You will not find one, because they are growing much faster than that. The people who provide the services have to be realistic about how those services are funded. Perhaps the Commonwealth does not need to worry about that, but the states and territories do. There has been a cut to health and a cut to health funding in the ACT, and the ramifications will be felt for years to come. (Time expired)

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:39):  I am very happy to follow on from Senator Gallagher because she has repeated the falsehoods she made outside this place around health funding. The Department of Health has confirmed that Senator Gallagher was simply making it up.




Senator Wong:
  I know it's hard to cope with, but she beat you!




Senator SESELJA:
 Senator Wong may not want to hear this, but she was making it up. The current health minister in the ACT is also making it up, but he is making it up with a completely different set of figures. So let's start with the record. Today's The Canberra Times reads: 'Canberra the worse for urgent case wait times.' That is what has been happening under years of ACT Labor.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Senator Seselja, you know the use of props is not appropriate.




Senator SESELJA:
  This is not a prop, this is a piece of paper. But I will read from it. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has figures showing that the ACT had the lowest proportion of urgent patients treated on time—just 50 per cent within 30 minutes. It also revealed that only 61 per cent of overall patients who presented in emergency departments, in the ACT, were seen within two hours—the second worst in the country. Those figures are simply false. 


Let's go to them. Let's go to the last Rudd-Gillard budget when it went to ACT Health hospitals funding, and compare it to coalition budgets, because the numbers that Senator Gallagher put out there are false. The Department of Health confirmed they are false. The $240 million she claimed last year was false, so let's go to the difference. The last Rudd-Gillard budget in 2012-13 had $202 million in funding for ACT hospitals. In 2013-14 they promised $233 million. The first coalition budget, in comparison, in 2013-14, was $271 million. That is a significant funding boost on what would have been there, on what was budgeted under the Rudd-Gillard budget. In 2014-15 it was $271 million. In the second coalition budget, delivering in 2015-16, we saw $321 million going onto $343 million in 2016-17.


One of the reasons the Labor Party cannot be taken seriously on health is that spokesperson after spokesperson comes here and makes up figures. We have heard it from senators opposite, right across the board. They are claiming these massive cuts when there are not massive cuts. There are increases in health funding. That is true in the ACT. Simon Corbell, the ACT health minister, came up with a different number. He claimed $600 million in cuts. Senator Gallagher claimed $240 million in cuts. Both of them were wrong. In fact, there was an extra $200 million for ACT health funding under this government than what would have been delivered by the previous government, had it continued. Yet they claim a cut. That is what we see across the board. 


I will go back to some of the national figures. What I think most interesting about this matter of public importance is that the Labor Party—who have had such a bad few weeks—are not arguing against actual coalition policy anymore, they have taken to arguing against phantom coalition policy. They will make up a policy that we do not have and argue against it. That comes through in wording like we had today about 'the Abbott government's plan to rip funding away from hospitals'. That is absolute rubbish.


I will go to some facts. The total 2015-16 budget investment in health and sport increases to $69.7 billion. That is an increase of $2.3 billion or 3.4 per cent from the 2014-15 estimate. This compares with the originally forecast 2015-16 amount of $68.5 billion 


We have a whole-of-government spending: Medicare, over $22 billion; primary and mental health, $2.4 billion; medicines, $10.1 billion. Let's look at this comparison: in 2005-06, the Commonwealth was spending $38 billion on health; in 2015-16, we are spending $69 billion, or an 85 per cent increase. So the economic vandals in the Labor Party who created the problem, who created the massive budget deficits, are now claiming that an 85 per cent increase in that time somehow represents a cut. We see it from those arguing it nationally and here in the ACT we hear it often.


I would say to the journalists who sometimes want to believe what the ACT health minister says, be it the current health minister in Simon Corbell or the former ACT health minister, that they should look at the figures. They should look at what the Department of Health has said on the record in relation to those figures. When I put the claims to them that there was a $240 million cut, they said that they had absolutely no idea where the former health minister had pulled that figure from. We can only assume that the figure was simply made up by Katy Gallagher, as she was then the health minister of the ACT. We can only assume—in fact, we know—that Simon Corbell's claims in relation to $600 million are similarly made up. He just made up a different figure. He just plucked out a different figure to justify the mismanagement of the health system by ACT Labor here in the ACT. We read about it again today in The Canberra Times. Canberrans have been experiencing it for more than a decade as we have consistently languished right at the back of the pack. Regardless of the additional investment from the Commonwealth, regardless of additional spending from the ACT government, we have continued to see some of the worst outcomes in the country.


To conclude, I think it is just a little bit embarrassing that the Labor Party is no longer arguing against our budget. I thought we might hear today about their vehement opposition to petrol excise increases, but of course we are not hearing that. They no longer have a position on that as they once did. They are no longer arguing against our budget; they are no longer arguing against actual policy. What they have resorted to through this MPI is to argue against phantom policies. They will make up a policy and then argue against it. I think that is pathetic. That is why, absolutely, the premise of this matter of public importance should be rejected. (Time expired)

PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS





SENATOR SMITH
'
S TABLING STATEMENT





Tuesday 23 June 2015



I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' Twenty-third Report of the 44th Parliament.


This report provides the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' view on the compatibility with human rights of bills introduced into the Parliament from 11 May to 4 June 2015, legislative instruments received from 10 April to 14 May 2015, and legislation previously deferred by the committee. The report also includes the committee's consideration of responses arising from previous reports.


This report outlines the committee's examination of the compatibility of these bills and instruments with our human rights obligations. The committee seeks to engage in dialogue with relevant ministers, both to help the committee better understand the intent of the legislation and to help relevant ministers and officials to identify and explore questions of human rights compatibility. 


Of the 44 bills considered in this report, 42 are assessed as not raising human rights concerns, and two raise matters requiring further correspondence. The committee has deferred its consideration of three bills and a number of instruments, including those which had previously been deferred. The committee has concluded its examination of seven bills and three legislative instruments. 


This report includes consideration of the response to the committee's initial inquiries in relation to the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. I note that in relation to this legislation, committee members expressed different views on its compatibility with human rights. 


Assessments of the compatibility of legislation by the committee involve the application of its analytical framework to, first, identify if a measure engages a human right (that is, whether in the broadest sense the measure may interact with a right); second, identify if a measure limits any right that is engaged; and third, assess whether any limitation is legally justified (that is, pursues a legitimate objective, is rationally connected to that objective and is proportionate).


Since its inception, the committee's approach is to apply the above analytical framework in undertaking a routine and technical examination of legislation.

PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS





SENATOR SMITH
'
S TABLING STATEMENT





Tuesday 23 June 2015



I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' Twenty-third Report of the 44th Parliament.


This report provides the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' view on the compatibility with human rights of bills introduced into the Parliament from 11 May to 4 June 2015, legislative instruments received from 10 April to 14 May 2015, and legislation previously deferred by the committee. The report also includes the committee's consideration of responses arising from previous reports.


This report outlines the committee's examination of the compatibility of these bills and instruments with our human rights obligations. The committee seeks to engage in dialogue with relevant ministers, both to help the committee better understand the intent of the legislation and to help relevant ministers and officials to identify and explore questions of human rights compatibility. 


Of the 44 bills considered in this report, 42 are assessed as not raising human rights concerns, and two raise matters requiring further correspondence. The committee has deferred its consideration of three bills and a number of instruments, including those which had previously been deferred. The committee has concluded its examination of seven bills and three legislative instruments. 


This report includes consideration of the response to the committee's initial inquiries in relation to the Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014. I note that in relation to this legislation, committee members expressed different views on its compatibility with human rights. 


Assessments of the compatibility of legislation by the committee involve the application of its analytical framework to, first, identify if a measure engages a human right (that is, whether in the broadest sense the measure may interact with a right); second, identify if a measure limits any right that is engaged; and third, assess whether any limitation is legally justified (that is, pursues a legitimate objective, is rationally connected to that objective and is proportionate).


Since its inception, the committee's approach is to apply the above analytical framework in undertaking a routine and technical examination of legislation. However, it is important to recognise that there are areas in which committee members may legitimately come to different conclusions on the compatibility of legislation with Australia's human rights obligations.


The committee's consideration of the response to the aforementioned Fair Work Amendment (Bargaining Processes) Bill 2014 is one such example where legitimate differences of view are expressed by committee members on the question of the proportionality of the measures.


The ultimate purpose of the committee is to inform the debates of the Parliament on the merits of the legislation which we are asked to consider, and in that spirit I encourage my fellow Senators and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation.


With these comments I commend the committee's Twenty-third Report of the 44th Parliament to the Senate.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2015 WINTER SITTINGS





SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEFINED BENEFIT INCOME STREAMS) BILL





Purpose of the Bill



This Bill will introduce a further 2015 Budget measure improving the fairness and sustainability of the pension system.


From 1 January 2016, the Bill will ensure that a fairer proportion of a superannuant's actual defined benefit income is taken into account when applying the social security income test by introducing a 10 per cent cap on the income that can be excluded from the test.  The measure will not apply to military superannuation schemes.




Reasons for Urgency



The measure is intended to be implemented from 1 January 2016. To allow this, significant work needs to be completed on communication products so that customers can be given sufficient notice about future arrangements for their payments.

The speech read as follows—



SOCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEFINED BENEFIT INCOME STREAMS) BILL 2015


This Bill will introduce a further 2015 Budget measure improving the fairness and sustainability of the pension system.


For improved fairness and equity, the Bill will make sure a fairer proportion of a superannuant's actual defined benefit income is taken into account when the social security income test is applied. From 1 January 2016, this measure will introduce a 10 per cent cap on the defined benefit income that can be excluded from the social security income test.


A defined benefit income stream is a pension paid from a public sector or other corporate defined benefit superannuation fund, where the pension paid generally reflects years of service and the final salary of the beneficiary. Current arrangements allow some defined benefit superannuants to have a large proportion of their superannuation income excluded from the pension income test.


People receiving Veterans' Affairs pensions will not be affected by this change, and defined benefit income streams paid by military superannuation schemes will be excluded.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:55):  Prior to question time, I commenced my contribution in this debate on the appropriation bills. I was discussing the context in which any set of appropriation bills is presented to this chamber—that is, the government's management of the budget and the management of the Australian economy. I was running through the figures in terms of the broader economic data which demonstrate the circumstances that the government have presided over since they came to government but most particularly since their confidence-killing budget of last year.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What about this year?




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from Senator O'Sullivan. I am happy to come to this year. Of course, they turned from fiscal conservatives into fiscal profligates, with higher deficits and higher debt than at any time under the Labor government, which they so roundly criticised.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You have to be kidding; how can you say it with a straight face?




Senator WONG:
  Well, it is true. I know those opposite get very grumpy with the truth, but all you have to do is look at these tables at the back of the budget papers—they are called the historical tables—and you can see all of the net debt figures, the historical figures around the underlying cash balance, expenditure, payments, tax, non-tax receipts. They make for very interesting reading and they show how poorly this government is managing our fiscal policy. 


One of the most important tasks of an elected government is to set appropriate fiscal policy, to manage the Commonwealth budget responsibly, to consider the impact of fiscal policy on economic growth, to make the investments and reforms needed for a prosperous and fair society into the future, and to make the decisions needed to ensure long-term budget sustainability—and that is the approach the former government took. We did use fiscal policy to keep Australia growing through the global financial crisis. We invested in infrastructure and we did so while ensuring that finances remained sustainable. We made responsible budget savings worth more than $180 billion over the six budgets after 2008-09. And we left Australia with one of the lowest levels of public debt of any advanced economy.


What has been the approach of those opposite? They have broken every promise they made before the election. They have created uncertainty and anxiety in the community. They have sought to ram through unfair policies like the new GP tax, cuts to pension indexation, cuts to family benefits and cuts to superannuation entitlements. Their approach to the budget has damaged consumer confidence and business confidence. Who can forget Joe Hockey?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Business confidence has never been better.




Senator WONG:
  Well, that is simply untrue. Senator Macdonald says that business confidence has never been better. That is just not true. In fact, business confidence, by the NAB survey, has fallen 75 per cent since the government took office. That is the problem with Senator Macdonald. He does not actually look at the facts; he just sits there spouting the rhetoric—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Let's go to the polls.




Senator WONG:
  Here is another one—Senator O'Sullivan. He does not want to look at the facts; he spouts the rhetoric. They claimed that they would reduce debt and deficit; they have grown the debt. So I again remind them: since their first budget was handed down in May 2014 we have seen a slowing of economic growth. As Senator Bullock rightly pointed out in question time today, the annual growth rate to the year ending March 2014 was three per cent, around trend. In the year to March 2015 it was 2.3 per cent—substantially below trend. There has been a denting of confidence, as I have reminded those opposite. They do not want to hear it.The NAB business survey shows that business confidence has fallen by 75 per cent since the government took office and consumer sentiment has fallen by 13.8 per cent. Wages growth has slumped. In the year to March 2015 wages grew by 2.3 per cent—the lowest annual rate of wage growth in two decades. Senator Cormann today interjected in question time, 'It is all fine because CPI is low'. I said to him, 'Why don't you go to the voters of Hasluck and say to them, ""It's okay that you are getting wages growth at the lowest rate in 20 years, because CPI is really low; inflation is really low.""' See how that works. We know this government does not make wages growth a priority; does not make increasing inequality, increasing the sharing of economic prosperity in this country, a priority. And of course the unemployment rate is up. The unemployment rate has been at six per cent or higher since their first budget in 2014. Under the Labor government the unemployment rate never had a six in front of it—not even at the height of the global financial crisis. 


So slower growth, sluggish wages, rising unemployment—what this means is that Australians' incomes have fallen under this government. The latest national accounts show that the average Australian's disposable income fell by 1.5 per cent in real terms in the year to March 2015. That is worth considering—the average Australian's disposable income fell by 1½ per cent in real terms in the year to March 2015. That is what this government is presiding over. Just this week we have seen a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers which shows a growing economic problem—one that governments of both persuasions need to tackle; the difference is those on that side do not appear to be willing to—and that is the increasing disparity in economic activity around Australia. One-third of regional locations are in recession.


The government's second budget is as socially unfair and economically short-sighted as its first budget. It still includes $80 billion in cuts to local schools and hospitals funding. In question time today Senator Brandis kept talking about CPI and population growth as good bases for indexation. I am sure there are those opposite who understand the mathematics of this enough, which is that if your costs grow at a rate higher than indexation, you erode funding over time. That is what the government is ignoring. Nobody on either side of politics asserts that health costs only grow by the consumer price index. No-one who can be taken seriously would assert that. The government's approach of changing indexation for health and education funding is a cut—it cuts funding over time because we know that the costs of these activities historically have continued to rise at rates higher than CPI. You do not have to take it from me—Liberal Party ministers and governments are complaining about this. As was discussed today, the New South Wales government's own evidence is that we will see longer waiting times for elective surgery and greater pressure on public hospitals as a result of the cuts to hospitals.


What else does the budget still include, apart from the $80 billion cut to schools and hospitals? There are $100,000 university degrees, a new tax on visiting the doctor and $2 billion more in cuts to health care, with children's health care, dementia assistance and Medicare benefits hit the hardest. This second budget hits families again, just as the government's first budget did. An analysis by NATSEM shows that the government's budget policies will inflict more than $6,000 in cuts to the typical family.


Labor has outlined its approach. We will invest in the education of our young people and the skills of our workforce. We want more young Australians to learn the language of the digital age, coding, from the beginning of formal learning in primary and secondary school. I was at a breakfast this morning with the Business Council of Australia where there was discussion about the demand for these skills, certainly in the United States, and why these skills are so important to employment prospects for the next generation of Australians. To cater for this we have to boost the skills of our primary and secondary teachers; we also have to encourage more recent graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to become teachers and we have to introduce new measures to encourage more young people, particularly women, to study the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. These are all matters that Mr Shorten has spoken at length about. Labor has also made clear the priority of investment in science research and innovation and supporting new ideas and start-ups to drive the economy. Our commitment is to ensure that three per cent of Australia's GDP is invested in science research and development by the end of the next decade. This is all about a smart, modern and fair Australia. 


In conclusion, I return to the need for a sustainable budget. We understand the need for a sustainable budget, and we demonstrated that when we were in government, as I said, by making targeted savings totalling over $180 billion over the six budgets from 2008-09. We have supported in excess of $20 billion of proposed savings announced by the government, and we have proposed a range of alternatives—alternatives which are responsible and fair. These include reducing superannuation tax breaks for high-income earners, saving over $14 billion in 10 years. I note today that Mr Tony Shepherd, the Prime Minister's hand-picked head of the Commission of Audit, has said what the Prime Minister cannot say, has said what the government cannot agree with, and that is that superannuation concessions need to be revisited. They do. They are overwhelmingly tilted to high-income earners, and in the interests of long-term sustainability of the budget position, as well as the encouragement of a sensible policy for all retirement incomes, you cannot take them off the table in the way the government has.


Another measure the opposition has announced is multinational tax reform to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax, saving some $7.2 billion over 10 years, and we indicated clearly that we did not support the Prime Minister's Paid Parental Leave scheme or his Direct Action scheme, which cost, respectively, $5.5 million and $2.6 billion a year. These are savings which are socially fair, unlike the Abbott government's cuts which fall hardest on low- and middle-income earners. Alternative savings are also economically and fiscally responsible—contributing to fiscal consolidation while supporting economic growth—and they address reform priorities: the need for a more sustainable retirement income system and also the impact of multinational tax shifting on budget revenues, which is an ongoing challenge for all advanced economies.


In conclusion, I want to turn to the issue of spending. Those opposite like to mouth a lot of rhetoric about Labor's spending, but in opposition they made a range of assertions which were simply not true. I think it was Barnaby Joyce who said that we were heading for Greek-like levels of debt; I recall Senator Abetz in question time suggesting that the country was bankrupt. In fact these are economically irresponsible statements; they are not only untrue and not only partisan, but they are economically irresponsible for senior members of a party of government to make. Senator Cormann also spent a lot of time, both in opposition and in the lead up to the 2014 budget, beating his chest about how fiscally conservative he was. It must be very embarrassing for him now to be the finance minister presiding over the budget. He spends a lot of time telling me how bad I was; I would like to point out some figures to him and hopefully he will reflect upon them.


During my time as finance minister, government spending averaged 24.6 per cent of GDP. Since Senator Cormann was sworn into the position of finance minister, government spending has run at an average of 25.8 per cent of GDP—that is a full percentage point of GDP higher than during my period as finance minister. But it is also higher than it was during the tenures of finance ministers Tanner, Minchin, Fahey, Beazley, Willis, Walsh, Guilfoyle, Robinson and Lynch. So in a government that has notched up so many dubious distinctions, here is another: congratulations to Senator Cormann, you hold the record as Australia's biggest-spending finance minister.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:09):  I rise to speak to the various Appropriation Bills before the Senate. I know the major parties support their passage, but I have grave concerns about these annual Appropriation Bills that I want to put on the record. As we have just heard from Senator Wong, Commonwealth spending is at record levels. Figures for last financial year indicate that real Commonwealth government spending per person is at its highest level on record. Real government spending per person across the federation is also at its highest level on record. There is no hiding the rise of government spending, even when you compare government spending with GDP. Commonwealth government spending is 25.9 per cent of GDP—that, by my calculations, is actually higher than Senator Wong thinks at 25.8. Since 1970, this ratio of Commonwealth government spending to GDP was higher for just four years under Bob Hawke, for two years under Keating and for one year under Rudd. In all other years since 1970, Commonwealth government spending relative to GDP was lower than it is today.


There is no justification for the ever-expanding Commonwealth government spend. As I have said before, living standards for all groups of society have risen inexorably over the past decades. This means the need for government welfare services has declined, and we have not uncovered new forms of effective government intervention, either. To the contrary, the prosperity-promoting effects of free markets and the many failings of government involvement have been demonstrated time and again.


The annual Appropriation Bills authorise Commonwealth government spending. They provide line-by-line authorisation for spending on specific items. They also set limits for some general categories of spending. The Senate is empowered by the Constitution to reject any appropriation bill. This reminds us that Senate scrutiny into appropriation bills does not represent sticking our noses into other people's business. Indeed, the Senate has a responsibility to scrutinise. The Senate is also empowered by the Constitution to amend any provision in the Appropriation Bills that does not relate to the 'ordinary annual services of Government'. That means the Senate can amend any provision relating to loans, capital equipment, assets and depreciation, any provision relating to grants to the states and territories and any provision relating to new policies.


So the Senate has a particular responsibility to scrutinise capital spending, grants to the states and spending on new policies. This leads me to the first of my grave concerns. The government is asserting that the Senate cannot amend provisions relating to new policies. The government is doing this by placing provisions relating to various new policies in those Appropriation Bills that should exclusively house provisions relating to the 'ordinary annual services of Government'. These are the odd-numbered Appropriation Bills, like the no. (1) and no. (5) bills before us today. For example, the no. (1) bill includes provisions for Australia's contributions to the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility and to the World Bank's Global Infrastructure Facility. These are new policies, but because they fall under an existing, broad departmental outcome, the government is asserting that they represent the 'ordinary annual services of Government' and are immune from Senate amendment. I reject this assertion and reserve the right to amend provisions relating to new programs and projects, even if the government places these provisions in odd-numbered appropriation bills.


Another grave concern relates to the even-numbered Appropriation Bills. These are the bills that should contain all the provisions that the Senate is empowered to amend, including grants to the states under section 96 of the Constitution. Section 96 of the Constitution provides:


… the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.


This is a very strong power provided to the parliament, but Appropriation Bill (No. 2) before us today contains a clause, clause 16, that delegates this power to the relevant minister. In particular, it provides the minister with the power to determine the amounts and timings of payments to the state, territory and local governments. It also provides the minister with the power to determine the conditions under which those payments are made. The government asserts that these payments to the states and territories can be made without a written determination from the minister; and the government asserts that, if there is a written determination, the determination may not be made public and it will not be disallowable by the parliament. It is bad enough that the Commonwealth uses section 96 of the Constitution to undermine the Federation; it is unforgivable that this could occur at the whim of a minister, without parliamentary scrutiny. This is a centralisation of power that would put the Soviet Union to shame.


My final grave concern relates to the massive blank cheques provided in the appropriation bills. Take, for example, the issue of national partnership payments. These are payments of tied grants to the states and territories that are authorised under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 so they do not need to be individually specified in annual appropriation bills. However, the annual appropriation bills need to set a limit on the total amount of national partnership payments in a year. The budget papers outline government plans for $10.6 billion of national partnership payments next financial year, but Appropriation Bill (No. 2) sets a limit of $25 billion on national partnership payments next year. This represents a $14.4 billion blank cheque. It will allow the government to make national partnership payments that it has not outlined in any document. 


Such a blank cheque is completely unnecessary. For instance, if the government increased its planned national partnership payments in later months, it would be able to outline these increased payments in updates to the portfolio budget statements and to seek authority for a higher spending limit in follow-up appropriation bills, which are routine. That the government seeks authority for national partnership payments without even outlining them in budget documents is the height of authoritarian swagger.


I have a simple amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to reduce the authority for national partnership payments next year from $25 billion to $11 billion. This is still well above the planned level of national partnership payments. This is the most modest of amendments. It is an amendment to a bill that the Senate is clearly empowered to amend and it is an amendment that defends the limited rights of the parliament. So, if any senator opposes this amendment, I would appreciate an explanation in the committee stage as to why.


I have outlined three grave concerns with the appropriation bills before the Senate, but these are not the paranoid concerns of a solo libertarian. The first two concerns arose from the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, a cross-party committee of which I am not a member. The third concern arose from the Parliamentary Library's briefings on the budget. Most senators do not take the time to personally scrutinise these bills. Surely that means it is our responsibility to listen to those people who do take the time—that is, the senators on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the parliamentary officers who prepare their committee reports and undertake research at the Parliamentary Library.


These five appropriation bills before the Senate have more than $97 billion of specific spending proposals in their schedules and spending limits applying to general spending areas in excess of $30 billion. Even if you do not share my concerns about the magnitude of government spending, there is a case for applying more scrutiny to these bills than to other bills that pass through this place. Unfortunately, there is far less scrutiny of these bills.


I believe it is a dereliction of duty to let government spending drift; but, through a failure to scrutinise these appropriation bills, that is exactly what this parliament is doing.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:19):  As most people in this chamber know, one of my previous occupations was as an early childhood educator. As such, I am familiar with the excitement that a child feels when they learn a new word. Listening to the Treasurer on budget night, I could not help but come to the conclusion that he was just like a small boy who had learnt a new word—that word was 'fairness'—and he was trying to use it at every opportunity. And it was clear to the Australian people that, like a small boy, he did not really understand the meaning of it, because this Treasurer still needs to learn that just saying something is fair does not make it so.


This appropriation bills debate that we are having today, despite the convention not to block supply, is perhaps the most important of the parliamentary year. It is important because it allows us to outline the values that we feel should be used to allocate funding and it allows us to spotlight the values that the government has used in this budget and raise objections to decisions that the government has made—and the values of this government are very, very wrong. They are not aligned with the values of the Australian people. Australia is a nation of intelligent, caring, egalitarian people. We battle for the underdog. We help out a mate. We believe in the fair go. The Australian people know that, despite the budget's mask of fairness, it contains cruel cuts and is built on last year's budget attack on the least well off in our community. There are cruel cuts to health, cruel cuts to education, cruel cuts to pensions and further unnecessary cuts to the ABC, SBS and the arts. The Abbott government is killing the fair go. 


Inequality in Australia is now at a 75-year high. It did not rise during the period 2007-2013. However, we are now in a situation where, compared to a generation ago, the top one per cent share of income has doubled and the top 0.01 per cent share has tripled. Earnings have gone up three times as fast for the top as they have for the bottom, and the wealthiest three Australians now earn more than the poorest one million Australians.


This budget does nothing about reducing inequality, and in fact it increases it. NATSEM modelling found that the poorest 20 per cent of households would lose up to seven per cent of their total annual disposable income by 2018-19, and that is when you take all the budget measures into account. This is a huge hit to 2.5 million of Australia's least well-off families. The modelling also shows that some higher-income families will be better off. The analysis shows that a sole parent with an income of $55,000, with two kids, one in primary school and one in high school, will be more than $20,000 worse off in total by 2018-19. This is absolutely shameful. It is a shameful attack on single parents and it is completely unwarranted.


As members of this place know, a great way to reduce inequality is through education, and Australians value education. Australian parents know that education is the means through which their children will build a better life. Parents understand that a quality education is vital for getting a job. They work hard to ensure their kids have the resources they need to get the best education they can. And, of course, in last year's budget we saw $30 billion cut from schools over 10 years.


I was absolutely shocked by reports over the weekend that part of the green paper on Federation reform would see funding adjusted for student need and the ability of families to make a contribution. In other words, this government is now putting forward an idea to charge parents for sending their children to primary school. This is from a government that had the great idea to provide $75,000, non-means-tested, to millionaire mums. There is no good reason to charge parents to send their children to public schools. Free public education is the right of every citizen in this country. Mr Abbott has walked away from a commitment to universal public education. He said recently:


Whether state or territory governments choose to change the way schools are funded in their states and territories is absolutely a matter for them.


And:


We don't have any role at all.


I would like to say, Mr Abbott: you do have a role, or your government does. You provide the states with the majority of their funding. If the Commonwealth does not provide the states with enough revenue to provide basic services, it is your fault if they have to introduce the education co-payment model outlined in the green paper. It would be Mr Abbott's fault, as the idea was raised in the Abbott government's own green paper.


Universal education was introduced in the 19th century and it is a value held by everyone in the country. It has been clear for some time that this government is out of touch and that its values are decades out of date, but I did not think they would be centuries out of date. There is absolutely no justification to make this fundamental shift in the right of Australian children to access free education.


The government have shown that they are also opposed to the principle of universal health care. Recently, we saw the 40th anniversary of Medicare. Medicare is a fantastic success story. It has been a central part of the Australian health system, except for the brief period in which it was axed under the Fraser Liberal government. But we saw in last year's budget that those opposite are opposed to universal health care. According to those opposite, universal access to health care is not an inalienable right but something that must be paid for. We saw this through their successive of policy positions on the GP tax. Whether the tax is $7, $5, $20 or, now, $80, it is a bad idea. They failed to sell this policy to the Australian people last year and they have failed to sell this policy to the Australian people this year. Why are they again trying to bring it back in through an effective $8 dollar GP tax in the budget through the MBS indexation freeze? This is a cut of more than $2 million from Medicare over the forward estimates that will have a serious impact on bulk-billing rates, out-of-pocket costs and the level of access vulnerable patients have to general practitioners.


We know from an analysis published in The Medical Journal of Australia that the government has put a GP tax of $8 into the budget by stealth. They have cut $2 million out of health again, and some of it in an incredibly petty way—for example, when you look at the cut to support for those with inborn errors of metabolism.


The government just wants to attack the most vulnerable in our community. In particular, they attack young people to shift the blame to them for the government's own failings. The rate of youth unemployment is far too high at 13.4 per cent, and long-term unemployment is at its highest rate in 16 years. The government has shown no interest in fixing this issue and no ability to do so. Consequently, they want to blame young job seekers. Rather than work positively to provide opportunities for young job seekers, they wish to punish them instead by ensuring they get no income support for a month.


Labor will not support a measure which pushes young people into poverty and hardship. How could this possibly help anyone? Why does the government think this cruelty will help? This government shows no concern for the vulnerable in our society, and its overtly harsh policies reflect the selfishness of liberal ideology. This government does not care about providing opportunity for all; it believes that if you do not have opportunity, it is your fault for not having rich parents.


While we are discussing unemployment, the budget figures themselves forecast an increase in unemployment over the course of the next year. Not only is this government failing to find work for those who are unemployed now, the situation is going to become worse in the future. It is all very well for the Treasurer to tell people to get a good job and a well-paid job—nearly 800,000 Australians are having trouble getting any job at all. For those Australians, the future is looking bleak, and that is why the government needs to do more. This government needs to articulate a jobs plan for this nation.


The ABC and SBS are exemplars of quality public broadcasting. Despite the assertions of members in Mr Abbott's government, they provide independent, unbiased and quality news. They are regularly rated as being trusted by the Australian people to a significantly higher degree than other parts of the mainstream media. This government, with its continued cuts to the ABC and SBS, shows that it does not value independent, unbiased media. Unfortunately, it is clear that the attacks on SBS and ABC are a payback to the Liberal and National Party mates for the support that they provided in the lead-up to the federal election.


It is pretty dangerous for a country to be without a free and fair media, because an independent, unbiased media is vital for questioning government policy. It is looking like this government is trying to hinder scrutiny of its actions wherever it can, because they are finding it hard to govern. It is hard to govern when all you have are three-word slogans and no real policies. It is hard to govern when the Prime Minister cares only about saving his own skin rather than governing for the benefit of the nation. It is hard to govern when you try to force all your policies through a narrow ideological vision that the Australian people do not subscribe to and that does not match reality.


Perhaps the minister who is most out of touch is the besieged Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts, Senator Brandis. Unfortunately the minister brings nothing to this government except arrogance and a lack of political judgement—and a small book of poetry to read at estimates when he should be doing his job. Minister Brandis has again mismanaged a portfolio responsibility. This budget saw an unwarranted and unprecedented attack on the arts. The Australia Council does a fantastic job of allocating funding independently, fairly and to arts organisations that are worthy. But Minister Brandis does not believe in the independent allocation of arts funding. He seems to believe that everyone has the right to be a bigot, as he has previously told this place; and, ironically for a man so enamoured with free speech, he believes that the allocation of arts funding should be under direct government control—namely, his own control. Presumably this is to reduce funding to projects or organisations that create art which the minister does not personally believe in.


The Liberal government's budget is once again leaving those on lower incomes worse off. The budget also unfairly attacks families. Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison's families package will leave almost half of Australian families worse off. New analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that 44 per cent of families, or over 1.4 million families, will be worse off. Tony Abbott's second budget is just as unfair as his first and will hit low- and middle-income families the hardest. Eighty per cent of families with children earning below $75,000 will lose out over all. Six in seven families who receive family tax benefits will be worse off because of the government's child care changes and family tax benefit cuts. One in 10 families receiving family tax benefit will be over $4,000 a year worse off.


This budget is a disaster. The government has even failed the test it set for itself. In this budget, spending is up, tax is up, deficits are up and unemployment is up. The government has broken its promise to save as much as it spends: spending initiatives are greater than actual savings. Mr Hockey has doubled the deficit in one year—from $17.1 billion to $35.1 billion. Mr Abbott has broken his promise for no new taxes—this budget contains around 17 new taxes—and tax is at its highest level since the last budget of the Howard government. As I said previously, this government is completely out of touch. It is out of touch with the values of the Australian people. It is out of touch with the way the world operates. This government has failed to meet its own expectations and has completely failed the Australian people.


This budget is mean. It attacks those on low incomes—single parents, pensioners and others that face disadvantage. This budget is vindictive. It attacks arts companies that the government does not agree with. This budget is visionless. It fails to see the value of investing in education and training. And this budget is cruel. It denies access to health care for those who can least afford it. The Abbott government cannot see a better Australia for all and has no plans to improve Australia. This is not a budget for Australia's future. It is last year's budget repackaged and ready for an election. I believe Australians deserve better government.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:33):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016. I agree with Senator Bilyk's assessment of this budget. It is a repackaged budget. They have tied a bow around it. They might have changed the wrapping, but it is still the same budget from last year which wrought such damage on the economy—on individuals and businesses. What we see in this year's budget is Mr Abbott trying to con the Australian public with a PR exercise to boost his own credibility, not to boost the economy and the standard of living of everyday Australians. The reality is that this budget remains inherently unfair—just like the last one but repackaged and served up again. Many of the same programs that were in the last budget are in this one. This budget contains the same cruel cuts from last year's budget which this parliament consistently rejected.


This budget shows that Mr Abbott and the coalition are not listening to the public, to the parliament, to their own backbench or, for that matter, to the crossbench. They are fanatically persisting with their own unfair budget measures. I concede that there has been repackaging. Health has been a major stayer in the Australian economy for a very long time. All sides have sought to improve health outcomes for Australia. All sides have continued to improve health services—up until recently. And it is the same person who did it once before. Mr Abbott has got form in this area. In the Howard era he ripped $1 billion out of the health budget—and he his doing it again. Of course, what that means is that families will be the hardest hit by Mr Abbott's attack on the Australian health system—only this time he has chosen a much bigger sum than $1 billion and to include education. The figure he is seeking to cut from both health and education is around $80 billion.


This budget does confirm that the government is once again trying to push through a GP tax, further cuts to hospital services and more expensive medicines. Before the election, Mr Abbott told the Australian people that the coalition would be a 'no surprises, no excuses' government. Well, there is one thing that is true about that statement: they certainly do not like providing any excuses. As for 'no surprises', it has been surprise after surprise after surprise. This government has consistently gone into reverse gear on many of the promises it made during the election period. Mr Abbott promised the Australian people that the coalition was about reducing taxes, not increasing taxes. He promised that the coalition was about getting rid of taxes, not imposing new taxes. Nothing about that statement is true. The Abbott government's new GP tax proposed in this budget is even bigger than the original proposal. By including a four-year freeze on medicine rebates, Mr Abbott and this government are passing the cost on to families, which he promised not to do.


In fact, the Liberals are so zealous in charging Australians this GP tax that, despite opposition from across the parliament, including the crossbench senators, they are still determined to pursue this GP tax, destroying the notion of universal health care in this country. It appears to be almost a pathological desire of the Liberals and Nationals, one of their highest priorities, to do this. The rebate freeze in this year's budget is just the latest version of an unfair GP tax, a tax which the Abbott government has tried to charge Australians. 


First they tried a $7 fee. That did not seem to go over very well with the general public, so they dropped it to $5. You think, 'Maybe this is a bidding war that they are in now.' But now Mr Abbott, if he is successful in getting a rebate freeze through this parliament, will see people slugged with an $8.43 fee. That is, in effect, what he seeks to do. The rebate freeze will rip $1.3 billion out of general practice over the next four years. The Medical Journal of Australia said of it:


Even though the rebate reduction has been retracted, the freeze will have greater impact with time—nearly double the amount of the rebate reduction by 2017-18. For economic reasons the freeze may still force GPs who currently bulk-bill to charge co-payments.


So by 2017-18 the shortfall will leave GPs $8.43 worse off, forcing who knows how many to charge patients who are currently bulk-billed and to increase gap payments for many other patients. Shame on this government because in the past both sides worked tirelessly to ensure that people could have access to affordable medicine, could have access to a GP, could have universal health care, could have a bulk-billing doctor handy to visit. But not this government. This government has continuously pursued its own ideological ideas, its own ideology about attacking Medicare. It goes directly against what the fundamental principles of Medicare are about—making sure that medicine is free and accessible to all Australians. It goes against the principle that your Medicare card, not your credit card, should determine your access to health care in this country. 


We have already seen the reports across the country of people, especially in some lower socioeconomic areas, not visiting the doctor for some conditions, which only compounds the problem and, in the end, when it reaches a critical point for patients, becomes a greater cost. So there is also a false saving built into their position. The healthcare system will ultimately bear the cost of this. Any measures which dissuade people from visiting their GP or accessing preventive healthcare options should be opposed, and Labor will continue to stand up against these measures.


The health minister has made it abundantly clear that the Abbott government is committed to forcing more patients to pay to see a doctor in that she said:


… there are a lot of people who attend the doctor, who pay nothing and can afford to pay a bit more and that's where we have to land in this discussion.


That was the health minister, Sussan Ley, on 3AW, 3 March 2015. What an extraordinary thing to say! You might otherwise have thought that it was a slip or misspoken words, but ultimately it is the Liberals speaking from their hearts. It is where their guard is down—they are comfortable on radio talking to their favourite presenter where they can speak their minds. The Assistant Treasurer even declared that he was very proud of last year's disastrous and unfair budget and lamented that the GP tax was blocked by Labor because 'there would have been big savings, and it is unfortunate.' So you can see that their whole position here is about driving the costs onto the people who can least afford it. 


The 2015-16 budget proves that Mr Abbott's promise that the GP tax is dead simply cannot now be believed. The budget attack on health through a backdoor GP tax is short-sighted and unfair and continues to threaten the future of universal health care. I think they abandoned some time ago the view that Australians should have access to universal health care. I think they abandoned some time ago the view that Medicare should remain strong and a viable entity. The Abbott government appears determined to inflict even more pain and chaos on the Australian people. Almost $1 billion will be cut from the programs that focus on preventative health care, drugs and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health and other crucial health programs. The magnitude of these cuts means that many organisations and service providers will be forced to close their doors, while many others will have to sack their staff and cut service provision.


But this budget does not stop there. The budget also cuts $125 million from the child dental benefits schedule; $140.6 million of cuts from the MBS, including halving the amount paid for child health assessments; $69.6 million cut from DVA dental and allied health; $214.1 million from eHealth; $252.2 million from PBS-listed drugs; $72.5 million cut from health workforce scholarships. This comes after the $1.3 billion increase in the price of medicines. The Australian people simply cannot afford to get sick under a Liberal government, literally. If they do get sick, they will have to find the money; if they cannot find the money, ultimately they will get sicker and sicker. Just today, we have seen a report in The Australian Financial Review that states could lose around $18 billion a year of Commonwealth funding for our public hospitals. The leaks from the Australian federation reform white paper show that the government's real objective is to cut money for public health, but it is also about cost shifting. It is also about shifting the cost of health to the states and education to the states and anything else it can push onto the states, but, ultimately, it fails to recognise that we are a Commonwealth—and the Commonwealth has primary responsibility in funding for the wellbeing of Australians.


When you look at what the government are doing to families, the Abbott government and their unfair budget are not content with attacking Australians' healthcare system. They also have their sights on attacking families in this budget. Mr Abbott's second budget lockup is in fact a lock-in. It locks in unfair cuts to family payments while at the same time imposing savage new cuts to paid parental leave. It is clear that the Abbott government have not learnt anything from last year's budget other than what I indicated at the start of my speech: they have learnt to dress it up. They have learnt to put a pink bow with a bit of frill around it, but, ultimately, when you unwrap it, it still remains an unfair budget to the core. Despite promising that this budget would not come at the expense of family budgets, Mr Abbott still wants to cut families off family tax benefit part B when their youngest child turns six. He still wants to freeze family tax benefit rates, eroding the value of these payments. As a result of last year's budget, a single-income family on $65,000 a year will be worse off to the tune of $6,000 a year. Mr Abbott also wants to abolish the large family supplement. He is also pursuing abolishing the low-income supplement and reducing the portability of family tax benefit part A. Mr Abbott's rhetoric on families may have changed—he may look like he has put his hand out—but, ultimately, it is about whether this budget passes the fairness test. The fundamental unfairness of last year's budget remains in this budget. It simply, on balance, does not pass that test.


The Minister for Social Services, Scott Morrison, refers to parents who receive top-ups to their paid parental leave as people who are rorters or defrauding the system. He uses strong language that I know the government secretly agree with. They might have distanced themselves from him, but they ultimately keep sending him out whacking families as the social services minister. Mr Abbott second budget will leave as many as 80,000 women a year worse off because of his cuts to their paid parental leave, and some women will lose as much as $11,500. Mr Abbott does not even know what he stands for any longer. This was his signature policy in this area, which he jettisoned as needed. In 2010, Mr Abbott referred to:


… 26 weeks which everyone knows is the minimum that should be spent at home by mothers with newborns.


This year, Mr Abbott said, about new mums who receive more than 18 weeks paid parental leave:


It is not right, it should not happen and it will not happen under this government.


This means less time for mothers with their babies in the early years of a baby's life. How quickly Mr Abbott changed his tune in this area.


Mr Abbott and the Liberals and Nationals simply do not care sufficiently in this area. They do not support mums and dads in starting families. They do not support them at the beginning of this journey; they certainly do not want to support them in case anything goes wrong later in life, when people might need to access a universal healthcare system. In fact, they are placing hurdles in front of families. Those opposite are waging a war against the safety net that successive Labor governments have built up over time. Those opposite are attacking our healthcare system, our family support system, which they want to cut, and our education system, at both primary and tertiary level.


I do recognise that we might want to finalise this debate before a dinner break, but I did not want to leave too much time for Senator Cormann to deal with his summing up speech.

(1) Clause 13, page 8 (line 18), omit ""$25,000,000,000"", substitute ""$11,000,000,000"".


The bill sets a debit limit for national partnership payments in 2015-16 of $25 billion, but government budget documents propose only $10.6 billion of national partnership payments in that year. So the bill provides a blank cheque to the government of $14.4 billion. My amendment changes the debit limit for national partnership payments from $25 billion to $11 billion. The amendment would do nothing to interfere with the $10.6 billion of national partnership payments proposed by the government in budget documents, but, if the amendment were to pass and if the government substantially increased its planned national partnership payments in the months ahead, the government would be required to seek authority for a higher spending limit in follow-up appropriation bills. Such follow-up appropriation bills are not uncommon. The advantage of this approach is that parliament would be able to see any new national partnership payment proposals in updated budget documents before the parliament agrees to a higher limit on national partnership payments. This would represent a very limited exercise of the parliament's responsibility to scrutinise the government and its spending.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (18:52):  The government will not be supporting this amendment. The debit limit for national partnership payments or drawing-rights limit, as it was previously known, has been around $20 billion for several years. In 2013-14 it was set at $19 billion and in this financial year it is set at $25 billion, as it is proposed to be for next year. The amount is set at this level to ensure that the Commonwealth has appropriate provision to not only deal with existing undertakings to the states but also to deal with any large-scale natural disasters or to fund new programs that may be required between estimates updates or to manage other major unexpected events. There is also a large difference between cash and accrual estimates for natural-disaster relief and recovery-arrangement payments. This is a factor that needs to be taken into account when considering Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment. We do not believe it would be responsible for the Senate to support this amendment and we very strongly recommend the Senate vote against it.

We do see the merit in allowing government the flexibility when it comes to increasing the national partnership payments. While we will not be supporting the amendment there are legitimate questions to ask the government as to why the limit is $25 billion when there is only $10.5 billion budgeted for the national partnership payments as per the Treasurer's portfolio budget statements—that is, the amount budgeted is less than half of the total budget spend. Note that a buffer of this magnitude was in the 2014-15 appropriation bills as well. Is the minister able to explain why the buffer is as large as it is?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:55):  Prior to question time, I commenced my contribution in this debate on the appropriation bills. I was discussing the context in which any set of appropriation bills is presented to this chamber—that is, the government's management of the budget and the management of the Australian economy. I was running through the figures in terms of the broader economic data which demonstrate the circumstances that the government have presided over since they came to government but most particularly since their confidence-killing budget of last year.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What about this year?




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from Senator O'Sullivan. I am happy to come to this year. Of course, they turned from fiscal conservatives into fiscal profligates, with higher deficits and higher debt than at any time under the Labor government, which they so roundly criticised.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You have to be kidding; how can you say it with a straight face?




Senator WONG:
  Well, it is true. I know those opposite get very grumpy with the truth, but all you have to do is look at these tables at the back of the budget papers—they are called the historical tables—and you can see all of the net debt figures, the historical figures around the underlying cash balance, expenditure, payments, tax, non-tax receipts. They make for very interesting reading and they show how poorly this government is managing our fiscal policy. 


One of the most important tasks of an elected government is to set appropriate fiscal policy, to manage the Commonwealth budget responsibly, to consider the impact of fiscal policy on economic growth, to make the investments and reforms needed for a prosperous and fair society into the future, and to make the decisions needed to ensure long-term budget sustainability—and that is the approach the former government took. We did use fiscal policy to keep Australia growing through the global financial crisis. We invested in infrastructure and we did so while ensuring that finances remained sustainable. We made responsible budget savings worth more than $180 billion over the six budgets after 2008-09. And we left Australia with one of the lowest levels of public debt of any advanced economy.


What has been the approach of those opposite? They have broken every promise they made before the election. They have created uncertainty and anxiety in the community. They have sought to ram through unfair policies like the new GP tax, cuts to pension indexation, cuts to family benefits and cuts to superannuation entitlements. Their approach to the budget has damaged consumer confidence and business confidence. Who can forget Joe Hockey?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Business confidence has never been better.




Senator WONG:
  Well, that is simply untrue. Senator Macdonald says that business confidence has never been better. That is just not true. In fact, business confidence, by the NAB survey, has fallen 75 per cent since the government took office. That is the problem with Senator Macdonald. He does not actually look at the facts; he just sits there spouting the rhetoric—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Let's go to the polls.




Senator WONG:
  Here is another one—Senator O'Sullivan. He does not want to look at the facts; he spouts the rhetoric. They claimed that they would reduce debt and deficit; they have grown the debt. So I again remind them: since their first budget was handed down in May 2014 we have seen a slowing of economic growth. As Senator Bullock rightly pointed out in question time today, the annual growth rate to the year ending March 2014 was three per cent, around trend. In the year to March 2015 it was 2.3 per cent—substantially below trend. There has been a denting of confidence, as I have reminded those opposite. They do not want to hear it.The NAB business survey shows that business confidence has fallen by 75 per cent since the government took office and consumer sentiment has fallen by 13.8 per cent. Wages growth has slumped. In the year to March 2015 wages grew by 2.3 per cent—the lowest annual rate of wage growth in two decades. Senator Cormann today interjected in question time, 'It is all fine because CPI is low'. I said to him, 'Why don't you go to the voters of Hasluck and say to them, ""It's okay that you are getting wages growth at the lowest rate in 20 years, because CPI is really low; inflation is really low.""' See how that works. We know this government does not make wages growth a priority; does not make increasing inequality, increasing the sharing of economic prosperity in this country, a priority. And of course the unemployment rate is up. The unemployment rate has been at six per cent or higher since their first budget in 2014. Under the Labor government the unemployment rate never had a six in front of it—not even at the height of the global financial crisis. 


So slower growth, sluggish wages, rising unemployment—what this means is that Australians' incomes have fallen under this government. The latest national accounts show that the average Australian's disposable income fell by 1.5 per cent in real terms in the year to March 2015. That is worth considering—the average Australian's disposable income fell by 1½ per cent in real terms in the year to March 2015. That is what this government is presiding over. Just this week we have seen a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers which shows a growing economic problem—one that governments of both persuasions need to tackle; the difference is those on that side do not appear to be willing to—and that is the increasing disparity in economic activity around Australia. One-third of regional locations are in recession.


The government's second budget is as socially unfair and economically short-sighted as its first budget. It still includes $80 billion in cuts to local schools and hospitals funding. In question time today Senator Brandis kept talking about CPI and population growth as good bases for indexation. I am sure there are those opposite who understand the mathematics of this enough, which is that if your costs grow at a rate higher than indexation, you erode funding over time. That is what the government is ignoring. Nobody on either side of politics asserts that health costs only grow by the consumer price index. No-one who can be taken seriously would assert that. The government's approach of changing indexation for health and education funding is a cut—it cuts funding over time because we know that the costs of these activities historically have continued to rise at rates higher than CPI. You do not have to take it from me—Liberal Party ministers and governments are complaining about this. As was discussed today, the New South Wales government's own evidence is that we will see longer waiting times for elective surgery and greater pressure on public hospitals as a result of the cuts to hospitals.


What else does the budget still include, apart from the $80 billion cut to schools and hospitals? There are $100,000 university degrees, a new tax on visiting the doctor and $2 billion more in cuts to health care, with children's health care, dementia assistance and Medicare benefits hit the hardest. This second budget hits families again, just as the government's first budget did. An analysis by NATSEM shows that the government's budget policies will inflict more than $6,000 in cuts to the typical family.


Labor has outlined its approach. We will invest in the education of our young people and the skills of our workforce. We want more young Australians to learn the language of the digital age, coding, from the beginning of formal learning in primary and secondary school. I was at a breakfast this morning with the Business Council of Australia where there was discussion about the demand for these skills, certainly in the United States, and why these skills are so important to employment prospects for the next generation of Australians. To cater for this we have to boost the skills of our primary and secondary teachers; we also have to encourage more recent graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to become teachers and we have to introduce new measures to encourage more young people, particularly women, to study the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. These are all matters that Mr Shorten has spoken at length about. Labor has also made clear the priority of investment in science research and innovation and supporting new ideas and start-ups to drive the economy. Our commitment is to ensure that three per cent of Australia's GDP is invested in science research and development by the end of the next decade. This is all about a smart, modern and fair Australia. 


In conclusion, I return to the need for a sustainable budget. We understand the need for a sustainable budget, and we demonstrated that when we were in government, as I said, by making targeted savings totalling over $180 billion over the six budgets from 2008-09. We have supported in excess of $20 billion of proposed savings announced by the government, and we have proposed a range of alternatives—alternatives which are responsible and fair. These include reducing superannuation tax breaks for high-income earners, saving over $14 billion in 10 years. I note today that Mr Tony Shepherd, the Prime Minister's hand-picked head of the Commission of Audit, has said what the Prime Minister cannot say, has said what the government cannot agree with, and that is that superannuation concessions need to be revisited. They do. They are overwhelmingly tilted to high-income earners, and in the interests of long-term sustainability of the budget position, as well as the encouragement of a sensible policy for all retirement incomes, you cannot take them off the table in the way the government has.


Another measure the opposition has announced is multinational tax reform to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax, saving some $7.2 billion over 10 years, and we indicated clearly that we did not support the Prime Minister's Paid Parental Leave scheme or his Direct Action scheme, which cost, respectively, $5.5 million and $2.6 billion a year. These are savings which are socially fair, unlike the Abbott government's cuts which fall hardest on low- and middle-income earners. Alternative savings are also economically and fiscally responsible—contributing to fiscal consolidation while supporting economic growth—and they address reform priorities: the need for a more sustainable retirement income system and also the impact of multinational tax shifting on budget revenues, which is an ongoing challenge for all advanced economies.


In conclusion, I want to turn to the issue of spending. Those opposite like to mouth a lot of rhetoric about Labor's spending, but in opposition they made a range of assertions which were simply not true. I think it was Barnaby Joyce who said that we were heading for Greek-like levels of debt; I recall Senator Abetz in question time suggesting that the country was bankrupt. In fact these are economically irresponsible statements; they are not only untrue and not only partisan, but they are economically irresponsible for senior members of a party of government to make. Senator Cormann also spent a lot of time, both in opposition and in the lead up to the 2014 budget, beating his chest about how fiscally conservative he was. It must be very embarrassing for him now to be the finance minister presiding over the budget. He spends a lot of time telling me how bad I was; I would like to point out some figures to him and hopefully he will reflect upon them.


During my time as finance minister, government spending averaged 24.6 per cent of GDP. Since Senator Cormann was sworn into the position of finance minister, government spending has run at an average of 25.8 per cent of GDP—that is a full percentage point of GDP higher than during my period as finance minister. But it is also higher than it was during the tenures of finance ministers Tanner, Minchin, Fahey, Beazley, Willis, Walsh, Guilfoyle, Robinson and Lynch. So in a government that has notched up so many dubious distinctions, here is another: congratulations to Senator Cormann, you hold the record as Australia's biggest-spending finance minister.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-06-23,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:09):  I rise to speak to the various Appropriation Bills before the Senate. I know the major parties support their passage, but I have grave concerns about these annual Appropriation Bills that I want to put on the record. As we have just heard from Senator Wong, Commonwealth spending is at record levels. Figures for last financial year indicate that real Commonwealth government spending per person is at its highest level on record. Real government spending per person across the federation is also at its highest level on record. There is no hiding the rise of government spending, even when you compare government spending with GDP. Commonwealth government spending is 25.9 per cent of GDP—that, by my calculations, is actually higher than Senator Wong thinks at 25.8. Since 1970, this ratio of Commonwealth government spending to GDP was higher for just four years under Bob Hawke, for two years under Keating and for one year under Rudd. In all other years since 1970, Commonwealth government spending relative to GDP was lower than it is today.


There is no justification for the ever-expanding Commonwealth government spend. As I have said before, living standards for all groups of society have risen inexorably over the past decades. This means the need for government welfare services has declined, and we have not uncovered new forms of effective government intervention, either. To the contrary, the prosperity-promoting effects of free markets and the many failings of government involvement have been demonstrated time and again.


The annual Appropriation Bills authorise Commonwealth government spending. They provide line-by-line authorisation for spending on specific items. They also set limits for some general categories of spending. The Senate is empowered by the Constitution to reject any appropriation bill. This reminds us that Senate scrutiny into appropriation bills does not represent sticking our noses into other people's business. Indeed, the Senate has a responsibility to scrutinise. The Senate is also empowered by the Constitution to amend any provision in the Appropriation Bills that does not relate to the 'ordinary annual services of Government'. That means the Senate can amend any provision relating to loans, capital equipment, assets and depreciation, any provision relating to grants to the states and territories and any provision relating to new policies.


So the Senate has a particular responsibility to scrutinise capital spending, grants to the states and spending on new policies. This leads me to the first of my grave concerns. The government is asserting that the Senate cannot amend provisions relating to new policies. The government is doing this by placing provisions relating to various new policies in those Appropriation Bills that should exclusively house provisions relating to the 'ordinary annual services of Government'. These are the odd-numbered Appropriation Bills, like the no. (1) and no. (5) bills before us today. For example, the no. (1) bill includes provisions for Australia's contributions to the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility and to the World Bank's Global Infrastructure Facility. These are new policies, but because they fall under an existing, broad departmental outcome, the government is asserting that they represent the 'ordinary annual services of Government' and are immune from Senate amendment. I reject this assertion and reserve the right to amend provisions relating to new programs and projects, even if the government places these provisions in odd-numbered appropriation bills.


Another grave concern relates to the even-numbered Appropriation Bills. These are the bills that should contain all the provisions that the Senate is empowered to amend, including grants to the states under section 96 of the Constitution. Section 96 of the Constitution provides:


… the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.


This is a very strong power provided to the parliament, but Appropriation Bill (No. 2) before us today contains a clause, clause 16, that delegates this power to the relevant minister. In particular, it provides the minister with the power to determine the amounts and timings of payments to the state, territory and local governments. It also provides the minister with the power to determine the conditions under which those payments are made. The government asserts that these payments to the states and territories can be made without a written determination from the minister; and the government asserts that, if there is a written determination, the determination may not be made public and it will not be disallowable by the parliament. It is bad enough that the Commonwealth uses section 96 of the Constitution to undermine the Federation; it is unforgivable that this could occur at the whim of a minister, without parliamentary scrutiny. This is a centralisation of power that would put the Soviet Union to shame.


My final grave concern relates to the massive blank cheques provided in the appropriation bills. Take, for example, the issue of national partnership payments. These are payments of tied grants to the states and territories that are authorised under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 so they do not need to be individually specified in annual appropriation bills. However, the annual appropriation bills need to set a limit on the total amount of national partnership payments in a year. The budget papers outline government plans for $10.6 billion of national partnership payments next financial year, but Appropriation Bill (No. 2) sets a limit of $25 billion on national partnership payments next year. This represents a $14.4 billion blank cheque. It will allow the government to make national partnership payments that it has not outlined in any document. 


Such a blank cheque is completely unnecessary. For instance, if the government increased its planned national partnership payments in later months, it would be able to outline these increased payments in updates to the portfolio budget statements and to seek authority for a higher spending limit in follow-up appropriation bills, which are routine. That the government seeks authority for national partnership payments without even outlining them in budget documents is the height of authoritarian swagger.


I have a simple amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to reduce the authority for national partnership payments next year from $25 billion to $11 billion. This is still well above the planned level of national partnership payments. This is the most modest of amendments. It is an amendment to a bill that the Senate is clearly empowered to amend and it is an amendment that defends the limited rights of the parliament. So, if any senator opposes this amendment, I would appreciate an explanation in the committee stage as to why.


I have outlined three grave concerns with the appropriation bills before the Senate, but these are not the paranoid concerns of a solo libertarian. The first two concerns arose from the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, a cross-party committee of which I am not a member. The third concern arose from the Parliamentary Library's briefings on the budget. Most senators do not take the time to personally scrutinise these bills. Surely that means it is our responsibility to listen to those people who do take the time—that is, the senators on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the parliamentary officers who prepare their committee reports and undertake research at the Parliamentary Library.


These five appropriation bills before the Senate have more than $97 billion of specific spending proposals in their schedules and spending limits applying to general spending areas in excess of $30 billion. Even if you do not share my concerns about the magnitude of government spending, there is a case for applying more scrutiny to these bills than to other bills that pass through this place. Unfortunately, there is far less scrutiny of these bills.


I believe it is a dereliction of duty to let government spending drift; but, through a failure to scrutinise these appropriation bills, that is exactly what this parliament is doing.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:19):  As most people in this chamber know, one of my previous occupations was as an early childhood educator. As such, I am familiar with the excitement that a child feels when they learn a new word. Listening to the Treasurer on budget night, I could not help but come to the conclusion that he was just like a small boy who had learnt a new word—that word was 'fairness'—and he was trying to use it at every opportunity. And it was clear to the Australian people that, like a small boy, he did not really understand the meaning of it, because this Treasurer still needs to learn that just saying something is fair does not make it so.


This appropriation bills debate that we are having today, despite the convention not to block supply, is perhaps the most important of the parliamentary year. It is important because it allows us to outline the values that we feel should be used to allocate funding and it allows us to spotlight the values that the government has used in this budget and raise objections to decisions that the government has made—and the values of this government are very, very wrong. They are not aligned with the values of the Australian people. Australia is a nation of intelligent, caring, egalitarian people. We battle for the underdog. We help out a mate. We believe in the fair go. The Australian people know that, despite the budget's mask of fairness, it contains cruel cuts and is built on last year's budget attack on the least well off in our community. There are cruel cuts to health, cruel cuts to education, cruel cuts to pensions and further unnecessary cuts to the ABC, SBS and the arts. The Abbott government is killing the fair go. 


Inequality in Australia is now at a 75-year high. It did not rise during the period 2007-2013. However, we are now in a situation where, compared to a generation ago, the top one per cent share of income has doubled and the top 0.01 per cent share has tripled. Earnings have gone up three times as fast for the top as they have for the bottom, and the wealthiest three Australians now earn more than the poorest one million Australians.


This budget does nothing about reducing inequality, and in fact it increases it. NATSEM modelling found that the poorest 20 per cent of households would lose up to seven per cent of their total annual disposable income by 2018-19, and that is when you take all the budget measures into account. This is a huge hit to 2.5 million of Australia's least well-off families. The modelling also shows that some higher-income families will be better off. The analysis shows that a sole parent with an income of $55,000, with two kids, one in primary school and one in high school, will be more than $20,000 worse off in total by 2018-19. This is absolutely shameful. It is a shameful attack on single parents and it is completely unwarranted.


As members of this place know, a great way to reduce inequality is through education, and Australians value education. Australian parents know that education is the means through which their children will build a better life. Parents understand that a quality education is vital for getting a job. They work hard to ensure their kids have the resources they need to get the best education they can. And, of course, in last year's budget we saw $30 billion cut from schools over 10 years.


I was absolutely shocked by reports over the weekend that part of the green paper on Federation reform would see funding adjusted for student need and the ability of families to make a contribution. In other words, this government is now putting forward an idea to charge parents for sending their children to primary school. This is from a government that had the great idea to provide $75,000, non-means-tested, to millionaire mums. There is no good reason to charge parents to send their children to public schools. Free public education is the right of every citizen in this country. Mr Abbott has walked away from a commitment to universal public education. He said recently:


Whether state or territory governments choose to change the way schools are funded in their states and territories is absolutely a matter for them.


And:


We don't have any role at all.


I would like to say, Mr Abbott: you do have a role, or your government does. You provide the states with the majority of their funding. If the Commonwealth does not provide the states with enough revenue to provide basic services, it is your fault if they have to introduce the education co-payment model outlined in the green paper. It would be Mr Abbott's fault, as the idea was raised in the Abbott government's own green paper.


Universal education was introduced in the 19th century and it is a value held by everyone in the country. It has been clear for some time that this government is out of touch and that its values are decades out of date, but I did not think they would be centuries out of date. There is absolutely no justification to make this fundamental shift in the right of Australian children to access free education.


The government have shown that they are also opposed to the principle of universal health care. Recently, we saw the 40th anniversary of Medicare. Medicare is a fantastic success story. It has been a central part of the Australian health system, except for the brief period in which it was axed under the Fraser Liberal government. But we saw in last year's budget that those opposite are opposed to universal health care. According to those opposite, universal access to health care is not an inalienable right but something that must be paid for. We saw this through their successive of policy positions on the GP tax. Whether the tax is $7, $5, $20 or, now, $80, it is a bad idea. They failed to sell this policy to the Australian people last year and they have failed to sell this policy to the Australian people this year. Why are they again trying to bring it back in through an effective $8 dollar GP tax in the budget through the MBS indexation freeze? This is a cut of more than $2 million from Medicare over the forward estimates that will have a serious impact on bulk-billing rates, out-of-pocket costs and the level of access vulnerable patients have to general practitioners.


We know from an analysis published in The Medical Journal of Australia that the government has put a GP tax of $8 into the budget by stealth. They have cut $2 million out of health again, and some of it in an incredibly petty way—for example, when you look at the cut to support for those with inborn errors of metabolism.


The government just wants to attack the most vulnerable in our community. In particular, they attack young people to shift the blame to them for the government's own failings. The rate of youth unemployment is far too high at 13.4 per cent, and long-term unemployment is at its highest rate in 16 years. The government has shown no interest in fixing this issue and no ability to do so. Consequently, they want to blame young job seekers. Rather than work positively to provide opportunities for young job seekers, they wish to punish them instead by ensuring they get no income support for a month.


Labor will not support a measure which pushes young people into poverty and hardship. How could this possibly help anyone? Why does the government think this cruelty will help? This government shows no concern for the vulnerable in our society, and its overtly harsh policies reflect the selfishness of liberal ideology. This government does not care about providing opportunity for all; it believes that if you do not have opportunity, it is your fault for not having rich parents.


While we are discussing unemployment, the budget figures themselves forecast an increase in unemployment over the course of the next year. Not only is this government failing to find work for those who are unemployed now, the situation is going to become worse in the future. It is all very well for the Treasurer to tell people to get a good job and a well-paid job—nearly 800,000 Australians are having trouble getting any job at all. For those Australians, the future is looking bleak, and that is why the government needs to do more. This government needs to articulate a jobs plan for this nation.


The ABC and SBS are exemplars of quality public broadcasting. Despite the assertions of members in Mr Abbott's government, they provide independent, unbiased and quality news. They are regularly rated as being trusted by the Australian people to a significantly higher degree than other parts of the mainstream media. This government, with its continued cuts to the ABC and SBS, shows that it does not value independent, unbiased media. Unfortunately, it is clear that the attacks on SBS and ABC are a payback to the Liberal and National Party mates for the support that they provided in the lead-up to the federal election.


It is pretty dangerous for a country to be without a free and fair media, because an independent, unbiased media is vital for questioning government policy. It is looking like this government is trying to hinder scrutiny of its actions wherever it can, because they are finding it hard to govern. It is hard to govern when all you have are three-word slogans and no real policies. It is hard to govern when the Prime Minister cares only about saving his own skin rather than governing for the benefit of the nation. It is hard to govern when you try to force all your policies through a narrow ideological vision that the Australian people do not subscribe to and that does not match reality.


Perhaps the minister who is most out of touch is the besieged Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts, Senator Brandis. Unfortunately the minister brings nothing to this government except arrogance and a lack of political judgement—and a small book of poetry to read at estimates when he should be doing his job. Minister Brandis has again mismanaged a portfolio responsibility. This budget saw an unwarranted and unprecedented attack on the arts. The Australia Council does a fantastic job of allocating funding independently, fairly and to arts organisations that are worthy. But Minister Brandis does not believe in the independent allocation of arts funding. He seems to believe that everyone has the right to be a bigot, as he has previously told this place; and, ironically for a man so enamoured with free speech, he believes that the allocation of arts funding should be under direct government control—namely, his own control. Presumably this is to reduce funding to projects or organisations that create art which the minister does not personally believe in.


The Liberal government's budget is once again leaving those on lower incomes worse off. The budget also unfairly attacks families. Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison's families package will leave almost half of Australian families worse off. New analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that 44 per cent of families, or over 1.4 million families, will be worse off. Tony Abbott's second budget is just as unfair as his first and will hit low- and middle-income families the hardest. Eighty per cent of families with children earning below $75,000 will lose out over all. Six in seven families who receive family tax benefits will be worse off because of the government's child care changes and family tax benefit cuts. One in 10 families receiving family tax benefit will be over $4,000 a year worse off.


This budget is a disaster. The government has even failed the test it set for itself. In this budget, spending is up, tax is up, deficits are up and unemployment is up. The government has broken its promise to save as much as it spends: spending initiatives are greater than actual savings. Mr Hockey has doubled the deficit in one year—from $17.1 billion to $35.1 billion. Mr Abbott has broken his promise for no new taxes—this budget contains around 17 new taxes—and tax is at its highest level since the last budget of the Howard government. As I said previously, this government is completely out of touch. It is out of touch with the values of the Australian people. It is out of touch with the way the world operates. This government has failed to meet its own expectations and has completely failed the Australian people.


This budget is mean. It attacks those on low incomes—single parents, pensioners and others that face disadvantage. This budget is vindictive. It attacks arts companies that the government does not agree with. This budget is visionless. It fails to see the value of investing in education and training. And this budget is cruel. It denies access to health care for those who can least afford it. The Abbott government cannot see a better Australia for all and has no plans to improve Australia. This is not a budget for Australia's future. It is last year's budget repackaged and ready for an election. I believe Australians deserve better government.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (18:33):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016. I agree with Senator Bilyk's assessment of this budget. It is a repackaged budget. They have tied a bow around it. They might have changed the wrapping, but it is still the same budget from last year which wrought such damage on the economy—on individuals and businesses. What we see in this year's budget is Mr Abbott trying to con the Australian public with a PR exercise to boost his own credibility, not to boost the economy and the standard of living of everyday Australians. The reality is that this budget remains inherently unfair—just like the last one but repackaged and served up again. Many of the same programs that were in the last budget are in this one. This budget contains the same cruel cuts from last year's budget which this parliament consistently rejected.


This budget shows that Mr Abbott and the coalition are not listening to the public, to the parliament, to their own backbench or, for that matter, to the crossbench. They are fanatically persisting with their own unfair budget measures. I concede that there has been repackaging. Health has been a major stayer in the Australian economy for a very long time. All sides have sought to improve health outcomes for Australia. All sides have continued to improve health services—up until recently. And it is the same person who did it once before. Mr Abbott has got form in this area. In the Howard era he ripped $1 billion out of the health budget—and he his doing it again. Of course, what that means is that families will be the hardest hit by Mr Abbott's attack on the Australian health system—only this time he has chosen a much bigger sum than $1 billion and to include education. The figure he is seeking to cut from both health and education is around $80 billion.


This budget does confirm that the government is once again trying to push through a GP tax, further cuts to hospital services and more expensive medicines. Before the election, Mr Abbott told the Australian people that the coalition would be a 'no surprises, no excuses' government. Well, there is one thing that is true about that statement: they certainly do not like providing any excuses. As for 'no surprises', it has been surprise after surprise after surprise. This government has consistently gone into reverse gear on many of the promises it made during the election period. Mr Abbott promised the Australian people that the coalition was about reducing taxes, not increasing taxes. He promised that the coalition was about getting rid of taxes, not imposing new taxes. Nothing about that statement is true. The Abbott government's new GP tax proposed in this budget is even bigger than the original proposal. By including a four-year freeze on medicine rebates, Mr Abbott and this government are passing the cost on to families, which he promised not to do.


In fact, the Liberals are so zealous in charging Australians this GP tax that, despite opposition from across the parliament, including the crossbench senators, they are still determined to pursue this GP tax, destroying the notion of universal health care in this country. It appears to be almost a pathological desire of the Liberals and Nationals, one of their highest priorities, to do this. The rebate freeze in this year's budget is just the latest version of an unfair GP tax, a tax which the Abbott government has tried to charge Australians. 


First they tried a $7 fee. That did not seem to go over very well with the general public, so they dropped it to $5. You think, 'Maybe this is a bidding war that they are in now.' But now Mr Abbott, if he is successful in getting a rebate freeze through this parliament, will see people slugged with an $8.43 fee. That is, in effect, what he seeks to do. The rebate freeze will rip $1.3 billion out of general practice over the next four years. The Medical Journal of Australia said of it:


Even though the rebate reduction has been retracted, the freeze will have greater impact with time—nearly double the amount of the rebate reduction by 2017-18. For economic reasons the freeze may still force GPs who currently bulk-bill to charge co-payments.


So by 2017-18 the shortfall will leave GPs $8.43 worse off, forcing who knows how many to charge patients who are currently bulk-billed and to increase gap payments for many other patients. Shame on this government because in the past both sides worked tirelessly to ensure that people could have access to affordable medicine, could have access to a GP, could have universal health care, could have a bulk-billing doctor handy to visit. But not this government. This government has continuously pursued its own ideological ideas, its own ideology about attacking Medicare. It goes directly against what the fundamental principles of Medicare are about—making sure that medicine is free and accessible to all Australians. It goes against the principle that your Medicare card, not your credit card, should determine your access to health care in this country. 


We have already seen the reports across the country of people, especially in some lower socioeconomic areas, not visiting the doctor for some conditions, which only compounds the problem and, in the end, when it reaches a critical point for patients, becomes a greater cost. So there is also a false saving built into their position. The healthcare system will ultimately bear the cost of this. Any measures which dissuade people from visiting their GP or accessing preventive healthcare options should be opposed, and Labor will continue to stand up against these measures.


The health minister has made it abundantly clear that the Abbott government is committed to forcing more patients to pay to see a doctor in that she said:


… there are a lot of people who attend the doctor, who pay nothing and can afford to pay a bit more and that's where we have to land in this discussion.


That was the health minister, Sussan Ley, on 3AW, 3 March 2015. What an extraordinary thing to say! You might otherwise have thought that it was a slip or misspoken words, but ultimately it is the Liberals speaking from their hearts. It is where their guard is down—they are comfortable on radio talking to their favourite presenter where they can speak their minds. The Assistant Treasurer even declared that he was very proud of last year's disastrous and unfair budget and lamented that the GP tax was blocked by Labor because 'there would have been big savings, and it is unfortunate.' So you can see that their whole position here is about driving the costs onto the people who can least afford it. 


The 2015-16 budget proves that Mr Abbott's promise that the GP tax is dead simply cannot now be believed. The budget attack on health through a backdoor GP tax is short-sighted and unfair and continues to threaten the future of universal health care. I think they abandoned some time ago the view that Australians should have access to universal health care. I think they abandoned some time ago the view that Medicare should remain strong and a viable entity. The Abbott government appears determined to inflict even more pain and chaos on the Australian people. Almost $1 billion will be cut from the programs that focus on preventative health care, drugs and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health and other crucial health programs. The magnitude of these cuts means that many organisations and service providers will be forced to close their doors, while many others will have to sack their staff and cut service provision.


But this budget does not stop there. The budget also cuts $125 million from the child dental benefits schedule; $140.6 million of cuts from the MBS, including halving the amount paid for child health assessments; $69.6 million cut from DVA dental and allied health; $214.1 million from eHealth; $252.2 million from PBS-listed drugs; $72.5 million cut from health workforce scholarships. This comes after the $1.3 billion increase in the price of medicines. The Australian people simply cannot afford to get sick under a Liberal government, literally. If they do get sick, they will have to find the money; if they cannot find the money, ultimately they will get sicker and sicker. Just today, we have seen a report in The Australian Financial Review that states could lose around $18 billion a year of Commonwealth funding for our public hospitals. The leaks from the Australian federation reform white paper show that the government's real objective is to cut money for public health, but it is also about cost shifting. It is also about shifting the cost of health to the states and education to the states and anything else it can push onto the states, but, ultimately, it fails to recognise that we are a Commonwealth—and the Commonwealth has primary responsibility in funding for the wellbeing of Australians.


When you look at what the government are doing to families, the Abbott government and their unfair budget are not content with attacking Australians' healthcare system. They also have their sights on attacking families in this budget. Mr Abbott's second budget lockup is in fact a lock-in. It locks in unfair cuts to family payments while at the same time imposing savage new cuts to paid parental leave. It is clear that the Abbott government have not learnt anything from last year's budget other than what I indicated at the start of my speech: they have learnt to dress it up. They have learnt to put a pink bow with a bit of frill around it, but, ultimately, when you unwrap it, it still remains an unfair budget to the core. Despite promising that this budget would not come at the expense of family budgets, Mr Abbott still wants to cut families off family tax benefit part B when their youngest child turns six. He still wants to freeze family tax benefit rates, eroding the value of these payments. As a result of last year's budget, a single-income family on $65,000 a year will be worse off to the tune of $6,000 a year. Mr Abbott also wants to abolish the large family supplement. He is also pursuing abolishing the low-income supplement and reducing the portability of family tax benefit part A. Mr Abbott's rhetoric on families may have changed—he may look like he has put his hand out—but, ultimately, it is about whether this budget passes the fairness test. The fundamental unfairness of last year's budget remains in this budget. It simply, on balance, does not pass that test.


The Minister for Social Services, Scott Morrison, refers to parents who receive top-ups to their paid parental leave as people who are rorters or defrauding the system. He uses strong language that I know the government secretly agree with. They might have distanced themselves from him, but they ultimately keep sending him out whacking families as the social services minister. Mr Abbott second budget will leave as many as 80,000 women a year worse off because of his cuts to their paid parental leave, and some women will lose as much as $11,500. Mr Abbott does not even know what he stands for any longer. This was his signature policy in this area, which he jettisoned as needed. In 2010, Mr Abbott referred to:


… 26 weeks which everyone knows is the minimum that should be spent at home by mothers with newborns.


This year, Mr Abbott said, about new mums who receive more than 18 weeks paid parental leave:


It is not right, it should not happen and it will not happen under this government.


This means less time for mothers with their babies in the early years of a baby's life. How quickly Mr Abbott changed his tune in this area.


Mr Abbott and the Liberals and Nationals simply do not care sufficiently in this area. They do not support mums and dads in starting families. They do not support them at the beginning of this journey; they certainly do not want to support them in case anything goes wrong later in life, when people might need to access a universal healthcare system. In fact, they are placing hurdles in front of families. Those opposite are waging a war against the safety net that successive Labor governments have built up over time. Those opposite are attacking our healthcare system, our family support system, which they want to cut, and our education system, at both primary and tertiary level.


I do recognise that we might want to finalise this debate before a dinner break, but I did not want to leave too much time for Senator Cormann to deal with his summing up speech.

   Insert:


   (2A) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), electricity that is transmitted or distributed is used predominantly for the transmission or distribution of electricity if:


      (a) the primary purpose of generating the electricity is for the use of the end user who generated the electricity; and


      (b) an amount of that electricity, no greater than the threshold amount determined under subsection (2B), is made available for use in relation to one or more services in the public interest.


   (2B) For the purposes of paragraph (2A)(b), the Minister must, by legislative instrument, determine a threshold amount of electricity which can be made available for use in relation to one or more services in the public interest.


   (2C) The Minister must:


      (a) make a determination under subsection (2B) within 3 months of the commencement of this subsection; and


      (b) as far as is practicable, ensure that a determination under that subsection is in force at all times after that determination comes into force.


I am concerned that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 does not include provisions to overcome a potentially serious flaw in the RET legislation. The problem arises due to the consequences of incidental uses of electricity under the existing legislation, and has potentially serious impacts in my home state of Western Australia. And I note that comments made by shadow minister Gray in the House debate also asked the government to address this matter.


The issue arises because the concessions available to self-generators of electricity from RET liability only apply where such self-generated electricity is used solely by that person. That said, the law must make provisions for the situation where a small amount of electricity is used by third parties to provide vital community services. The Alcoa facilities in Western Australia provide this incidental power for police communication services, telephone services and for the local government. It is ludicrous that Alcoa should face a substantial penalty for making the electricity available to enable these public services.


The Warburton review also recommended that the issue be addressed. It said:


… the Panel recommends that self-generators should be permitted to supply incidental amounts of electricity to third parties for community services on an otherwise dedicated line while still being eligible for the exemption.


My amendment simply asks the minister that within three months, by a legislative instrument, he must determine a threshold amount of electricity that can be made available for use in relation to one or more services in the public interest.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-23,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:31):  I thank Senator Wang. The government appreciate the intent of Senator Wang's amendment, but we do not agree with the amendment. We believe that implementing full exemptions for emissions-intensive trade-exposed entities addresses, through alternative means, most of the concerns raised about the self-generator provisions and that there is a risk the amendment could lead to some unintended consequences for some businesses. It is the government's view that the entities that generate and use their own electricity can seek exemption from RET liability under strict eligibility conditions to target genuine self-generation. To be exempted, electricity must currently be used within one kilometre of the point of generation or supplied via a dedicated line. The proposed amendment seeks to extend these exemptions by diluting the dedicated line test to allow third parties to be supplied under certain circumstances without voiding the self-generation exemption.


The issue this amendment attempts to deal with tends to be confined to large development projects on remote grids where the self-generator is undertaking an ET activity. Increasing the partial exemptions under the scheme for ET activities to a 100 per cent exemption, as proposed in the government's bill, will provide significant additional relief to these ET businesses. Expanding the self-generator exemption provides little additional benefit to the businesses.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (22:34):  I move amendment (1) standing in my name on sheet 7728:


(1) Schedule 1, page 15 (after line 2), at the end of the Schedule, add:



Part


5—Injunctions





Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000





53


Subsections


154S(1), (2) and (3)



   Repeal the subsections, substitute:


(1) If a person (the first person) has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any conduct that is or would be:


   (a) an offence against this Act or the regulations; or


   (b) a contravention of a civil penalty provision;


the Federal Court may, on the application of the Regulator or any other person, grant an injunction restraining the first person from engaging in the conduct.


(2) If:


   (a) a person (the first person) has refused or failed, is refusing or failing, or is about to refuse or fail, to do a thing; and


   (b) the refusal or failure is, or would be:


      (i) an offence against this Act or the regulations; or


      (ii) a contravention of a civil penalty provision;


the Federal Court may, on the application of the Regulator or any other person, grant an injunction requiring the first person to do the thing.


(3) The power of the Federal Court to grant an injunction may be exercised:


   (a) whether or not it appears to the Court that the first person intends to engage, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; and


   (b) whether or not the first person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind.


The aim of this amendment is to allow the Clean Energy Regulator or any other person to seek an injunction in certain circumstances—that is, if the person, and that includes the Clean Energy Regulator, believes that someone is about to engage in or is engaging in any conduct that would be an offence against this act or the regulations or a contravention of the civil penalty provisions. It allows an application to be made to the Federal Court, on the application of the regulator or any other person, to grant an injunction restraining the first person from engaging in the conduct.


The purpose of this is to ensure that the regulator has that injunctive power to seek an injunction, and, indeed, any other persons, in the event that it appears that a breach is about to be committed. In order to seek an injunction, you need to be able to give an undertaking as to damages. This is not something that will be used lightly. Giving an undertaking as to damages is a very serious undertaking in order to obtain an injunction. Significant damages can flow if you get it wrong, if the injunction is subsequently lifted and there is economic loss to the party that had the injunction lifted against them. But if there is a strong case, if the regulator thinks it is appropriate—or, indeed, any other person who may have an interest in this or who has a concern about an activity that appears, on the face of it, to be a strong prima facie case that there is going to be an offence against the act or the regulations—then there can be action taken. These circumstances also apply where a person has refused or failed or is refusing or failing to do a thing and that thing would be a breach of the act or regulations or a contravention of the civil penalty provision.


In essence, this amendment allows the regulator or a third party to take action where a civil penalty provision has been contravened or there has been a breach of regulations of the act. If we look at other regulatory regimes such as the ACCC with our competition consumer law, the ACCC does have the power to seek an injunction. As I understand it, ASIC has the power to seek an injunction. Why shouldn't the Clean Energy Regulator, at the very least, have the power to seek an injunction? This is not whether you agree or disagree with what is being proposed on biomass. Under the rules that are being proposed that are likely to pass tonight, if there is a likely breach of those rules, what is wrong with giving the Clean Energy Regulator, or indeed any other person, the right to pursue an injunction, to pursue a remedy? To me, this is a fundamental issue of the rule of law. To emasculate the Clean Energy Regulator, to prevent community groups, individuals or indeed any person to seek an injunction is, to me, quite inadequate. 


If all the Clean Energy Regulator can do after the event, when it appears as though there could well have been a serious breach, under the rules proposed by the government if there has been a serious breach the only remedy is to suspend the issuing of the renewable energy certificates. I do not think that is an appropriate remedy and I think this is a fundamental issue in respect of ensuring that the legislation will be enforced. It is another layer of protection if a state regulator—if a state EPA, for instance—does not do so. That is why I would urge my colleagues to seriously consider this amendment.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-23,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:38):  As with Senator Wong before, I thank Senator Xenophon for the amendment. The government appreciates the intent behind the amendment but does not agree with it. The RET already has a robust enforcement framework with a very wide range of tools for the Clean Energy Regulator to bring entities into compliance with the act and regulations. There are robust market entry criteria, including the fit-and-proper person test. There are powers to suspend registration of participants. There are powers to have enforceable undertakings made. There are civil and criminal penalties.


The framework already includes an injunction power in the form proposed both for the Clean Energy Regulator and another person aggrieved by conduct in breach of the act to enable the Federal Court to grant injunctions, either restraining a person from committing an offence against the RET act or contravening a civil penalty provision, and requiring a person who refuses or fails to do something required by a civil or criminal offence provision of the act or regulations to do whatever they were required to do.


This amendment would expand the range of persons who can seek these injunctions under section 154S to include any person not just aggrieved persons. The term 'aggrieved persons' is not defined by the act. It is used in a range of contexts in legislation. Its purpose is to provide a filter. It is meant to require that someone who brings an action has a grievance beyond that experienced by an ordinary member of the public. I am advised that it is also interpreted rather broadly by the courts. 


Generally speaking, this standing requirement is designed to ensure that people seeking injunctions have some connection with the conduct complained of. For example, in relation to administrative law, it concerns people affected by a decision. In the context of the RET, it would include people affected by the conduct alleged to be or likely to be in contravention of the renewable energy act.


The amendment's purpose would be to enable anyone to take action. It would require the courts to consider the standing of people bringing actions. The obligations currently in the renewable energy act and regulations have not been designed with the idea of enforcement by unrelated third parties in mind. It would also mean that people with no connection with the conduct could take action. It could encourage speculative, strategic or mischievous litigation by people with no connection with or who are not affected by a renewable energy project. This change could add regulatory risk to renewable energy projects and ultimately increase the cost of the RET to consumers.


I would also point out to Senator Xenophon that obviously we have had some discussion tonight in relation to the undertakings that Minister Hunt has made with some of the crossbench colleagues. These include establishing a wind farm commissioner, who would be able to help communities to resolve complaints and deal with certain issues and work with relevant state authorities where complaints need to be addressed, which I suspect would provide further assistance in relation to all the existing protections with regard to some of the issues or incidences that you are probably seeking to target through this amendment.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (22:42):  I rise to support this amendment. This amendment effectively would allow public interest enforcement of our laws, which is a principle the Greens and, prior to tonight, this parliament have championed for about 30 years. Given that we have these spurious rules around native forest logging that depend on interpretations of high value, that depend on interpretations of primary purpose and that depend on compliance with RFAs, all of which are very subject to debate, it is crucial that we allow members of the public to apply those tests and hold the government to account in applying those tests. The existing drafting merely allows aggrieved persons to take action. That is an affront to open standing, as I say, a principle I thought we had fought for for 30 years—certainly the Greens have. 


In relation to your contention that there would be frivolous litigation, it is the Federal Court which is a cost jurisdiction. No-one in their right mind takes on that level of risk, as the last 30 years of court transcripts will show. There are no flood gates. There are very rarely frivolous actions taken, certainly not in the public interest to protect the environment. People have better things to do with their time and money, like protect the environment. We will be supporting this amendment and look forward to its passing.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:43):  I draw Senator Xenophon's attention to section 154S and division 2 of the act headed 'Injunctions', which provides for certain powers for the regulator and indeed for other aggrieved persons. It is defined as, 'On the application of the regulator or any other aggrieved person, the Federal Court may grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in certain conduct or requiring the person to undertake certain action.' As I outlined before, there are clear provisions there for the regulator to seek injunctions or aggrieved persons to seek injunctions. Certainly, the government believes that these provisions are appropriate and sufficient at this time, and that there are risks with broadening that definition in the manner in which your amendments would do.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (22:45):  I am digging up that section of the act now. My understanding is that in the circumstances that are prescribed in this amendment—for instance, if there were about to be logging of a particular coupe and there was a concern that, under the rules set by this parliament, there would be a breach, can there be an injunction in the circumstances anticipated by this particular amendment? My understanding is that that section 154—subsections (1) and (2)—does not allow for that. Could the minister clarify that?

(b) a contravention of a civil penalty provision;


the Federal Court may, on the application of the Regulator or any other aggrieved person, grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in the conduct.


So, if it were the belief of a party that a logging activity were in some way going to be in breach of the regulations, then either the regulator or an aggrieved person—which, as I identified before, I understand is interpreted relatively widely by the courts—would be able to seek an injunction against an activity that they believe to be in breach of the regulations or the act.

Usually it means a direct proprietary or financial interest, which I am sure a forest logging campaigner would not have. This amendment would ensure that, for example, those who are trying to protect forests would have the ability to enforce the rules that you have been assuring us all night are going to mean that native forest logging is going to be just fine. If you are so confident in that assertion, then let people enforce those rules. Given that you also say, 'Leave it to the regulator,' because unfortunately you seem to believe there is a good track record of enforcing environmental law, where the Auditor-General says there is not, my question for you is: how many enforcement officers does the Clean Energy Regulator have?

Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Through you, Chair, I hear the interjections, and I know that there is virtually no area where the Australian Greens would not like to see more public servants in place. But, ultimately, it is about providing effective regulation, and the Clean Energy Regulator does provide effective regulation. The capacity is there, Senator Waters, for a party who may not believe they have standing before the court to petition the Clean Energy Regulator to seek an injunction to bring the matter forward in many other ways that would likely see such action taken, if indeed there were potentially going to be a breach of the regulations or the act.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (22:49):  I do not think it is at all fair for the minister to characterise Senator Waters' statements as having low regard for the regulator. She did not say that at all. What she said was that there is a distinct lack of resources on the part of the regulator, and that the regulator cannot be everywhere at all times. It is just a resources issue. I will stand corrected, and I am embarrassed that I have to do this, but I think it is fair to say that the regulator does have the power to seek an injunction. It is the question in this amendment to broaden it to allow someone other than an aggrieved person, as narrowly defined in the case law, to seek an injunction. I apologise for that—I think that puts it in context—and I want to correct that and put it on the record. It is just that this amendment was rolled up with the existing provisions but expanded it, hence the confusion on my part. I want to clear that up and to be accurate in respect of that.


Really, the nub of this amendment is: do you restrict this to the regulator or a narrowly-defined group of persons with a direct commercial interest? Or if a citizen believes that the law is about to be broken then they take the very serious step of seeking an injunction with undertaking as to damages, which can be very, very significant, as well as being hit with a massive costs order, because justice is not cheap in this country. We have a legal system, not a justice system. So there are very significant disincentives. There will not be floodgates of litigation opened, but this enshrines the principle that if, as a citizen, you believe there is going to be a breach of the law, you should be able to enforce it. This would also cut to the issue of any breaches with respect to wind turbines. So it cuts both ways—it is not just about waste, about biomass, but it would also go to the issue of wind farms. So if a citizen believes that there has been a breach, they make an undertaking against the damages—and I would imagine in wind turbines it would be a very significant undertaking against the damages—and if they are sure of their case, then they should not be constrained from taking a case on. I cannot take it any higher than that. But, to me, there is an important principle here of the power of the individual to bring a matter to court to ensure that the law is enforced.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:52):  To address, at least in part, Senator Waters's question before, I understand there are 330 staff employed by the Clean Energy Regulator. If Senator Waters wants to know the exact breakdown of the roles of those staff, that is something that can be pursued at estimates or elsewhere. But it is a significant statutory body, with a significant resource allocation, able to ensure that it undertakes its functions and upholds the act and regulations that it is charged to uphold.


In relation to Senator Xenophon's points, I suspect we will have to agree to disagree this evening. The government does not believe that, in the context of this legislation, it would be appropriate to open it up for any person or any party who did not necessarily have some connection or some grievance beyond that of an ordinary member of the public to pursue injunctions in this regard. We have a well-funded, well-staffed, well-resourced, well-intentioned and well-legislated regulator in place that is able to take that action. Of course, aggrieved persons are also able to take that action. We think that is the appropriate balance to ensure that, if there a risk of the law being broken or if the law is being broken or has been broken, appropriate action is taken by the appropriate parties.

   Omit ""used solely"", substitute ""used predominantly"".




54 After subsection 31(2)



   Insert:


   (2A) For the purposes of subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), electricity that is transmitted or distributed is used predominantly for the transmission or distribution of electricity if:


      (a) the primary purpose of generating the electricity is for the use of the end user who generated the electricity; and


      (b) an amount of that electricity, no greater than the threshold amount determined under subsection (2B), is made available for use in relation to one or more services in the public interest.


   (2B) For the purposes of paragraph (2A)(b), the Minister must, by legislative instrument, determine a threshold amount of electricity which can be made available for use in relation to one or more services in the public interest.


   (2C) The Minister must:


      (a) make a determination under subsection (2B) within 3 months of the commencement of this subsection; and


      (b) as far as is practicable, ensure that a determination under that subsection is in force at all times after that determination comes into force.


I am concerned that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015 does not include provisions to overcome a potentially serious flaw in the RET legislation. The problem arises due to the consequences of incidental uses of electricity under the existing legislation, and has potentially serious impacts in my home state of Western Australia. And I note that comments made by shadow minister Gray in the House debate also asked the government to address this matter.


The issue arises because the concessions available to self-generators of electricity from RET liability only apply where such self-generated electricity is used solely by that person. That said, the law must make provisions for the situation where a small amount of electricity is used by third parties to provide vital community services. The Alcoa facilities in Western Australia provide this incidental power for police communication services, telephone services and for the local government. It is ludicrous that Alcoa should face a substantial penalty for making the electricity available to enable these public services.


The Warburton review also recommended that the issue be addressed. It said:


… the Panel recommends that self-generators should be permitted to supply incidental amounts of electricity to third parties for community services on an otherwise dedicated line while still being eligible for the exemption.


My amendment simply asks the minister that within three months, by a legislative instrument, he must determine a threshold amount of electricity that can be made available for use in relation to one or more services in the public interest.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:31):  I thank Senator Wang. The government appreciate the intent of Senator Wang's amendment, but we do not agree with the amendment. We believe that implementing full exemptions for emissions-intensive trade-exposed entities addresses, through alternative means, most of the concerns raised about the self-generator provisions and that there is a risk the amendment could lead to some unintended consequences for some businesses. It is the government's view that the entities that generate and use their own electricity can seek exemption from RET liability under strict eligibility conditions to target genuine self-generation. To be exempted, electricity must currently be used within one kilometre of the point of generation or supplied via a dedicated line. The proposed amendment seeks to extend these exemptions by diluting the dedicated line test to allow third parties to be supplied under certain circumstances without voiding the self-generation exemption.


The issue this amendment attempts to deal with tends to be confined to large development projects on remote grids where the self-generator is undertaking an ET activity. Increasing the partial exemptions under the scheme for ET activities to a 100 per cent exemption, as proposed in the government's bill, will provide significant additional relief to these ET businesses. Expanding the self-generator exemption provides little additional benefit to the businesses.

While it does have some merit to it, this is really neither the time nor the place to throw new and undebated changes into the RET as it currently has been negotiated and agreed upon. I do take on board the contribution he has made with his amendment, specifically in relation to the self-generator exemption arrangements, but at this point in time, with what we are debating right now, the opposition will not be supporting the amendment.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (22:34):  I move amendment (1) standing in my name on sheet 7728:


(1) Schedule 1, page 15 (after line 2), at the end of the Schedule, add:



Part


5—Injunctions





Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000





53


Subsections


154S(1), (2) and (3)



   Repeal the subsections, substitute:


(1) If a person (the first person) has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any conduct that is or would be:


   (a) an offence against this Act or the regulations; or


   (b) a contravention of a civil penalty provision;


the Federal Court may, on the application of the Regulator or any other person, grant an injunction restraining the first person from engaging in the conduct.


(2) If:


   (a) a person (the first person) has refused or failed, is refusing or failing, or is about to refuse or fail, to do a thing; and


   (b) the refusal or failure is, or would be:


      (i) an offence against this Act or the regulations; or


      (ii) a contravention of a civil penalty provision;


the Federal Court may, on the application of the Regulator or any other person, grant an injunction requiring the first person to do the thing.


(3) The power of the Federal Court to grant an injunction may be exercised:


   (a) whether or not it appears to the Court that the first person intends to engage, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind; and


   (b) whether or not the first person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind.


The aim of this amendment is to allow the Clean Energy Regulator or any other person to seek an injunction in certain circumstances—that is, if the person, and that includes the Clean Energy Regulator, believes that someone is about to engage in or is engaging in any conduct that would be an offence against this act or the regulations or a contravention of the civil penalty provisions. It allows an application to be made to the Federal Court, on the application of the regulator or any other person, to grant an injunction restraining the first person from engaging in the conduct.


The purpose of this is to ensure that the regulator has that injunctive power to seek an injunction, and, indeed, any other persons, in the event that it appears that a breach is about to be committed. In order to seek an injunction, you need to be able to give an undertaking as to damages. This is not something that will be used lightly. Giving an undertaking as to damages is a very serious undertaking in order to obtain an injunction. Significant damages can flow if you get it wrong, if the injunction is subsequently lifted and there is economic loss to the party that had the injunction lifted against them. But if there is a strong case, if the regulator thinks it is appropriate—or, indeed, any other person who may have an interest in this or who has a concern about an activity that appears, on the face of it, to be a strong prima facie case that there is going to be an offence against the act or the regulations—then there can be action taken. These circumstances also apply where a person has refused or failed or is refusing or failing to do a thing and that thing would be a breach of the act or regulations or a contravention of the civil penalty provision.


In essence, this amendment allows the regulator or a third party to take action where a civil penalty provision has been contravened or there has been a breach of regulations of the act. If we look at other regulatory regimes such as the ACCC with our competition consumer law, the ACCC does have the power to seek an injunction. As I understand it, ASIC has the power to seek an injunction. Why shouldn't the Clean Energy Regulator, at the very least, have the power to seek an injunction? This is not whether you agree or disagree with what is being proposed on biomass. Under the rules that are being proposed that are likely to pass tonight, if there is a likely breach of those rules, what is wrong with giving the Clean Energy Regulator, or indeed any other person, the right to pursue an injunction, to pursue a remedy? To me, this is a fundamental issue of the rule of law. To emasculate the Clean Energy Regulator, to prevent community groups, individuals or indeed any person to seek an injunction is, to me, quite inadequate. 


If all the Clean Energy Regulator can do after the event, when it appears as though there could well have been a serious breach, under the rules proposed by the government if there has been a serious breach the only remedy is to suspend the issuing of the renewable energy certificates. I do not think that is an appropriate remedy and I think this is a fundamental issue in respect of ensuring that the legislation will be enforced. It is another layer of protection if a state regulator—if a state EPA, for instance—does not do so. That is why I would urge my colleagues to seriously consider this amendment.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-23,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:38):  As with Senator Wong before, I thank Senator Xenophon for the amendment. The government appreciates the intent behind the amendment but does not agree with it. The RET already has a robust enforcement framework with a very wide range of tools for the Clean Energy Regulator to bring entities into compliance with the act and regulations. There are robust market entry criteria, including the fit-and-proper person test. There are powers to suspend registration of participants. There are powers to have enforceable undertakings made. There are civil and criminal penalties.


The framework already includes an injunction power in the form proposed both for the Clean Energy Regulator and another person aggrieved by conduct in breach of the act to enable the Federal Court to grant injunctions, either restraining a person from committing an offence against the RET act or contravening a civil penalty provision, and requiring a person who refuses or fails to do something required by a civil or criminal offence provision of the act or regulations to do whatever they were required to do.


This amendment would expand the range of persons who can seek these injunctions under section 154S to include any person not just aggrieved persons. The term 'aggrieved persons' is not defined by the act. It is used in a range of contexts in legislation. Its purpose is to provide a filter. It is meant to require that someone who brings an action has a grievance beyond that experienced by an ordinary member of the public. I am advised that it is also interpreted rather broadly by the courts. 


Generally speaking, this standing requirement is designed to ensure that people seeking injunctions have some connection with the conduct complained of. For example, in relation to administrative law, it concerns people affected by a decision. In the context of the RET, it would include people affected by the conduct alleged to be or likely to be in contravention of the renewable energy act.


The amendment's purpose would be to enable anyone to take action. It would require the courts to consider the standing of people bringing actions. The obligations currently in the renewable energy act and regulations have not been designed with the idea of enforcement by unrelated third parties in mind. It would also mean that people with no connection with the conduct could take action. It could encourage speculative, strategic or mischievous litigation by people with no connection with or who are not affected by a renewable energy project. This change could add regulatory risk to renewable energy projects and ultimately increase the cost of the RET to consumers.


I would also point out to Senator Xenophon that obviously we have had some discussion tonight in relation to the undertakings that Minister Hunt has made with some of the crossbench colleagues. These include establishing a wind farm commissioner, who would be able to help communities to resolve complaints and deal with certain issues and work with relevant state authorities where complaints need to be addressed, which I suspect would provide further assistance in relation to all the existing protections with regard to some of the issues or incidences that you are probably seeking to target through this amendment.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (22:42):  I rise to support this amendment. This amendment effectively would allow public interest enforcement of our laws, which is a principle the Greens and, prior to tonight, this parliament have championed for about 30 years. Given that we have these spurious rules around native forest logging that depend on interpretations of high value, that depend on interpretations of primary purpose and that depend on compliance with RFAs, all of which are very subject to debate, it is crucial that we allow members of the public to apply those tests and hold the government to account in applying those tests. The existing drafting merely allows aggrieved persons to take action. That is an affront to open standing, as I say, a principle I thought we had fought for for 30 years—certainly the Greens have. 


In relation to your contention that there would be frivolous litigation, it is the Federal Court which is a cost jurisdiction. No-one in their right mind takes on that level of risk, as the last 30 years of court transcripts will show. There are no flood gates. There are very rarely frivolous actions taken, certainly not in the public interest to protect the environment. People have better things to do with their time and money, like protect the environment. We will be supporting this amendment and look forward to its passing.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:43):  I draw Senator Xenophon's attention to section 154S and division 2 of the act headed 'Injunctions', which provides for certain powers for the regulator and indeed for other aggrieved persons. It is defined as, 'On the application of the regulator or any other aggrieved person, the Federal Court may grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in certain conduct or requiring the person to undertake certain action.' As I outlined before, there are clear provisions there for the regulator to seek injunctions or aggrieved persons to seek injunctions. Certainly, the government believes that these provisions are appropriate and sufficient at this time, and that there are risks with broadening that definition in the manner in which your amendments would do.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (22:45):  I am digging up that section of the act now. My understanding is that in the circumstances that are prescribed in this amendment—for instance, if there were about to be logging of a particular coupe and there was a concern that, under the rules set by this parliament, there would be a breach, can there be an injunction in the circumstances anticipated by this particular amendment? My understanding is that that section 154—subsections (1) and (2)—does not allow for that. Could the minister clarify that?

Senator BIRMINGHAM

(1) If a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any conduct that is or would be:


(a) an offence against this Act or the regulations; or


(b) a contravention of a civil penalty provision;


the Federal Court may, on the application of the Regulator or any other aggrieved person, grant an injunction restraining the person from engaging in the conduct.


So, if it were the belief of a party that a logging activity were in some way going to be in breach of the regulations, then either the regulator or an aggrieved person—which, as I identified before, I understand is interpreted relatively widely by the courts—would be able to seek an injunction against an activity that they believe to be in breach of the regulations or the act.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (22:47):  Minister, I beg to differ on your interpretation of what the courts have found 'aggrieved' to mean. Usually it means a direct proprietary or financial interest, which I am sure a forest logging campaigner would not have. This amendment would ensure that, for example, those who are trying to protect forests would have the ability to enforce the rules that you have been assuring us all night are going to mean that native forest logging is going to be just fine. If you are so confident in that assertion, then let people enforce those rules. Given that you also say, 'Leave it to the regulator,' because unfortunately you seem to believe there is a good track record of enforcing environmental law, where the Auditor-General says there is not, my question for you is: how many enforcement officers does the Clean Energy Regulator have?

Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Through you, Chair, I hear the interjections, and I know that there is virtually no area where the Australian Greens would not like to see more public servants in place. But, ultimately, it is about providing effective regulation, and the Clean Energy Regulator does provide effective regulation. The capacity is there, Senator Waters, for a party who may not believe they have standing before the court to petition the Clean Energy Regulator to seek an injunction to bring the matter forward in many other ways that would likely see such action taken, if indeed there were potentially going to be a breach of the regulations or the act.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (22:49):  I do not think it is at all fair for the minister to characterise Senator Waters' statements as having low regard for the regulator. She did not say that at all. What she said was that there is a distinct lack of resources on the part of the regulator, and that the regulator cannot be everywhere at all times. It is just a resources issue. I will stand corrected, and I am embarrassed that I have to do this, but I think it is fair to say that the regulator does have the power to seek an injunction. It is the question in this amendment to broaden it to allow someone other than an aggrieved person, as narrowly defined in the case law, to seek an injunction. I apologise for that—I think that puts it in context—and I want to correct that and put it on the record. It is just that this amendment was rolled up with the existing provisions but expanded it, hence the confusion on my part. I want to clear that up and to be accurate in respect of that.


Really, the nub of this amendment is: do you restrict this to the regulator or a narrowly-defined group of persons with a direct commercial interest? Or if a citizen believes that the law is about to be broken then they take the very serious step of seeking an injunction with undertaking as to damages, which can be very, very significant, as well as being hit with a massive costs order, because justice is not cheap in this country. We have a legal system, not a justice system. So there are very significant disincentives. There will not be floodgates of litigation opened, but this enshrines the principle that if, as a citizen, you believe there is going to be a breach of the law, you should be able to enforce it. This would also cut to the issue of any breaches with respect to wind turbines. So it cuts both ways—it is not just about waste, about biomass, but it would also go to the issue of wind farms. So if a citizen believes that there has been a breach, they make an undertaking against the damages—and I would imagine in wind turbines it would be a very significant undertaking against the damages—and if they are sure of their case, then they should not be constrained from taking a case on. I cannot take it any higher than that. But, to me, there is an important principle here of the power of the individual to bring a matter to court to ensure that the law is enforced.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (22:52):  To address, at least in part, Senator Waters's question before, I understand there are 330 staff employed by the Clean Energy Regulator. If Senator Waters wants to know the exact breakdown of the roles of those staff, that is something that can be pursued at estimates or elsewhere. But it is a significant statutory body, with a significant resource allocation, able to ensure that it undertakes its functions and upholds the act and regulations that it is charged to uphold.


In relation to Senator Xenophon's points, I suspect we will have to agree to disagree this evening. The government does not believe that, in the context of this legislation, it would be appropriate to open it up for any person or any party who did not necessarily have some connection or some grievance beyond that of an ordinary member of the public to pursue injunctions in this regard. We have a well-funded, well-staffed, well-resourced, well-intentioned and well-legislated regulator in place that is able to take that action. Of course, aggrieved persons are also able to take that action. We think that is the appropriate balance to ensure that, if there a risk of the law being broken or if the law is being broken or has been broken, appropriate action is taken by the appropriate parties.

"Bullock, Sen Joesph",ALP,2015-06-23,"



Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (23:06):  Tonight, I rise to speak about an issue that resonates right across my home state of Western Australia. Once again, the Liberal government has neglected our community and failed to build the infrastructure that we need for the future. In this, they are perhaps following in the footsteps of history. Western Australia only agreed to join the Federation if the Commonwealth constructed a railway line to connect us to the eastern states. When the train arrived 70 years late, WA picked up most of the cost.


More recently, Canberra—under a federal Liberal government and with the acquiescence of state Liberals—devised a GST formula that now sees my state lose 63c in every dollar. Perhaps it is with an eye to tradition that the current federal Liberal government has decided to shaft Western Australians on the provision of the infrastructure that is integral to our future prosperity: the National Broadband Network. I appreciate tradition, but not all traditions are worth preserving. The tradition of Canberra ignoring the concerns of Western Australians is one we can do without.


To give one example, my office conducted a survey in the seat of Cowan in Perth's northern suburbs. From just three suburbs—Landsdale, Madeley and Darch—over 500 households contacted me to say that their internet service was substandard. This is revealing, because until the current federal Liberal government came to power, these three suburbs were on the list to have the NBN rolled out. More than 14,000 homes and businesses in this area were slated to get the superfast, fibre-to-the-premises NBN by the end of June 2016 under the former Labor government. However, the residents in these areas were cruelly ripped off the map by Minister Turnbull and the latest version of the NBN rollout plan sent to internet service providers shows that construction will not even commence in the suburbs until the third quarter of 2016 at the earliest. Rubbing salt into the wound, these residents and businesses will miss out on the real NBN and will instead have to rely on a second-rate, old copper system.


Last fortnight, it was my pleasure to host a community meeting of residents of Landsdale, Madeley and Darch. We had a big turn out, despite the rain. Labor's communications spokesman, Jason Clare, gave a fantastic presentation of the NBN, took questions from residents and committed to fixing the Liberal mess. Local councillors from the City of Wanneroo, Hugh Nguyen and Domenic Zappa, organised the meeting and have been superb in taking up residents' concerns. It was a great night. Local Liberal member Luke Simpkins even sent someone to keep an eye on us! He was not able to attend himself, of course. He was on a taxpayer funded trip overseas at the time.


Regrettably, apart from keeping an eye on our meeting, Mr Simpkins has not shown any previous interest in the issue on behalf the electorate. In fact, a Hansard search reveals that from day 1 of the Liberal government in 2013 right up to our forum on 11 June 2015 not a single mention was made by Mr Simpkins of the NBN nor was there any mention by Mr Simpkins of internet access for his Cowan constituents. His conscience may have pricked him last week when he jumped up in the other place to regale the chamber with tales of his apparent work on the issue of internet connectivity and high-speed broadband. He claimed:


For six years our opponents talked about the NBN and did not deliver for Cowan. 


But then, two sentences later, he said:


Already nearly 10,000 premises in Cowan have been listed on NBN's national rollout plan, which serves as a good starting point for more work to be done. 


Mr Simpkins might be trying to fool himself about who was responsible for delivering the NBN to Cowan and yes, the rollout has been underway for some time now, but he cannot fool the people of Cowan. 


Perhaps Mr Simpkins thinks that many of his constituents will not google the truth about the NBN rollout in Cowan. After all, they do not have decent internet access. The government's own myBroadband website shows that large areas of Cowan are rated E for overall fixed broadband internet quality. That is not E for excellent but the lowest possible rating.


The government has promised to prioritise the connection of the NBN in areas currently experiencing the worst internet quality. Tonight I call on the government to honour its promise to the residents of Landsdale, Madeley and Darch. Quality, affordable internet access is no longer a luxury but a necessity. In the 21st century, families, businesses and schools need the NBN to create opportunity and to participate in the new economy. My staff constantly comment on my lack of technological familiarity. Anyone who knows me will attest that I am not exactly at the cutting edge of telecommunications. So if I can understand why this is important, why can't the Liberal government?
