Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:31):  Mr President, I object to that, and I seek leave to make a 30-second statement to indicate why.


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr President. I have been advised of this meeting. Three of my colleagues from Queensland who have been regular participants in the meeting have not yet received the draft report and have not been advised of meetings in recent times. For that reason, I object.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, the question is: would you like the motion to be put? Any senator can request for the motion to be put.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I would ask for that, Mr President. That is the procedure?



The PRESIDENT:  Yes. Every senator has the right to have these motions put. This is just an automatic consideration of the extension of the right for any senator to have the motion put. The question is that the select committee, as the Clerk indicated, be authorised to meet during the sitting of the Senate today.

 (Queensland) (09:32):  Clearly, we are in support of this motion, but as we are waiting for the newly-appointed Senator Gallagher to come in could we defer the actual division until after that occurs?



The PRESIDENT:  I am at the will of the Senate: is the Senate happy for this division to be deferred? Yes? We will consider this matter immediately after the swearing-in of the new senator.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  It suits the Labor Party.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (09:45):  I seek leave to make a one-minute statement.


Leave granted.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  There has been much said recently in this place about continued abuses of processes, and that motion just gave effect, I think, to a departure from what have been reasonable standards here concerning the conduct of these committees.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Let me finish. It is uncomfortable listening, because you have just given effect to it.



The PRESIDENT:  To the chair, Senator O'Sullivan.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Mr President, we have had a situation where many of us stakeholders from my state have attended and participated in this committee process, and yet we are excluded from notification about the potential of this meeting. We have not seen the draft report, which is a courtesy normally extended to those who have shown interest in a matter and participated, and now we have had a motion by this place to give force to that—a motion that cannot give effect. The time had expired before the motion gave effect, and so I think we should— (Time expired)




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, on a point of order, we did give leave for Senator O'Sullivan's statement and we allowed it to continue, but I do believe that was a reflection on a decision of this chamber.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, it has to be an unparliamentary or adverse reflection upon a decision of the Senate.




Senator Conroy:
  What was it? That had to be an adverse reflection.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, I am not going to argue with you from the chair, and I do not believe there is a point of order from Senator Moore.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, on the same point of order, perhaps you could reflect on the Hansard to consider whether or not it was in fact adverse.



The PRESIDENT:  I do not need to do that, Senator Wong, and I did consult with the Clerk also during Senator O'Sullivan's speech, and I am satisfied that it was not out of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I raise a point of order. The motion that has just been passed was concluded after the time scheduled for the meeting that it related to. I am the one government-voting member on that committee. I have received notice of the meeting; my colleagues have not. But I am still here in the chamber as the meeting allegedly is happening. But the meeting could not happen—that is my point of order—because, at the time the meeting should have commenced, everyone was in this chamber dealing with a motion before the chair. I make the point, Mr President, that if you do not agree with me on this matter then, by the time I get there, the meeting will probably be concluded, and that will be typical of the farcical nature of this committee from day one.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I will take that as more of a point of clarification as well as a point of order.

Senator LEYONHJELM

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (09:51):  We indicated our support last night. I am also foreshadowing that we will drop a very similar amendment the Australian Greens drafted when we get to it. I am happy to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments.



The CHAIRMAN:  We are in continuation from last night so I want to give everybody an opportunity to catch up to where we are. Are there any other speakers on these amendments? The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (09:58):  I foreshadowed this amendment last night. In a way, the amendment of Senator Leyonhjelm that we just voted on really was our fallback. This is probably the most important amendment that the Australian Greens will move during this debate. It is colloquially known as the get-a-warrant amendment. We strongly believe that in 1979, when this act was passed into law, if we had had the multitude of devices, data types and platforms that we have today, the drafters who were considering the substantial overall of telecommunications interception legislation as they were in 1979 would have looked around the field and said, 'You can tap people's phone, you can read people's email, you can track their movements around the landscape, you can map their social networks and you can find everything about their lives. These things will all be covered by a warrant and what will not be covered by a warrant is simple subscriber data so that agencies can very rapidly establish who owns the handset, who holds a particular prescription for a particular service.'


And so we would have ended up with the same two-tiered system that we have today, but those invasive forms of data access—whether they be tapping the phone call or reading your location as you move around the place—would have been within the warranted regime. I have no doubt about that at all. What we have seen, quite frankly, is the failure of the law to keep up with the march of technology. We still have a fairly robust warranted regime. Last night, Senator Rhiannon pointed out some of its failings, and we are certainly aware of those. We have a robust warranted regime and I think the number is about 4,700. We do not know how many ASIO applies for because that is done through a different process, but the entire law enforcement and anticorruption community around the country has about 4,700 warrants a year.


But, as I have said more times than I care to remember, there are 750-odd thousand applications for warrantless access to people's private information, and that is just because these categories of material basically did not exist in 1979. So while intelligence and policing agencies have been very keen to run the argument that the TIA Act needs continual incremental change to keep up with the march of technology, privacy protections have not. That is one of the reasons why opposition to the data retention regime has been so strong; it effectively forces carriers to entrench and embed a broken access system that henceforth will have access to vast new quantities of material.


This is not a view that the Greens are alone in putting forward. It is shared by people as widely separated across the political spectrum as the Institute of Public Affairs—good friends of Senator Brandis—the Law Council of Australia, the telecommunications sector, digital rights organisations like Electronic Frontiers Australia and also Bret Walker SC, who is the former National Security Legislation Monitor. Now, lest anybody fear that I am verballing him, Mr Walker believes that there should be a data retention regime in Australia. But he also believes that it should be circumscribed and that these long-overdue protections of getting a warrant are added. This is what Mr Walker said on 7 August of last year:


It seems to me a warrant is a traditional way by which we say drastic powers ought to be exercised so as to breach what would be otherwise be ordinary personal privacy only when somebody outside the agency, usually a judge or a magistrate, is satisfied that sufficient cause is shown to justify that reversal of what we expect.


This was in an interview that he did with Lateline last year. He goes on:


And if we don't have a warrant system, we don't have that independent umpire to check in the usual way of warrants, making a very formal record, which can be produced later in a court if there's litigation about it. If we don't have that, I fear that there will be an understandable suspicion, hostility, about the operation of agencies, which I stress, we need to be doing a good job.


There is not a word of that with which I disagree, and I think that most right-thinking people would agree with Mr Walker, who has many years of experience in weighing up the checks and balances. And, as I said, he is a proponent of mandatory data retention. Obviously, we part company on that issue, but it is his view that if the government forces a scheme such as this into existence then for the obvious reasons that I have described today—and for years, actually—we need to bring these huge categories of material into the warranted regime.


The way that the amendment is drafted excludes subscriber data. The argument that is made frequently about those 750,000—or, if you believe the Attorney-General's annual report, the 340-odd thousand warrantless requests—is that the government says, 'Look, a lot of that is for subscriber data. We don't know how many of those requests are for basic subscriber data so we do not propose to drag that information into the warranted regime.' But—quite seriously—if two dozen agencies want to be able to know where you are at any time of the day, or where your mobile phone handset is, and if they want to be able to scrape your email records and work out your whole social graph and know who you are talking to at any given time, get a warrant, Senator Brandis—get a warrant! I commend this amendment to the chamber.

(1) After considering an application under section 180Q, the Part 4‑1 issuing authority must:


   (a) issue a data authorisation warrant that authorises the making of authorisations under one or more of sections 178, 178A and 180, or Division 4A, in relation to the particular person to which the application relates; or


   (b) refuse to issue a data authorisation warrant.


(2) The Part 4‑1 issuing authority must not issue a data authorisation warrant unless the Part 4‑1 issuing authority is satisfied that:


   (a) the warrant is reasonably necessary for whichever of the following purposes are applicable:


      (i) if the warrant would authorise the making of authorisations under section 178—for the enforcement of a serious contravention;


      (ii) if the warrant would authorise the making of authorisations under section 178A—finding a person who the Australian Federal Police, or a Police Force of a State, has been notified is missing;


      (iii) if the warrant would authorise the making of authorisations under section 180—the investigation of an offence of a kind referred to in subsection 180(4);


      (iv) if the warrant would authorise the making of authorisations under Division 4A—the investigation of a serious foreign contravention; and


   (b) the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting privacy, having regard to:


      (i) the extent to which the privacy of any person or persons would be likely to be interfered with by the disclosure of information or documents under authorisations that are likely to be made under the authority of the warrant; and


      (ii) the gravity of the matter in relation to which the warrant is sought; and


      (iii) the extent to which that information or those documents would be likely to assist in relation to that matter; and


      (iv) whether reasonable attempts have been made to obtain the information or documents by other means; and


      (v) any submissions made by a Public Interest Advocate under section 180X; and


      (vi) any other matters the Part 4‑1 issuing authority considers relevant.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:04):  The government opposes this amendment for a reason that, towards the end of his contribution, Senator Ludlam adverted to: the volume of warrantless requests, as reported in the most recent annual report of the Attorney-General's Department, as Senator Ludlam says, was 340,000. It is not suggested—I do not understand it to be suggested—that those requests were irregular or ought not to have been made. What they tell you is the weight and dependence of the police and the other investigative agencies which have access to metadata under the current arrangements, which are not subject of the regimes provided for by this bill.


Surely, Senator Ludlam and Senator Leyonhjelm, you must see as a matter of common sense that, if that is the demand by the authorities for access to metadata—340,000 a year—there is no practical possibility, none, that a warranted regime could work. None. The sheer volume of the need of the authorities to access metadata precludes the procedure for warrants.


Senator Ludlam, you have never had the obligation, as I do, to issue warrants. I have to issue warrants from time to time under the T(IA) Act and under the ASIO Act. Under those acts, the decision maker is required to be satisfied of certain matters, so the authorities seeking the warrant place a volume of material before me which I consider carefully and, on the basis of that consideration, I make my decision about whether or not to issue the warrant. It is a quasi-judicial act, and it takes quite a period of time. The practical impossibility of that process being undertaken carefully where there are, in the last reporting year, 340,000 access requests should be obvious to you. Contrary to what you say, Senator Ludlam, it is not uniformly the practice in Europe to require a warrant.




Senator Ludlam:
  Twelve countries.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Ludlam, I really wish you would stop interjecting. In this debate you have behaved yourself with a reasonable amount of courtesy and decorum, and I would urge you to continue to do so rather than continue to interject. It is the case in some jurisdictions. It is not the case in other European jurisdictions. I am advised that, according to the most recent report of the United Kingdom's Interception of Communications Commissioner, Sir Paul Kennedy, the only European countries that require any level of particularised consideration of whether access to metadata is proportionate are France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and those systems have an internal executive process of authorisation. Most European countries do not require warrants, though I acknowledge, Senator Ludlam, that some do.


The practical problem is not just a problem of volume. Access to metadata is, in relation to the kinds of investigations with which this bill is concerned—that is, serious investigations into things like terrorism, paedophilia, organised and transnational crime, and, if we include the economic regulators, things like cartel conduct, for example—the initial stage of an investigative process. So there becomes what you might call a chicken-and-egg question here. The authorities use access to metadata to establish certain elementary primary facts in order to determine whether or not there is something that requires investigation. 


No prosecution could ever proceed on metadata alone. Perhaps that is a point I should have made more often in the debate yesterday. No prosecution could ever possibly proceed on the basis of what was revealed by metadata alone. In the event that access to metadata reveals, for example, the existence of a network, then, in an appropriate case, the authorities can make an application under the TIA Act for a listening device, for example. That power has been in existence for as long as the TIA Act has been in existence—since 1969. In fact, if my memory serves me correctly, it was first introduced into Commonwealth law during the Attorney-Generalship of Sir Garfield Barwick—more than half a century ago. That is the point at which the law appropriately says, 'If you are going to have a listening device to access someone's telephone conversations or to access what is on their computer—if you place them under surveillance under the Surveillance Devices Act—that is the point at which you need a warrant, because that is an intrusive and invasive form of investigation.' But it has never been the judgement of this parliament that merely to establish, in a preliminary way, whether, for example, a particular connection was made between two telephone services is a level of intrusion that requires a warrant. 


Always we must bear this in mind, Senator Ludlam: there is an explicit prohibition in this legislation against accessing content—an explicit prohibition. To make assurance doubly sure, there is also an explicit provision that says a person's web-browsing history may never be the subject of the metadata retention regime. 


What this bill does is introduce new protections. There is nothing to stop access to metadata at the moment. There is nothing to control or govern or oversee the exercise of the power to access metadata at the moment. Under this bill there are limitations and oversight mechanisms introduced into the law for the first time. The number of agencies that can avail themselves of this power is reduced by more than three-quarters, from 85 at the moment to 21. This limits, in a way that is not part of the existing law, access to metadata. If the authorities want to go one step further and tap somebody's phone, access their computer or engage in other forms of intrusive investigative activity, they need a warrant—and they should. Nothing in this legislation changes that.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:13):  I indicate my support for the Greens amendment. The Attorney's main objection to this seems to be that it is inconvenient and impractical—on the basis of 340,000 warrants. The question of course arises as to whether or not 340,000 warrants is something we should accept as a reasonable state of affairs anyway. I find it exceedingly disturbing that we should have such a large number of existing intrusions by snoops into our private activities. Indeed, you could argue that instead of being the nanny state we are developing into the spying state. 


It is fairly obvious also that, with 21 agencies able to access metadata under the legislation proposed, there will be a need for fewer warrants. If, as the Attorney suggests, their access to metadata will be restricted to serious offences—although I point out that he declined to accept my amendment yesterday to ensure that that was the case—there would also be fewer warrants. The issue under the current regime with 340,000 accesses of existing metadata is that that does not include two years of history. It does not include the extent of the data that is currently accessed. It seems to me not at all unreasonable for a warrant system to apply to the fewer agencies going after serious offenders and more intrusive data.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:16):  Senator Leyonhjelm, can I correct you. It is not 340,000 warrants; it is 340,000 access authorisations. Let me explain to you how this works. Senator Leyonhjelm, you have been in this chamber for almost a year now. Senator Ludlam has been in the chamber for six years. I have never heard from you, Senator Leyonhjelm, and certainly not from Senator Ludlam an argument that the existing provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act are bad. But the authorisation for access to information or documents is contained in a provision of that act. It is in section 178. I understand that section 178 is an original provision of that act. It has been part of the act since 1979.


We discussed last night section 180F, which falls within the same part of the T(IA) Act. It requires, among other things, privacy considerations to be considered before an access application is made. I want to direct you in particular to section 186, which is the statutory basis of the obligation for there to be a public report on the number of access authorisations made in any given year. The most recent annual report which I have is for 2012-13. At page 47 and following of that report it tabulates the number of authorisations that were made in that year. I think that is where your figure of 340,000 probably comes from.


My point to you, Senator Leyonhjelm, is that it is not as if this is uncontrolled. The fact that there is a public reporting obligation for access applications should demonstrate to you that there is already a level of accountability, as there is through the various parliamentary and executive oversight mechanisms that are already in place. So we are not talking about 340,000 warrants; we are talking about 340,000 access applications which are the subject, transparently, of a public report each year.


I entirely share your sentiments about the need to be vigilant, Senator Leyonhjelm, against intrusions by the state. But that noble sentiment of yours has to be put in the context of what the agencies are asking to do. They are not asking for content. They are not asking for a winding back, degradation or attenuation of the existing warrant regime. The existing warrant regime, which does require a warrant if content is to be sought, remains as it is. The only effect of this bill that is relevant to your argument is to reduce from 85 to 21 the number of agencies that can make access applications.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:19):  Related to this amendment is a concern, which I think was touched on in questions to the Attorney in the last couple of days. It has been a long committee stage, and I am grateful for the Attorney's patience. I do not want to be otiose or prolix in relation to this, but there is a concern about when warrants can be issued. I appreciate that the RSPCA and the Victorian Taxi Directorate will no longer be able to access metadata, but the concern that has been expressed to me by some constituents this morning relates to alleged copyright violations. Can the Attorney assure us that the access of metadata under this regime will not be used to prosecute citizens who happen to have downloaded the latest episode of Breaking Bad. I do not know if it is still being shown. 





Senator XENOPHON:
  The Temporary Chairman says that it is no longer in the series. It shows you that my cultural references are not very good. Let's say whatever the latest television programs are that people want to download. 




Senator Ludlam:
  Or Game of Thrones.




Senator XENOPHON:

Game Of Thrones

is apparently a TV program. Can the Attorney assure us that access to metadata under this regime will not in any circumstances be used for the prosecution of citizens or, indeed, of others that may be downloading content that relates to breach of copyright? I am sorry about my lack of cultural reference. Thank you, Chair, for telling me that Breaking Bad is no longer in the series.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:21): I can give you that assurance, Senator, because what this bill is concerned with is the enforcement of the criminal law. If you look at the 21 agencies listed at section 110A, you will see that they are all crime or corruption investigative agencies. I do not want to be tedious, but I might read them into the record because not everybody appreciates the limitation on the number of agencies. It will only take me a moment. Under these reforms, the following agencies can access metadata: the Australian Federal Police, the police force of a state, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Customs and Boarder Protection Service, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Crime Commission, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Police Integrity Commission, the IBAC, the Crime and Corruption Commission of Queensland, the Corruption and Crime Commission, the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. These are different formulae in the different states, apparently. And then there is a power to declare other bodies but none have been declared, and that is subject to the limitations that we have already discussed. That is all. So we are dealing here with the enforcement of the criminal law. 


As you know, Senator Xenophon, breach of copyright is a civil wrong. Against that argument two things have been said. First of all, it has been said that there are criminal provisions in the Copyright Act but not in relation to breach of copyright—for example, internet piracy. We deal with that in other ways. Those are civil wrongs. There is no capacity under section 110A of this bill for anyone other than the agencies whose names I have read out to you to make an access application. 


The second argument that is used in relation to this issue is that, if there were a party to civil litigation—it does not matter what kind of civil litigation it might be, but for the purposes of this discussion we are talking about copyright—it might seek to subpoena or, by a process that you will remember, Senator Xenophon, known as third party discovery, to obtain the metadata and get at it in that way to make out its case in a civil action. That is dealt with, though, by the new section 281(2), which provides—I am paraphrasing here, but I will ask you to look at it for yourself—that, if a subpoena or a notice of disclosure is directed to a third party that retains metadata, and that metadata is retained or kept solely for the purpose of compliance with that act, then it may not be used in the civil litigation either. This is a compliance obligation. The primary obligation under this bill is a compliance obligation. The reason we are having this debate is that increasingly telecommunications service providers are not retaining metadata and, with the evolution of technology, the only reason they will be expected to retain metadata is to be compliant with the provisions of this act. If the only reason they are retaining metadata is compliance with the provisions of this act, they cannot be answerable in respect of that metadata to a subpoena or a notice for third party discovery in a civil action either, whether it be a breach of copyright claim or any other form of civil claim.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:26):  I am grateful to the Attorney for his answer, and I am well familiar with third party discovery, Anton Piller orders and pre-action discovery. Sadly, I still keep a practising certificate going so I can do my pro bono work, which always seems to cost me money. But I just go to this issue: the Australian government's Australian Institute of Criminology website has a publication—it is a few years old now, from back in November 2004—by Tony Krone where reference is made to the fact that, as the Attorney points out, the Copyright Act provides civil and criminal sanctions to protect copyright. My question is in respect of, for instance, section 132(1), as it then was, of the Copyright Act, where it was an offence to make, sell, trade or import an article that infringes copyright or to distribute an infringing item for the purpose of trade. Under section 132(2) of the Copyright Act, there were clearly criminal sanctions. Can the Attorney assure us that, in the course of a prosecution under those sections, citizens who may have downloaded the latest episode of Game of Thrones would not be drawn into a criminal investigation in respect of copyright? That is the nub of my question. In other words, where metadata can be used in copyright matters, can citizens' metadata be accessed?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:28):  That is not going to happen in relation to citizens, because in the example you have posited you are talking about citizens engaging in a download. That is something which the government yesterday introduced other legislation to deal with by way of the remedy of an injunction—a civil claim. So the example that you have posited is dealt with by the civil law. In particular, I invite you to inspect—no doubt we will be debating it in this chamber when we come back for the budget sittings—the government's copyright and online piracy reforms, which are modelled on the British copyright act and the copyright laws of other European jurisdictions. That is the way in which those matters will be dealt with. Breach of copyright, as I say, is primarily a civil wrong, and a civil action is not what this legislation is concerned with. There is this explicit prohibition, in the section to which I have directed your attention, on accessing metadata retained solely for the purpose of compliance with this act by way of a subpoena or a notice for third party discovery.

 (South Australia) (10:29):  I apologise if my questions have not been direct enough. I really want to conclude this line of questioning. Does the Attorney concede that there will be circumstances when, as part of, say, an investigation of a breach of copyright as a criminal offence under the Copyright Act—or perhaps in the seeking of an injunction under the proposed copyright regime that has yet to be debated in this parliament—in order to prove the case against those who are profiting from that breach of copyright, there will need to be access to the metadata of people who will not be charged with a criminal offence?

Those agencies include the state police departments and the Federal Police—that is true. But the way the examples you are positing are dealt with will be through civil actions. In particular, the very reason the government is introducing, based on English and other models, a new injunction power to protect intellectual rights is to make sure that these proceedings to protect copyrights are taken in the civil courts.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:31):  There are criminal offence provisions in the Copyright Act, but the purpose of those criminal offence provisions is not to deal with the examples you have given. You talked about, for example, somebody downloading copyrighted material—file sharing is the practice most commonly instanced. That is not the kind of commercial grade breach of copyright which the offence provisions of the Copyright Act are directed to. If that conduct were ever to be the subject of judicial proceedings, they could only ever be civil proceedings—to which this legislation does not apply. No civil litigant, other than through a notice for third party inspection or subpoena issued by the court, could have access to metadata in support of a proceeding like that. Because the obligation being observed by the service providers is an obligation which will now be solely an obligation in obedience to this act, the sole purpose test would, one would expect, be met in every case. So metadata could not be accessed in civil litigation in those circumstances either.

 (South Australia) (10:33):  Hopefully this is my final question on this matter. Can the Attorney not envisage circumstances where, as part of a criminal prosecution under the Copyright Act—particularly in relation to section 132, subsection 1, and section 132, subsection 2, where we are talking about that commercial grade where people are making money out of that breach of copyright and so it is clearly a criminal offence under the act—metadata may be sought from those who downloaded the material from the unauthorised provider, the copyright breaker, in order to build the case against the person being charged under section 132 of the act? If there is a concession to that effect—if the minister says that is the case—then I do not need to ask anything further on this.

There is no doubt that there are criminal offence provisions in the Copyright Act. Those criminal offence provisions are directed to what one might call large scale or commercial scale theft of intellectual property. They are not concerned with unlawful downloading, for example. They are not concerned with what ordinary citizens may perhaps be doing. That is dealt with through the civil law and it will be dealt with in particular by the industry code that is being developed under the auspices of my department and Mr Turnbull's department—and, in relation to offshore pirate sites, by the new injunction power that I just mentioned to you, which is the subject of a bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday.


This bill is about serious crime. It is about terrorism, organised and transnational crime and paedophilia. That is its entire purpose. That is the mischief that the authorities seek to deal with through this bill.

The law enforcement agencies deal with the entire corpus of the enforcement of the criminal law, that is true. But just as I said to Senator Leyonhjelm last night: we are not interested in using this complex system to enforce parking tickets, nor are we interested in using it to police intellectual property law, because there are other statutes—other mechanisms—to deal with it.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:48):  I move amendment (12) on sheet 7661:


(12) Schedule 1, item 5, page 28 (before line 32), before the definition of Defence Minister, insert:



   content, in relation to a communication, includes the following:


   (a) any speech, music or other sound that forms part of a telephone conversation;


   (b) the body of an email;


   (c) a short text message sent from one telecommunications device to another;


   (d) a website address;


      (e) any other user‑generated content.


This amendment is intended to provide a definition of 'content' in the legislation. The lack of a definition of content has caused a great deal of industry disquiet.


I have used two sources in developing this definition. One was comments by Malcolm Turnbull, when he was asked to draw a distinction between metadata and content. However, I have also paid attention to the lengthy enumeration of the kinds of information to be retained and now brought into the bill as a consequence of recommendations of the PJCIS. My hope is that, added together, this will ensure that the law enforcement agencies are always able to distinguish between the two—retained data and content.


As we have heard from the Attorney-General, content is not to be retained, and yet content is not defined. I want to fix that. I want to ensure that the agencies do not deliberately or inadvertently intrude on content simply because there is an absence of definition. Perhaps the definition of 'content' that I have put into my amendment could be improved, but once again my aim here is to improve what is a bad law, not perfect it.


So the purpose of the amendment: there is a definition of what data may be retained. There is a clause which says that, for the avoidance of doubt, content is not to be retained, but 'content' is not defined. The purpose of my amendment is to define 'content', to ensure that it is not retained.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:50):  Senator Leyonhjelm, this is a very laudable contribution, if I may say so, because your objective and the government's objective are the same, although obviously we approach the same objective in a different way. I am sorry to say, though, Senator Leyonhjelm, that in the government's view your proposed amendment would not have the effect that you wish it to have.


Your amendment, for a start, is an inclusive and therefore a non-exclusive definition, so it leaves the nature of content still as an open-ended category. That is the first point to be made about your amendment. Secondly, your amendment says:



content, in relation to a communication, includes the following:


(a) any speech, music or other sound that forms part of a telephone conversation;


(b) the body of an email;


(c) a short text message sent from one telecommunications device to another;


(d) a website address;


(e) any other user-generated content.


In relation to the first four, Senator Leyonhjelm, there is a lot of content that I can readily call to mind that would not be caught by that definition. For example, moving visual images—videos—would not be caught by that definition. But it may have unintended consequences. There is no definition of 'the body of an email'. I have told you that the address line of an email is regarded as content. It could well be argued that the body of an email is the principal message and not the address line, so it may well be that when a court came to interpret these words, were they to be included, it might have the opposite effect to what you intend. In relation to (e), 'any other user-generated content', that merely repeats without further explication the word 'content'.


So, Senator Leyonhjelm, I think that by this definition you actually narrow the protection. It is the government's intention to broaden the protection. Do not for a moment think, Senator Leyonhjelm—I am sure you would not actually think—that we did not consider this very carefully and did not take advice about the right way to go about this. The very firm view at which the government arrived—and I would commend this view to you, Senator—is to leave 'content' as broadly expressed as possible. It is expressed in section 187A(4) of the bill as 'the contents or substance of a communication', and it could not be more broadly expressed than that. But if we try to list what content is then, by omission, it may well be that we include content within the reach of this bill that we actually want to protect from being accessed by authorities. That is why, in proposed section 187A(4) of the bill, we express 'content' not by way of definition but as broadly as possible according to the ordinary English language usage of those words, but in section 187AA(1) of the bill, in the table, we describe the metadata narrowly. If you want to limit access to metadata to very strict confines and protect content as widely as possible, that is the way you would do it: you would have a specific definition of 'metadata' and an open-ended, comprehensive or all-embracing definition of 'content'. That is what we have done.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:55):  The Australian Greens will be supporting this amendment, notwithstanding Senator Leyonhjelm's acknowledgement that people may quibble with the definition. But we are here to improve bad law, not perfect it. I also—this does not happen all that often, but I am going to do it anyway—acknowledge the distinction that Senator Brandis draws and the difficulty of drawing distinctions between the two. The government believes it has done the best that it can.


The only contribution that I want to make to the debate, in supporting this amendment, is that the distinction between content and metadata is becoming wholly arbitrary. As many smarter people than me, with a better background in this technology than me, have pointed out, metadata in aggregate is content. There is a false distinction that has driven the entire debate: we will protect the phone call or the content of the email behind buttresses of judicial oversight, procedure and reporting, but we will offer no protection whatsoever for the 340,000 warrantless metadata accesses. This implies—actually, it does not imply it, because spokespeople from both the major parties have said this in black and white—that metadata is somehow of a lesser quality and is less invasive. That is simply not true, because that term—which is not a term of art—encompasses such a wide variety of material. Metadata includes simple material like who owns that particular handset or who holds that particular subscription. That is metadata, and we have already agreed that we are not proposing to constrain agencies to require a warrant to get that, because it is reasonably routine. But this same word 'metadata'—with that innocent definition of who owned a particular subscription at a particular time—also covers data that can be used to track your precise location. That is invasive. That is content. It is intrusive. The state should not be able to peer into that material without the same protections that apply to listening to a phone call or reading an email. It is not that hard.


I recognise that legal definitions will always lag behind technology, and that is partly why we are in the mess that we are in, but I fundamentally reject the artificial distinction between content and non-content. Metadata in aggregate is content, and we do nothing to protect that in Australian law. Before you jump up, Senator Brandis, to tell us that that is the prevailing system, that this bill does nothing to make it worse et cetera, I agree with you. The prevailing system is broken, and today you propose to make it worse.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:57):  Senator Ludlam, I am not sure if you are an aficionado of Alice in Wonderland, but you have just fallen down the rabbit hole. Your statement, 'Metadata is content,' reveals a fundamental gap in your appreciation of a reality here.




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, the debate has been pretty courteous and reasonable so far. I did not say, 'Metadata is content.' Please do not mislead the chamber. I said, 'Metadata in aggregate is content.' At least quote me accurately.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  That is a debating point, Senator Ludlam. Resume your seat.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Ludlam, perhaps you want to resile from what you said, but at the beginning of your contribution you did not include those qualifying words. You said, 'Metadata is content.' If you want to resile from that now and add a qualification to what you said, we all occasionally misspeak in this chamber, but you actually did say, 'Metadata is content,' and of course it is not.


Although we have all regularly used the word 'metadata' in this debate, of course you rightly say, Senator Ludlam, that 'metadata' is not a term of art. I am sure you will understand that the word 'metadata', which is a jargon phrase of no clear and specific meaning and no technical standing—and I see you nodding in agreement, so we are of a common mind about this—does not appear anywhere in this bill, for that very reason. So, rather than use a jargon phrase of no certain meaning and no technical standing, what the government has set out in the table subjacent to subsection 187A(1)(a) is a description of six categories of information which, in a loose way, we have been referring to in the course of this debate and which has been referred to in the course of public discussion as metadata. But, for the very reason you acknowledge, we have very carefully avoided using this cant, jargonistic phrase of no certain meaning and no technical standing. That is why the legislation has been structured the way it is. I really think, Senator Ludlam—because I know you know a lot about this area; I respect the fact that this is an area of specialist knowledge you have, more so than most in this chamber—you really should reconsider whether you go along with Senator Leyonhjelm's approach here. By defining content to limited categories what Senator Leyonhjelm has done, with respect—inadvertently, I am sure—is to confine the exclusion. Senator Leyonhjelm, who thinks this is a bad bill, would nevertheless want to improve it by making the exclusion of content as comprehensive and all-embracing as possible; but by defining certain categories of content to the exclusion of other potential categories, you are achieving the opposite effect, Senator Leyonhjelm.


As a matter of logic we should leave content as broadly expressed as possible. As I counselled in a slightly different context last night: these are not legal terms of art. Content is not a legal or a technical term. The substance of a communication is not a legal or a technical term. We should avoid an infinite regression into the thesaurus. We should simply use plain English and express that plain English as widely as it can be expressed.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (11:02):  Labor considers this amendment unnecessary. The committee examined this issue and concluded it unnecessary to insert a definition of content. If I could just quote from the committee's report:


The Committee accepts the evidence provided by industry representatives that content can be reliably separated from data for the purpose of data retention. The Committee notes that, currently, service providers are required by law to separate content from data when complying with historic and prospective data authorisations made under Chapter 4 of the TIA Act.


Senator Leyonhjelm's concerns about the precision of the dataset are adequately addressed by the existing exclusion of content under the TIA Act and by the increased precision of the dataset achieved by amendments to the bill in the other place.


Question negatived.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:04):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (25) and (27) on sheet 7669 together:


(25) Schedule 1, item 5, page 29 (after line 8), after the definition of infrastructure, insert:



   journalist means a person who is engaged and active in the publication of news and who may be given information by a source in the expectation that the information may be disseminated in the form of:


   (a) news, current affairs or a documentary; or


   (b) commentary, observations or opinion on, or analysis of, news, current affairs or a documentary.


(27) Schedule 1, item 5, page 29 (lines 26 to 29) omit paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of source, substitute:


(a) to another journalist; and


(b) in the normal course of the other person's work as a journalist; and


What we have attempted to do here is important and it was canvassed to some degree in the other place during the debate there last week. The government, for reasons I hope Senator Brandis will explain to us shortly, has a definition of journalist as regards who is actually protected by the clauses the government and the opposition agreed to, to provide for a warrant and the public interest advocate. The definition of journalist therefore becomes fairly central as to who can avail themselves of these protections. Some senators will recall that when we were debating shield laws provisions that made amendments to the Evidence Act, going back now a couple of years, the chamber agreed—do not let me get this wrong, but I seem to recall Senator Brandis was on the same side of this vote as we were; in fact, I think it was unanimous—that the definition of journalist should be framed fairly broadly so that in the event that people needed to avail themselves of the protection of shield laws, we would effectively leave it to the courts to decide whether it was in the public interest that somebody should be protected and allow their source to be protected. The reason for that should seem reasonably obvious: if you are doing investigative journalism or you are reporting in the public interest and you need to protect a source, or if people doing this work want to publicly disclose wrongdoing or corruption—if you have been given information that relates to government corruption or malfeasance or any of the other things the press gallery does every day to keep our democracy strong, if you will; that is probably overstating it a bit, but it is tremendously important—they can get that material into the public domain without being prosecuted. Whistleblowers have their lives ruined. I know Senator Xenophon has had a lot to do with Mr Allan Kessing. This society is tremendously hard on whistleblowers and the protections that do exist have in the past proven quite inadequate at protecting people. But shield laws are one way of keeping a source out of harm's way so that people can anonymously report to journalists stuff that needs to get into the public domain. We framed 'journalists' very broadly, and I will read the definition that is in the Evidence Act at the moment:


 … journalist means a person who is engaged and active in the publication of news and who may be given information by an informant in the expectation that the information may be published in a news medium.


Linked to that:



news medium means any medium for the dissemination to the public or a section of the public of news and observations on news.


Those two definitions are deliberately broad, and my recollection is that they were unanimously agreed to by the Senate so that the courts can decide—not on some arbitrary distinction of whether the person got paid to write the piece. Whether they are working for the Sydney Morning Herald and whether they are sensible grown-up journalist should not matter. The decision is whether the disclosure is in the public interest. The source should be able to available themselves of the protection and the journalists should not be dragged through the courts and potentially jailed. We agreed to leave that broadly. 


The government, in drafting this new category of quasi-warrant to protect journalists, is proposing to narrow the definition. I do not understand why you would do that. I think the standard that we apply for shield laws should apply in this instance. That is why we brought these amendments forward today. Arbitrarily constraining such protections as have managed to be hammered out, we think, are inadequate, but are better than what prevailed before.


I do not see any reason at all why that should depend on whether or not you draw a pay cheque. If it is important work—if it is public interest reporting—and if sources' lives or livelihoods are at risk, then that protection should be offered.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:08):  Before responding to your contribution, Senator Ludlam, if I may say so, you do me less than justice. Not only was I part of the body of opinion in the Senate that supported the shield laws; I actually introduced the legislation. 



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. It was introduced initially as a private senator's bill by me. It was initially opposed by the Labor Party and the Greens. It was, in subsequent months or years, then adopted by the Labor Party, but the legislation was originally introduced by me. So I have nothing but commitment to the idea of the rights of journalists to protect their sources. That is why, although initially it was not part of the bill because journalists and their sources were never the target of this bill, I am quite comfortable with the amendments that were introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr Turnbull and which now comprise division 4C of the bill.


If I may say so, Senator Ludlam, I think you make a very good point. If only for the sake of consistency, I think it is undesirable that there should be different definitions of 'journalism' in different Commonwealth acts. You have instanced the provisions in the Evidence Act that protect journalists, which extend confidentiality to journalists' sources, and which I supported. On reflection, I think the way that it is expressed is a little wide but unfortunately the problem that you identify would not be solved were we to adopt your amendment because there are other definitions elsewhere in the Commonwealth law which apply this definition of 'journalist'. In particular, division 119 of the Criminal Code, subsection 119.23(f), uses this definition of 'journalism'. 


You know as well as I do, Senator, that the definition of 'journalist' has been the subject of much public discussion, especially driven by the expansion, beyond the imagination of people even 30 years ago, of the media through which journalism may be published and conducted. But the definition that is preferred here—a person who is working in a professional capacity as a journalist—is not necessarily a contradiction of your amendment. There is no doubt that it is more generic. It is not a question of whether a person draws a pay cheque, by the way. A person can be working in a professional capacity as a barrister even though he does not render a fee for a particular case. The definition calls attention to the notion that there is such a profession as journalism, whose members consciously identify as such and who observe certain professional standards so that they are recognisable members of a body of people who undertake the same profession. That is the concept sought to be captured here.


It may well be that, given that there are inconsistent definitions of 'journalism' or 'journalist' already in the Commonwealth statues—and, indeed, between the Commonwealth and the states—some regularisation and standardisation should be adopted. But, for the time being, given that this definition is more generic, and is consistent with one of the two definitions currently extant in the Commonwealth statutes, the government prefers to deal with the issue in this way.

I am grateful that the Attorney-General acknowledges that it is an issue that there are different definitions of 'journalism'. The one that has been chosen here is the one taken from the Evidence Act, not the Criminal Code. We prefer it. I certainly would encourage the Attorney-General to move towards a consistent definition of journalism in Commonwealth legislation at the earliest opportunity—and today is a good one.

In fact, I put it in my own amendments to the bill, along with the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, around the same time. I think in terms of the raw politics of it, the fact that the coalition in opposition was prepared to support it, prompted the government of the day to bring that forward, and I think Senator Ludwig did play a very constructive role with respect to that. I am grateful to the Attorney for the role he has played in journalist shield laws, from opposition. You do not have to be in government to come up with good ideas, Attorney. I think that puts it in an historical context. Journalists are in a better position as a result of those shield laws, but my concern is that with the metadata laws they may be in a worse position.

 (South Australia) (11:16):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7672 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 6L, page 34 (lines 8 to 10), omit paragraph 180G(1)(b), substitute:


(b) a purpose, effect or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify another person whom the eligible person knows or reasonably believes may be a source;


(2) Schedule 1, item 6L, page 34 (lines 26 to 28), omit paragraph 180H(1)(b), substitute:


(b) a purpose, effect or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify another person whom the authorised officer knows or reasonably believes may be a source;


These amendments amend the criteria under which an eligible person or enforcement agencies may not make an authorisation for disclosure of information relating to a journalist or their employer unless a journalist information warrant is in force. The amendments alter the provisions to include where the purpose or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify another person who is known to be a source, or is reasonably believed to be a source, so that an authorisation cannot be made under these circumstances.


If we can put this in context, what is proposed in the bill in terms of the excluded categories—that is, those categories for which a journalist's information warrant must be sought—is that you need to show if a purpose of making the authorisation would be to identify another person whom the eligible person knows or reasonably believes to be a source. I know this is not competition law, but it does remind me about the debate of the effects test that the Harper review is looking at. In other words, to show purpose, and to simply confine it to purpose, seems to me to be unduly narrow. That is why I have moved an amendment that would allow a broader approach that would allow inclusion of the words 'effect' or 'likely effect'. The argument by those seeking authorisation is: 'This is not our purpose,' but if the effect or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify a source, then I think that should be included. I think it is consistent with what the government has put up in this bill. It is intended to have a regime in place to protect journalists' sources. But having it confined simply to purpose, particularly in the context of the public interest advocate regime, where there is not an opportunity for the media organisation to be consulted, I think it is important that we have it as broad and consistent as possible with the purpose of what the government's amendment says. The aim of these amendments is to broaden the circumstances under which information cannot be disclosed without a warrant, to ensure that sources are not inadvertently identified. My concern is that the word 'purpose' is simply too narrow; that it ought to include 'effect' or 'likely effect', because of the debates we have seen in other pieces of legislation about the narrowness of the word 'purpose' in the context of what the government's amendment is trying to remedy.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:19):  The government is not persuaded by that argument. In general, Senator Xenophon, you do make a good point about the importance in legislation that tries to avoid an adverse effect of dealing with both purpose or effect so that volitional conduct—that is, conduct engaged in for a purpose—or unintended conduct that is not intended to have that purpose but might nevertheless have that effect, should both be caught. Then, in certain circumstances, there are powerful logical arguments for doing that, although I myself have never been persuaded that section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act is one of them. But when we confine what is prohibited to conduct engaged in for a purpose only, as opposed to engaging for a purpose or likely to have an effect, what we focus on really is the motive of the person whose conduct is under scrutiny. What we have heard throughout this debate is that there is a risk that this scheme could circumvent a journalist's capacity to protect their sources by allowing applications for their metadata to identify the source. That is, in essence, what we have been told is the mischief here. The government, after consideration, responded to that by including division 4C into the bill. The mischief that was identified to us was not incidental or second-order effects. The definition that was identified to us was 'conscious, deliberate, purposeful, advertent abuse of the system', and that is what this provision deals with. Your provision would take it a great deal further, but what we are dealing with here is the very mischief that was identified that needed to be corrected by the insertion of division 4C.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:21):  Does not the Attorney concede that the words 'effect or likely effect' would, whilst making the provision broader in terms of the categories for which a journalist information warrant is required, still be consistent with the aim of the government's amendment—that is, to protect a journalist's source? Or rather—and I will stand corrected—in order for a journalist information warrant to be granted, there is a process prescribed in the bill. The circumstances in which that occurs are now confined in part to showing that there is a purpose for making the authorisation: to identify another person or eligible person. You could have the person seeking the warrant simply say, 'The purpose is not to seek to identify the source, but it could well be an incidental effect to that.' Given the government's negotiation with the opposition and listening to concerns of major media organisations including News Ltd and Seven West in this country, does not the Attorney concede that there may be circumstances when the bill in its current form as proposed by the government would not require an authorisation, because the authority or agency seeking the metadata says, 'This is not the purpose for the authorisation, but it may well be a collateral effect that a source will be disclosed and therefore we do not have to go through this process of the public interest advocate'?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:23):  I wish you would not ask me to concede things, because, if I say I concede things to you, it will look as if you have argued me into a corner. I would rather say I acknowledge the point you make. I do acknowledge the point you make, but that is not the reason this provision has been included. The reason this provision has been included is to prevent abuse of the system. Purposeful conduct is the mischief to which we are directing our attention here. I might point out to you that there is not a sole purpose here. Unlike elsewhere in the legislation, there is not a sole purpose test here. So long as it is a purpose, that will be enough to invoke the protection. If we were going to go further to seek to comprehensively protect journalists or their sources from incidental unintended effects then what you say would be absolutely correct, but that is not what we are seeking to do. It is not what we have been asked to do. What we are seeking to do—what we have been asked to do—is to include, in effect, an anti-abuse provision to prevent the deliberate misuse of this provision to interfere with the confidentiality of the relationship between journalists and their sources. This provision, as I am sure you would acknowledge, does so.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-03-26,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (11:25):  I might take this opportunity to comment not only on these two amendments but the subsequent two sets we will be dealing with in a moment but that are in some sense related. Senator Xenophon's amendments seek to introduce a different warrant regime for journalists purportedly modelled on the provisions in America, as we discussed earlier in the committee stage. I note that in the other place Labor supported amendments which implemented such a warrant regime being introduced for journalists; however, I should note that those amendments were successful and that the bill before us already incorporates a warrant regime for the protection of journalists and their sources which was not previously in place.


Senator Xenophon would evidently prefer a different model from that agreed between the government and the opposition. It seems that the main focus of the amendments is what Senator Xenophon refers to as 'contestability'. Senator Xenophon says that his model is based on the law in the United States, though it is not clear precisely what law he is referring to. Of course, as we understand, the Americans do have a very different system from us.


We should be clear: there is no precedent in Australia for warrants to be subject to a contested hearing. Warrants are not issued in an interparties hearing. They are not the subject of a full contested hearing. The reasons for this are obvious. Notifying the subject of a phone tap or a search warrant defeats the purpose of seeking such a warrant. Best practice is, however, for an independent body to appear before the issuing authority and to test the argument of the agencies and argue against the issue of the warrant. In Queensland and Victoria bodies called public interest monitors perform this function. This bill implements best practice through the creation of a public interest advocate modelled on the public interest monitors in Queensland and Victoria. It is the first and only time such special protection has been provided to a warrant scheme at the Commonwealth level.


Though it is inappropriate for warrants to be contested in the way that Senator Xenophon desires, the public interest advocate model ensures that the warrant-issuing process is rigorous and that the issuing—




Senator Xenophon:
  I rise on a point of order. We have not got to that particular amendment yet. I acknowledge—I concede—that Senator Collins has spoken to the particular amendment that is before us, but I wonder whether it is more appropriate for it to be dealt with—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Seselja
):  I am not going to take too strict an approach on this. People do tend to go a little bit back and forth on these things. Senator Collins has indicated that she is expressing a view in terms of the upcoming amendments, so I am not averse to some discussion of those future amendments.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I apologise to Senator Xenophon if he was distracted by Senator Brandis at the outset when I indicated I would be reflecting.



An honourable senator interjecting—  




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Well then, I do not need to apologise. I indicated at the outset that I would be covering the three sets. If you objected to that, Senator Xenophon, you might have responded at the outset. I am of course quite keen to facilitate progress in relation to the consideration of the amendments in this committee stage, so I was seeking to address the three sets at once. If Senator Xenophon can bear with another paragraph then that will conclude my contribution on his amendments.


I was saying that although it is inappropriate for warrants to be contested in the way that Senator Xenophon desires, the public interest advocate model ensures that the warrant issuing process is rigorous and the issuing authority hears strong arguments against the issuing of a warrant. Labor believes that this is the appropriate model overall, thus related to the first two amendments and the subsequent ones. We share Senator Xenophon's goal, however, of protecting journalists and we believe that the model already incorporated in this bill achieves that goal.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:30):  The Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. They are consistent with what we have been arguing the whole time. The final model that the government and the Labor Party came to has been quite heavily criticised, but nonetheless Senator Collins is quite right: this framework does not actually exist at the moment and there is no public interest monitor equivalent at a Commonwealth level. That is something that we have argued for.


In the course of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act inquiry that we conducted over the last 15 months or so we heard quite compelling evidence from the public interest monitors in the two states where they do exist that it does not slow down the process. What it does is that it provides a measure of contestability in the warranting process. What they found was that the agencies did take a little while to get used to having interposed in the process somebody they were not used to being there and who would say, 'Does this need to be this broad? Could this be narrower? Could it be for a briefer period of time? Do you need all of these devices?' Eventually, once the agencies got used to having that process of contestability interposed into the process, it streamlined things and it was in the view of the public interest monitor that we took evidence from that it had actually immeasurably improved the process.


But I have seen the crack in the government's armour with the two acknowledgments that have been made: firstly, that metadata is not so completely harmless or innocuous that journalists and their sources do not deserve a measure of protection; secondly, that we would introduce therefore a process that is not really the same as ordinary warrants. It is kind of quasi-warranting process. Also, we would introduce a public interest advocate who performs not an identical role, but a similar role, for this narrow category of professionals, as the government has defined them. We have got problems about the way that it is constructed; but I think it does open the door to some of the arguments that we have been running for a couple of years now, as the system requires further safeguards.


What Senator Xenophon has done is make the obvious point here that you can put a better lock on the front door and try to protect the journalists a little bit better than they are at the moment, but the back door is wide open. If somebody, for example, publishes a scoop on the horrors that are unfolding on Manus Island and the government wants to know or police agencies or the federal police are instructed to find out who that journalist is talking to, they will need to go through these new procedures that have been put into place. It is my expectation that, of course, the warrant will be issued. It might take a little bit longer and it might have a few more checks and balances in the way, but no doubt the warrant will be issued.


Nonetheless, that is a piece of process that does not exist at the moment. Of course, the agency is just as likely to go through and scrape the phone records of people working on the island and find out which phone numbers come up. If those numbers match those of a journalist, then you do not really need to go any further. It completely renders obsolete the shield laws that everybody on all sides of the debate just argue passionately in favour of. You do not need to take a journalist to court to find out who they have been talking to; you just find out who they have been talking to. That is part of the problem. All sides of politics—although the government somewhat reluctantly—have recognised that this is an issue, even as the government does continue to try to track down the source of stories that are appearing that it does not like the content of.


What Senator Xenophon's amendment attempts to do—it is difficult to enforce, I suspect, but nonetheless I think the intent is noble—is to ensure that if somebody is reasonably suspected of being a source then they would also be protected. I think that is a noble intention. It goes some way towards improving the kind of protections that most people believe should be in place, but it does not deal with the fundamental issue of the fact that the Australian government is instructing the federal police a reasonable number of times a year to go and find out who is putting unpopular stories into the press. That is disgusting behaviour. We should not be throwing additional procedural hurdles in the way; we should make that very, very difficult to do, if not completely unlawful.


We are happy to commend these amendments to the chamber and hope that they pass.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:35):  I cannot let Senator Ludlam get away with that disgraceful remark. The Australian government does not instruct the Australian Federal Police to go after people. That is an attack on the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police are independent of government. There is no possibility that I, as the minister with ultimate responsibility for the Australian Federal Police; or the Minister for Justice, who has immediate responsibility for the Australia Federal Police; or any other minister could ever instruct the Australian Federal Police to carry out any investigation. It is not possible.


Individuals can make complaints to the Australian Federal Police. When I was in opposition, I made a number of complaints to the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police treat everyone equally. They treat government, opposition, members of parliament and private citizens—everyone—equally. The suggestion that members of a government could or would instruct the Australian Federal Police and the suggestion that the Australian Federal Police could or would accept such instruction is deplorable.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:36):  I will not be dividing on this amendment. I appreciate that the government and the opposition have given me their position. If we acknowledge that sources need to be protected, then this amendment would seek to broaden that protection. Sometimes, there could be circumstances where a purpose is not to reveal a source, but it could have the effect of revealing a source; therefore the public interest advocacy regime anticipated in this legislative framework ought to be strengthened according to that. I will not take it any further. I know now to ask the Attorney only to acknowledge something rather than concede. An acknowledgement from the Attorney is probably almost a concession.

 (South Australia) (11:37):  by leave—I move amendments (3) and (7) on sheet 7672 together:


(3) Schedule 1, item 6L, page 35 (after line 28), at the end of section 180K, add:


Note: If further information is required, a Public Interest Advocate must be notified, see section 180X.


(7) Schedule 1, item 6L, page 40 (after line 23), at the end of section 180R, add:


Note: If further information is required, a Public Interest Advocate must be notified, see section 180X.


Amendment (3) inserts a new note at the end of proposed section 180K to specify that a Public Interest Advocate must be notified if further information is required under that section. This is in accordance with proposed section 180X and consequential to my proposed amendments to the section. In essence, proposed section 180K says


(1) The Minister may require the Director-General of Security to give to the Minister, within the period specified in the requirement, further information in connection with a request under this Subdivision.


(2) If the Director-General breaches the requirement, the Minister may: 


   (a) refuse to consider the request; or 


   (b) refuse to take any action, or any further action, in relation to the request.


It seems to me that the government's bill is unclear as to whether the further information that is required by the minister is information that will necessarily be given to the Public Interest Advocate. I am not sure whether it was an oversight or a deliberate policy position, or whether the Attorney would acknowledge or even concede that there ought to be a revisiting of this at some time down the track. The Public Interest Advocate does not have the same access to journalists as exists in, say, the US protocols, which we will talk about shortly. The argument is that if further information is requested then the Public Interest Advocate ought to be aware of that in the context of arguing the public interest case in the issue of a journalist information warrant.

Your point is right but it is also a little unnecessary, because of course what these amendments seek to achieve is the process that is envisaged anyway. If you look at the stipulations in proposed sections 180K and 180R you will see that they already require the minister to have regard to submissions made by the Public Interest Advocate in relation to the public interest, so it is necessarily implicit in the bill that the Public Interest Advocate will be given the opportunity to make those submissions. That is what we had envisaged. Perhaps if we had consulted you earlier on, Senator Xenophon, we might have expressed this a little more elegantly. Can I direct you to proposed section 180X(3), which provides that the regulations may prescribe matters relating to the performance of the role of the Public Interest Advocate. Those regulations will be promulgated. I can tell you—and I am not just saying this, by the way, because of what you have said; it is something that we already had in mind to do—those regulations will include a specific stipulation to put beyond doubt the issue that you have raised.

Public Interest Advocates



(1) The Prime Minister shall declare, in writing, one or more persons to be Public Interest Advocates.




Notice to be given to Public Interest Advocates



(2) If a notice is given to a Public Interest Advocate under section 180L in relation to a request for a journalist information warrant, or under 180T in relation to an application for a journalist information warrant, the notice must:


   (a) be in writing; and


   (b) include:


      (i) the information and material that was provided with the request or application, as the case may be; and


      (ii) the additional information or material (if any) that is prescribed by the regulations.




Further notice if additional information provided



(3) If:


   (a) the Minister requires the Director‑General of Security to give further information under section 180K in connection with a request; and


   (b) the Director‑General gives the further information or refuses to give the further information;


then the Minister must notify the Public Interest Advocate, in writing, of the further information or the refusal as soon as practicable.


(4) If:


   (a) the Part 4‑1 issuing authority requires the chief officer of an enforcement agency, or a person other than the chief of the agency, to give further information under section 180R in connection with an application; and


   (b) the chief officer, or the other person, gives the further information or refuses to give the further information;


then the Part 4‑1 issuing authority must notify the Public Interest Advocate, in writing, of the further information or the refusal as soon as practicable.




Submissions



(5) A Public Interest Advocate may make submissions:


   (a) to the Minister about matters relevant to:


      (i) a decision to issue, or refuse to issue, a journalist information warrant under section 180L; or


      (ii) a decision about the conditions or restrictions (if any) that are to be specified in such a warrant; or


   (b) to a Part 4‑1 issuing authority about matters relevant to:


      (i) a decision to issue, or refuse to issue, the warrant under section 180T; or


      (ii) a decision about the conditions or restrictions (if any) that are to be specified in such a warrant.


(6) In making a submission under subsection (5), a Public Interest Advocate must have particular regard to protecting the public interest and the need to act as a contradictor to the person requesting, or applying for, the journalist information warrant.




Regulations



(7) The regulations may prescribe matters relating to the performance of the role of a Public Interest Advocate.




Declaration not legislative instrument



(8) A declaration under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.


Amendment (4) amends proposed section 180L(2) to alter the circumstances in which the minister must not issue a journalist information warrant. The changes to the proposed subsection provide that the minister must not issue a warrant where reasonable notice of the request has not been given to the Public Interest Advocate. Further, reasonable notice must also be given in writing to the person to whom the warrant relates. The minister must also invite the person to make a submission on the request. The minister must also be satisfied that the organisation's functions would extend to the making of authorisations regarding that particular person and that the public interest in ensuring the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the source.


These amendments also provide that the minister must give the greatest weighting to the public interest provisions set out in proposed subsection (2)(b). These amendments will ensure that paramount consideration is given to public interest matters by the minister when considering whether to issue a journalist information warrant. The aim of these provisions is to ensure that the greatest consideration is given to the impact of issuing such warrants on the public interest and to provide basic requirements that must be met in terms of notice to the Public Interest Advocate and in allowing a journalist a right of reply in considering the public interest.


Senator Collins in her contribution made mention of the US system. It is true, as the Attorney has said, that there isn't a system of warrants as such and that the material—metadata—is retained by the NSA. As a result of a very unfortunate raid on Associated Press in Washington DC a couple of years ago, US Attorney General Eric Holder put in a number of protocols which have been evolving, but essentially the general rule is that journalists—media organisations—are consulted before that metadata is accessed so they can argue the access. I think one of the minister's advisers is shaking his head—maybe it is at me; maybe I have that wrong; I will be happy to stand corrected. That is my understanding of the protocols and guidelines I have seen, and I am sure we will get to this at some other time. I am conscious of the time. Could I get the Chairman's guidance—are we going to 11.50?



The CHAIRMAN:  Till 10 past 12.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I should know this by now, shouldn't I? Thank you.




Senator Brandis:
  Don't take that as an invitation to go longer!




Senator XENOPHON:
  No, I will not be prolix or even otiose; I just want to get on with it! In the United States, it can be said that media organisations are, as a general rule, consulted in relation to the access to metadata. That is my understanding of the protocols that have existed. Items (5) and (6) are consequential to the passage of item (4). Item (7) inserts a note after proposed section 180R to specify that the public interest advocate must be notified—that has been dealt with.


Item (8) amends the bill so that the same requirements of the minister as set out in item (4) of my amendments also apply to the issuing authority. This ensures consistency and that the public interest is a paramount consideration in the decision made by any authority in issuing a journalist information warrant. Item (9) amends proposed section 180X, which relates to the public interest advocates. These amendments set out the requirement for a notice to be provided to the advocates in relation to journalist information warrants. The amendments provide that the notice must be provided in writing and include the information or material that was provided with a request or application and any other information as prescribed by regulation.


Further, the amendments include provisions to ensure that the advocate will be provided with any further information requested of the relevant authorities by the minister or issuing authority, or notified if the request to provide information is refused. The amendments also provide that the advocate may make submissions to the minister or the issuing authority about matters relevant to the issuing of the warrant. The advocate may also specify conditions or limitations to be placed on a warrant if necessary. The amendments also specify that the advocate must have particular regard to protecting the public interest and the need to act as a contradictor or devil's advocate to the person requesting the warrant. Further, the amendments provide that the regulations may prescribe matters relating to the role of the public interest advocate and that the declaration made by the minister or by the Prime Minister to declare a person as an advocate is not a disallowable instrument.


The aim of these amendments is to flesh out the role of the public interest advocate to ensure that it has specific roles and duties to maintain the public interest and act as a true advocate. The amendments I propose will provide greater protection for journalists through greater scrutiny of the journalist information warrant process. Without an active, appropriately focused advocate who has the ability to ask journalists or media organisations about aspects of the application, I think the public interest advocate will be quite circumscribed in what they can do. Also, I referred in my speech to the second reading debate to the sorts of concerns that Associate Professor Clinton Fernandes has raised about the public interest advocate, which I will not unnecessarily restate now.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:48):  Senator Xenophon, I completely disagree with you. In the government's view, these amendments are entirely unnecessary and some of the bases upon which you put them forward are wrong in fact.


Let us go back to first principles here. This legislation maintains a status quo, which is a warrantless system. Subject to certain oversight obligations, including a public reporting obligation, which we discussed earlier on, nevertheless, access to metadata as opposed to content is warrantless; access to content requires a warrant. Against that general rule, the government has—without conceding the necessity to do so but I can understand the arguments nevertheless—agreed with the opposition to include a special set of provisions for journalists, in proposed division 4C. Within that special set of exceptions to journalists to protect the relationship between them and their sources, we have, uniquely, required warrants.


Furthermore, in creating the design of the warrant system so far as it applies to journalists, we have included extensive public interest criteria, which are set out in proposed section 180L—public interest criteria that do not exist in that form in other Commonwealth legislation which creates warrant regimes. On top of that—in superaddition to that—we have, by section 180X, created this new office of public interest monitor to act, as you rightly say, as a kind of devil's advocate or an advocate for the public interest, to contest whether or not a warrant should issue.


That is unique. No warrant regime under Commonwealth law includes the creation of a specific public interest advocate whose peculiar role is to make the issuance of a particular kind of warrant contestable. So we have piled Pelion upon Ossa here in order to create as many safeguards as can possibly be made.


But let us remember that what this bill is about is the facilitation of criminal investigations. Although journalists and, indeed, the sources of journalists are not the target or the focus or the purpose of this bill—because, as I said before, I have never met a journalist who was a terrorist or a paedophile or an organised criminal—nevertheless, in the very unlikely situation where the police did want to investigate a journalist or a source in relation to the matters which are the object of this bill, you can immediately see how advance notice to the person who was the subject of their concern would prejudice the investigation.


Senator Xenophon, you say that such a system as you propound exists in the United States. You are wrong. Let me give you the advice that I have in relation to the American system. In the American system, the most recently issued Department of Justice guidelines require that the Attorney-General approve any subpoena ordering a carrier to disclose metadata for the purpose of identifying a journalist source. Those guidelines do not require agencies to notify journalists before such a subpoena is issued. I am informed that they do not. Is that right, Mr Bassi? My adviser Mr Justin Bassi here, who is the person you spied shaking his head before, is extremely well informed about these matters, about the American system. Indeed, I notice he is even wearing his CIA cufflinks today in honour of the occasion—just to feed the paranoia of Senator Ludlam over there. That is not the way the American system works. Your amendments address a problem that does not exist. This legislation could hardly have been based on a more carefully constructed set of safeguards.

 (South Australia) (11:53):  Can the Attorney concede a couple of things?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:54):  I do not acknowledge that at all. Section 180X, which sets out the role of the Public Interest Advocate, describes the role of the Public Interest Advocate in subsection (2), which gives the Public Interest Advocate the role to make submissions to a minister about matters relevant to a decision to issue, or refuse to issue, a journalist information warrant under section 180L, or a decision about the conditions or restrictions, if any, that are to be specified in such a warrant. If you go then to section 180L, it states those matters which the minister must have regard to in subsection (2) include the public interest consideration set out with some particularity over six sub subparagraphs in subsection (2)(b). Those are the very matters, including that elaborately articulated series of public interest considerations which the minister must consider, which the Public Interest Advocate must also consider. 


It is not necessarily the case that the Public Interest Advocate will be a contradicter of the minister; but, in an appropriate case, having regard to the public interest considerations, he may be. It is his role to be the Public Interest Advocate. That is the name of the statutory office, and the function of the statutory office is to, as it were, second-guess the minister's judgement in relation to those six particular aspects of the public interest set out in subsection 180L(2)(b).

Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You need to get out more. 




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Collins, that is right. I do not have a life, not in this place. 



Senator Leyonhjelm interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  I am not being prolix, Senator Leyonhjelm. I do want to put this on notice, because I have made the assertions I have made in good faith in terms of the Department of Justice in the United States and their media policies. I am happy to table or provide a copy of this material to the Attorney's office. It says: 


The first and most significant policy change would be to reverse and expand the presumption concerning notice to, and negotiations with, affected members of the news media whenever Department attorneys seek access to their records related to newsgathering activities.


In other words, metadata. It goes on to say:


The presumption will ensure notice in all but the most exceptional cases.


I can go on, but that is the basis of the material that I read over a number of months now that there is, as a general policy, an ability to negotiate, an ability for there to be discussions, with media organisations in respect of this. That is the practice following the disastrous Associated Press raid in Washington DC a couple of years ago. That is the distinction. Obviously, there are exceptions that, if it is a matter of urgent national security in the context of people's safety being at risk, those rules are thrown out the window. But, as a general proposition, I am very happy to provide not a set of cuff links but the material that I have downloaded from the US Department of Justice that does talk about protocols and about how, as a general rule, there are negotiations before the access to metadata. So it is not a criticism of your very fine advisers but the basis upon which I made those statements in relation to that.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:58):  Briefly, the Australian Greens will be supporting the amendments that Senator Xenophon has brought forward for the simple reason that anything which improves the operation of the Public Interest Advocate is, we think, a profoundly good idea. Senator Brandis took enormous umbrage a short time ago at my admittedly loose language when I pointed out that the government relatively frequently 'instruct'—which was the word I used—the Federal Police to investigate the source of various leaks. They do not instruct; you are quite right, Senator Brandis. But you regularly refer matters to the Federal Police and then they get to choose. One example that is pretty close to my heart, and Senator Hanson-Young addressed it in her second reading contribution, is that at least eight times which we are aware of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection referred matters that appeared in TheGuardian and TheWest Australian newspapers about sexual abuse, child sexual abuse, violence, self-harm, attempted suicides, rape and catastrophic mistreatment of human beings in our care. Instead of investigating the issues that have been raised in the public interest by these publications, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—at least eight times that we are aware of—has asked the Federal Police to try and find out who is talking. That is the kind of repellent behaviour that provides part of the reason why we are supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment.


It is my understanding that the way the public interest monitors in Queensland and Victoria work is that they are contradictors. They are not there to decide whether or not a particular warrant is in the public interest; they are actually there to push back and argue for the narrowing of warrants—for example, to circumscribe the number of people, the number of devices or whatever it is. They are there to improve the quality, and evidence that we took in our telecommunications interception inquiry, as I mentioned before, indicated that processes improved in Victoria and Queensland as a result. My question to Senator Brandis is: would it be your expectation, on your reading of the way that the government has drafted these amendments, that the Public Interest Advocate, in performing the role that you have established, would be arguing against referrals by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, or could we expect that those investigations by the Federal Police would continue?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:01):  I do not know enough about the acts that establish the public interest monitors in Queensland or in Victoria to tell you whether they are specifically mandated by their acts to be a contradictor. Obviously, I am not going to talk about particular cases that may be the subject of an investigation or speculate about how this provision might bear on those cases, the facts of which I am not really familiar with. 


It is enough to say, I think, that the role of the public interest monitor is to ensure that the public interest considerations that are set out quite exhaustively in the act are properly articulated to the relevant decision maker. It may conceivably be that the public interest monitor independently arrives at the view that the issuance of a warrant is in the public interest, applying those criteria in proposed subsection 180L(2)(b), but that is entirely a matter for him. If I may use an analogy with the way courts operate, I would envisage that the public interest monitor would be like an amicus curiae: they would bring an independent mind to bear on the application of these statutory tests to the particular case and, if they were of the view that the public interest was not served by the issuance of a warrant, then they would contest the judgement of the minister. If they were of the view that the public interest was not served by the refusal of a warrant, they could contest that judgement too, I dare say. He or she is to be an independent mind to independently assess and, where appropriate, contradict the minister in the assessment of the application of the public interest criteria to a particular request for a warrant.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:03):  I appreciate the Attorney's response, but unless they are required to be a contradictor—I am not sure whether the Attorney is proposing to do so in respect of the regulations yet to be promulgated once this bill passes—that changes the very nature of their role, in my view. It makes a very substantial difference in the way that they would deal with particular matters. In the context of these amendments—and in the context of having, in my view and in the views of Senators Leyonhjelm, Ludlam, and the Australian Greens, a more robust mechanism in place—does the Attorney concede that metadata retention can be used for sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act, which are the so called leak provisions? 


We are talking about the case of Mr Kessing, who maintains to this day his innocence. That was a case where he wrote a report about airport security that was subsequently leaked to The Australian. It was a report that prompted the Howard government, to their credit, to implement a $240 million upgrade to airport security, after a subsequent report by Sir John Wheeler. Does the Attorney acknowledge that, in the context of metadata surveillance, section 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act would be acts to which metadata access would relate?

In relation to what you have to say about the public interest monitor, can I just make this point: I do not think that the public interest monitor should necessarily be a contradictor. As Mr Bassi reminds me, there is an intrinsic tension between saying that the public interest monitor should be a contradictor and that the public interest monitor should be independent. If there is a statutory requirement that the public interest monitor has to be a contradictor, then what it means is that the public interest monitor cannot operate independently; he cannot bring an independent mind to bear on his own appraisal of whether the criteria in proposed subsection 180L(2)(b) are satisfied or not. If you say he has a statutory obligation to be a contradictor, you are saying he cannot be an independent officer. I think that that is a very bad principle.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:07):  May I suggest to the Attorney that sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act relate, in broad terms, to whistleblowers, to the leak of information. And, as Philip Dorling, the investigative journalist, said, technically you could be done for saying how many paperclips Centrelink has, in respect of that itself being an unauthorised disclosure of information. Whistleblowers will be affected by this in terms of the context of sections 70 and 79, because the AFP is the relevant authority; it is one of the authorities prescribed by this bill. 


The consequences of metadata surveillance are that it will be so much easier for sources to be tracked down. It will have an effect on investigative journalism in this country in the sense that sources and journalists will have to avoid pretty much any electronic communication in order to communicate with each other. The consequence of that will be, I think, to make the job of investigative journalists in this country that much more difficult in the context of other legislative frameworks to do with whistleblower protections, to do with sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act. 


That is why, if there is going to be a public interest advocate—and I commend the government and the opposition for at least having the public interest advocate up there as a matter to be considered in this bill—I agree with the comments of Professor Clinton Fernandes from the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at the University of New South Wales. He said that there is a real problem that the public interest advocate could well be flying blind and have one hand tied behind their back in the absence of knowing, being aware of, what arguments the journalist may have to say, 'We want to protect the source for these reasons, because there are a whole range of factors that need to be considered in the context of the story that we are investigating.' 


I will have a discussion with your advisors and with you, Attorney, if you are minded to, about the US approach. I am only relying on information from the US Department of Justice. But there does seem to be an approach where media organisations are consulted much more comprehensively than is being suggested in this particular bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (09:58):  I foreshadowed this amendment last night. In a way, the amendment of Senator Leyonhjelm that we just voted on really was our fallback. This is probably the most important amendment that the Australian Greens will move during this debate. It is colloquially known as the get-a-warrant amendment. We strongly believe that in 1979, when this act was passed into law, if we had had the multitude of devices, data types and platforms that we have today, the drafters who were considering the substantial overall of telecommunications interception legislation as they were in 1979 would have looked around the field and said, 'You can tap people's phone, you can read people's email, you can track their movements around the landscape, you can map their social networks and you can find everything about their lives. These things will all be covered by a warrant and what will not be covered by a warrant is simple subscriber data so that agencies can very rapidly establish who owns the handset, who holds a particular prescription for a particular service.'


And so we would have ended up with the same two-tiered system that we have today, but those invasive forms of data access—whether they be tapping the phone call or reading your location as you move around the place—would have been within the warranted regime. I have no doubt about that at all. What we have seen, quite frankly, is the failure of the law to keep up with the march of technology. We still have a fairly robust warranted regime. Last night, Senator Rhiannon pointed out some of its failings, and we are certainly aware of those. We have a robust warranted regime and I think the number is about 4,700. We do not know how many ASIO applies for because that is done through a different process, but the entire law enforcement and anticorruption community around the country has about 4,700 warrants a year.


But, as I have said more times than I care to remember, there are 750-odd thousand applications for warrantless access to people's private information, and that is just because these categories of material basically did not exist in 1979. So while intelligence and policing agencies have been very keen to run the argument that the TIA Act needs continual incremental change to keep up with the march of technology, privacy protections have not. That is one of the reasons why opposition to the data retention regime has been so strong; it effectively forces carriers to entrench and embed a broken access system that henceforth will have access to vast new quantities of material.


This is not a view that the Greens are alone in putting forward. It is shared by people as widely separated across the political spectrum as the Institute of Public Affairs—good friends of Senator Brandis—the Law Council of Australia, the telecommunications sector, digital rights organisations like Electronic Frontiers Australia and also Bret Walker SC, who is the former National Security Legislation Monitor. Now, lest anybody fear that I am verballing him, Mr Walker believes that there should be a data retention regime in Australia. But he also believes that it should be circumscribed and that these long-overdue protections of getting a warrant are added. This is what Mr Walker said on 7 August of last year:


It seems to me a warrant is a traditional way by which we say drastic powers ought to be exercised so as to breach what would be otherwise be ordinary personal privacy only when somebody outside the agency, usually a judge or a magistrate, is satisfied that sufficient cause is shown to justify that reversal of what we expect.


This was in an interview that he did with Lateline last year. He goes on:


And if we don't have a warrant system, we don't have that independent umpire to check in the usual way of warrants, making a very formal record, which can be produced later in a court if there's litigation about it. If we don't have that, I fear that there will be an understandable suspicion, hostility, about the operation of agencies, which I stress, we need to be doing a good job.


There is not a word of that with which I disagree, and I think that most right-thinking people would agree with Mr Walker, who has many years of experience in weighing up the checks and balances. And, as I said, he is a proponent of mandatory data retention. Obviously, we part company on that issue, but it is his view that if the government forces a scheme such as this into existence then for the obvious reasons that I have described today—and for years, actually—we need to bring these huge categories of material into the warranted regime.


The way that the amendment is drafted excludes subscriber data. The argument that is made frequently about those 750,000—or, if you believe the Attorney-General's annual report, the 340-odd thousand warrantless requests—is that the government says, 'Look, a lot of that is for subscriber data. We don't know how many of those requests are for basic subscriber data so we do not propose to drag that information into the warranted regime.' But—quite seriously—if two dozen agencies want to be able to know where you are at any time of the day, or where your mobile phone handset is, and if they want to be able to scrape your email records and work out your whole social graph and know who you are talking to at any given time, get a warrant, Senator Brandis—get a warrant! I commend this amendment to the chamber.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:04):  The government opposes this amendment for a reason that, towards the end of his contribution, Senator Ludlam adverted to: the volume of warrantless requests, as reported in the most recent annual report of the Attorney-General's Department, as Senator Ludlam says, was 340,000. It is not suggested—I do not understand it to be suggested—that those requests were irregular or ought not to have been made. What they tell you is the weight and dependence of the police and the other investigative agencies which have access to metadata under the current arrangements, which are not subject of the regimes provided for by this bill.


Surely, Senator Ludlam and Senator Leyonhjelm, you must see as a matter of common sense that, if that is the demand by the authorities for access to metadata—340,000 a year—there is no practical possibility, none, that a warranted regime could work. None. The sheer volume of the need of the authorities to access metadata precludes the procedure for warrants.


Senator Ludlam, you have never had the obligation, as I do, to issue warrants. I have to issue warrants from time to time under the T(IA) Act and under the ASIO Act. Under those acts, the decision maker is required to be satisfied of certain matters, so the authorities seeking the warrant place a volume of material before me which I consider carefully and, on the basis of that consideration, I make my decision about whether or not to issue the warrant. It is a quasi-judicial act, and it takes quite a period of time. The practical impossibility of that process being undertaken carefully where there are, in the last reporting year, 340,000 access requests should be obvious to you. Contrary to what you say, Senator Ludlam, it is not uniformly the practice in Europe to require a warrant.




Senator Ludlam:
  Twelve countries.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Ludlam, I really wish you would stop interjecting. In this debate you have behaved yourself with a reasonable amount of courtesy and decorum, and I would urge you to continue to do so rather than continue to interject. It is the case in some jurisdictions. It is not the case in other European jurisdictions. I am advised that, according to the most recent report of the United Kingdom's Interception of Communications Commissioner, Sir Paul Kennedy, the only European countries that require any level of particularised consideration of whether access to metadata is proportionate are France, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and those systems have an internal executive process of authorisation. Most European countries do not require warrants, though I acknowledge, Senator Ludlam, that some do.


The practical problem is not just a problem of volume. Access to metadata is, in relation to the kinds of investigations with which this bill is concerned—that is, serious investigations into things like terrorism, paedophilia, organised and transnational crime, and, if we include the economic regulators, things like cartel conduct, for example—the initial stage of an investigative process. So there becomes what you might call a chicken-and-egg question here. The authorities use access to metadata to establish certain elementary primary facts in order to determine whether or not there is something that requires investigation. 


No prosecution could ever proceed on metadata alone. Perhaps that is a point I should have made more often in the debate yesterday. No prosecution could ever possibly proceed on the basis of what was revealed by metadata alone. In the event that access to metadata reveals, for example, the existence of a network, then, in an appropriate case, the authorities can make an application under the TIA Act for a listening device, for example. That power has been in existence for as long as the TIA Act has been in existence—since 1969. In fact, if my memory serves me correctly, it was first introduced into Commonwealth law during the Attorney-Generalship of Sir Garfield Barwick—more than half a century ago. That is the point at which the law appropriately says, 'If you are going to have a listening device to access someone's telephone conversations or to access what is on their computer—if you place them under surveillance under the Surveillance Devices Act—that is the point at which you need a warrant, because that is an intrusive and invasive form of investigation.' But it has never been the judgement of this parliament that merely to establish, in a preliminary way, whether, for example, a particular connection was made between two telephone services is a level of intrusion that requires a warrant. 


Always we must bear this in mind, Senator Ludlam: there is an explicit prohibition in this legislation against accessing content—an explicit prohibition. To make assurance doubly sure, there is also an explicit provision that says a person's web-browsing history may never be the subject of the metadata retention regime. 


What this bill does is introduce new protections. There is nothing to stop access to metadata at the moment. There is nothing to control or govern or oversee the exercise of the power to access metadata at the moment. Under this bill there are limitations and oversight mechanisms introduced into the law for the first time. The number of agencies that can avail themselves of this power is reduced by more than three-quarters, from 85 at the moment to 21. This limits, in a way that is not part of the existing law, access to metadata. If the authorities want to go one step further and tap somebody's phone, access their computer or engage in other forms of intrusive investigative activity, they need a warrant—and they should. Nothing in this legislation changes that.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:13):  I indicate my support for the Greens amendment. The Attorney's main objection to this seems to be that it is inconvenient and impractical—on the basis of 340,000 warrants. The question of course arises as to whether or not 340,000 warrants is something we should accept as a reasonable state of affairs anyway. I find it exceedingly disturbing that we should have such a large number of existing intrusions by snoops into our private activities. Indeed, you could argue that instead of being the nanny state we are developing into the spying state. 


It is fairly obvious also that, with 21 agencies able to access metadata under the legislation proposed, there will be a need for fewer warrants. If, as the Attorney suggests, their access to metadata will be restricted to serious offences—although I point out that he declined to accept my amendment yesterday to ensure that that was the case—there would also be fewer warrants. The issue under the current regime with 340,000 accesses of existing metadata is that that does not include two years of history. It does not include the extent of the data that is currently accessed. It seems to me not at all unreasonable for a warrant system to apply to the fewer agencies going after serious offenders and more intrusive data.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:16):  Senator Leyonhjelm, can I correct you. It is not 340,000 warrants; it is 340,000 access authorisations. Let me explain to you how this works. Senator Leyonhjelm, you have been in this chamber for almost a year now. Senator Ludlam has been in the chamber for six years. I have never heard from you, Senator Leyonhjelm, and certainly not from Senator Ludlam an argument that the existing provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act are bad. But the authorisation for access to information or documents is contained in a provision of that act. It is in section 178. I understand that section 178 is an original provision of that act. It has been part of the act since 1979.


We discussed last night section 180F, which falls within the same part of the T(IA) Act. It requires, among other things, privacy considerations to be considered before an access application is made. I want to direct you in particular to section 186, which is the statutory basis of the obligation for there to be a public report on the number of access authorisations made in any given year. The most recent annual report which I have is for 2012-13. At page 47 and following of that report it tabulates the number of authorisations that were made in that year. I think that is where your figure of 340,000 probably comes from.


My point to you, Senator Leyonhjelm, is that it is not as if this is uncontrolled. The fact that there is a public reporting obligation for access applications should demonstrate to you that there is already a level of accountability, as there is through the various parliamentary and executive oversight mechanisms that are already in place. So we are not talking about 340,000 warrants; we are talking about 340,000 access applications which are the subject, transparently, of a public report each year.


I entirely share your sentiments about the need to be vigilant, Senator Leyonhjelm, against intrusions by the state. But that noble sentiment of yours has to be put in the context of what the agencies are asking to do. They are not asking for content. They are not asking for a winding back, degradation or attenuation of the existing warrant regime. The existing warrant regime, which does require a warrant if content is to be sought, remains as it is. The only effect of this bill that is relevant to your argument is to reduce from 85 to 21 the number of agencies that can make access applications.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:19):  Related to this amendment is a concern, which I think was touched on in questions to the Attorney in the last couple of days. It has been a long committee stage, and I am grateful for the Attorney's patience. I do not want to be otiose or prolix in relation to this, but there is a concern about when warrants can be issued. I appreciate that the RSPCA and the Victorian Taxi Directorate will no longer be able to access metadata, but the concern that has been expressed to me by some constituents this morning relates to alleged copyright violations. Can the Attorney assure us that the access of metadata under this regime will not be used to prosecute citizens who happen to have downloaded the latest episode of Breaking Bad.

Senator XENOPHON:

Game Of Thrones

is apparently a TV program. Can the Attorney assure us that access to metadata under this regime will not in any circumstances be used for the prosecution of citizens or, indeed, of others that may be downloading content that relates to breach of copyright? I am sorry about my lack of cultural reference. Thank you, Chair, for telling me that Breaking Bad is no longer in the series.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:21): I can give you that assurance, Senator, because what this bill is concerned with is the enforcement of the criminal law. If you look at the 21 agencies listed at section 110A, you will see that they are all crime or corruption investigative agencies. I do not want to be tedious, but I might read them into the record because not everybody appreciates the limitation on the number of agencies. It will only take me a moment. Under these reforms, the following agencies can access metadata: the Australian Federal Police, the police force of a state, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Customs and Boarder Protection Service, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Crime Commission, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Police Integrity Commission, the IBAC, the Crime and Corruption Commission of Queensland, the Corruption and Crime Commission, the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. These are different formulae in the different states, apparently. And then there is a power to declare other bodies but none have been declared, and that is subject to the limitations that we have already discussed. That is all. So we are dealing here with the enforcement of the criminal law. 


As you know, Senator Xenophon, breach of copyright is a civil wrong. Against that argument two things have been said. First of all, it has been said that there are criminal provisions in the Copyright Act but not in relation to breach of copyright—for example, internet piracy. We deal with that in other ways. Those are civil wrongs. There is no capacity under section 110A of this bill for anyone other than the agencies whose names I have read out to you to make an access application. 


The second argument that is used in relation to this issue is that, if there were a party to civil litigation—it does not matter what kind of civil litigation it might be, but for the purposes of this discussion we are talking about copyright—it might seek to subpoena or, by a process that you will remember, Senator Xenophon, known as third party discovery, to obtain the metadata and get at it in that way to make out its case in a civil action. That is dealt with, though, by the new section 281(2), which provides—I am paraphrasing here, but I will ask you to look at it for yourself—that, if a subpoena or a notice of disclosure is directed to a third party that retains metadata, and that metadata is retained or kept solely for the purpose of compliance with that act, then it may not be used in the civil litigation either. This is a compliance obligation. The primary obligation under this bill is a compliance obligation. The reason we are having this debate is that increasingly telecommunications service providers are not retaining metadata and, with the evolution of technology, the only reason they will be expected to retain metadata is to be compliant with the provisions of this act. If the only reason they are retaining metadata is compliance with the provisions of this act, they cannot be answerable in respect of that metadata to a subpoena or a notice for third party discovery in a civil action either, whether it be a breach of copyright claim or any other form of civil claim.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:26):  I am grateful to the Attorney for his answer, and I am well familiar with third party discovery, Anton Piller orders and pre-action discovery. Sadly, I still keep a practising certificate going so I can do my pro bono work, which always seems to cost me money. But I just go to this issue: the Australian government's Australian Institute of Criminology website has a publication—it is a few years old now, from back in November 2004—by Tony Krone where reference is made to the fact that, as the Attorney points out, the Copyright Act provides civil and criminal sanctions to protect copyright. My question is in respect of, for instance, section 132(1), as it then was, of the Copyright Act, where it was an offence to make, sell, trade or import an article that infringes copyright or to distribute an infringing item for the purpose of trade. Under section 132(2) of the Copyright Act, there were clearly criminal sanctions. Can the Attorney assure us that, in the course of a prosecution under those sections, citizens who may have downloaded the latest episode of Game of Thrones would not be drawn into a criminal investigation in respect of copyright? That is the nub of my question. In other words, where metadata can be used in copyright matters, can citizens' metadata be accessed?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:28):  That is not going to happen in relation to citizens, because in the example you have posited you are talking about citizens engaging in a download. That is something which the government yesterday introduced other legislation to deal with by way of the remedy of an injunction—a civil claim. So the example that you have posited is dealt with by the civil law. In particular, I invite you to inspect—no doubt we will be debating it in this chamber when we come back for the budget sittings—the government's copyright and online piracy reforms, which are modelled on the British copyright act and the copyright laws of other European jurisdictions. That is the way in which those matters will be dealt with. Breach of copyright, as I say, is primarily a civil wrong, and a civil action is not what this legislation is concerned with. There is this explicit prohibition, in the section to which I have directed your attention, on accessing metadata retained solely for the purpose of compliance with this act by way of a subpoena or a notice for third party discovery.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:29):  I apologise if my questions have not been direct enough. I really want to conclude this line of questioning. Does the Attorney concede that there will be circumstances when, as part of, say, an investigation of a breach of copyright as a criminal offence under the Copyright Act—or perhaps in the seeking of an injunction under the proposed copyright regime that has yet to be debated in this parliament—in order to prove the case against those who are profiting from that breach of copyright, there will need to be access to the metadata of people who will not be charged with a criminal offence?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:30):  The only agencies that can access metadata are the proposed section 110A agencies. Those agencies include the state police departments and the Federal Police—that is true. But the way the examples you are positing are dealt with will be through civil actions. In particular, the very reason the government is introducing, based on English and other models, a new injunction power to protect intellectual rights is to make sure that these proceedings to protect copyrights are taken in the civil courts.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:31):  There are criminal offence provisions in the Copyright Act, but the purpose of those criminal offence provisions is not to deal with the examples you have given. You talked about, for example, somebody downloading copyrighted material—file sharing is the practice most commonly instanced. That is not the kind of commercial grade breach of copyright which the offence provisions of the Copyright Act are directed to. If that conduct were ever to be the subject of judicial proceedings, they could only ever be civil proceedings—to which this legislation does not apply. No civil litigant, other than through a notice for third party inspection or subpoena issued by the court, could have access to metadata in support of a proceeding like that. Because the obligation being observed by the service providers is an obligation which will now be solely an obligation in obedience to this act, the sole purpose test would, one would expect, be met in every case. So metadata could not be accessed in civil litigation in those circumstances either.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:33):  Hopefully this is my final question on this matter. Can the Attorney not envisage circumstances where, as part of a criminal prosecution under the Copyright Act—particularly in relation to section 132, subsection 1, and section 132, subsection 2, where we are talking about that commercial grade where people are making money out of that breach of copyright and so it is clearly a criminal offence under the act—metadata may be sought from those who downloaded the material from the unauthorised provider, the copyright breaker, in order to build the case against the person being charged under section 132 of the act? If there is a concession to that effect—if the minister says that is the case—then I do not need to ask anything further on this.

There is no doubt that there are criminal offence provisions in the Copyright Act. Those criminal offence provisions are directed to what one might call large scale or commercial scale theft of intellectual property. They are not concerned with unlawful downloading, for example. They are not concerned with what ordinary citizens may perhaps be doing. That is dealt with through the civil law and it will be dealt with in particular by the industry code that is being developed under the auspices of my department and Mr Turnbull's department—and, in relation to offshore pirate sites, by the new injunction power that I just mentioned to you, which is the subject of a bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday.


This bill is about serious crime. It is about terrorism, organised and transnational crime and paedophilia. That is its entire purpose. That is the mischief that the authorities seek to deal with through this bill.

It is the purpose of this act to deal with the kinds of conduct—the kinds of pathologies if you like: terrorism, paedophilia and organised and transnational crime. That is why the government is bringing forward this legislation. The agencies set out in proposed section 110A are the law enforcement agencies. The law enforcement agencies deal with the entire corpus of the enforcement of the criminal law, that is true. But just as I said to Senator Leyonhjelm last night: we are not interested in using this complex system to enforce parking tickets, nor are we interested in using it to police intellectual property law, because there are other statutes—other mechanisms—to deal with it.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:48):  I move amendment (12) on sheet 7661:


(12) Schedule 1, item 5, page 28 (before line 32), before the definition of Defence Minister, insert:



   content, in relation to a communication, includes the following:


   (a) any speech, music or other sound that forms part of a telephone conversation;


   (b) the body of an email;


   (c) a short text message sent from one telecommunications device to another;


   (d) a website address;


      (e) any other user‑generated content.


This amendment is intended to provide a definition of 'content' in the legislation. The lack of a definition of content has caused a great deal of industry disquiet.


I have used two sources in developing this definition. One was comments by Malcolm Turnbull, when he was asked to draw a distinction between metadata and content. However, I have also paid attention to the lengthy enumeration of the kinds of information to be retained and now brought into the bill as a consequence of recommendations of the PJCIS. My hope is that, added together, this will ensure that the law enforcement agencies are always able to distinguish between the two—retained data and content.


As we have heard from the Attorney-General, content is not to be retained, and yet content is not defined. I want to fix that. I want to ensure that the agencies do not deliberately or inadvertently intrude on content simply because there is an absence of definition. Perhaps the definition of 'content' that I have put into my amendment could be improved, but once again my aim here is to improve what is a bad law, not perfect it.


So the purpose of the amendment: there is a definition of what data may be retained. There is a clause which says that, for the avoidance of doubt, content is not to be retained, but 'content' is not defined. The purpose of my amendment is to define 'content', to ensure that it is not retained.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:50):  Senator Leyonhjelm, this is a very laudable contribution, if I may say so, because your objective and the government's objective are the same, although obviously we approach the same objective in a different way. I am sorry to say, though, Senator Leyonhjelm, that in the government's view your proposed amendment would not have the effect that you wish it to have.


Your amendment, for a start, is an inclusive and therefore a non-exclusive definition, so it leaves the nature of content still as an open-ended category. That is the first point to be made about your amendment. Secondly, your amendment says:



content, in relation to a communication, includes the following:


(a) any speech, music or other sound that forms part of a telephone conversation;


(b) the body of an email;


(c) a short text message sent from one telecommunications device to another;


(d) a website address;


(e) any other user-generated content.


In relation to the first four, Senator Leyonhjelm, there is a lot of content that I can readily call to mind that would not be caught by that definition. For example, moving visual images—videos—would not be caught by that definition. But it may have unintended consequences. There is no definition of 'the body of an email'. I have told you that the address line of an email is regarded as content. It could well be argued that the body of an email is the principal message and not the address line, so it may well be that when a court came to interpret these words, were they to be included, it might have the opposite effect to what you intend. In relation to (e), 'any other user-generated content', that merely repeats without further explication the word 'content'.


So, Senator Leyonhjelm, I think that by this definition you actually narrow the protection. It is the government's intention to broaden the protection. Do not for a moment think, Senator Leyonhjelm—I am sure you would not actually think—that we did not consider this very carefully and did not take advice about the right way to go about this. The very firm view at which the government arrived—and I would commend this view to you, Senator—is to leave 'content' as broadly expressed as possible. It is expressed in section 187A(4) of the bill as 'the contents or substance of a communication', and it could not be more broadly expressed than that. But if we try to list what content is then, by omission, it may well be that we include content within the reach of this bill that we actually want to protect from being accessed by authorities. That is why, in proposed section 187A(4) of the bill, we express 'content' not by way of definition but as broadly as possible according to the ordinary English language usage of those words, but in section 187AA(1) of the bill, in the table, we describe the metadata narrowly. If you want to limit access to metadata to very strict confines and protect content as widely as possible, that is the way you would do it: you would have a specific definition of 'metadata' and an open-ended, comprehensive or all-embracing definition of 'content'. That is what we have done.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:55):  The Australian Greens will be supporting this amendment, notwithstanding Senator Leyonhjelm's acknowledgement that people may quibble with the definition. But we are here to improve bad law, not perfect it. I also—this does not happen all that often, but I am going to do it anyway—acknowledge the distinction that Senator Brandis draws and the difficulty of drawing distinctions between the two. The government believes it has done the best that it can.


The only contribution that I want to make to the debate, in supporting this amendment, is that the distinction between content and metadata is becoming wholly arbitrary. As many smarter people than me, with a better background in this technology than me, have pointed out, metadata in aggregate is content. There is a false distinction that has driven the entire debate: we will protect the phone call or the content of the email behind buttresses of judicial oversight, procedure and reporting, but we will offer no protection whatsoever for the 340,000 warrantless metadata accesses. This implies—actually, it does not imply it, because spokespeople from both the major parties have said this in black and white—that metadata is somehow of a lesser quality and is less invasive. That is simply not true, because that term—which is not a term of art—encompasses such a wide variety of material. Metadata includes simple material like who owns that particular handset or who holds that particular subscription. That is metadata, and we have already agreed that we are not proposing to constrain agencies to require a warrant to get that, because it is reasonably routine. But this same word 'metadata'—with that innocent definition of who owned a particular subscription at a particular time—also covers data that can be used to track your precise location. That is invasive. That is content. It is intrusive. The state should not be able to peer into that material without the same protections that apply to listening to a phone call or reading an email. It is not that hard.


I recognise that legal definitions will always lag behind technology, and that is partly why we are in the mess that we are in, but I fundamentally reject the artificial distinction between content and non-content. Metadata in aggregate is content, and we do nothing to protect that in Australian law. Before you jump up, Senator Brandis, to tell us that that is the prevailing system, that this bill does nothing to make it worse et cetera, I agree with you. The prevailing system is broken, and today you propose to make it worse.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (10:57):  Senator Ludlam, I am not sure if you are an aficionado of Alice in Wonderland, but you have just fallen down the rabbit hole. Your statement, 'Metadata is content,' reveals a fundamental gap in your appreciation of a reality here.




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order, the debate has been pretty courteous and reasonable so far. I did not say, 'Metadata is content.' Please do not mislead the chamber. I said, 'Metadata in aggregate is content.' At least quote me accurately.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  That is a debating point, Senator Ludlam. Resume your seat.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Ludlam, perhaps you want to resile from what you said, but at the beginning of your contribution you did not include those qualifying words. You said, 'Metadata is content.' If you want to resile from that now and add a qualification to what you said, we all occasionally misspeak in this chamber, but you actually did say, 'Metadata is content,' and of course it is not.


Although we have all regularly used the word 'metadata' in this debate, of course you rightly say, Senator Ludlam, that 'metadata' is not a term of art. I am sure you will understand that the word 'metadata', which is a jargon phrase of no clear and specific meaning and no technical standing—and I see you nodding in agreement, so we are of a common mind about this—does not appear anywhere in this bill, for that very reason. So, rather than use a jargon phrase of no certain meaning and no technical standing, what the government has set out in the table subjacent to subsection 187A(1)(a) is a description of six categories of information which, in a loose way, we have been referring to in the course of this debate and which has been referred to in the course of public discussion as metadata. But, for the very reason you acknowledge, we have very carefully avoided using this cant, jargonistic phrase of no certain meaning and no technical standing. That is why the legislation has been structured the way it is. I really think, Senator Ludlam—because I know you know a lot about this area; I respect the fact that this is an area of specialist knowledge you have, more so than most in this chamber—you really should reconsider whether you go along with Senator Leyonhjelm's approach here. By defining content to limited categories what Senator Leyonhjelm has done, with respect—inadvertently, I am sure—is to confine the exclusion. Senator Leyonhjelm, who thinks this is a bad bill, would nevertheless want to improve it by making the exclusion of content as comprehensive and all-embracing as possible; but by defining certain categories of content to the exclusion of other potential categories, you are achieving the opposite effect, Senator Leyonhjelm.


As a matter of logic we should leave content as broadly expressed as possible. As I counselled in a slightly different context last night: these are not legal terms of art. Content is not a legal or a technical term. The substance of a communication is not a legal or a technical term. We should avoid an infinite regression into the thesaurus. We should simply use plain English and express that plain English as widely as it can be expressed.

The Committee accepts the evidence provided by industry representatives that content can be reliably separated from data for the purpose of data retention. The Committee notes that, currently, service providers are required by law to separate content from data when complying with historic and prospective data authorisations made under Chapter 4 of the TIA Act.


Senator Leyonhjelm's concerns about the precision of the dataset are adequately addressed by the existing exclusion of content under the TIA Act and by the increased precision of the dataset achieved by amendments to the bill in the other place.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:04):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (25) and (27) on sheet 7669 together:


(25) Schedule 1, item 5, page 29 (after line 8), after the definition of infrastructure, insert:



   journalist means a person who is engaged and active in the publication of news and who may be given information by a source in the expectation that the information may be disseminated in the form of:


   (a) news, current affairs or a documentary; or


   (b) commentary, observations or opinion on, or analysis of, news, current affairs or a documentary.


(27) Schedule 1, item 5, page 29 (lines 26 to 29) omit paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of source, substitute:


(a) to another journalist; and


(b) in the normal course of the other person's work as a journalist; and


What we have attempted to do here is important and it was canvassed to some degree in the other place during the debate there last week. The government, for reasons I hope Senator Brandis will explain to us shortly, has a definition of journalist as regards who is actually protected by the clauses the government and the opposition agreed to, to provide for a warrant and the public interest advocate. The definition of journalist therefore becomes fairly central as to who can avail themselves of these protections. Some senators will recall that when we were debating shield laws provisions that made amendments to the Evidence Act, going back now a couple of years, the chamber agreed—do not let me get this wrong, but I seem to recall Senator Brandis was on the same side of this vote as we were; in fact, I think it was unanimous—that the definition of journalist should be framed fairly broadly so that in the event that people needed to avail themselves of the protection of shield laws, we would effectively leave it to the courts to decide whether it was in the public interest that somebody should be protected and allow their source to be protected. The reason for that should seem reasonably obvious: if you are doing investigative journalism or you are reporting in the public interest and you need to protect a source, or if people doing this work want to publicly disclose wrongdoing or corruption—if you have been given information that relates to government corruption or malfeasance or any of the other things the press gallery does every day to keep our democracy strong, if you will; that is probably overstating it a bit, but it is tremendously important—they can get that material into the public domain without being prosecuted. Whistleblowers have their lives ruined. I know Senator Xenophon has had a lot to do with Mr Allan Kessing. This society is tremendously hard on whistleblowers and the protections that do exist have in the past proven quite inadequate at protecting people. But shield laws are one way of keeping a source out of harm's way so that people can anonymously report to journalists stuff that needs to get into the public domain. We framed 'journalists' very broadly, and I will read the definition that is in the Evidence Act at the moment:


 … journalist means a person who is engaged and active in the publication of news and who may be given information by an informant in the expectation that the information may be published in a news medium.


Linked to that:



news medium means any medium for the dissemination to the public or a section of the public of news and observations on news.


Those two definitions are deliberately broad, and my recollection is that they were unanimously agreed to by the Senate so that the courts can decide—not on some arbitrary distinction of whether the person got paid to write the piece. Whether they are working for the Sydney Morning Herald and whether they are sensible grown-up journalist should not matter. The decision is whether the disclosure is in the public interest. The source should be able to available themselves of the protection and the journalists should not be dragged through the courts and potentially jailed. We agreed to leave that broadly. 


The government, in drafting this new category of quasi-warrant to protect journalists, is proposing to narrow the definition. I do not understand why you would do that. I think the standard that we apply for shield laws should apply in this instance. That is why we brought these amendments forward today. Arbitrarily constraining such protections as have managed to be hammered out, we think, are inadequate, but are better than what prevailed before.


I do not see any reason at all why that should depend on whether or not you draw a pay cheque. If it is important work—if it is public interest reporting—and if sources' lives or livelihoods are at risk, then that protection should be offered.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:08):  Before responding to your contribution, Senator Ludlam, if I may say so, you do me less than justice. Not only was I part of the body of opinion in the Senate that supported the shield laws; I actually introduced the legislation. 



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. It was introduced initially as a private senator's bill by me. It was initially opposed by the Labor Party and the Greens. It was, in subsequent months or years, then adopted by the Labor Party, but the legislation was originally introduced by me. So I have nothing but commitment to the idea of the rights of journalists to protect their sources. That is why, although initially it was not part of the bill because journalists and their sources were never the target of this bill, I am quite comfortable with the amendments that were introduced in the House of Representatives by Mr Turnbull and which now comprise division 4C of the bill.


If I may say so, Senator Ludlam, I think you make a very good point. If only for the sake of consistency, I think it is undesirable that there should be different definitions of 'journalism' in different Commonwealth acts. You have instanced the provisions in the Evidence Act that protect journalists, which extend confidentiality to journalists' sources, and which I supported. On reflection, I think the way that it is expressed is a little wide but unfortunately the problem that you identify would not be solved were we to adopt your amendment because there are other definitions elsewhere in the Commonwealth law which apply this definition of 'journalist'. In particular, division 119 of the Criminal Code, subsection 119.23(f), uses this definition of 'journalism'. 


You know as well as I do, Senator, that the definition of 'journalist' has been the subject of much public discussion, especially driven by the expansion, beyond the imagination of people even 30 years ago, of the media through which journalism may be published and conducted. But the definition that is preferred here—a person who is working in a professional capacity as a journalist—is not necessarily a contradiction of your amendment. There is no doubt that it is more generic. It is not a question of whether a person draws a pay cheque, by the way. A person can be working in a professional capacity as a barrister even though he does not render a fee for a particular case. The definition calls attention to the notion that there is such a profession as journalism, whose members consciously identify as such and who observe certain professional standards so that they are recognisable members of a body of people who undertake the same profession. That is the concept sought to be captured here.


It may well be that, given that there are inconsistent definitions of 'journalism' or 'journalist' already in the Commonwealth statues—and, indeed, between the Commonwealth and the states—some regularisation and standardisation should be adopted. But, for the time being, given that this definition is more generic, and is consistent with one of the two definitions currently extant in the Commonwealth statutes, the government prefers to deal with the issue in this way.

We are satisfied that the definition in this bill is appropriate and that judicial interpretation will resolve at least some of the difficulties. I note, though, that it is consistent—as I think Senator Brandis just indicated—with the definition of 'journalist' now incorporated in the Commonwealth Criminal Code.

I am grateful that the Attorney-General acknowledges that it is an issue that there are different definitions of 'journalism'. The one that has been chosen here is the one taken from the Evidence Act, not the Criminal Code. We prefer it. I certainly would encourage the Attorney-General to move towards a consistent definition of journalism in Commonwealth legislation at the earliest opportunity—and today is a good one.

In fact, I put it in my own amendments to the bill, along with the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, around the same time. I think in terms of the raw politics of it, the fact that the coalition in opposition was prepared to support it, prompted the government of the day to bring that forward, and I think Senator Ludwig did play a very constructive role with respect to that. I am grateful to the Attorney for the role he has played in journalist shield laws, from opposition. You do not have to be in government to come up with good ideas, Attorney. I think that puts it in an historical context. Journalists are in a better position as a result of those shield laws, but my concern is that with the metadata laws they may be in a worse position.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:16):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7672 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 6L, page 34 (lines 8 to 10), omit paragraph 180G(1)(b), substitute:


(b) a purpose, effect or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify another person whom the eligible person knows or reasonably believes may be a source;


(2) Schedule 1, item 6L, page 34 (lines 26 to 28), omit paragraph 180H(1)(b), substitute:


(b) a purpose, effect or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify another person whom the authorised officer knows or reasonably believes may be a source;


These amendments amend the criteria under which an eligible person or enforcement agencies may not make an authorisation for disclosure of information relating to a journalist or their employer unless a journalist information warrant is in force. The amendments alter the provisions to include where the purpose or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify another person who is known to be a source, or is reasonably believed to be a source, so that an authorisation cannot be made under these circumstances.


If we can put this in context, what is proposed in the bill in terms of the excluded categories—that is, those categories for which a journalist's information warrant must be sought—is that you need to show if a purpose of making the authorisation would be to identify another person whom the eligible person knows or reasonably believes to be a source. I know this is not competition law, but it does remind me about the debate of the effects test that the Harper review is looking at. In other words, to show purpose, and to simply confine it to purpose, seems to me to be unduly narrow. That is why I have moved an amendment that would allow a broader approach that would allow inclusion of the words 'effect' or 'likely effect'. The argument by those seeking authorisation is: 'This is not our purpose,' but if the effect or likely effect of making the authorisation would be to identify a source, then I think that should be included. I think it is consistent with what the government has put up in this bill. It is intended to have a regime in place to protect journalists' sources. But having it confined simply to purpose, particularly in the context of the public interest advocate regime, where there is not an opportunity for the media organisation to be consulted, I think it is important that we have it as broad and consistent as possible with the purpose of what the government's amendment says. The aim of these amendments is to broaden the circumstances under which information cannot be disclosed without a warrant, to ensure that sources are not inadvertently identified. My concern is that the word 'purpose' is simply too narrow; that it ought to include 'effect' or 'likely effect', because of the debates we have seen in other pieces of legislation about the narrowness of the word 'purpose' in the context of what the government's amendment is trying to remedy.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:19):  The government is not persuaded by that argument. In general, Senator Xenophon, you do make a good point about the importance in legislation that tries to avoid an adverse effect of dealing with both purpose or effect so that volitional conduct—that is, conduct engaged in for a purpose—or unintended conduct that is not intended to have that purpose but might nevertheless have that effect, should both be caught. Then, in certain circumstances, there are powerful logical arguments for doing that, although I myself have never been persuaded that section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act is one of them. But when we confine what is prohibited to conduct engaged in for a purpose only, as opposed to engaging for a purpose or likely to have an effect, what we focus on really is the motive of the person whose conduct is under scrutiny. What we have heard throughout this debate is that there is a risk that this scheme could circumvent a journalist's capacity to protect their sources by allowing applications for their metadata to identify the source. That is, in essence, what we have been told is the mischief here. The government, after consideration, responded to that by including division 4C into the bill. The mischief that was identified to us was not incidental or second-order effects. The definition that was identified to us was 'conscious, deliberate, purposeful, advertent abuse of the system', and that is what this provision deals with. Your provision would take it a great deal further, but what we are dealing with here is the very mischief that was identified that needed to be corrected by the insertion of division 4C.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:21):  Does not the Attorney concede that the words 'effect or likely effect' would, whilst making the provision broader in terms of the categories for which a journalist information warrant is required, still be consistent with the aim of the government's amendment—that is, to protect a journalist's source? Or rather—and I will stand corrected—in order for a journalist information warrant to be granted, there is a process prescribed in the bill. The circumstances in which that occurs are now confined in part to showing that there is a purpose for making the authorisation: to identify another person or eligible person. You could have the person seeking the warrant simply say, 'The purpose is not to seek to identify the source, but it could well be an incidental effect to that.' Given the government's negotiation with the opposition and listening to concerns of major media organisations including News Ltd and Seven West in this country, does not the Attorney concede that there may be circumstances when the bill in its current form as proposed by the government would not require an authorisation, because the authority or agency seeking the metadata says, 'This is not the purpose for the authorisation, but it may well be a collateral effect that a source will be disclosed and therefore we do not have to go through this process of the public interest advocate'?

I would rather say I acknowledge the point you make. I do acknowledge the point you make, but that is not the reason this provision has been included. The reason this provision has been included is to prevent abuse of the system. Purposeful conduct is the mischief to which we are directing our attention here. I might point out to you that there is not a sole purpose here. Unlike elsewhere in the legislation, there is not a sole purpose test here. So long as it is a purpose, that will be enough to invoke the protection. If we were going to go further to seek to comprehensively protect journalists or their sources from incidental unintended effects then what you say would be absolutely correct, but that is not what we are seeking to do. It is not what we have been asked to do. What we are seeking to do—what we have been asked to do—is to include, in effect, an anti-abuse provision to prevent the deliberate misuse of this provision to interfere with the confidentiality of the relationship between journalists and their sources. This provision, as I am sure you would acknowledge, does so.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (11:25):  I might take this opportunity to comment not only on these two amendments but the subsequent two sets we will be dealing with in a moment but that are in some sense related. Senator Xenophon's amendments seek to introduce a different warrant regime for journalists purportedly modelled on the provisions in America, as we discussed earlier in the committee stage. I note that in the other place Labor supported amendments which implemented such a warrant regime being introduced for journalists; however, I should note that those amendments were successful and that the bill before us already incorporates a warrant regime for the protection of journalists and their sources which was not previously in place.


Senator Xenophon would evidently prefer a different model from that agreed between the government and the opposition. It seems that the main focus of the amendments is what Senator Xenophon refers to as 'contestability'. Senator Xenophon says that his model is based on the law in the United States, though it is not clear precisely what law he is referring to. Of course, as we understand, the Americans do have a very different system from us.


We should be clear: there is no precedent in Australia for warrants to be subject to a contested hearing. Warrants are not issued in an interparties hearing. They are not the subject of a full contested hearing. The reasons for this are obvious. Notifying the subject of a phone tap or a search warrant defeats the purpose of seeking such a warrant. Best practice is, however, for an independent body to appear before the issuing authority and to test the argument of the agencies and argue against the issue of the warrant. In Queensland and Victoria bodies called public interest monitors perform this function. This bill implements best practice through the creation of a public interest advocate modelled on the public interest monitors in Queensland and Victoria. It is the first and only time such special protection has been provided to a warrant scheme at the Commonwealth level.


Though it is inappropriate for warrants to be contested in the way that Senator Xenophon desires, the public interest advocate model ensures that the warrant-issuing process is rigorous and that the issuing—




Senator Xenophon:
  I rise on a point of order. We have not got to that particular amendment yet. I acknowledge—I concede—that Senator Collins has spoken to the particular amendment that is before us, but I wonder whether it is more appropriate for it to be dealt with—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Seselja

Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I apologise to Senator Xenophon if he was distracted by Senator Brandis at the outset when I indicated I would be reflecting.



An honourable senator interjecting—  




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Well then, I do not need to apologise. I indicated at the outset that I would be covering the three sets. If you objected to that, Senator Xenophon, you might have responded at the outset. I am of course quite keen to facilitate progress in relation to the consideration of the amendments in this committee stage, so I was seeking to address the three sets at once. If Senator Xenophon can bear with another paragraph then that will conclude my contribution on his amendments.


I was saying that although it is inappropriate for warrants to be contested in the way that Senator Xenophon desires, the public interest advocate model ensures that the warrant issuing process is rigorous and the issuing authority hears strong arguments against the issuing of a warrant. Labor believes that this is the appropriate model overall, thus related to the first two amendments and the subsequent ones. We share Senator Xenophon's goal, however, of protecting journalists and we believe that the model already incorporated in this bill achieves that goal.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:30):  The Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. They are consistent with what we have been arguing the whole time. The final model that the government and the Labor Party came to has been quite heavily criticised, but nonetheless Senator Collins is quite right: this framework does not actually exist at the moment and there is no public interest monitor equivalent at a Commonwealth level. That is something that we have argued for.


In the course of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act inquiry that we conducted over the last 15 months or so we heard quite compelling evidence from the public interest monitors in the two states where they do exist that it does not slow down the process. What it does is that it provides a measure of contestability in the warranting process. What they found was that the agencies did take a little while to get used to having interposed in the process somebody they were not used to being there and who would say, 'Does this need to be this broad? Could this be narrower? Could it be for a briefer period of time? Do you need all of these devices?' Eventually, once the agencies got used to having that process of contestability interposed into the process, it streamlined things and it was in the view of the public interest monitor that we took evidence from that it had actually immeasurably improved the process.


But I have seen the crack in the government's armour with the two acknowledgments that have been made: firstly, that metadata is not so completely harmless or innocuous that journalists and their sources do not deserve a measure of protection; secondly, that we would introduce therefore a process that is not really the same as ordinary warrants. It is kind of quasi-warranting process. Also, we would introduce a public interest advocate who performs not an identical role, but a similar role, for this narrow category of professionals, as the government has defined them. We have got problems about the way that it is constructed; but I think it does open the door to some of the arguments that we have been running for a couple of years now, as the system requires further safeguards.


What Senator Xenophon has done is make the obvious point here that you can put a better lock on the front door and try to protect the journalists a little bit better than they are at the moment, but the back door is wide open. If somebody, for example, publishes a scoop on the horrors that are unfolding on Manus Island and the government wants to know or police agencies or the federal police are instructed to find out who that journalist is talking to, they will need to go through these new procedures that have been put into place. It is my expectation that, of course, the warrant will be issued. It might take a little bit longer and it might have a few more checks and balances in the way, but no doubt the warrant will be issued.


Nonetheless, that is a piece of process that does not exist at the moment. Of course, the agency is just as likely to go through and scrape the phone records of people working on the island and find out which phone numbers come up. If those numbers match those of a journalist, then you do not really need to go any further. It completely renders obsolete the shield laws that everybody on all sides of the debate just argue passionately in favour of. You do not need to take a journalist to court to find out who they have been talking to; you just find out who they have been talking to. That is part of the problem. All sides of politics—although the government somewhat reluctantly—have recognised that this is an issue, even as the government does continue to try to track down the source of stories that are appearing that it does not like the content of.


What Senator Xenophon's amendment attempts to do—it is difficult to enforce, I suspect, but nonetheless I think the intent is noble—is to ensure that if somebody is reasonably suspected of being a source then they would also be protected. I think that is a noble intention. It goes some way towards improving the kind of protections that most people believe should be in place, but it does not deal with the fundamental issue of the fact that the Australian government is instructing the federal police a reasonable number of times a year to go and find out who is putting unpopular stories into the press. That is disgusting behaviour. We should not be throwing additional procedural hurdles in the way; we should make that very, very difficult to do, if not completely unlawful.


We are happy to commend these amendments to the chamber and hope that they pass.

Amendment (3) inserts a new note at the end of proposed section 180K to specify that a Public Interest Advocate must be notified if further information is required under that section. This is in accordance with proposed section 180X and consequential to my proposed amendments to the section. In essence, proposed section 180K says


(1) The Minister may require the Director-General of Security to give to the Minister, within the period specified in the requirement, further information in connection with a request under this Subdivision.


(2) If the Director-General breaches the requirement, the Minister may: 


   (a) refuse to consider the request; or 


   (b) refuse to take any action, or any further action, in relation to the request.


It seems to me that the government's bill is unclear as to whether the further information that is required by the minister is information that will necessarily be given to the Public Interest Advocate. I am not sure whether it was an oversight or a deliberate policy position, or whether the Attorney would acknowledge or even concede that there ought to be a revisiting of this at some time down the track. The Public Interest Advocate does not have the same access to journalists as exists in, say, the US protocols, which we will talk about shortly. The argument is that if further information is requested then the Public Interest Advocate ought to be aware of that in the context of arguing the public interest case in the issue of a journalist information warrant.

180X


Public Interest Advocates



(1) The Prime Minister shall declare, in writing, one or more persons to be Public Interest Advocates.




Notice to be given to Public Interest Advocates



(2) If a notice is given to a Public Interest Advocate under section 180L in relation to a request for a journalist information warrant, or under 180T in relation to an application for a journalist information warrant, the notice must:


   (a) be in writing; and


   (b) include:


      (i) the information and material that was provided with the request or application, as the case may be; and


      (ii) the additional information or material (if any) that is prescribed by the regulations.




Further notice if additional information provided



(3) If:


   (a) the Minister requires the Director‑General of Security to give further information under section 180K in connection with a request; and


   (b) the Director‑General gives the further information or refuses to give the further information;


then the Minister must notify the Public Interest Advocate, in writing, of the further information or the refusal as soon as practicable.


(4) If:


   (a) the Part 4‑1 issuing authority requires the chief officer of an enforcement agency, or a person other than the chief of the agency, to give further information under section 180R in connection with an application; and


   (b) the chief officer, or the other person, gives the further information or refuses to give the further information;


then the Part 4‑1 issuing authority must notify the Public Interest Advocate, in writing, of the further information or the refusal as soon as practicable.




Submissions



(5) A Public Interest Advocate may make submissions:


   (a) to the Minister about matters relevant to:


      (i) a decision to issue, or refuse to issue, a journalist information warrant under section 180L; or


      (ii) a decision about the conditions or restrictions (if any) that are to be specified in such a warrant; or


   (b) to a Part 4‑1 issuing authority about matters relevant to:


      (i) a decision to issue, or refuse to issue, the warrant under section 180T; or


      (ii) a decision about the conditions or restrictions (if any) that are to be specified in such a warrant.


(6) In making a submission under subsection (5), a Public Interest Advocate must have particular regard to protecting the public interest and the need to act as a contradictor to the person requesting, or applying for, the journalist information warrant.




Regulations



(7) The regulations may prescribe matters relating to the performance of the role of a Public Interest Advocate.




Declaration not legislative instrument



(8) A declaration under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.


Amendment (4) amends proposed section 180L(2) to alter the circumstances in which the minister must not issue a journalist information warrant. The changes to the proposed subsection provide that the minister must not issue a warrant where reasonable notice of the request has not been given to the Public Interest Advocate. Further, reasonable notice must also be given in writing to the person to whom the warrant relates. The minister must also invite the person to make a submission on the request. The minister must also be satisfied that the organisation's functions would extend to the making of authorisations regarding that particular person and that the public interest in ensuring the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the source.


These amendments also provide that the minister must give the greatest weighting to the public interest provisions set out in proposed subsection (2)(b). These amendments will ensure that paramount consideration is given to public interest matters by the minister when considering whether to issue a journalist information warrant. The aim of these provisions is to ensure that the greatest consideration is given to the impact of issuing such warrants on the public interest and to provide basic requirements that must be met in terms of notice to the Public Interest Advocate and in allowing a journalist a right of reply in considering the public interest.


Senator Collins in her contribution made mention of the US system. It is true, as the Attorney has said, that there isn't a system of warrants as such and that the material—metadata—is retained by the NSA. As a result of a very unfortunate raid on Associated Press in Washington DC a couple of years ago, US Attorney General Eric Holder put in a number of protocols which have been evolving, but essentially the general rule is that journalists—media organisations—are consulted before that metadata is accessed so they can argue the access. I think one of the minister's advisers is shaking his head—maybe it is at me; maybe I have that wrong; I will be happy to stand corrected. That is my understanding of the protocols and guidelines I have seen, and I am sure we will get to this at some other time. I am conscious of the time. Could I get the Chairman's guidance—are we going to 11.50?



The CHAIRMAN:  Till 10 past 12.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I should know this by now, shouldn't I? Thank you.




Senator Brandis:
  Don't take that as an invitation to go longer!




Senator XENOPHON:
  No, I will not be prolix or even otiose; I just want to get on with it! In the United States, it can be said that media organisations are, as a general rule, consulted in relation to the access to metadata. That is my understanding of the protocols that have existed. Items (5) and (6) are consequential to the passage of item (4). Item (7) inserts a note after proposed section 180R to specify that the public interest advocate must be notified—that has been dealt with.


Item (8) amends the bill so that the same requirements of the minister as set out in item (4) of my amendments also apply to the issuing authority. This ensures consistency and that the public interest is a paramount consideration in the decision made by any authority in issuing a journalist information warrant. Item (9) amends proposed section 180X, which relates to the public interest advocates. These amendments set out the requirement for a notice to be provided to the advocates in relation to journalist information warrants. The amendments provide that the notice must be provided in writing and include the information or material that was provided with a request or application and any other information as prescribed by regulation.


Further, the amendments include provisions to ensure that the advocate will be provided with any further information requested of the relevant authorities by the minister or issuing authority, or notified if the request to provide information is refused. The amendments also provide that the advocate may make submissions to the minister or the issuing authority about matters relevant to the issuing of the warrant. The advocate may also specify conditions or limitations to be placed on a warrant if necessary. The amendments also specify that the advocate must have particular regard to protecting the public interest and the need to act as a contradictor or devil's advocate to the person requesting the warrant. Further, the amendments provide that the regulations may prescribe matters relating to the role of the public interest advocate and that the declaration made by the minister or by the Prime Minister to declare a person as an advocate is not a disallowable instrument.


The aim of these amendments is to flesh out the role of the public interest advocate to ensure that it has specific roles and duties to maintain the public interest and act as a true advocate. The amendments I propose will provide greater protection for journalists through greater scrutiny of the journalist information warrant process. Without an active, appropriately focused advocate who has the ability to ask journalists or media organisations about aspects of the application, I think the public interest advocate will be quite circumscribed in what they can do. Also, I referred in my speech to the second reading debate to the sorts of concerns that Associate Professor Clinton Fernandes has raised about the public interest advocate, which I will not unnecessarily restate now.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:48):  Senator Xenophon, I completely disagree with you. In the government's view, these amendments are entirely unnecessary and some of the bases upon which you put them forward are wrong in fact.


Let us go back to first principles here. This legislation maintains a status quo, which is a warrantless system. Subject to certain oversight obligations, including a public reporting obligation, which we discussed earlier on, nevertheless, access to metadata as opposed to content is warrantless; access to content requires a warrant. Against that general rule, the government has—without conceding the necessity to do so but I can understand the arguments nevertheless—agreed with the opposition to include a special set of provisions for journalists, in proposed division 4C. Within that special set of exceptions to journalists to protect the relationship between them and their sources, we have, uniquely, required warrants.


Furthermore, in creating the design of the warrant system so far as it applies to journalists, we have included extensive public interest criteria, which are set out in proposed section 180L—public interest criteria that do not exist in that form in other Commonwealth legislation which creates warrant regimes. On top of that—in superaddition to that—we have, by section 180X, created this new office of public interest monitor to act, as you rightly say, as a kind of devil's advocate or an advocate for the public interest, to contest whether or not a warrant should issue.


That is unique. No warrant regime under Commonwealth law includes the creation of a specific public interest advocate whose peculiar role is to make the issuance of a particular kind of warrant contestable. So we have piled Pelion upon Ossa here in order to create as many safeguards as can possibly be made.


But let us remember that what this bill is about is the facilitation of criminal investigations. Although journalists and, indeed, the sources of journalists are not the target or the focus or the purpose of this bill—because, as I said before, I have never met a journalist who was a terrorist or a paedophile or an organised criminal—nevertheless, in the very unlikely situation where the police did want to investigate a journalist or a source in relation to the matters which are the object of this bill, you can immediately see how advance notice to the person who was the subject of their concern would prejudice the investigation.


Senator Xenophon, you say that such a system as you propound exists in the United States. You are wrong. Let me give you the advice that I have in relation to the American system. In the American system, the most recently issued Department of Justice guidelines require that the Attorney-General approve any subpoena ordering a carrier to disclose metadata for the purpose of identifying a journalist source. Those guidelines do not require agencies to notify journalists before such a subpoena is issued. I am informed that they do not. Is that right, Mr Bassi? My adviser Mr Justin Bassi here, who is the person you spied shaking his head before, is extremely well informed about these matters, about the American system. Indeed, I notice he is even wearing his CIA cufflinks today in honour of the occasion—just to feed the paranoia of Senator Ludlam over there. That is not the way the American system works. Your amendments address a problem that does not exist. This legislation could hardly have been based on a more carefully constructed set of safeguards.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:53):  Can the Attorney concede a couple of things? No; can he acknowledge or can he just respond that there is no requirement in this legislative regime on the Public Interest Advocate for the Public Interest Advocate to in any way necessarily be a devil's advocate, to be a contradicter, in terms of the application being sought?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:54):  I do not acknowledge that at all. Section 180X, which sets out the role of the Public Interest Advocate, describes the role of the Public Interest Advocate in subsection (2), which gives the Public Interest Advocate the role to make submissions to a minister about matters relevant to a decision to issue, or refuse to issue, a journalist information warrant under section 180L, or a decision about the conditions or restrictions, if any, that are to be specified in such a warrant. If you go then to section 180L, it states those matters which the minister must have regard to in subsection (2) include the public interest consideration set out with some particularity over six sub subparagraphs in subsection (2)(b). Those are the very matters, including that elaborately articulated series of public interest considerations which the minister must consider, which the Public Interest Advocate must also consider. 


It is not necessarily the case that the Public Interest Advocate will be a contradicter of the minister; but, in an appropriate case, having regard to the public interest considerations, he may be. It is his role to be the Public Interest Advocate. That is the name of the statutory office, and the function of the statutory office is to, as it were, second-guess the minister's judgement in relation to those six particular aspects of the public interest set out in subsection 180L(2)(b).

 (South Australia) (11:56):  I do not have a set of CIA cufflinks, unlike Mr Bassi. I do not want a set; it's okay. I say this to your advisers; to your team: I have a great regard for them. You have a pretty exceptional team, although some of them did take me to task quoting Taylor Swift rather than Britney Spears. I think we are both missing out on cultural references, Attorney, in respect of that! 




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You need to get out more. 




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Collins, that is right. I do not have a life, not in this place. 



Senator Leyonhjelm interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  I am not being prolix, Senator Leyonhjelm. I do want to put this on notice, because I have made the assertions I have made in good faith in terms of the Department of Justice in the United States and their media policies. I am happy to table or provide a copy of this material to the Attorney's office. It says: 


The first and most significant policy change would be to reverse and expand the presumption concerning notice to, and negotiations with, affected members of the news media whenever Department attorneys seek access to their records related to newsgathering activities.


In other words, metadata. It goes on to say:


The presumption will ensure notice in all but the most exceptional cases.


I can go on, but that is the basis of the material that I read over a number of months now that there is, as a general policy, an ability to negotiate, an ability for there to be discussions, with media organisations in respect of this. That is the practice following the disastrous Associated Press raid in Washington DC a couple of years ago. That is the distinction. Obviously, there are exceptions that, if it is a matter of urgent national security in the context of people's safety being at risk, those rules are thrown out the window. But, as a general proposition, I am very happy to provide not a set of cuff links but the material that I have downloaded from the US Department of Justice that does talk about protocols and about how, as a general rule, there are negotiations before the access to metadata. So it is not a criticism of your very fine advisers but the basis upon which I made those statements in relation to that.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:58):  Briefly, the Australian Greens will be supporting the amendments that Senator Xenophon has brought forward for the simple reason that anything which improves the operation of the Public Interest Advocate is, we think, a profoundly good idea. Senator Brandis took enormous umbrage a short time ago at my admittedly loose language when I pointed out that the government relatively frequently 'instruct'—which was the word I used—the Federal Police to investigate the source of various leaks. They do not instruct; you are quite right, Senator Brandis. But you regularly refer matters to the Federal Police and then they get to choose. One example that is pretty close to my heart, and Senator Hanson-Young addressed it in her second reading contribution, is that at least eight times which we are aware of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection referred matters that appeared in TheGuardian and TheWest Australian newspapers about sexual abuse, child sexual abuse, violence, self-harm, attempted suicides, rape and catastrophic mistreatment of human beings in our care. Instead of investigating the issues that have been raised in the public interest by these publications, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—at least eight times that we are aware of—has asked the Federal Police to try and find out who is talking. That is the kind of repellent behaviour that provides part of the reason why we are supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment.


It is my understanding that the way the public interest monitors in Queensland and Victoria work is that they are contradictors. They are not there to decide whether or not a particular warrant is in the public interest; they are actually there to push back and argue for the narrowing of warrants—for example, to circumscribe the number of people, the number of devices or whatever it is. They are there to improve the quality, and evidence that we took in our telecommunications interception inquiry, as I mentioned before, indicated that processes improved in Victoria and Queensland as a result. My question to Senator Brandis is: would it be your expectation, on your reading of the way that the government has drafted these amendments, that the Public Interest Advocate, in performing the role that you have established, would be arguing against referrals by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, or could we expect that those investigations by the Federal Police would continue?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:01):  I do not know enough about the acts that establish the public interest monitors in Queensland or in Victoria to tell you whether they are specifically mandated by their acts to be a contradictor. Obviously, I am not going to talk about particular cases that may be the subject of an investigation or speculate about how this provision might bear on those cases, the facts of which I am not really familiar with. 


It is enough to say, I think, that the role of the public interest monitor is to ensure that the public interest considerations that are set out quite exhaustively in the act are properly articulated to the relevant decision maker. It may conceivably be that the public interest monitor independently arrives at the view that the issuance of a warrant is in the public interest, applying those criteria in proposed subsection 180L(2)(b), but that is entirely a matter for him. If I may use an analogy with the way courts operate, I would envisage that the public interest monitor would be like an amicus curiae: they would bring an independent mind to bear on the application of these statutory tests to the particular case and, if they were of the view that the public interest was not served by the issuance of a warrant, then they would contest the judgement of the minister. If they were of the view that the public interest was not served by the refusal of a warrant, they could contest that judgement too, I dare say. He or she is to be an independent mind to independently assess and, where appropriate, contradict the minister in the assessment of the application of the public interest criteria to a particular request for a warrant.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:03):  I appreciate the Attorney's response, but unless they are required to be a contradictor—I am not sure whether the Attorney is proposing to do so in respect of the regulations yet to be promulgated once this bill passes—that changes the very nature of their role, in my view. It makes a very substantial difference in the way that they would deal with particular matters. In the context of these amendments—and in the context of having, in my view and in the views of Senators Leyonhjelm, Ludlam, and the Australian Greens, a more robust mechanism in place—does the Attorney concede that metadata retention can be used for sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act, which are the so called leak provisions? 


We are talking about the case of Mr Kessing, who maintains to this day his innocence. That was a case where he wrote a report about airport security that was subsequently leaked to The Australian. It was a report that prompted the Howard government, to their credit, to implement a $240 million upgrade to airport security, after a subsequent report by Sir John Wheeler. Does the Attorney acknowledge that, in the context of metadata surveillance, section 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act would be acts to which metadata access would relate?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:05):  I do not have those provisions in front of me, but I have told you on many occasions now—by reference to the identified agencies and the proposed scope of the act—who can access metadata and for what purposes it can be accessed.


In relation to what you have to say about the public interest monitor, can I just make this point: I do not think that the public interest monitor should necessarily be a contradictor. As Mr Bassi reminds me, there is an intrinsic tension between saying that the public interest monitor should be a contradictor and that the public interest monitor should be independent. If there is a statutory requirement that the public interest monitor has to be a contradictor, then what it means is that the public interest monitor cannot operate independently; he cannot bring an independent mind to bear on his own appraisal of whether the criteria in proposed subsection 180L(2)(b) are satisfied or not. If you say he has a statutory obligation to be a contradictor, you are saying he cannot be an independent officer. I think that that is a very bad principle.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:07):  May I suggest to the Attorney that sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act relate, in broad terms, to whistleblowers, to the leak of information. And, as Philip Dorling, the investigative journalist, said, technically you could be done for saying how many paperclips Centrelink has, in respect of that itself being an unauthorised disclosure of information. Whistleblowers will be affected by this in terms of the context of sections 70 and 79, because the AFP is the relevant authority; it is one of the authorities prescribed by this bill. 


The consequences of metadata surveillance are that it will be so much easier for sources to be tracked down. It will have an effect on investigative journalism in this country in the sense that sources and journalists will have to avoid pretty much any electronic communication in order to communicate with each other. The consequence of that will be, I think, to make the job of investigative journalists in this country that much more difficult in the context of other legislative frameworks to do with whistleblower protections, to do with sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act. 


That is why, if there is going to be a public interest advocate—and I commend the government and the opposition for at least having the public interest advocate up there as a matter to be considered in this bill—I agree with the comments of Professor Clinton Fernandes from the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at the University of New South Wales. He said that there is a real problem that the public interest advocate could well be flying blind and have one hand tied behind their back in the absence of knowing, being aware of, what arguments the journalist may have to say, 'We want to protect the source for these reasons, because there are a whole range of factors that need to be considered in the context of the story that we are investigating.' 


I will have a discussion with your advisors and with you, Attorney, if you are minded to, about the US approach. I am only relying on information from the US Department of Justice. But there does seem to be an approach where media organisations are consulted much more comprehensively than is being suggested in this particular bill.

Proposal to refer a


bill to a committee:





Name of bill:



International Aid (Promoting Gender Equality) Bill 2015




Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:



Two of the Millennium Development Goals (3 and 5) state the importance of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. Our Foreign Minister has stated a recognition that the empowerment of women and girls is fundamental to promoting economic growth and stronger aid-recipient communities.


An inquiry offers the chance to investigate the following:


Australia's official development and humanitarian assistance does not recognise that simply increasing economic activity in the recipient country fails to address the specific historical and cultural bases for gender inequality.


There is no legislated requirement that gender equality be considered in the delivery of aid programs, regardless of any stated intention.


In some cases, projects with a simple aim of increasing economic activity may indeed exacerbate these problems.




Possible submissions or evidence from:



Aidwatch, International Women's Development Agency, Care Australia, Action Aid, Micah Challenge, Scarlett Alliance, Aidwatch, Plan International, The Oaktree Foundation, APHEDA, Results International, ACFID, Oxfam, World Vision, Global Poverty Project, ActNowPNG, Save the Children, Jubilee Australia, Medicin sans Frontiere Sydney.

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE





Proposal to refer a


bill to a committee:





Name of bill:



International Aid (Promoting Gender Equality) Bill 2015




Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:



Two of the Millennium Development Goals (3 and 5) state the importance of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. Our Foreign Minister has stated a recognition that the empowerment of women and girls is fundamental to promoting economic growth and stronger aid-recipient communities.


An inquiry offers the chance to investigate the following:


Australia's official development and humanitarian assistance does not recognise that simply increasing economic activity in the recipient country fails to address the specific historical and cultural bases for gender inequality.


There is no legislated requirement that gender equality be considered in the delivery of aid programs, regardless of any stated intention.


In some cases, projects with a simple aim of increasing economic activity may indeed exacerbate these problems.




Possible submissions or evidence from:



Aidwatch, International Women's Development Agency, Care Australia, Action Aid, Micah Challenge, Scarlett Alliance, Aidwatch, Plan International, The Oaktree Foundation, APHEDA, Results International, ACFID, Oxfam, World Vision, Global Poverty Project, ActNowPNG, Save the Children, Jubilee Australia, Medicin sans Frontiere Sydney.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Judiciary Amendment Bill will support the consolidation of the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) into the Attorney‑General's Department.




The decision to consolidate AGS into the Department 



The decision to consolidate AGS into the Department was announced in the 2014-15 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook as part of the Government's Smaller Government Reform Agenda. This is a comprehensive package of reforms designed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and focus of the Commonwealth public service. When fully implemented, they will reduce the number of government bodies by 251 since the last election. Our efforts to deliver a smaller and more rational government footprint will ensure a more flexible and unified public sector which is better able to respond to emerging pressures and ensure that services are best aligned to the evolving policy priorities of the Government.


The consolidation of AGS into the Attorney-General's Department will create opportunities for greater efficiency in the operation of the consolidated department. But the Government wants to make clear that AGS will maintain its own distinct functional identity within the Department, including the AGS name and its well-regarded independent brand. Its well-deserved professional reputation will be maintained. This will allow AGS to continue to operate effectively on a business as usual basis for its staff and its clients, and with the necessary level of professional independence within the Department. 




Consolidation draws on the best aspects of both AGS and the Attorney-General
'
s Department



It is of critical importance that the Government has a strong and expert government solicitor. The decision the government has made is to consolidate the AGS within the Attorney-General's Department, not to abolish it. AGS will continue to be the nation's leading provider of legal services to the federal government and its agencies. In fact, AGS and the Department have operated as one organisation in all but 15 of AGS's 110 years of operation 


AGS lawyers have a special understanding of the context in which the Commonwealth operates – and that the government needs tailored advice and practical solutions. These can be a legal solution, a policy solution or some combination of both. They consider issues from a whole-of-government perspective and take into account broader public policy goals. 


The Attorney-General's Department will continue to carry out the central policy and coordinating functions of the Attorney-General's portfolio, with one of its key roles being to provide legal and legal policy advice to the Attorney-General as First Law Officer of the Commonwealth and chief legal adviser to Cabinet. It draws on highly-qualified legal policy experts and legal practitioners with experience in dealing with a range of high priority, sensitive and time critical matters.


Consolidating the AGS into the Department will strengthen their respective capacities to support the Attorney-General as First Law Officer and chief legal adviser to Cabinet by providing a comprehensive source of authoritative advice on key Commonwealth legal and legal policy issues. It will also ensure that the Department and AGS are well-placed to deliver high quality legal services and legal policy advice on legal issues of importance to the Commonwealth and the most critical matters of state.




Secretary
'
s Review 



Following consolidation, the Secretary of the Department will conduct a review of legal services to identify efficiencies that can be gained in government legal costs. The review will encompass the role of in-house legal practices in Commonwealth departments and agencies, including how in-house advice is organised, to ensure more coordinated and aligned advice to the Government in the future. 


The review will look to the Commonwealth legal services market as a whole and ultimately seek to deliver the best outcomes for the Government from the full array of legal services available. 


The terms of reference for this review are yet to be developed, and both Government and private sector stakeholders will be invited to participate in the consultation process for the review. Any savings from the consolidation will also be quantified following this review.




Key features of the Bill



Schedule 1 to the Bill will amend the Judiciary Act to support consolidation. 


Schedule 1 repeals references to AGS being a statutory corporation and its responsibilities as a separate corporate entity.


Instead, the Australian Government Solicitor will be a senior public servant within the Attorney-General's Department and will oversee a separate legal practice group and report to the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department. The definition of AGS lawyers is updated to reflect that they will be employed under the Public Service Act 1999 framework working under the direction and supervision of the Australian Government Solicitor. 


Consistent with ensuring business as usual and providing minimal change to existing operations, amendments have been made to enable the AGS to continue providing the same legal services to the same range of clients, and to continue to operate on a commercial and competitive basis for the great majority of its work. 


Schedule 2 to the Bill makes the necessary consequential amendments to existing Commonwealth legislation with references to the AGS.


This includes amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 to ensure that the AGS can continue to perform and exercise the Director's functions when requested pursuant to the existing DPP legislation. 


Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 will ensure that AGS continues to be exempt from its operation. This ensures the confidentiality of AGS' legal advice and its relationship with its clients continues to be protected.


Schedule 3 provides transitional arrangements regarding the consolidation. The purpose of Schedule 3 is to ensure certainty and efficiency for existing AGS staff, clients and third parties that regularly engage with AGS.


Transitional matters addressed by the Bill include:


assets and liabilities of the former AGS


references in instruments to the former AGS


legal proceedings of the AGS


contracts which were entered into by the AGS


exemption from State and Territory taxation


reporting requirements of the AGS, and


employee arrangements of the AGS. 


The Schedule includes a general deeming provision to ensure that references in existing Commonwealth laws to AGS are taken to be references to the AGS under its new structure. 


Finally, there is also a time limited transitional rule making power to enable a legislative instrument to be made to address unforeseen circumstances or unintended consequences arising from the consolidation within the year following commencement of the Bill.




Conclusion



AGS and the Attorney-General's Department enjoy a very close, productive and professional working relationship and have done so for many years. As I observed earlier, AGS and the Department have operated as one organisation in all but 15 of AGS's 110 years of operation. It has also been said that AGS is the custodian of the Commonwealth's legal corporate memory. This continuity is critical to providing trusted and relevant advice to the Commonwealth on critical issues for the Commonwealth. 


Consolidation will only enhance this relationship—a relationship exemplified by the cooperation between AGS and the Department on significant matters such as Operation Sovereign Borders, the Royal Commissions and high priority, sensitive and time critical matters in constitutional law, national security law and public international law. 


The Judiciary Amendment Bill will further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a consolidated AGS in the Department, while at the same time bringing together some of the brightest legal minds in this country, improving the provision of Commonwealth legal services and streamlining the administration of law in Australia.

 (South Australia) (12:21):  I table the explanatory memorandum and move:

The speech read as follows—



FOOD STANDARDS AMENDMENT (FISH LABELLING) BILL 2015


The introduction of this Bill is timely, given the recent increased awareness of the need for clear and concise country of origin labelling on food. Sadly, this awareness has come as Australians have fallen ill with Hepatitis A as the result of contaminated frozen berries imported from China. It is a great tragedy that people have had to suffer for the Government to take action on food labelling, despite the fact that both the previous and current governments have been made well aware of the need for improved standards.


The measures in this Bill directly implement the recommendation from the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into the current requirements for labelling of seafood and seafood products, which reported on 18 December 2014.


Under the current Standard 1.2.11 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, country of origin labelling is required for fish, including fish that has been mixed or coated with one or more other foods. This requirement also applies to fish that has been processed in some way, either by cutting or filleting, smoking, curing, pickling or cooking. It is also important to note that in the context of the Code, fish is considered to be ""any of the cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates and aquatic invertebrates including shellfish, but does not include amphibians and reptiles""1.


This Standard, however, includes an exemption for food that is offered for immediate consumption by restaurants, canteens, schools, caterers or self-catering institutions, prisons, hospitals, or other venues listed in the Table accompanying the Standard.


Following its inquiry, the Committee recommended that this exemption be removed, and that country of origin labelling should apply to fish provided for immediate consumption; for example, for fish sold in restaurants, bars and fish and chip shops.


This recommendation follows the removal of the exemption in the Northern Territory, where fish from overseas provided for immediate consumption is required to be labelled as 'imported'. The aim of this is to provide consumers with greater choice and information, and the Committee inquiry found that these measures had high support both from consumers and the food services sector.


The provisions in this Bill will require Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to develop and implement a Standard within 12 months to require country of origin labelling to apply to fish offered for immediate consumption in the food services sector in Australia. The exemption applies to a broad class; however, the Bill defines the food services sector to ensure that the requirements do not have a negative impact on venues where consumers are unlikely to be able to choose between products. For example, the definition in the Bill does not include hospitals, schools, prisons and so on, but does include restaurants, bars and takeaway shops. It also allows the Standard to be applied to other entities if required.


The Bill also exempts the first Standard developed under the Bill from the usual processes that must be adhered to by FSANZ, as the legislation already sets out many of the matters to be included in the Standard that would otherwise need to be determined by these processes. This exemption does not, however, apply to any subsequent Standard developed under these provisions.


Ultimately, this Bill is not just about increasing consumer knowledge and capacity for exercising choice. It is also about supporting Australian produce, and by extension Australian producers, and fostering Australian industry and jobs.

 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (12:26):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CASH:
  The government will not be supporting this motion. This is a politically driven motion moved by those who are fundamentally opposed to the government's offshore processing policies. The allegations referred to in this motion have been extensively investigated independently by Mr Philip Moss, the former Integrity Commissioner and former head of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity. The Moss inquiry was a comprehensive investigation which drew information from a wide range of stakeholders, including Serco and the Australian Federal Police. The department has accepted all of Mr Moss's 19 recommendations and has only just commenced implementing its responses. The department will continue to have discussions with the government of Nauru on the best way forward to implement the investigation's recommendations.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that general business notice of motion No. 698, standing in the names of Senator Gallacher and Senator Hanson-Young, be agreed to.

 (Victoria) (12:35):  by leave—In principle, I supported the previous motion before the chamber today. Transparency and investigation are paramount, particularly when the target is the treatment of vulnerable people, women and children. However, I am concerned that this motion is too soon, in light of the fact that I have read the Moss review that was handed down only last Friday. I acknowledge the fact that the terms of reference may have been narrow, but I am impressed with the integrity of Mr Moss and the veracity of his findings. This motion called for a report within three months, and I believe that is unrealistic. If, in three months' time, the government's response to the Moss review has been inadequate, I will support the motion if it is put again.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (12:26):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CASH:
  The government will not be supporting this motion. This is a politically driven motion moved by those who are fundamentally opposed to the government's offshore processing policies. The allegations referred to in this motion have been extensively investigated independently by Mr Philip Moss, the former Integrity Commissioner and former head of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity. The Moss inquiry was a comprehensive investigation which drew information from a wide range of stakeholders, including Serco and the Australian Federal Police. The department has accepted all of Mr Moss's 19 recommendations and has only just commenced implementing its responses. The department will continue to have discussions with the government of Nauru on the best way forward to implement the investigation's recommendations.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that general business notice of motion No. 698, standing in the names of Senator Gallacher and Senator Hanson-Young, be agreed to.

 (Victoria) (12:35):  by leave—In principle, I supported the previous motion before the chamber today. Transparency and investigation are paramount, particularly when the target is the treatment of vulnerable people, women and children. However, I am concerned that this motion is too soon, in light of the fact that I have read the Moss review that was handed down only last Friday. I acknowledge the fact that the terms of reference may have been narrow, but I am impressed with the integrity of Mr Moss and the veracity of his findings. This motion called for a report within three months, and I believe that is unrealistic. If, in three months' time, the government's response to the Moss review has been inadequate, I will support the motion if it is put again.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-03-26,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:46):  I rise today to speak on the Public Governance and Resources Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2015. This bill is another stage in the financial framework reform process that Labor commenced when in government. We initiated a review process, the Commonwealth Financial Accountability Review, which involved two years of detailed consultation and consideration of issues. This culminated in the development and passage of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The new legislation, which replaced the old Financial Management and Accountability Act and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, established an integrated financial management framework for entities within the Commonwealth. The concept was to design an appropriate framework that would improve the performance, accountability and risk management across government.


The 44th Parliament has dealt with a number of pieces of legislation relating to the implementation of the framework governed by the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 which Labor has supported. The bill before the Senate today continues the reform process we put in place to ensure the continual effective operation of the financial framework. This bill may be the first in a series of bills that may be introduced and developed in the future that would continue to improve the financial framework arrangements. This would be similar to the series of financial framework legislation amendment bills that Labor put through the parliament when we were in government to deal with similar issues to the previous financial framework legislation.


The vast majority of the amendments contained in this bill are housekeeping items of a technical nature and are uncontroversial. Some of the proposed changes that are in this bill relate to the amendments that were unable to be made at the time of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act when it took effect on 1 July 2014. This was for various reasons. As a result of further consultation with relevant entities, these amendments can now be made to the relevant legislation to ensure that they interact properly with the new financial framework.


I will go briefly through the contents of the bill. Schedule 1 of the bill amends sections of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 which relate to definitions, corporate plans, arrangements for GST and streamlining the administration of transfer of functions between non-corporate Commonwealth entities. These amendments ensure a continuation of the arrangements that were in place under the previous financial framework, as well as providing sufficient flexibility in relation to corporate plans.


Schedule 2 of the bill amends sections of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2014 which relate to reporting periods, Commonwealth repayments and other items which ensure the improved operation of the financial legislation.


I will return to schedule 3 later. Schedule 4 of the bill ensures that the Clean Energy Regulator and the Climate Change Authority are listed entities for the purpose of the new financial framework. These are sensible and necessary amendments to make.


Schedule 5 of the bill amends 22 acts, including the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011, the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act 1997 and the National Land Transport Act 2014, to align and harmonise them with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act to ensure there is consistency with the new financial framework. These amendments do not change any of the policies or statutory functions contained in the legislation that is sought to be amended.


Schedule 6 of the bill makes amendments to a series of acts which are, in the main, minor, technical in nature and uncontroversial, such as amendments to the Reserve Bank Act, the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act, the Future Fund Act and the Health Insurance Act. There are also amendments to the Air Services Act, which will provide Airservices Australia with an increased ability to manage foreign currency risk effectively—that is, by managing foreign currency exposure on operating expenses including insurance premiums and technical support services worth around $5 million to $15 million per annum. Similar statutory powers to manage foreign currency risk already reside with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, the Reserve Bank and Australia Post. 


Schedule 6 also includes amendments to the Australian Trade Commission Act relating to the inclusion of domestic tourism as part of the Austrade chief executive officer's function. The shadow minister for tourism, Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler in the other place, made some substantial remarks in relation to this amendment. He is a passionate champion of tourism. Schedule 7 of the bill relates to transitional provisions relating to legislative instruments and transitional rules that the Minister for Finance can make. Again, these are uncontroversial.


Labor ensured this bill was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee to give us assurance that there were no issues with the legislation before us today. In particular, sections of the bill that we sought assurance on included schedule 3, which relates to the removal of body corporate status from the Clean Energy Regulator and the Climate Change Authority. Page 4 of the committee's report said: 




In its submission the Clean Energy Regulator stated that it had been consulted on the proposed amendments to its enabling legislation and 
'
fully supports them
'
.





The proposed amendments in schedule 6, relating to the Auditor-General Act, would expand the current exemptions to disclosing information on proposed audit reports to drafts, extracts of proposed reports and any other reports, including drafts, which are created for the purpose of preparing a proposed audit report. The current exemption means that, unless the Auditor-General
'
s permission is granted, people who have been provided with a proposed audit report for comment cannot provide it to others. There is a two-year imprisonment penalty attached to this unauthorised disclosure. The amendment in this bill would also extend the imprisonment penalty to the unauthorised disclosure of the drafts and other extracts that I described earlier. We just want to make sure that there are no issues with these provisions of the bill. The recommendation of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee was that the Senate pass the bill.




I note that this bill was debated in the other place in the week that the most recent so-called 
'
repeal day
'
 was scheduled. I remind the House of the situation the last time the parliament dealt with legislation relating to public governance, when Labor successfully moved amendments to save the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines only to see them abolished in another way 24 hours later. The same government that gave $1.1 billion in new tax breaks back to multinationals cut the pay of the cleaners who clean their offices by $2 an hour. That is an amount that is probably not much to those of us who enjoy the job of representing our constituents in this place, but I can assure honourable senators that losing $2 an hour causes considerable pain to those who work as cleaners. The deception perpetrated by this government on this issue was deplorable. The lowest paid people in parliament suffering 
the biggest cuts—it is just crazy. It is ideology gone mad and it is not a proper policy position to be adopted. But that is what the coalition has done. That is what this government is about—look after the big end of town and then the bottom end can look after itself. That is why we were presented with a budget that targets the lowest paid in this country—a budget that targets those who cannot look after themselves, a budget that is about unfairness and a budget that has been rejected by the population of this country. I think it epitomises the ideology of this government when it can take $2 an hour from a cleaner and give billions of dollars back to its mates at the big end of town.





Notwithstanding that, Labor understands the necessity of a well-functioning financial framework. We are providing our support for this bill, as it is necessary for the continual improvement of the financial framework and is a further aspect of the reform process that we put in place when we were in government. I just wish it had not been used to attack some of the poorest and weakest people in this parliament.

The Abbott government's cuts to the legal assistance sector are already being felt by the most vulnerable Australians. Cuts to community legal centres mean that the assistance available to families experiencing domestic violence has already been affected.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


It is no wonder that the Australian public have lost all confidence and all trust in this rabble of a government sitting across here. This is a government that has absolutely no idea about the issues that affect ordinary people. Nothing could have been clearer in the strident response from the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne, to a legitimate question about how we look after some of the poorest and the most underprivileged people in this country. Senator Payne had an opportunity for two minutes to say that she cares about what happens to people who are unemployed or who rely on a pension, and people who are being ripped off by unscrupulous companies. But what did she do? She spent about one minute and 20 seconds of that response not caring about what is happening to the poor and not caring about what is happening to people who are being exploited. All she did was to try to score political points. The public are over these political points. The public want governments that care about communities. The public want governments that care about jobs, that want to do something about jobs, that want to get kids into apprenticeships, that want to get kids off the dole but do not want to push them in for six months with absolutely no income and force them to rely on charities. Being strident and being uninformed—like Senator Payne was today—is not a good example of how a government should work. You cannot just care about political points. You have got to care about the Australian public.


When people go to the ballot box in New South Wales on Saturday they can look at the quality of the senators, the ministers and the MPs in New South Wales. And Senator Payne epitomises this uncaring approach from this government. They only want to look after the big end of town. They only want to look after their mates who will pull up in their Bentley and hand over the brown paper bag for their election funds. That is the people that they want to look after. They do not care. They do not care about the workers in Penrith, they do not care about the people in Blacktown, they do not care about the people in Mt Druitt. All they care about is the big end of town. Let me tell you, Mike Baird is no different. He wears the same blue tie, he belongs to the same party and he takes the same political position—that is, they do not care about those who are in trouble.


Nothing could epitomise this more than the response of the federal coalition and the New South Wales Liberal government to the bushfires in the Blue Mountains. When you hear Senator Payne stand up saying that things are under consideration, remember she told the people in the Blue Mountains—those who had been moved out from getting any support from the federal government—that that would be 'under active consideration'. These are people who could not get into their homes, people who could not get out of their homes, people who had lost their fridges, people who had lost their food. People who had to go into hotels were told, 'You are on your own.' But what they actually did was tell the people in the Blue Mountains that the issue of providing support was 'under active consideration'. So when you hear the Liberals talk about 'under consideration' and 'under active consideration', you know that this is another way of not delivering for people in New South Wales. We have got two MPs up in the Blue Mountains: we had Mrs Louise Markus, the member for Macquarie, who was absolutely silent. She is one of the worst members of parliament ever in this country. And there is Mrs Roza Sage, the state member, who is absolutely pathetic. She did not raise her voice against Blue Mountains people getting their wages and their entitlements cut.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing orders is it appropriate for this senator who has an unenviable reputation for abuse to speak to other members of other houses of parliament in the way and give them the descriptions that this senator has?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. I have been listening carefully, and I do not think Senator Cameron has breached the standing orders. Senator Cameron, you have the call.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:07):  I am delighted to take part in this debate. Who did Senator Cameron just seek to demonise? Louise Markus, the member for Macquarie. He said 'one of the worst ever'. What did he ever say against Craig Thomson, the member for Dobell? Absolutely nothing. And there you have a window into the moral standards of the New South Wales Labor Party represented by Senator Doug Cameron in this chamber. Louise Markus is a wonderful person and wonderful human being who has a genuine heart for her electorate, and he demonises her in favour of Craig Thomson. Let us not be mistaken that this Senator Doug Cameron was the same Senator Doug Cameron who weaved the magic numbers within the Labor Party to allow Senator Macdonald's namesake, the corrupt Ian Macdonald, to retain his endorsement in New South Wales. So, if the people of New South Wales want to do a compare and contrast, let them do so on the basis of the words that have just come out of Senator Cameron's own mouth.


But the reason I want to be part of this debate this afternoon is to remind all honourable senators of the great words of the former Prime Minister John Howard, who said, 'Never rely on a quote alleged by your political opponents, especially those in the Australian Labor Party.' Today in question time Senator Wong sought to put o me certain alleged quotes from Prime Minister Abbott. Allow me to read into the Hansard the full quote of what the Prime Minister said:


Debt as a percentage of GDP, which would have been 120 per cent under the policies of the former government, is about 60 per cent under the policies of this government.


Listen to this:


Now, that's too high. We want to get it in a much, much better situation than that.


Oh. Why would Senator Wong refuse to put that into the quote to contextualise that which the Prime Minister had said? Because she went on a deliberate campaign to misrepresent that which the Prime Minister had said. He then went on to say:


We'd like over time to achieve this green line, but a ratio of debt to GDP at about 50 or 60 per cent is a pretty good result—


and what were the words missing?—


looking around the world, 120 per cent is a dire result and that's what we were going to have under the policies of the former government.


Senator Wong is an intelligent human being and therefore you cannot assume anything other than that she may have done this deliberately. When you read the words of the Prime Minister saying that a debt ratio of 60 per cent is:


… too high. We want to get it in a much, much better situation than that—


you have a clear understanding from the Prime Minister of Australia that he is going to continue to deal with the situation.


The Labor Party legacy of 120 per cent was dire. At the moment, we have a trajectory of about 50 to 60 per cent. In anybody's language, halving that debt trajectory is good news. However, it is not enough, and that is what the Prime Minister himself said when he said:


Now, that's too high. We want to get it in a much, much better situation than that.


And so let's just get this exceptionally clear: we as a government are determined to clean up the mess by the Australian Labor Party—especially that left by the failed Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition in this place. The sad thing is that each and every time we try to fix their mess they deliberately stand in the way—standing in the way in circumstances where their own policies of saving five thousand million that they took to the election that they then vote against after they get defeated, deliberately seeking to avoid the issues of the day.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:13):  I rise on the back of that speech that we have just heard from Senator Abetz to say that we as the Labor Party will stand in the way every single day that this government tries to roll over the Australian people and completely reject any of the claims that they made before the election. The fact is this government has a massive trust deficit and it will never overcome the trust it has broken with the Australian people. That is because they absolutely said one thing before the election and have been delivering a completely different thing since they got in the place. Before the election there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to the pension, no changes to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS, for good measure. And what do we have? The Prime Minister arrives and he says, in a manner of words, 'I didn't say that.'


And we hear it again. He made a number of comments last year in the lead-up to the budget. He claimed at that point in time that a ratio of 14 per cent debt to GDP was a 'debt and deficit disaster', and on the back of that he went ahead and created the most appalling budget it has been my great displeasure to witness in my entire life in this country. He could not have constructed a more unfair budget, and in doing so he revealed the Liberal Party and everything it stands for both here in the federal parliament and in the state of New South Wales. If they can take a knife to education, they will slash and burn. If they can take a knife to health, they will cut it and they will scalpel away at it until it is a shadow of its former self. They are determined to break access for every Australian to education and health. They want to set up a two-tier, Americanised system where the rich get richer, and can access health and education, and the poor do not even get a look in. That is what they are in the business of constructing right now.


What did they do the minute they got in here? They said, 'Debt and deficit. Debt and deficit. Debt and deficit.' They drew everyone's attention to a fake emergency. Then they went ahead and, in their very first budget, they cut $50 billion out of health—but that was not quite enough. They had a crack at education, which was their next target, of $30 billion. Mike Baird followed that lead with a $1.7 million cut from education, axing the jobs of 1,100 teachers and staff and cutting courses such as the second-chance HSC syllabus, tourism, hospitality and IT. Access was wiped for young people on the Central Coast, where youth unemployment is hitting nearly 22 per cent. But Mike Baird says, 'Let's cut TAFEs and get rid of it.' He has the hide to call it the Smart and Skilled program. It is dumb and it is removing any opportunity for skilling for young people. There is a pattern here: say one thing before the election, get in and then cut like crazy in health and education. This is what is going on with this government.


What can we hope for from them? In the lead-up to this next budget, he we are hearing them one day saying, 'It is a debt and deficit disaster,' and they are getting ready to kill us again in the budget. The next day they say, 'It is really not that bad.' The Prime Minister actually did say those very words. He said:


… a ratio of debt to GDP at about 50 or 60 per cent is a pretty good result …


It is for this year, because he has decided that it is. Last year, 13 per cent was a disaster. We have him saying, 'I never said that. I never said that.' People know what they heard this Prime Minister say. They know that he promised not to cut health and education and they can see exactly what he did. There are massive cuts to health and education. We should be very, very worried that if a Baird government gets into New South Wales in the next 48 hours, we will see the end of a powerful state giving this government the sort of scrutiny that it deserves.


At the moment, there is no consultation with experts across the fields. The government are just making of their policies they go, flip-flopping from one day to another, to the point where an eye roll from the Foreign Minister has now secured foreign investment. I can only hope that Christopher Pyne and Ms Ley—




Senator Abetz:
  That's Mr Pyne to you.




Senator O'NEILL:
  I can only hope that Mr Pyne and Ms Ley can actually develop their eye rolling skills to adequate sufficiency that they might also save a little bit of money for health and education for this nation. In the meantime, the people of New South Wales should be aware: if you believe in health and if you believe in education and a fair go, Labor is the only way to vote on Saturday.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:18):  I perfectly understand the theatre of politics and I do understand that those on the opposite side are meant to come into this place, pluck figures out of the air and just read the talking points that they have been given. But I would implore upon them, if they are genuine about the crisis of confidence that is engulfing politics in this country, to actually speak the truth. That is because what we have is people like Senator Cameron and Senator O'Neill coming here and reading verbatim what is put in front of them, with no regard to the veracity of the claims that they make.


Senator O'Neill has reflected about changes to health and changes to education. Let us put this in perspective: there are no changes in the forward estimates and, in fact, there are actually improvements in the forward estimates from when we came into government for health, pensions and education. But what Senator O'Neill is referring to is these ridiculous last-minute decisions of their government, which said, 'In 2020, 2025 or 2050, we are going to put more money into something.' The money was never there. It was a figment of the then Prime Minister's—I cannot even recall who was, quite frankly; it could have been Mr Rudd or Ms Gillard—imagination. It was a falsehood peddled upon the Australian people.


The result of that is that we have the likes of Senator Cameron and Senator O'Neill coming in here, who make the spurious claims and who pluck elements of a speech and then try to portray that without any context around it. It is demeaning. I have respect the Senator O'Neill. I even have respect to Senator Cameron, albeit that he is part of the socialist mob and a much different philosophical line than myself. He does believe in something. But this diminishes them in the public capacity.


Let me make the point that the crisis of trust in politics and politicians in this country is born of the actions of the New South Wales Labor Party and the federal Labor Party, because the federal Labor Party backed up that man who abused the trust of many thousands of union members, Mr Craig Thomson. Mr Craig Thomson, we will recall, was a man who used hard-earned money of those low-paid workers from the Health Services Union for prostitutes and to rent the red ruby room in New South Wales for his prostitutes. What sort of betrayal of trust is that? We also know that those on the other side—including Senator Dastyari, as he was the shop steward for the Labor Party at the time—spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of Labor Party funds defending Craig Thomson, defending the indefensible.




Senator O'Neill:
  Eleven NSW Liberals were removed!




Senator BERNARDI:
  Senator O'Neill is here defending it again. It diminishes you in the public square, Senator O'Neill. If you want to uphold yourself as someone of integrity, you do not come in here and defend the actions of Senator Dastyari and the disgraced Craig Thomson. You come in here and you condemn the bad and corrupt Ian Macdonald and you condemn the bad and corrupt Eddie Obeid. You condemn the grubbiness, the filth and the disgust that the New South Wales electorate exposed and turfed out. That is what you do if you want to be a person of integrity, but no: we have the defenders of it on that side. Let me make this point: when the people of New South Wales return a Baird Liberal government this weekend, what we will see is the extinguishment and demise of that small man of Australian politics, whose vision for this country is so myopic and so short-sighted that he is already under enormous pressure in his own party. That man is Mr Bill Shorten.


He is a man who has no plan for this country. He is a man who is prepared to sacrifice the future of our children, who is prepared to stand in the way of returning the budget to surplus, who is prepared to stand in the way of making progress to fix the mistakes of the previous government. He is a man the Australian people cannot trust. If you doubt that, ring Mr Rudd, ring Ms Gillard, and say, 'Can you trust Mr Shorten?' The answer to that is no. He is an impediment to this country becoming all that it can be. Shame on you for defending him. (Time expired)

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:23):  I rise to take note of answers to questions that Labor asked in question time today. I will focus particularly on the answers Minister Scullion gave on issues around homelands in Western Australia. This is a subject that is near and dear to my heart and a subject that I have raised in this place on three or four occasions. I have to say that Senator Scullion's response today was completely incorrect. The Premier of Western Australia has stood up and said to Aboriginal people in Western Australia, without a skerrick of consultation, that 273 homeland communities are not viable.


The back story is that, about three months ago, Minister Scullion stood in this place and said that WA welcomed the opportunity to lose $90 million in funding to homeland communities and that it welcomed the opportunity to take control of municipal services in those communities. Nothing could have been further from the truth, because at the same time that Minister Scullion was making those claims Mike Nahan, the Treasurer, and Colin Barnett, the Premier, were well and truly saying the opposite. They were absolutely sheeting home the blame for the state of homeland communities, for having these potential forced closures, absolutely at the feet of the Abbott government. Somehow, today, it is Labor that is scaremongering. I cannot believe the hypocrisy that goes on in here; I seriously cannot. We have a Liberal Premier in Western Australia who does not even know where these communities are—would not have a clue, does not have a list—but who announces out of the blue, without consultation, that 273 groups of people will lose their homes.


Let us look at some of the rural towns in Western Australia where white fellas live that perhaps are not viable. There is no threat to them. This is an attack on Aboriginal people right across the country by the Abbott government and by Liberal state governments, particularly the Western Australian government.


Last year, the Abbott government received a report from Twiggy Forrest, but it was a bit too far to the right for them. They said at that time there would be no BasicsCard. Now what are they doing? Another backflip, and it looks as though Aboriginal people in this country will be forced onto some kind of cashless economy. That came from their billionaire mate Twiggy Forrest, who would not have a clue what it is like to live the tough life that some Aboriginal people in Western Australia and across the country live. They demonise Aboriginal people and the communities they live in. Many of those communities are very, very successful, but that fact completely passes Premier Barnett and Minister Scullion by, because they do not know anything about them.


The Premier of Western Australia is yet to consult with Aboriginal communities. He is yet to consult with one, single homeland about what its future will be after the two years—the mere pittance the Abbott government has given to homeland communities to survive on—runs out. There has been not a skerrick, not a word, nothing. Last week we saw thousands and thousands of Western Australians march on the state parliament and let Premier Barnett and his mean-spirited Liberal government know in no uncertain terms that the Western Australia community would not cop people being thrown off their homelands.


Since making the announcement that homeland communities would close, directly as a result of the withdrawal of funding by Minister Scullion, Premier Barnett has backpedalled a little bit, saying that nobody will be forced off their lands. But if they have their water cut off or their school is closed or there is no electricity they will be forced off their lands. WA has a long history of forcing Aboriginal people off their lands, ignoring the fact that many of them have viable businesses there. There is very strong micro-tourism going on, but does either Minister Scullion or Premier Barnett bother to inform himself about that? Of course they don't. It is long over time that Aboriginal people, particularly in Western Australia, were treated with respect and dignity and not forced to leave their traditional lands. It shows just how out of touch are the Abbott government and the government of Western Australia that they continue to demonise Aboriginal people in the communities they live in. It is time to sit down and talk.

February 2015



Senator Fawcett


Joint Standing Committee on Treaties



Mr President, today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 147.


The Report contains the Committee's views on three proposed treaties: the World Trade Organization Protocol Amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO and including the Agreement on Trade Facilitation, the First Protocol to Amend the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area, and the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters between Australia and Vietnam.


Mr President, the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation is an important step forward in developing a multilateral trade system. It is a significant milestone; the first major agreement concluded since the WTO was established in 1995. The aim of the agreement is to increase transparency and remove red tape relating to customs regulations and procedures across international boundaries. It is estimated that, if the agreement is fully implemented, it could add $USI trillion to the world economy and create 21 million jobs by cutting trade costs. Mr President, it is vitally important for Australian businesses and industry to benefit from this global economy.


Despite the hard work being done to remove tariff barriers, it is often the behind-the-scenes non-tariff barriers that discourage trade participation. Mr President, complex paper-work or the fear that perishable goods will be held up in foreign ports can stop an Australian business from taking advantage of the opportunities provided by trade agreements. This agreement will make a difference in this regard.


Mr President, the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area is Australia's largest free trade agreement, accounting for 18 per cent of our total trade in goods and services and worth $121.6 billion in 2013-14. With a combined population of 650 million people, the parties to this agreement account for $4.1 billion of global GDP. It is important that Australian businesses and industry can make full use of the agreement.


The amendments to the agreement are designed to simplify and harmonise administrative requirements. Again the paper-work will become simpler, easier to fill out and comply with. By making trade easier for Australian exporters and importers, the amendments are expected to encourage better use of the agreement.


Mr President, mutual assistance treaties develop and strengthen Australia's capacity to fight international crime. Currently Australia is party to 29 such agreements. The treaty on mutual legal assistance between Australia and Vietnam provides for the two countries to exchange information and evidence for investigating or prosecuting serious crimes. It will make sure that criminals cannot evade justice solely because evidence of their criminal activity is located in another country.


Mr President, Vietnam is already a valuable Australian partner in the fight against transnational crime in our region and this agreement will strengthen that relationship. This agreement will complement existing treaties between the two countries on extradition and transfer of sentenced persons.


Mr President, the Committee supports the ratification of these three treaties.


Mr President, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Report to the Senate.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:35):  On behalf of the Minister for the Environment, I table a ministerial statement on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The statement read as follows—



I rise to update the House on the Government's policy priorities in regards to the Murray Darling Basin Plan.


Water reform in our nation has progressed over many years and I speak on this matter today as one of many, from both sides of the House, who have been given the responsibility of managing this nationally important issue. 


I acknowledge the work by former Prime Minister John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull as the Minister for Water and their courage to continue on the path of bold reforms in the water sector, building on the COAG reforms of the mid-1990s and the National Water Initiative and Living Murray Program from the early 2000s.


On a continent such as ours, with such variable climatic conditions, managing water resources sensibly, equitably and sustainably, is the most important aspect of Commonwealth's role in leading the nation's water reform agenda.


The making of the Basin Plan in 2012 by the then Minister for Water Tony Burke, with the bipartisan support of the Coalition, represented the culmination of twenty years of substantial water reform.


Under Prime Minister Abbott, each state has now signed up to the Intergovernmental Agreement for Implementing Water Reform in the Murray Darling Basin, a historic achievement that all members of this parliament and state Parliaments can be proud of.


This Plan is the epitome of bipartisanship, recognition of the dire situation highlighted by the millennium drought and shows what can be achieved through Federal and state collaboration, negotiation and cooperation.


I have only been in this portfolio a short time, but I immediately commenced travelling throughout the regions of the Murray-Darling Basin listening to and observing the concerns of all sectors of the community. 


I have travelled the length of the Murray, I have visited parts of the Goulburn and Murrumbidgee Rivers, and I have travelled to Menindee Lakes to see the dire situation with their water shortage, with water now only remaining in Copi Hollow. I look forward to continuing my travels down the Darling with the Members for Parkes and Maranoa after Easter.


No matter where I go, it is clear to me are two key issues facing communities in the Basin; the first is the policy fatigue that has set in after more than twenty years of water reform and secondly the sense of urgency for certainty regarding the implementation of the Basin Plan. 


The communities of the Murray-Darling Basin understand the need for the reforms that have gone ahead, but they – rightly – want assurances that the implementation of these water reforms will achieve a win-win-win that delivers good outcomes for the environment and a good outcome for the farmers and irrigators, as well as the communities and businesses in the Basin.


I want to make it abundantly clear that the Coalition Government is committed to delivering the Basin Plan, in full and on time. The Coalition is completing the water reforms that we started. It is what we pledged and we are delivering. 


However, we recognise the concerns and challenges that the plan creates for some communities and we must, and we will, find a way to deliver the best possible outcome for Basin communities and the environment. 


It is our responsibility to ensure the long term environmental and business sustainability for our communities to prosper.


The Coalition is cognisant of the need for certainty for all businesses to enable them to invest in the future of their community and industry. This is true from the north of the Basin to the south, as it is from the east to the west of the Basin.


We are listening to environmentalists, to townspeople, to farmers, to irrigators, to businesses, tourism operators, to industry and to fishermen alike. Every person and every group in the Basin matters and they must all be considered. This is why we are aiming to implement the Basin Plan to achieve a win-win outcome and provide a level of certainty that has been missing.


This is why we are now moving to legislate the 1500 giglitre cap on water buybacks in the Basin, to place a ceiling on the amount of water recovery that can be achieved through water purchase, in line with the Coalition's Water Recovery strategy released in June 2014.


To date, 1162 gigalitres has been recovered through water purchase, 607 gigalitres recovered through investment in infrastructure projects and a further 182 gigalitres through other state recovery actions. That's 1951 gigalitres – 71 per cent of the water recovery required under the plan. 


There is still more to be done, but it needs to be done with the least detrimental impact on all sectors of the community.


For the remaining water recovery efforts, we have prioritised the remainder of the Basin Plan funding for investment in infrastructure, particularly through more efficient on- and off-farm irrigation systems, and environmental works and measures, to achieve the outcomes of the Basin Plan to the full extent. 


People often talk about the Snowy Hydro Scheme as the biggest infrastructure project that rural Australia has ever seen. While the project is an impressive hydrological engineering feat, let me tell you the $820 million Governments spent over 25 years, pales in comparison to the $13 billion that will be spent implementing the Basin Plan reforms. 


From now until 30 June 2019 the Australian Government will spend $2 million per day, investing in infrastructure right across the Basin, investing in the future of sustainable farming and irrigated agriculture, and investing in our environmental sustainability as well as community sustainability, all with a level of certainty. 


That is $2 million per day invested into our regional communities.


We will do this working in partnership with our state counterparts who are key and critical to delivering the Murray Darling Basin reforms.


Throughout my travels with local members I have seen the positives of this investment by the Commonwealth Government. 


With Sharman Stone, Member for Murray, I visited the diary farm of Nick and Nicole Ryan who have upgraded their farm with laser leveling and automated, pressurised pipe and riser irrigation technology. Irrigating paddocks through automation reduces watering time and delivers water to the soil more efficiently and effectively, reducing the volume of water required to maintain healthy pastures and reducing salinity impacts. These infrastructure works increase farm productivity and reduce the labour demands of farming, all the while delivering water savings for the environment.


I also visited Deniliquin with Sussan Ley, Member for Farrer, where I saw infrastructure investment in new remote controlled regulators and metering and met with the Wragge family, a father and son rice growing team. Again they are benefiting from on-farm laser levelling, which is reducing the amount of water needed, but also increasing crop yield. 


Innovation is the Australian way and this rice farmer is looking for further means to increase his yield per hectare – he is doing this by putting fresh water eels into the flooded paddocks, which is achieving the dual benefit of eel production for market, but also improving their environmental footprint through bug control, as the eels feed on the insects, reducing pesticide and input costs. 


I encountered similar stories of efficiency and effectiveness in the electorate of Tony Pasin, Member for Barker visiting grape and citrus growers who are achieving similar feats of increased efficiency and productivity.


While in Renmark, I also visited the Chowilla Regulator, which is an impressive example of the types of works we can develop to achieve better environmental outcomes through the more effective control and delivery of water and, just like irrigators, achieve a more efficient use of water. 


This project is part of the $1 billion for the Living Murray works developed for environmental icon sites in the Murray system; the regulator will allow for regular inundation of up to 50 per cent of the 17,750 hectares of wetlands.


I also saw the fish ladders and gates in action, which now span the entire length of the Murray River restricting the passage of non native carp which destroy our river system, whilst providing safe passage for our native species, an environmental engineering feat in itself.


Similarly, the Koondrook Pericoota forest works on the New South Wales side of the Murray, which covers 32,000 hectares of floodplain and is home to a significant bird, fish and native flora populations, including the iconic river red gums and black box colonies. 


Over $100 million invested through the Living Murray initiative is finally delivering water to the wetland and I have seen the success of the recent environmental watering – with trees, the bush scrub and wildlife responding slowly, but positively.


Andrew Broad, Member for Mallee, and Michael McCormack, Member for Riverina, who despite the distance between their electorates, have good examples of the positives from Government investment in off-farm irrigation delivery infrastructure.


In the Sunraysia, Lower Murray Water are converting their channel system to pipe, which reduces water losses during delivery and improves water quality to the farmer, through $103 million in Federal Government investment.


In the Murrumbidgee I saw the innovation and drive from Coleambally Irrigation, to deliver world's best practice farming techniques and water management. They also highlighted increased investment in the region due to more efficient water delivery and certainty of access through these irrigation networks.


In a sign of confidence in the future of irrigated agriculture, six local cotton farmers have banded together, investing $24 million to build a cotton gin – I was so impressed at the enthusiasm in this small, but dynamic community.


I met with Leeton Mayor Paul Maytom who was upbeat about the investment the reforms were delivering to his community; however, when meeting with him and local businesses such as Sunrice, Walnuts Australia and JBS Meat, they highlighted the need for certainty from Government – the need for the 1500 gigalitre cap to be legislated.


At the end of the day, all of the above projects are investment into agriculture that are delivering improvements for our farmers and water for the environment. 


We recognise the challenges for all groups, from townspeople, to farmers, to irrigators, and environmentalists, to businesses, tourism operators, and industry, and to fishermen alike, indeed everyone. That is why we are determined to deliver a triple bottom line outcome; the Basin as a whole depends on it.


As I said, delivering the Plan it is not without challenges or issues that we must address, but we will work with the states to finesse and deliver a Plan that meets this aim, and we will make sure it is effective. 


From my visits to the Basin, I can see and understand the emotions, but I can only address the facts, and I will address the facts.


I have clearly heard the concerns surrounding the Constraints Management Strategy and the delivery of environmental water. 


I thank those groups on the Edward and Murrumbidgee Rivers that showed me around their farms and highlighted the issues in some of the modelling and what the models mean for those on the ground.


 It is clear this is an area that states need to examine more thoroughly as part of the development of the Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment Mechanism.


I have listened to the calls for improved transparency and greater community engagement. I have directed the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the Department of the Environment and the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder to address this with a level of urgency.


There will be challenging times as we again go through dry periods as we did with the millennium drought, as much as we will go through challenging times during excessive wet periods as we did in 2010, 2011 and 2012. 


As Dorothea McKeller wrote those immortal words in the poem My Country on the deck of Torryburn House, near Gresford in my electorate of Paterson, this is a land of sweeping plains, of ragged mountain ranges, of droughts and flooding rains.


We, and I mean all of us, need to take people on the journey with us, we need to provide greater certainty, so that communities can understand where the journey in these reforms will take them, from now to 2019 and of course beyond. 


We need to work together in a bipartisan way, to provide a level certainty, to address the challenges together, with our Basin communities, not against them. Communities have a need and right to know what the plan will deliver and what their future holds. 


We need to build a strong future in the Murray-Darling Basin and this is why the next step to legislate the 1500 gigalitre cap is so important as means of providing confidence and certainty to Basin communities as a whole, they deserve nothing less.

The Private Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2014 implements a part of the 2014-15 budget measure ""Smaller Government—additional reductions in the number of Australian Government bodies"" by transferring the functions of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman from 1 July 2015. The consolidation of these functions will reduce duplication, improve coordination and increase efficiency in delivering the Ombudsman's services to the community.


It is important to note that there is expected to be no impact upon the services provided to policy holders. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will continue to provide education and advice services to consumers as well as assist in resolving private health insurance complaints. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will also keep its consumer website which will continue to be managed by Private Health Insurance Ombudsman staff transferring to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


The transfer of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman will result in direct savings to industry. As the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman operates on a cost recovered basis, all savings made will be directly reflected in reduced levies payable by the private health insurance industry.


As part of the transfer of functions, the opportunity has been taken to streamline some of the investigative procedures of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman with those of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. This deregulation of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will lessen the administrative burden placed upon the Commonwealth Ombudsman by aligning complaints handling and investigation processes between the agencies. These administrative efficiencies are expected to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of complaints handling, and ensure that consumer complaints are resolved expediently and satisfactorily, helping patients get the best value from their insurance.


Further, under the Private Health Insurance Act 2007, the only statutory process available to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to gather information was to make a formal written request for information or records to the subject of a complaint. However, consistent with information gathering powers in the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman will now be able to either request information and documents from a person, or formally require the production of information or records by written notice. This will allow for a more graduated information gathering approach, which will in turn provide for increased consumer protection and an expedited complaints resolution process.


Finally, this Bill will make a minor amendment to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 to remove references to the ""Base Premium"" which were intended to be removed by the Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Act 2014 passed by the parliament earlier this year. Unfortunately, due to an unintended delay in the granting of Royal Assent these references were not removed.


The removal of remaining references to the concept of a base premium will not affect how the current premiums reduction scheme is applied for insurers and relevant policy holders and the simplified calculation of the Australian Government Rebate on private health insurance will remain in place. 


This Government has long acknowledged the important role that private health insurance plays throughout the Australian healthcare system, and is committed to supporting Private Health Insurance now and into the future.



The PRESIDENT:  In accordance with standing order 115(3), further consideration of this bill is now adjourned to 12 May 2015.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:38):  I rise today to draw attention to the shameful treatment that this Liberal government has displayed towards Australian pensioners. Those on the other side should be ashamed of themselves. The Labor Party is built on a narrative and a set of values that include fairness, opportunity, education, pensions and better health. They are the issues which we hold great store in. When I look at the Liberal Party, it strikes me that the only narrative and the only set of values that they have is what this government has demonstrated over and over again since they came into government—that is, they promised to be a government of adults but what we see day after day in this chamber is that they are a government of backflips, a government in chaos and a government that is built on lies. They were untruthful when it came to the policies that they were espousing before the election.


If you recall, Mr President, just before the election the now Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, said on national television that there would be no change to the pension—none at all. He was adamant about that. He even said the same thing on the Insiders with Barrie Cassidy, on 1 September 2013. He gave an assurance: no change to the pension, no cuts to the pension. That was the promise this Prime Minister made to 3.7 million pensioners around Australia. He repeated that assurance on the eve of the election. This turned out to be a deceitful statement which those in the community had relied on. They thought they could rely on the then opposition leader to uphold his commitment, particularly to Australian pensioners, that there would be no change to the pension. 


It does not matter how many times those on the other side in this place and in the other place come out and accuse Labor, accuse us, of misleading the community and running a scare campaign, because the reality is that pension indexation will change; it will have an effect on the daily living standards of our Australian pensioners—people who rely on what is already a limited income. It was a very dishonest statement. It was shameful that when the now Prime Minister went to the election he made those commitments. We have seen since he has come into power that he has broken that promise. As I said, this will have an effect on the living standards of Australian pensioners. It will have an effect on those people who go into aged care facilities. It will have an effect on the aged care sector, because, as we know, 85 per cent of the pension of those who are living in an aged care facility is taken to cover that expense. It is so disappointing that those who are most vulnerable in our community are the ones whom this government have chosen to attack. 


There was the commitment that there would be no change to the pension, the commitment that there would be no cuts to education, the commitment that there would be no cuts to health and the commitment that there would be no change to the GST. What have we seen already? The New South Wales election is on Saturday, and we have seen Mr Hockey once again trying to play politics. We have heard in this chamber again today that Western Australia wants to have a larger cut of the GST. I have to say on behalf of my home state of Tasmania that we will never support it. We are a Commonwealth so that we can ensure that smaller states like Tasmania and South Australia are protected from the larger states who want a larger slice of the cake. 


We recently saw in the budget something that was going to impact on the majority of people in this country. People who voted for this government believed that the commitments of those opposite would be honoured when they came into power. It was a very clear message that the Prime Minister gave to the Australian people when he said that there would be no cuts to health, yet we have seen such cuts taking effect in my home state. We have also seen it with the commitment given to no cuts to education. This has led to the Australian community clearly making their views known to government members that they are not going to tolerate the deregulation of universities. They are not going to stand by while regional campuses like the Tasmanian University, particularly the Launceston campus and the north-west coast Burnie campus, are run down. This government has already cut $30 million from the university's budget. This will have an enormous effect on young people living in Tasmania. We already have a very low retention rate when it comes to further education and young Tasmanians pursuing a tertiary education At the same time, we have seen the effects of the cuts that have been made to the TAFE sector. All of these have an enormous impact on our local communities. 


It was written in the budget for every Australian to see that what this government wants to do is cut the indexation rate of the pension, cut the deeming threshold for the pension, and increase the age for the age pension to a level that would make it the highest in the developed world. It truly is a shameful and despicable act that this Liberal government would pick on those most vulnerable in our community. This act will, in fact, destroy the standard of living for our Australian pensioners—those who rely on the support of this government. As I said, this will have an impact on the ability of the residential aged care sector to provide the best possible care. Their funding will be cut at a time when we know the aged care sector is facing continued pressures in relation to infrastructure—particularly in my home state of Tasmania, where there are a lot of facilities and not-for-profit organisations that simply do not have the reserves to update facilities or build new ones.  


This government continues to attack those people most in need. Today the Attorney-General did yet another backflip, this time on funding for legal assistance. When you move around your local communities and talk to your constituents, you find constant confusion. People really feel unsettled because they cannot rely on this government—what they say one day is completely different from what they say the next day. A lot of organisations in social services and the not-for-profit sector rely on assistance to run their programs. In my own community, the not-for-profit sector is already cutting positions. People are losing their jobs—and these are people with a wealth of experience. Because of this government's funding cuts, that experience and corporate knowledge is being lost to the sector. 


I am really concerned about the impact all this is having, not only on our pensioners and those on limited incomes but on health in general—through increased uncertainty, funding cuts to the hospital system and the proposed GP tax. All of those things are of concern within the community. We have seen the unemployment rate increase under this government. This was going to be a government of infrastructure investment and increasing employment opportunities. Unfortunately, we have seen no action on these issues. 


I seek leave to continue my remarks later. 


Leave granted; Debate adjourned.

This bill already reflects protections for journalists arising out of the joint committee's considerations and recommendations and is implementing the warrant regime for journalists that Labor argued for and achieved in the other place. We believe that those amendments to the bill already provide ample oversight of access to the telecommunications data of journalists. 


The bill in its amended form provides that the IGIS, the Ombudsman and the committee itself will be notified when a journalist's data is accessed. These bodies are well placed to make inquiries and to ascertain whether this access was indeed appropriate. Labor appreciates that Senator Wang has been concerned, as I indeed mentioned that Labor was, that the way in which this bill has proceeded has not brought the public with it, and we appreciate his efforts to deal with this aspect, but we think the arrangements as reflected in the bill now are satisfactory.

 (South Australia) (15:55):  I have discussed this privately with the Attorney. If a media organisation, on a daily or weekly basis, says on its website, 'We have not been subject to any journalist information warrants for our metadata,' and then they suddenly stop saying that, could that imply that they have been subject to a warrant? I have not articulated it very well, but that is one of the arguments that has been put to me by someone who is concerned about this legislation. In other words, it is what they refer to—I do not think it is quite a term of art—as almost a 'warrant canary'. I am glad that it amuses the Attorney. But, if you had been saying that you had not had a warrant and you then stay silent on it, that might imply that you then do have a warrant. So, could the fact that you say that you do not have a warrant itself be a criminal offence?

Sometimes the law will attribute conduct to a person because of other aspects of their conduct, sometimes even their silence.

But merely to remain silent would certainly not, in my view—and I have spoken with others as well—constitute constructive disclosure.

But, after 380 days of doing this, one day they stop saying that. Could that in itself go beyond silence to actually imply that they have been subject to a warrant? That would be a reasonable conclusion that people would reach. Could that previous conduct, saying that they had not been subject to it, imply that they have disclosed that they have been subject to a warrant?

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:38):  by leave—I move amendments (10) to (12) on sheet 7672 together:


(10) Schedule 1, item 6V, page 46 (lines 13 to 31), omit section 182A, substitute:




182A


Disclosure/use offences: journalist information warrants



(1) A person commits an offence if:


   (a) the person discloses or uses information; and


   (b) the information is about any of the following:


      (i) whether a journalist information warrant (other than such a warrant that relates only to section 178A) has been, or is being, requested or applied for;


      (ii) the making of such a warrant;


      (iii) the existence or non‑existence of such a warrant;


      (iv) the revocation of such a warrant; and


   (c) the person knows that the information is about a warrant as set out in paragraph (b); and


   (d) at the time of the disclosure or use, the matter to which the warrant relates is ongoing.


Penalty:   Imprisonment for 2 years.


(2) A person commits an offence if:


   (a) the person discloses or uses a document; and


   (b) the document consists (wholly or partly) of any of the following:


      (i) a journalist information warrant (other than such a warrant that relates only to section 178A);


      (ii) the revocation of such a warrant; and


   (c) the person knows that the document consists (wholly or partly) of the warrant or the revocation of the warrant; and


   (d) at the time of the disclosure or use, the matter to which the warrant relates is ongoing.


Penalty:   Imprisonment for 2 years.


(11) Schedule 1, item 6V, page 47 (before line 4), before paragraph 182B(a), insert:


   (aa) both:


      (i) the disclosure or use is by a person working in a professional capacity as a journalist; and


      (ii) the information or document is disclosed or used in that capacity for the purpose of disseminating information on a matter of public interest; or


(12) Schedule 1, item 6X, page 48 (before line 1), before section 185D, insert:




185CA


Evidentiary certificate relating to ongoing Ombudsman matter



(1) The Director‑General of Security or the Deputy Director‑General of Security may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out:


   (a) whether a matter involving the grounds on which a journalist information warrant was issued is ongoing; and


   (b) whether the matter was ongoing on a specified date.


(2) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (1) by the Director‑General of Security or the Deputy Director‑General of Security and to be signed by him or her:


   (a) is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof; and


   (b) is, in an exempt proceeding, prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the document.


Note: An evidentiary certificate issued under this section relates to an offence under section 182A.




185CB


Evidentiary certificate relating to ongoing enforcement agency matter



(1) A certifying offer of an enforcement agency may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out:


   (a) whether a matter involving the grounds on which a journalist information warrant was issued is ongoing; and


   (b) whether the matter was ongoing on a specified date.


(2) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (1) by a certifying officer of an enforcement agency and to be signed by him or her:


   (a) is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof; and


   (b) is, in an exempt proceeding, prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the document.


Note: An evidentiary certificate issued under this section relates to an offence under section 182A.


Amendment (10) amends the offences in the bill related to the disclosure and use of journalist information warrants. This amendment limits the offence to ensure it only applies when a person knows that the information disclosed or used relates to a journalist information warrant and that the matter to which the warrant relates is ongoing. The aim of this amendment is to ensure openness and transparency and, in practical terms, to allow reporting on matters that may, in the past, have related to journalist protection warrants. While acknowledging that such an offence provision may be necessary to protect ongoing investigations, these amendments prevent the offence from becoming a barrier to sharing information in the public interest. 


Amendment (11) seeks to clarify the defences available to someone charged with the disclosure or use of information relating to journalist information warrants. It provides that disclosure or use by a journalist for the purpose of disseminating information in the public interest is a defence. In conjunction with the amendments in amendment (10), this amendment will ensure that journalists are free to report on matters of public interest even if they are the subject of a journalist information warrant.


Amendment (12) allows the Director-General of Security or Deputy Director-General of Security to provide evidentiary certificates relating to whether a matter involving the grounds on which a journalist information warrant was issued is ongoing and whether the matter specified was ongoing on a particular day. These provisions are consistent with others in the act relating to the issuing of evidentiary certificates. Under the same conditions, a certifying officer of an enforcement agency may issue a written certificate relating to the same matters. Again, this is consistent with existing provisions for the use of evidentiary certificates in the act.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (16:40):  The government does not support these amendments. Section 102A makes it an offence for a person to use or disclose information about a journalist information warrant. The offence is punishable by two years imprisonment. Pursuant to section 5.6 of the Criminal Code, this offence will be committed where a person uses or discloses information and is reckless as to whether that information is about a journalist information warrant. Amendment (10) would make disclosure an offence only where the person who discloses the warrant knows that the information is about a journalist information warrant relating to an ongoing matter. The offence provisions serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security and integrity of investigations are maintained against unlawful disclosure and protecting the reputation and privacy of subjects of investigations.


Prohibitions on use and disclosure exist so that any private information, even the mere fact that a person has come to the police's attention, is not incidentally used to embarrass, humiliate or harass the person. Given the sensitive nature of TIA Act powers, for those prohibitions to be meaningful they must be backed up by criminal penalties. The media cannot have it both ways. They have sought protections relating to the identification of their sources, yet they are looking to be able to disclose the information about the target of the warrant—that is, the source. The offence provision is consistent with those already in place in relation to other warrants, including telecommunications interception warrants and stored communications warrants. These offences exist in both Commonwealth and state legislation, including relating to surveillance device warrants. They create a need to know within an agency to protect the privacy of the person who is the subject of the warrant.

 (Victoria) (16:42):  I could refer to my earlier comments, Senator Xenophon, but I will add an additional point on these amendments, especially for your staff. The provisions regarding unauthorised disclosure that a warrant has been sought are standard in warrant schemes. I think I can elaborate on Senator Brandis's comments that the explanatory memorandum sets out the rationale for these provisions. Let me read those:


153. Section 182A makes it an offence for a person to use or disclose information about whether a journalist information warrant, has been, or is being requested or applied for, the making of such warrant, the existence or non-existence of such a warrant and the revocation of such a warrant. The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years imprisonment. Section 182A is consistent with equivalent offence provisions already in place in relation to other warrants, including telecommunications interception warrants and stored communications warrants. These provisions create a ""need-to-know"" within an agency to protect the privacy of the person who is the subject of a TIA Act warrant.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:43):  I thank the government and the opposition for their response, but let us put this into perspective. If a journalist discloses after the fact, when, as set out in this amendment, it is clearly in the public interest, that there has been a journalist information warrant sought or obtained—when there is no longer any issue about it being detrimental to the work of the security agency or the authorities but is in fact actually in the public interest—that would still be a criminal offence. How, from a public policy point of view, can that be desirable? There is a threshold in this amendment that says it must be in the public interest for a journalist to disclose that there was a warrant issued.


It might be five years down the track or 10 years down the track. Does that mean forever and a day that this will be secret? Does this mean that in 10 years' time, 20 years' time, 30 years' time or 40 years' time, if this bill is in its current form, that journalists will not be able to ever report that a warrant was sought for their metadata even when the exigency or the need for the warrant is no longer apparent and it is also positively in the public interest to disclose that? That is what disturbs me: that fact that we could end up seeing journalists being jailed for disclosing something that would be clearly in the public interest.

(39) Schedule 2, item 8, page 63 (lines 14 to 24), to be opposed.


As to these amendments, we covered—whether it was last night or the night before, I now cannot remember; it has all started to run together—the issue of the government being able to effectively move the goalposts in terms of categories of data that could be added to the scope of the bill once it is enacted, the number of service providers and companies who could be brought within the scope of the bill and, the third issue, the fact that Attorney-General can unilaterally add agencies to the bill.


The Attorney-General has made much—and I acknowledge the significant change and a significant improvement in the regime that prevails in Australia to date—of narrowing roughly 80 agencies, to use the rule of thumb figure. In theory, it could be much larger than that, because there are in excess of 500 local government authorities in this country. They can, in theory at least, acquire metadata on a warrantless basis by just directly contacting the phone and internet companies. This bill narrows the range of agencies to just under two dozen. But, of course, the door as it closes on one side opens on another: the Attorney-General has allowed himself to unilaterally add agencies back into the bill. We are going back to some of the arguments that we had earlier about this strange 40 sitting day lag that appears where the minister can add an agency; 40 sitting days can pass, which will be six or eight months down the track; and then the parliament is asked to ratify the decision.


Maybe before we go to the substance of the amendments, because what we are proposing to do is remove that power so that if another agency is to come back into the scheme and be able to access people's metadata on a warrantless basis, we believe that is something that the parliament should be engaged in at the beginning of the process and not the end. Just before I put the amendments, what I would like to do is seek your advice, Attorney-General, on what criteria you will bear in mind when agencies come knocking on your door seeking to be included back into the scheme.


That is because, as you have identified earlier in the debate, some—when you read the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act annual reports—agencies like Centrelink and a number of others that have no criminal law enforcement role are among the largest users of these authorisations. I want to know what criteria will guide you when Centrelink, if we take them as an example, come knocking at your door—if they are not already there—seeking to be reincorporated within the scheme.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (16:49):  I will answer your question in a moment, Senator Ludlam. Thank you at least for having the good grace to acknowledge the reduction of the number of agencies to 21 from 85, which is a very substantial improvement on the status quo. That is the point I have been making all along. I tried to make it in my speech winding up the second reading debate. The way this debate has proceeded, you could be forgiven for thinking—if you were not familiar with the legislation and were listening in—that this is an invasion of peoples' liberties, whereas in fact what it does is attenuate very significantly and subject to much more rigorous oversight conduct which at the moment is lawful.


Coming directly to your question, the answer is in accordance with the criteria actually set out in section 110A(4). The criteria that the minister must have regard to in considering whether to make a declaration is set out there, particularly in subsection (c). The minister is, among other things, required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, with a binding scheme that provides for the protection of personal information and with other matters which you can read yourself. This is not an ungoverned discretion. It is a discretion that is governed by the specific matters set out in proposed subsection 110A(4)(b). Because these are amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the discretion is governed generally by the criteria set out in section 180F. That is augmented and strengthened by this bill, which deals with the overarching considerations to be had regard to in accessing information.


You, in an exuberantly rhetorical way, said that the minister can unilaterally add agencies. As a matter of fact, the minister cannot unilaterally add agencies. What the minister can do is promulgate a legislative instrument which adds agencies. But as you well know, legislative instruments are subject to disallowance by either house of parliament.


Lastly, the 21 agencies are set out in the act not by function but by name. In the existing TIA Act additional agencies can be added. That is how we got to this forest of agencies with the capacity to access metadata under the existing act: they do not have to be named agencies; they can be agencies that answer a functional description. That is removed under this act, so that, once again, is a protection which does not exist under the existing law.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:53):  I moved identical amendments to those of Senator Ludlam, so therefore I am speaking in support. I have proposed these amendments in order to prevent regulatory creep through the addition of further agencies. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Just to clarify, Senator Leyonhjelm, you actually circulated these rather than moved them.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I did not move them; you are quite correct. I circulated them, yes. They are on the running sheet showing as identical to mine, that is all. Under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the distinction between a criminal law enforcement agency and an enforcement agency allows for some agencies that have enforcement functions but not criminal law enforcement functions to have limited access powers. In order to have full access powers an agency must have a criminal law enforcement function.


I take the point that, under this bill, the agencies with access will be named in the bill. I think that is an excellent idea, but this takes account of the fact that additional agencies can be added. The amendment seeks to prevent regulatory creep by omitting proposed definitions of 'criminal law enforcement agency' as set out in clause 110A and 'enforcement agency' as set out in clause 176A altogether and reverting to the current approach in the telecommunications interception act of setting up these agencies in the definitions section. There is an express reference to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service in the definition of enforcement agency in amendment (38). By virtue of this amendment, the only way for new agencies to be added will be by an amending act, which will enhance parliamentary scrutiny and oversight, and the distinction between criminal law enforcement agency and enforcement agency is thus preserved.


This approach also ensures that ASIC and ACCC do not get themselves onto the list of government approved, government sanctioned nosy parkers. Those two agencies already have large and intrusive powers, sometimes in excess of those enjoyed by agencies more properly considered criminal law enforcement bodies. Those powers should not be further expanded, particularly as they may be used to pursue trivial infractions such as collusion among service stations over petrol prices.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (16:55):  I obviously have a fundamental disagreement with you about this. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are the two principal economic regulators in this country. They keep the operation of our free market system honest and they ensure that markets operate free of abusive conduct or manipulative conduct.


I think it is a very superficial view, if I may say so, to think that the kind of market manipulation, cartel conduct or abuse of market power which it is the responsibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to police and to enforce the provisions of its act with a view to preventing is a trivial matter. I say this with some feeling because for several years before I came to this place this is what I did. Competition law was my field of practice, and I acted for the ACCC and against the ACCC on many occasions. I have seen in my own professional experience many, many instances of very serious market manipulation, cartel conduct and collusive behaviour at the expense of consumers, which it is absolutely in the public interest to prevent. There are criminal penalties now under the Competition and Consumer Act.


In relation to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that is the principal corporate regulator in this country. It is our principal guardian against white-collar crime and commercial fraud within the corporate sector. The thought that either the ACCC or, even more so, ASIC do not have a very important law enforcement, including criminal law enforcement, role is quite wrong. An article by Mr Greg Tanzer in this morning's Australian Financial Review has been drawn to my attention. Mr Tanzer, as you may know, is a commissioner of ASIC, who argues very strongly for the retention of urgency within the list of relevant criminal law enforcement bodies. Mr Tanzer says, among other things:


… in the two years to November 2014 ASIC used telecoms data in more than 80 per cent of our insider trading cases.


He goes on to say that the powers sought here are no different in kind than existing powers under the TIA Act already. Mr Tanzer writes:


Changes to the TIA Act do not give law enforcement agencies any new powers but aim to ensure crucial existing powers retain their utility and are not eroded because of profit-driven changes in commercial practices.


Telecoms data is crucial in combating corporate crime.


I know you take a libertarian point of view and I know that is one of the points of difference between you and perhaps the Greens senators. May I say, through you, Madam Temporary Chairman O'Neill, to the Greens senators: the Greens senators have always been at the absolute forefront in their outrage at corporate crime and white-collar crime in this country. I can understand Senator Leyonhjelm's libertarian, anarcho-capitalist point of view, which I do not share but I understand, but I cannot for the life of me understand why the Greens would wish to disable the investigative capability of the agency charged with policing against white-collar crime from having a power akin to police forces and anti-corruption bodies which it has at the moment but would not have if this amendment were to be carried.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  Thank you, Attorney. I must admit I am a little confused. I thought this bill was all about serious crime—terrorism, paedophilia and organised crime are the terms I think that I have heard you use several times. White-collar crime, I suppose, at its most extreme end could perhaps be called organised crime, but it absolutely could not be called paedophilia or terrorism. Insider trading, as I am sure you are aware, is not actually illegal in some countries, including across the ditch in New Zealand. It certainly does not qualify as serious organised crime.


This reinforces, I guess, my prediction that this is mission creep—this is regulatory creep. We are not just talking about serious crimes. This legislation will be used for all kinds of crimes. I doubt very much whether its impact on terrorism or paedophilia or serious organised crime will be very great at all, but it will be very substantial on matters that really do not warrant such intrusive powers.

We obviously have a philosophical difference about that. And it is not mission creep, as you say, Senator, because these powers already exist. These powers already exist under the status quo. We have shed three-quarters of the agencies by whom these powers are exercisable, but we have included ASIC and the ACCC on the list for that reason.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:02):  Labor will be opposing these amendments for much the same reasons as Senator Brandis outlined. But I should also highlight, in relation to this discussion about trivial offences, that, in the amendments introduced by the government in the House, the new threshold that Labor argued for through the joint committee process with respect to access ensures that gravity is one of the factors taken into consideration. This is a very important point to be made here.


We sought to clarify with the Greens in relation to the Greens amendments essentially the point that Senator Leyonhjelm made earlier, which is that they are indeed identical. Like Senator Brandis, I was somewhat surprised at the Greens' approach in relation to ASIC and the ACCC and we could not get back from the Greens confirmation that they understood that the effect of their amendments was that they would be removing from the list ASIC and the ACCC. If I recall correctly—and sorry if I am verballing you, Senator Ludlam—this issue was not addressed in your comments introducing these amendments. It is quite a serious issue, as highlighted by Senator Brandis. I too read the article in today's Financial Review, but there is another aspect to that article, by Greg Tanzer, that I would like to go to. He reports:


Telecoms data is crucial in combating corporate crime. This sort of information is commonly the first source of important information for further investigations and is frequently used to identify suspected offenders or verify preliminary suspicions. Without this data many offences and offenders would never be detected …


This is a very serious issue. As I said, the amendments to which the government has already agreed through the process of the joint committee and that were dealt with in the House ensure that we are not talking about the trivial matters that Senator Leyonhjelm is referring to. Indeed, in the evaluation process of a request for access, gravity is one of the important factors taken into account.

the Commissioner of Police must cause the information or document, including any copies of the information or document, to be destroyed as soon as practicable.


This is reasonably simple and we already traversed the reasoning behind it earlier in the debate, but to refresh our memory: this amendment requires that metadata obtained under the data retention legislation should be destroyed when it is no longer relevant to the matter under investigation. Earlier in the debate, we addressed the idea that, after the two-you mandatory retention period, stuff that had been collected for no other purpose than that people were being forced to collect it under the terms of the bill would be destroyed. However, this goes to the material being retrieved—and we have already discussed at length the fact that there are in excess of three-quarters of a million of these warrantless authorisations reported to the ACMA every year. Once that material is no longer relevant to any kind of investigation, it should be destroyed. We know that it is not. Not just the intelligence agencies are amassing it but the law enforcement agencies and other agencies are collecting it. There is no obligation as far as I am aware—please correct me if I am wrong, Senator Brandis—on the part of any of these agencies to destroy anything that they collect on a warrantless basis.


The software tools for aggregating and mapping this information are way more sophisticated than most people realise. I think the numbers increment by 10 or 15 per cent every year. So 750,000 this year, maybe 720,000 or 730,000 the year before. All of the records that are being grabbed are also being compiled. They are being stored; they are being compiled. And there is no question at all that it effectively means that the private records of phone and internet use, location, data and whatever else are being authorised, collected, archived and kept. This material—we do not know absolute numbers, because that material is not recorded—on tens or potentially hundreds of thousands of people is being stored. 


So I struggle to imagine a justification whereby material is accessed on a warrantless basis for a range of matters—everything from quite serious matters to quite trivial matters. Many people who support these schemes have been at pains to tell us that this is about preliminary discovery so that people can be excluded as persons of interest and not pursued by more intrusive means. Why would you require the retention of their material? Why not instruct agencies to dispose of it when it is no longer needed? That would be in accord with the Australian privacy principles that were legislated and, to my mind, improved by this government about this time last year.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:08):  Senator Ludlam, I think you make a very good point, but the way you expressed yourself at the end there was wrong. We are not requiring the retention of metadata—we are not requiring it at all. The bill does not include a requirement that it be destroyed at a particular time, which is the effect of your amendment. 


Senator Ludlam, I understand the point you are making and, as I say, I think it has a lot to be said for it. It is for that reason that the government adopted recommendation 28 of the PJCIS that the Attorney-General's Department oversee a review of the adequacy of the existing destruction requirements that apply to documents or information disclosed pursuant to an authorisation made under chapter 4 of the TIA Act and held by enforcement agencies and ASIO. The committee further recommended that the Attorney-General report to parliament on the findings of the review by 1 July 2017. As I say, the government has accepted that recommendation and that review will be conducted. As well as that, you will be pleased to know, Senator Ludlam, in respect of ASIO there is an agreement between ASIO and the National Archives, which was reviewed in 2012, in relation to retained material. The retention and destruction of data by ASIO is going to be examined by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security later this year. So there are in fact two reviews. There is the IGIS review this year and the Attorney-General's Department review, which will report within a little over two years. The government will consider what those reviews have to say. I tend to agree with you, Senator Ludlam, that it is desirable that there should be a destruction date in relation to data in certain defined circumstances. But we will await and be informed by the review in making decisions concerning that issue.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:11):  I withdraw Australian Greens amendments (41) and (42) on sheet 7669. They were consequential to earlier amendments that, regrettably, I did not have the numbers to pass. So I will not be proceeding with moving those. I move amendment (43) on sheet 7669:


 (43) Schedule 3, item 7, page 77 (after line 29), after subsection 186B(1), insert:


   (1A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the Ombudsman must inspect the records of each enforcement agency at least once every 6 months in relation to authorisations under Division 3, 4 or 4A of Part 4‑1.


This is the last Australian Greens amendment that we will bring forward. Its purpose is fairly simple. It is to explicitly require the Commonwealth Ombudsman to examine every six months the records of agencies which have access to metadata. The Ombudsman has been brought more closely into the orbit of oversight of the regime. I do not think at the moment that this regime, particularly access to metadata, has anything like the amount of oversight that it is going to need, given the volume of requests that go through and the evident problems and issues that have been well canvassed during this debate. Nonetheless, the Ombudsman does have a closer role. I would like to know the degree to which the Ombudsman's office will be given a greater amount of resourcing to conduct those additional activities. 


We would like to see the Ombudsman have that regular and very cyclical inspection and reporting obligation—the inspection, therefore, being every six months. The reason for this is simple. Unlike the warranted access to material which has that judicial oversight—it is sought through the AAT or it is sought through judges—there is no such oversight role. I am not sure that many people realise that there are probably thousands of people in agencies around this country who are authorised to be in receipt of a two-page form, a double-sided piece of A4 paper, with the target individuals or networks or devices that are handed directly to the phone companies or the internet service providers, and then the material is forthcoming. There is no intermediary. There is no judicial oversight. So, at the very minimum, we would like that to be the Commonwealth Ombudsman, given that the proposal to bring bulk or intrusive metadata within the warranted regime was rejected. This is really a last ditch attempt to providing a greater measure of transparency and oversight to a system that I believe is fundamentally broken.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:14):  Senator Ludlam, the government does not support your amendment. I should acquaint you with the fact that the Commonwealth Ombudsman was in fact closely involved in drafting these powers. These were the powers that the Ombudsman's office, as one of the integrity agencies, thought were appropriate to it to best discharge its oversight obligations—that is, the powers that are already in the bill, which your amendment would change. 


Can I draw your attention, please, to paragraph 685 of the explanatory memorandum, which reads:


Under subsection 186B(2), the Ombudsman is not restricted in the frequency with which the Ombudsman may inspect the records of an agency. For example, the Ombudsman could choose inspection cycles of twelve months, six months, three months or some other period to inspect the records of any particular agency. This flexibility is intended to cater for the significant differences in the size, structure, functions, and internal systems and procedures of the various criminal law-enforcement agencies, the variable nature and flow of investigations and to ensure the new inspection regime is sufficiently responsive to differing contingencies encountered during an inspection. Depending on the circumstances, this may necessitate other adaptive approaches, including, for example, staged or rolling inspection programs, a quarter-sized inspection four times a year, or inspecting different field offices at different times if that was more convenient for the agency from an operational perspective or logistically more feasible. 


So the mischief that your amendment seeks to address is already provided for by clause 186B(2) of the bill in a way which—with the advice of the Ombudsman, as the relevant integrity agency—will actually enhance rather than diminish his capacity to oversee the compliance by agencies with the provisions of this bill. I should also remind you that the intelligence agencies are subject to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security as well.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:16):  Labor will be opposing this amendment because we feel, given what has occurred in recent times, that it is now redundant. Proposed section 186B(1) already provides that the Ombudsman must inspect the records of relevant agencies, and the Ombudsman's office is indeed a highly experienced oversight body. We have, however, demanded and received an assurance from the government that the Ombudsman will be effectively resourced to exercise his new responsibilities. As such—given, as Senator Brandis highlighted, the consultation that occurred with the Ombudsman himself—we have no doubt that he will be an effective and diligent watchdog over the data retention scheme.


Question negatived.

After paragraph


119.7(3)(b) of the Criminal Code



   Insert:


   ; (c) the publication of the advertisement or item of news was not in the public interest.


This amendment addresses issues relating to disclosures of information by journalists, through amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, the Crimes Act 1914 and the Criminal Code Act 1995. These amendments address changes to these acts made by the previous bills in this tranche of legislation, primarily the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2014. 


Make no mistake about it, these issues go to the heart of press freedom in this country in relation to the ability of investigative journalists to do their work. These bills insert into these acts new offences relating to the disclosure of information relating to a special intelligence operation, as well as for publishing advertisements or items of news that contain information about recruitment of people to armed forces in a foreign country. I want to make it clear that, in relation to any publication of information in respect of a special intelligence operation that could endanger the lives of those involved in the operation or other lives directly as a result of that disclosure of information, I do not oppose the imposition of a penalty. If we are talking about endangering lives—if, for instance, there is an ASIS or ASIO officer whose life is put in real danger by the disclosure of their identity—then that is a serious matter. But we are talking about a whole range of other circumstances where there can be no such consideration; where there is no question of any lives being endangered; and where, in fact, what is being endangered by not publishing that information is very much the public interest and some key democratic principles. 


At the time that the bills were being considered in respect of section 35P, I expressed my concerns about the provisions relating to disclosure of information and how this would impact on journalists reporting on matters in good faith and in the public interest. At the time, I also moved an amendment to include the consideration of the public interest as a defence to these offences. This amendment expands on these original concerns to address the matter more fully. I am grateful to the mainstream media organisations that I have spoken to—major media organisations which have been very helpful with useful suggestions as to how this clause could have real protections for journalists who are doing their job in the public interest. 


Firstly, in relation to disclosure of information, these amendments introduce a concept of 'knowingly disclosing information relating to a special intelligence operation, disclosing information with the intent of endangering the health or safety of any person, or prejudicing the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation'. Further, the amendments provide exceptions to this offence which are consistent with existing whistleblower protections. They also include an exception where the person was working in a professional capacity as a journalist and published in good faith as a matter of public interest, and where the report was not likely to enable staff of security organisations to be identified. 


The amendments also provide an extensive definition of what matters can be considered to be in the public interest. These include matters that increase public debate and promote the integrity and accountability of security organisations or officials, and matters relating to conduct that contravenes certain laws or standards. These amendments provide the same defences in relation to disclosing information about delayed notification search warrants under the Crimes Act. 


The amendments also address issues relating to the publication of certain matters under the Criminal Code. The new offences in the act relate to the publication of recruitment material, and, in essence, I believe these offences are suitable. However, there is capacity for these offences to capture media organisations in the following ways. Firstly, it is possible that a journalist could publish a story that contains information about recruitment—for example, an investigative piece that looks at recruitment strategies of terrorist groups or how an individual has been personally affected by this. Secondly, it is possible that a major news organisation with many publications could unwittingly publish an advertisement that, while it does not overtly seem so, relates to recruiting activities—for example, for a town meeting that turns out to have recruiting elements, unbeknownst to the news organisation. 


To address these concerns, the amendments in this item change the existing offence from a person being reckless to the fact to a person publishing with the intention of encouraging recruitment. Further, in relation to the offence of publishing more detailed information about recruiting, these amendments provide that the offence can only apply where the publication is not in the public interest. This would, for example, come into effect when a story is published about recruitment taking place at a certain location and time for the purpose of raising public awareness.


I want to briefly raise a matter that relates to ASIS, not ASIO, but the principles are the same. There is, of course, the issue in respect of the allegations that ASIS planted electronic surveillance, electronic bugs, in 2004 in the East Timorese cabinet room, allegedly to gather information regarding negotiations of the Timor Sea treaty, the sharing of energy resources between Australia and Timor. That cannot be seen, on any reasonable basis, as a national security issue. In March 2014 the International Court of Justice ordered Australia to stop any such behaviour. Bernard Collaery, a former Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory, representing East Timor, alleged in 2013 that his offices had been raided by ASIO. A key witness, known as Witness K, was detained and had his passport cancelled, which of course has all sorts of consequences for Witness K. I am not sure whether he has been charged. 


My concern is with cases such as that, cases of botched operations, and it does happen from time to time. As good as our intelligence agencies are, as good as the AFP is, there are occasions when they get it wrong, where they have exceeded their powers, and it is in the public interest to expose that. There is no protection for journalists, as I see it, under the current legislation or 35P. We know what the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, representing journalists in this country, have said about this. And leading academics are concerned that section 35P in its current form is simply too restrictive and draconian and needs to be amended.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:24):  This is an attempt to litigate the issue of section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was debated and canvassed extensively in this chamber last year during the debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. Because this has been debated very extensively in this chamber and this is an attempt merely to relitigate it—it is not immediately germane to this bill; it has, as it were, been tacked on—I do not want to take too long in responding to Senator Xenophon. But let me make a couple of points to you, Senator. 


First of all, section 35P of the ASIO Act is confined to the disclosure of special intelligence operations. Special intelligence operations are themselves a defined term, a defined form of operation that was introduced into the ASIO Act last year. They can only be conducted in exceptional circumstances and only if the Attorney-General is satisfied as to a variety of matters that are specified in the relevant provisions of the ASIO Act. But, to give you the flavour of what special intelligence operations are, they are about things like officers of ASIO, under cover, becoming associated with terrorist cells, for example, in order to gather intelligence. That is what ASIO does, Senator Xenophon: it is an intelligence-gathering operation. 


In order to gather human intelligence, or HUMINT, to use the jargon term that is used in the intelligence community, officers subject themselves to very, very serious risk of physical harm. And they are entitled to be protected; they are entitled to be protected from disclosure. You can readily imagine, Senator Xenophon, that if the fact of a special intelligence operation that involved, for example, an undercover ASIO officer or officers penetrating a terrorist cell were disclosed, that could well put the lives of those officers or their families at risk. I know you would not wish to do that, Senator Xenophon—of course you would not. But that is the mischief—




Senator Xenophon:
  Mr Chairman, on a point of order, my amendment does not say that or do that. I respectfully suggest to the Attorney that he read my amendment. It does not do that.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Xenophon, there is no point of order.




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is the purpose of section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was inserted, over the objection of crossbench senators, last year. It is no answer to say that perhaps prohibition should only apply to a current operation but not to a past operation, because often people need protection for years, or even decades, after an intelligence operation. You know, Senator Xenophon, the Australian government protected the identity of Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov until the day they died, 30 or 40 years after the Petrov affair. 


It strikes me as a crowning irony in this debate that those who are extremely concerned to protect the confidentiality of journalists' sources would, in the next breath, expose the confidentiality of intelligence operations. I know that is not your motive, Senator Xenophon, but it is the effect of the argument against section 35P. 


This was looked at by the first PJCIS report, recommendation 28, and adopted in a bipartisan manner. I should say that the section 35P protections of ASIO are modelled on the longstanding protections of the Australian Federal Police for protected operations by AFP officers; they are modelled on like protection provisions that exist under state and territory law for state and territory police officers. It should never be controversial, frankly, that the identity of officers involved in covert operations should be protected. 


Lastly, this is not a provision about journalists, as I have said many times. This is no more a provision about journalists than the law relating to drink-driving is a law about journalists. This is a law that makes it an offence for anyone in the community to disclose or prejudice a covert operation. That is what section 35P does. We had that debate in this chamber last year. Section 35P was passed in the teeth of a reasonably furious media campaign. But, mindful of the sensitivity of the press freedom issue that some journalists and news organisations have raised, additional protections were added. In particular, the Director of Public Prosecutions himself issued a directive which is available on his website setting out certain public interest criteria that would be applied in enforcing section 35P.


As well, I made a directive to the Director of Public Prosecutions requiring the consent of the Attorney-General for any prosecution under section 35P. So if it were thought that a prosecution was in some way inappropriate or inimical to the freedom of the press, by requiring the Attorney's consent—that happens in a number of cases, but they are unusual—it would mean that the Attorney-General of the day, whoever he or she may be, as the responsible political officer would accept personal and public responsibility. So it would not merely be a matter of prosecutorial discretion exercised by the Commonwealth DPP; it would be a matter of the Attorney-General of the day accepting public and political responsibility as well. So there are safeguards. I will defend to the utmost, Senator Xenophon, the proposition that the confidentiality of covert operations ought to be protected, as it is in section 35P, by criminal sanction.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:31):  The Attorney has grossly misrepresented my position. If he remembers, during the debate in respect of section 35P there was an amendment moved, from memory, by Senator Lambie, then a member of the Palmer United Party, to increase the penalty from five years to 10 years in circumstances where lives were endangered by someone disclosing a special intelligence operation. I supported that. I supported that because there must be no ambiguity when it comes to information that could lead to a person involved in a special intelligence operation having their life endangered or, indeed, having the lives of their family members endangered by virtue of the disclosure of their identity. I just want to make that absolutely clear. I would be grateful if the Attorney would acknowledge this: I have never argued that endangering the life of a person by disclosing information should not be a most serious offence.


But I do draw the Attorney's attention to comments made by Tim Wilson, the Human Rights Commissioner—an appointment that the Attorney made. He has raised concerns about section 35P. He made the point in an opinion piece that:


As former independent national security legislation monitor Bret Walker has argued, in its most extreme form 35P could stop the reporting of a citizen being killed during a botched special intelligence operation. I have no doubt that is not the intention of the government, or any in the near future. But that shouldn't mollify critics.


He expresses real concerns in respect of that.


My concern is that section 35P in its current form does not give protection to journalists where there is no question of revealing the identity of someone involved in a special intelligence operation. We are aware of raids in the past that have been botched by our police and intelligence operatives. Things have gone wrong. It seems to me that in those circumstances there will be no protection for journalists reporting that. We have very fine journalists in this country such as Cameron Stewart who report on these matters. He is highly regarded. I think that he would be constrained in reporting on those sorts of issues.


The government seems to be coming from the position that intelligence agencies can do no wrong. Well, they are not infallible. They do make mistakes. We have seen throughout history that this is a very dangerous position to take. The media plays a vital role in exposing those intelligence operations which have gone wrong, where it is in the public interest to disclose them and where there is no question of any lives being endangered by that disclosure.


I just want to make it clear on the record that I supported an increase in the penalty from five years to 10 years in order that if disclosure endangered the life of someone involved in a special intelligence operation that should be treated seriously by the courts. But this is about ensuring that the media can do their job in cases where there is a clear public interest to disclose an intelligence operation that effectively goes wrong.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:35):  Senator Xenophon, I do not for a moment suggest—and I said this before—that you would wish to oppose a provision that protects the lives and health of ASIO officers. But you are directing yourself to subsection 35P(2), which is on the aggravated offence. It carries a penalty of imprisonment of 10 years. The problem with your argument, Senator Xenophon, is that, under subsubsection 35P(2)(c), there is an element that:


(i) the person intends to endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation; or 


(ii) the disclosure of the information will endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation.


That carries the higher range penalty of 10 years imprisonment.


Senator Xenophon, you detained the Senate for some time this morning arguing very persuasively, if I may say so, the case for having a purpose test and an effects test so that unintended consequences could be caught as well as deliberate conduct in relation to another provision of the bill before the chamber. The same logic that you advanced earlier on in the debate applies here. Disclosure may not be intended to or for the purpose of endangering lives or health. It is very unlikely to be. But that may be the incidental effect of it. That is why, if it is the inadvertent or incidental effect of it, we need section 35(1), which does not contain those limitations.


As well, although I spoke about life and health as the extreme case here, there are more consideration at play than merely that. For example, there are operational techniques. To disclose operational techniques is not necessarily to endanger the life or health of agents or officers engaged in an operation, although it could, either currently or in the future, but it certainly prejudices the capacity of ASIO to effectively carry out those operations if its tradecraft, if its techniques, if its wherewithal, are the subject of public disclosure.


Let us be realistic here, Senator Xenophon. ASIO is a covert intelligence gathering body. It was established in 1949 by the Chifley government to be a covert intelligence gathering body. That is what it does and because we are a liberal democracy that cares about values like personal freedom and the freedom of the press, when we establish a covert intelligence gathering body in the middle of a liberal democracy what do we do? We subject it to the most stringent limitations and oversight mechanisms and accountability mechanisms, and the architecture of those mechanisms, including the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, including the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, including various requirements of accountability to the Attorney-General, including reporting requirements to the parliament, has been integral to the confidence that the Australian people have had in ASIO since 1949. That confidence, I believe, has never been significantly prejudiced because although over the years ASIO has made mistakes, frankly it has not made many, in the scheme of things, since 1949. So, Senator Xenophon, the essence of your proposition is that it should not be against the law to disclose the special intelligence operation of an agency which was designed and built to operate covertly. That is what you are saying.




Senator Xenophon:
  No I'm not.




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is the effect of what you are saying, whether you are prepared to acknowledge it or not, and I fundamentally disagree with you

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:39):  Not only am I prepared not to acknowledge what the Attorney has said, but I repudiate what he says, because the amendment is clear—it must be in the public interest. There is a whole framework there in respect of the public interest. Let me give one example. On 4 August 2009 there was a front-page story by The Australian's Cameron Stewart, one of the most respected journalists in this country. It was headed 'Army base terror plot foiled', and it related to a plot by Islamic extremists in Melbourne to launch a suicide attack on an Australian Army base being uncovered by national security agencies. TheAustralian's story caused a massive fuss at the time. So I am not accused of plagiarism, I am reading from a piece from a MediaWatch story on this on 6 October 2014. I am going to confine my remarks to Mr Stewart's story. There was a huge fuss at the time, with the AFP and the Victorian police accusing Cameron Stewart of putting their operation at risk by reporting the police raids on the day they were going to take place. Cameron Stewart, in response to MediaWatch questions on 3 October 2014, was asked whether he believed his scoop would have been blocked by the new law. It was unclear, because ASIO was also part of Operation Neath, said Mr Stewart—he said he suspected it could have been declared a special intelligence operation under those new provisions, and he did not see how it could have been possible to publish his stories without breaking the law and being liable for jail. Does the Attorney consider that Mr Stewart should be charged under section 35P for that front-page story in The Australian newspaper on 4 August 2009?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:41):  No, I do not, and he could not be. Let me explain very simply why he could not be. The activity about which Mr Stewart reported was the execution of a search warrant, it was not a special intelligence operation. ASIO does not need and has never needed a special intelligence operation authorisation to execute a search warrant. In fact, the search warrant powers of ASIO I think have been powers of ASIO since the original ASIO Act of 1955. ASIO was created in 1949 but it was put on a statutory footing I think in 1955. If Mr Stewart was apprehensive that that was so, Mr Stewart is wrong, and the example Senator Xenophon gives is wrong. If that is what concerns you, I can relieve your concerns entirely. Section 35P does not apply to search warrants.


The other example you give, Senator Xenophon, is wrong too. You refer to allegations in relation to spying on East Timor. These are only allegations. But the allegations are in relation to ASIS, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. Whether those allegations be true or false, this is about ASIO. So, with the two examples you give, one is about the wrong agency and the other is about the wrong procedure. Section 35P applies to neither.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:43):  I indicate my support for Senator Xenophon's amendment. It is well known in free speech circles that 35P went too far, even to the extent that the member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, wrote in a public forum to that effect. Free speech advocates including Bret Walker, Professor George Williams and Tim Wilson, amongst others, have expressed concerns about 35P. The distinction that Senator Xenophon's amendment makes is between recklessness and intention, and I think the amendment brings it back into the realm of intention in an appropriate fashion. There are safeguards in it to protect ASIO personnel, and the grave danger here is that, as we almost did with the torture issue, we would be giving cover for misbehaviour by ASIO agents that, if it was reported, if it was brought to the public's attention, would constitute a crime, so it would be a crime to report what ought to be a crime. 


Senator Xenophon's amendment nominates what would be in the public interest and what it would not be a crime to report, which includes maladministration, an abuse of public trust, an officer of a public agency abusing his or her position and action which gives a reasonable ground for disciplinary action. I think the amendment is appropriate and ought to be adopted.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:45):  Labor noted its concerns about section 35P and its effect on freedom of the press when this was last agitated. We asked the government to refer the matter to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and, despite initial objection, the government agreed to do this. The monitor will be holding hearings and reporting back to the government on this matter in the coming months. It would be inappropriate to pre-empt that process with amendments tacked onto an unrelated bill. As a result, Labor will not be supporting this amendment. I note that Senator Xenophon has also sought to amend other disclosure provisions in Commonwealth law and, again, it is not appropriate for these matters to be agitated in this bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:46):  I am grateful to Senator Collins, not for not supporting the amendment but for pointing out that Roger Gyles is looking at these matters. But I think there is an urgency in dealing with them now. I understand what the position is. I hope—hope against hope—that, depending on what Mr Gyles concludes, this will be re-litigated, revisited or whatever. I have a serious concern about this.


I will refer to what the Australian Financial Review's international editor, Tony Walker, has said. In the Australian Financial Review on 27-28 September 2014, he said that it:


… will have a chilling effect on reporting of security matters in an environment in which parliamentary oversight provisions are extremely weak. 


The legislation will sit on the statute books like a rotting carcass.


Cameron Stewart, who reports on security matters for the Australian, in responding to Media Watch questions on 3 October 2014, said this—and it is very telling:


… Australians will know less than they deserve to about what is happening inside security agencies at a time when they are larger and more powerful than ever before.


I would pose a question to the Attorney—and this is a question that could relate to any attorney. It could be that he could be Attorney for the next 20 years but there will be a successor to the Attorney one day. Under these provisions in respect of 35P, is it not the case that the Attorney has a wide discretion as to what can be declared a special intelligence operation? Could that not, for instance, declare that the execution of a warrant itself could be a special intelligence operation?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:48):  No, Senator, because the warrant application procedure under the ASIO Act and the special intelligence operation procedure under the ASIO Act are quite separate. I hope my staff can remind me of the section that deals with special intelligence operations. The special intelligence operation is the most complex kind of covert operation that ASIO will undertake. It will be undertaken rarely. It requires a series of criteria specified in the ASIO Act to be satisfied before the Attorney authorises it. The application for a search warrant is a much more straightforward procedure. To compare a special intelligence operation to the execution of a search warrant is to compare two procedures, one of which is a very complex and unusual procedure and the other of which is not an especially complex and a much more common procedure.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  But, Senator Xenophon, if ASIO wanted a search warrant they would apply for a search warrant, and it is a lot easier to get a search warrant than it is to get authorisation for a special intelligence operation.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:49):  I thank Senator Xenophon for bringing this amendment forward tonight. I can guarantee that this is not the last time that this chamber will deal with the issue of the fact that the Australian government, with the support of the Labor Party, last year sought to effectively criminalise forms of national security reporting. I did not expect Senator Brandis, who was the sponsor of that bill, to have changed his mind, and nothing that he has said tonight has been particularly surprising. The reason that this amendment was brought forward and the reason that the Australian Greens are supporting it is that it gives the Australian Labor Party a chance to do something about the buyer's regret that it suffered last year.


The data retention campaign and bill has been a little bit different, but last year, after the ASIO bill passed, there was a remarkable outpouring of anxiety, concern, alarm and, I would say, regret from some in the Press Gallery and from some in the Australian Labor Party. We are giving you the opportunity tonight to do something with that buyer's regret and fix the mistake that was made when the ASIO bill passed into law last year. I am very pleased to join with my crossbench colleagues in providing the kind of opposition that this country needs on matters such as this and to provide the Labor Party with the chance to do something with some of the concerns that it expressed after it supported Senator Brandis last year.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:51):  I do not want to prolong the debate—and I expected Senator Ludlam to say what he had to say; he has his view and I have mine—but I just wanted to add to my remarks to Senator Xenophon. It has been pointed out to me that not only in a practical sense would ASIO never seek a special intelligence operation authorisation where all it needed was a search warrant, it actually cannot.


The jurisdiction under section 35C and 35D are the relevant provisions of the ASIO Act. The jurisdiction to grant approval to a special intelligence operation is only exercisable in circumstances where there would otherwise but for the authorisation be a breach of the civil or criminal law. That is a not uncommon provision in relation to covert operations. For example, if an officer engages covertly, pretending to be a member of a terrorist cell, for argument's sake, he could find himself engaged in conduct which might constitute the offence of preparation for a terrorist act—playing along, as it were, with the cell that he was trying to penetrate. These are matters of fine operational judgement. But the point I am making to you, Senator Xenophon, is that because a special intelligence operation can be authorised under section 35C of the ASIO Act only in circumstances involving conduct that would otherwise breach the criminal or civil law, it could not—it actually is a matter of law, not just practicality—overlap with a search warrant application, because of course to execute a search warrant is not a breach of the criminal or the civil law.

So of course we will consider Mr Gyles's recommendations when we receive them. I mentioned two, but as Senator Collins has, rightly, reminded me, there are actually three oversight mechanisms that we have introduced post the debate: firstly, my direction under the Commonwealth DPP Act to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a prosecution of a journalist under section 35P could be engaged only with the Attorney-General's consent; secondly, the Commonwealth DPP's own guidelines, which further limit and add additional elements to the exercise of his prosecutorial discretion in a case like that; and, thirdly, the review of this provision which the Prime Minister and I referred to Mr Roger Gyles so that he could bring an independent mind to bear on the issues—in good faith, obviously—that you and other colleagues have raised.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (18:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a third time.


I want to thank the Senate for the debate that we have had through a long committee stage. Nobody could say that this has been a rushed process, it being the culmination of something that began in May 2013, when former Attorney-General Roxon referred this issue to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I think it is very important, particularly where national security legislation is involved, that the issues be fully ventilated, and I do not think it could be said that they have not been. I want to thank the three principal crossbench participants in this debate, Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Xenophon and Senator Ludlam, for their contributions. Obviously the government has not agreed with those contributions, but nevertheless observations that have come from the crossbench in the course of this debate will inform the government's thinking about this legislation when it comes to be reviewed, and I think we have had, for what has been a difficult issue, a very civil and intelligent debate, if I may say so.


I want to thank a couple of people. I want to thank Anna Harmer, from the Attorney-General's Department, and Simon Lee and their team for their hard work. I want to thank the hardworking officers of ASIO, whom it would be a crime for me to name, for their contribution, but I can name the former Director-General of Security, David Irvine, who, more than anyone else, was the parent of these reforms, and the current director-general, Duncan Lewis.


I want to thank my colleagues, particularly my colleague Malcolm Turnbull, who introduced this legislation and handled it in the lower house; Mr Anthony Byrne, the former Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, who conducted the committee through the hearings during the last parliament with notable skill and nonpartisanship; and Mr Dan Tehan, the member for Wannon, who displayed a similar spirit during the inquiry into the bill in this parliament. May I thank the opposition, in particular the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, for its support of this important measure. Lastly, may I thank my staff, in particular Justin Bassi, my adviser, and Emma Swinbourne, from my office, for the very hard work that they have put into this legislation.


This legislation does contain protections that were not there before. It does preserve a capability for the police and national security and commercial regulatory agencies which was on the verge of being lost. It does contain safeguards that were not there before. It is, in the government's view—shared, I am pleased to say, by the opposition—a measured and proportionate response. Its operation will be conducted over a long implementation period, as the bill provides. It will be the subject of the statutory review, and certain aspects of it will be the subject of sooner review.


In dealing with national security issues, we do have to bring the public with us. We do have to get the balance right between protection and liberty. The bipartisan spirit with which this bill has been dealt with in this parliament and the constructiveness of the engagement of those who did not feel able to support the bill but nevertheless engaged in the debate in the manner in which they have done I think are a credit to all who have participated in the debate and a credit to this parliament.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:07):  I will be brief because this debate has been running for some time. We are here tonight because the Abbott government has chosen to ignore the very clear warnings sent by tens of thousands of people and pressed ahead with a bill that entrenches a form of passive surveillance over 23 million Australians.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I will get to that—believe me, I will. It has been a long time coming. Mandatory data retention first came to light—at least to my knowledge—in 2010, when it became evident that the Attorney-General's Department had forced telecommunications companies into secret meetings to establish how a two-year mandatory data retention scheme could work. That was when the ALP's Robert McClelland was Attorney-General. With the support of the then chair of the environment and communications committee, Senator Mary Jo Fisher—who I think many people in here still remember quite fondly—we conducted an inquiry into what the Attorney-General's Department was up to, which generated a significant degree of opposition. And then the proposal went underground for a time.


In 2012, with the ALP's Ms Nicola Roxon as Attorney-General, mandatory data retention was referred as a single throwaway paragraph to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Under a hail of condemnation, that committee was unable to come to a consensus recommendation on mandatory data retention. The proposal dropped under the radar again until it was put firmly back there last August by Senator George Brandis. I have sketched this recent history because this bill contains the DNA of both of the major parties. I am getting a little tired of people reinventing history, as began to happen after the unwelcome passage of the ASIO reforms last year. In her opening contribution, the Labor Party's Senator Collins put it better than I could. She said:


The Australian people must be satisfied that in seeking to defend ourselves from crime and terrorism we do not trample upon the very rights and freedoms that characterise Australia as a free and open democracy. The Abbott government has failed this test.


I strongly agree with this statement by Senator Collins. The Abbott government has failed this test, and the majority of the Australian people are not satisfied with this government's lunge for power. 


The only people who did end up satisfied were in the Australian Labor Party. The ALP has caved in to Tony Abbott's self-interested fear campaign and supported the bill. Together, with some of the more critically minded crossbench senators, we had the numbers to defeat this bill, but you failed to turn up. You will be judged for that, and we will ensure that people never forget who made this possible. In 2016, you will answer for it. Surveillance in a democracy should be targeted, proportionate and levelled at serious criminals, organised crime and national security threats. This bill entrenches the opposite. The government will not disclose the costs of the scheme, is silent on the risks of unauthorised disclosure and has at no stage been able to point to evidence that collecting the private records of 23 million nonsuspects will keep people safe or reduce the crime rate. 


We will be encouraging people to follow the advice of Mr Malcolm Turnbull, who introduced the bill and, in recent days, has been outlining techniques for avoiding the surveillance scheme that he has just forced on the rest of us. Mr Turnbull told Sky's David Speers yesterday:


… of course you now have the ability by using over-the-top applications. It might just be something straightforward like Whatsapp. It might be a more encrypted over-the-top application to avoid leaving a trail.


He goes on to say:


If you have a device, you know, a phone or a smartphone, and if I call you through the mobile phone network there will be a record. Say my phone's with Telstra, there'll be a record with Telstra that I've called your number. If on the other hand—


our helpful communications minister informs us—


I communicate with you via Skype for a voice call or Viber, send you a message on WhatsApp or Wickr or Threema or Signal or Telegrammer—there's a gazillion of them—or, indeed, if you make a FaceTime call, then all that the telco can see, insofar as it can see anything, is that my device has had a connection with the Skype server or the WhatsApp server; it doesn't see anything happening with you.


Amazing! Tips on how to avoid mandatory data retention by the guy who introduced the bill.


There is a lot of bad information, however, circulating about the use of cryptography and anonymisation tools in protecting privacy and identity online. In particular, there is real confusion about whether merely circumventing the government's expensive new data retention regime guarantees any kind of absolute privacy or anonymity. I admit that I am guilty of some pretty loose language on this issue myself. So I want to be completely clear: if you do not want your email records captured by data retention, all you need to do is use a platform that that is hosted overseas like Gmail or Facebook. If you do not want metadata from your chat sessions hanging around forever, use one of the services that Mr Turnbull recommends. If configured properly, these services erase their tracks as fast as they are created. So as far as email records are concerned, defeating this $400 million data retention scheme really is that simple.


But there are two hugely important caveats. Firstly, it is well documented that signals intelligence agencies like the NSA and its Five Eyes partners, of which Australia is one, are engaged in massive full-take surveillance of nearly all data traffic globally and that these entities are alleged to have unprecedented visibility of the networks of these very same international providers—some of them mentioned by Mr Turnbull. The second caveat is that using Facebook chat or Twitter direct messages in no way actually guarantees anonymity of privacy. There are whole bodies of practice and technique out there on how to do this well. But the fact is: doing crypto well is actually pretty hard.


We have recently taken the lead of data journalist and transparency activist Asher Wolf, who founded the global CryptoParty movement, and we have held a few events of our own to up-skill on basic crypto skills. The fact is: if you are a whistleblower who fears what will happen if your identity is disclosed, assume that there is no politician in this building—and I include myself—with the technical skills to help you properly protect your identity. You will need to look after yourself. I came across an article yesterday by a certain Dan Nolan who debunked some of the confusion surrounding the distinction between defeating data retention, which in some regards is fairly easy, and defeating some of the more elaborate systems deployed against journalists, whistleblowers, activists and campaigners. The article is titled 'Leaking Securely', and it reads in part:


How To Leak


1. This might seem obvious, but think about it, don't leak information only you have access to. If you're the only one that has the information then it's pretty bloody easy to figure out who leaked the info. Find or create a situation in which you can have plausible deniability that someone else accessed the data


2. Don't leak data from your home computer, from your personal devices or anywhere at home or at work. You will get caught, and if there are legal ramifications of the leak they will rain down on you like fire.


3. Don't leak data from personal accounts or accounts linked to family or friends or that can in any way be traced back to you. Create a hushmail or a gmail account, don't put in your phone number and create this account on a computer you do not normally use, say an internet cafe.


4. Don't provide any personal information in the stuff you leak. Redact as you need to.


5. Don't store copies of leaked information on personal devices or home devices.


6. If you use a USB device or something similar to access or copy data, be aware of corporate policies or monitoring. If you're copying from your office computer, logged in under your account to a device, corporate IT systems can easily track you down and figure out who copied what and when.


7. Destroy any items or devices you use to transit the information to be leaked to a third party area. Dispose of them, again, somewhere you wouldn't normally dispose of items so someone going through your rubbish can't find them. 


8. Only leak to places that have SecureDrop, like the Guardian.


9. DON'T TELL ANYONE WHAT YOU DID. DO NOT TELL A SINGLE SOUL WHAT YOU DID.


He carries on, but I am not sure that I want to read the rest of it into Hansard. The point being, I guess, the old saying 'three may keep a secret as long as two are dead' applies very much to whistleblowing. Now some, like Mr Edward Snowden, whom the Attorney-General has said on any number of occasions he believes to be a traitor—who I believe to be one of the most important whistleblowers in modern history—or publishers like Julian Assange, who has just spent more than 1,000 days in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, actually do go public and do lend their name to these acts of quite radical transparency. But, for others, if your welfare or your job depends on anonymity or privacy, do your research and make sure you are using these tools properly. And, by the way, we are looking to auspice such a session for the Canberra Press Gallery, because, with the installation of this regime, things just got even more serious.


Before we commit this thing to a vote, I want to thank all of those who built a spirited community campaign against this measure—publishers, journalists, the Law Council of Australia, the technology sector, digital rights organisations like EFA and advocates from right across the political spectrum joined tens of thousands of concerned Australians to voice their anger—and the major parties shut them out. Some of these people do this advocacy for a living and I thank them for their expertise and their determination. But above all, I want to thank and acknowledge those who bothered to come to events, made calls, wrote emails, signed petitions and organised to try to bring about a different outcome tonight. I would also like to thank my staff, particularly Felicity Ruby who, with me, fought round 1 and round 2 data retention, and Renai LeMay for throwing his heart and soul into round 3. I also acknowledge the significant dissent within the Liberal-National-Labor parties, but the inflexible party discipline that prevails in Australia means that not a single member crossed the floor either to oppose the bill or to support the dozens of amendments proposed by the crossbench. I thank those members of the crossbench in the House and in the Senate, who, together with the Australian Greens, performed the job of opposition that the Labor Party abandoned. We will remember this come 2016, and we will not let others forget.


Our work now turns to documenting this regime and working for its repeal. But to all those listing to this debate, and I know that there are many of you out there, I apologise to you. To all of those who will face the consequences of what is done tonight, I am deeply sorry that we were not able to prevent this from passing into law.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-03-26,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (18:18):  I had not intended to make a third reading contribution, but I think there were a few points raised by Senator Ludlam that do need some response. Firstly, I thank him for his concession that he has used loose language and his reference to 'bad' information. I personally have found, through the many people I have communicated with about the facts and the details of this matter, many have come back to me and said, 'Thank you very much for a detailed and considered response. We now understand the circumstances,' rather than some of the 'bad' information—to use Senator Ludlam's words—that has been circulating in this debate.


Let me make a few critical points here, points that Senator Ludlam has indeed glossed over. Mandatory data retention is not mass surveillance. Let me repeat that:—




Senator Brandis:
  That is what Professor Gillian Triggs said.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Let me repeat that: mandatory data retention is not mass surveillance. And indeed I will pick up on Senator Brandis's interjection there and refer to his earlier comments. That is what Professor Gillian Triggs said in her contribution to this debate.


Information that is recorded is not necessarily accessed. We have built a strong system with checks and balances to ensure we have that balance right. I also will not be verballed. Senator Brandis likes to do that to me, but now it seems Senator Ludlam does as well. I do not appreciate being verballed by Senator Ludlam. I will make it very clear: the Labor Party has not caved in on this matter.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  But, Senator Ludlam, I want to be very clear on the record because you were referring to my contribution when you moved very swiftly to that next point. So let us make it very clear: the Labor Party has not caved in on this matter. And, yes, indeed, we do accept that we will be judged as will you and as will all of us in the political arena. We accept that, and we take responsibility for that. We are the alternative government, and we need to be responsible about issues related to national security. We do not accept the bad information and the suggestions that 'there have only been three cases that might relate to national security'. It does you no service to continue to peddle some of that bad information.


What also does you no service is to move amendments such as you did today in relation to the ACCC and to ASIC. It is quite contrary, as Senator Brandis pointed out in the debate, to the usual positions the Greens would take about such crime. I was astounded. I understood why Senator Leyonhjelm did that from his perspective, but for that to come from the Greens was quite astounding.


Let me go back to that point about how Labor purportedly caved in. I know that Senator Ludlam would like to participate in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I am not sure about the job application he just did in his third reading speech—I suspect Senator Xenophon's might have been closer to the mark. As Senator Brandis and others indicated, copious work went into this process. In terms of caving in, I would have to say the 74 amendments that were accepted by the government in the debate in the House of Representatives represent the critical concessions that have been made in this debate to build a system that does have integrity and does have balance. I am confident that we have reached that balance. That balance involves not only the protection of privacy but also the protection of our national security.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:22):  It would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge the fulsome nature of this debate, the generally civil nature of this debate. We even managed to throw in cultural references to The Mikado, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, the Dead Kennedys and the Sex Pistols. We weaved it all in there. It was a debate that was not gagged and not truncated, and I think that that says something about the institution of this place and the manner in which we conduct debate on some very important issues. I also want to acknowledge the role of the opposition, in particular Senator Collins, in respect of this, and I want to thank my colleagues Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Ludlam. In terms of our respective political beliefs, we are a pretty disparate and motley bunch, but we were bound together by a genuine concern about what impact this will have on our democracy and on free speech.


I just want to make this observation: we live in difficult and dangerous times. There is a need to combat terrorism. Of course there is a need to do all we can to combat paedophilia and to stamp that out to bring those predators to justice. But my concern is that, with our intelligence agencies having more and more power—as this bill does give another increase in the power of our intelligence agencies—we do not have the same level of scrutiny as some of our closest allies such as the United States. We do not have the level of parliamentary oversight that the German parliament has, in respect of our intelligence services. I think it is important that we do so, and that is something that we cannot ignore.


I also do not understand, and I hope that Roger Gyles, in his assessment as Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, will consider the issue of allowing the public interest advocate to consult with journalists and media organisations before their metadata is accessed, as is the general practice in the United States, following rulings by Eric Holder, their Attorney General. So, finally, my great fear, which is based on an emotion, but is based on the very text of this bill, is that this legislation will, like a python, further put the squeeze on investigative journalism and whistleblowers in this country. This, in turn, will have a suffocating effect on press freedom, and that is bad for our democracy.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:25):  I am not in the habit of making third reading speeches. I agree with other speakers, including the Attorney-General, that this was not a rushed exercise, unlike the previous National Security Legislation Amendment Bill, and I am very pleased that was not the case. However, I do wish to draw attention to one amendment of mine that I know was taken seriously on all sides of the chamber and, in some form, was also considered in detail by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. During the Senate Committee of the Whole consideration, Senator Brandis reassured everyone in this place that mandatory data retention would not be used to pursue trivial crimes. He pointed out that proposed section 180F will require authorised officers to:


… be satisfied on reasonable grounds that any interference with the privacy of any person or persons that may result from the disclosure or use is justifiable and proportionate.


Amendments to proposed section 180F(a) also required authorised officers to consider both the seriousness of the offence and the seriousness of the penalty involved before making any authorisation. In the view of both government and opposition, these safeguards are clearly considered adequate, and I thank the Attorney-General for setting out why he thinks they comport with the recent European Court of Justice ruling overturning the European Union data retention directive. For the reasons he gave, my amendment to ensure retained data was only used for the enforcement of serious contraventions was rejected. I mean not disrespect to the Attorney-General when I say that I do not believe him. I am not comforted by his reassurances, because I already have abundant evidence for the invasive use of retained data to pursue trivialities. In the existing law, section 180F already requires authorised officers to:


… have regard to whether any interference with the privacy of any person or persons that may result from the disclosure or use is justifiable …


In other words, despite the presence of a decently drafted, clear requirement not to invade people's privacy without justification, hundreds of thousands of authorisations have been made, often in connection with requests that are absurd. In the year to June 2013, for example, there were almost 320,000 authorisations to access telephone records. Yes, it is good that the number of agencies that can stick their fingers into this particular data honey pot has been reduced. However, the list can be added to with remarkably little parliamentary oversight, and ASIC and ACCC have also been included.


The Attorney-General seems content to accept undertakings from security and law enforcement agencies that retained data will not be misused. Indeed, it would appear that the police and security agencies are never self-interested. Lawyers, by contrast, as we heard at length yesterday, should be ignored because they are self-interested. I suspect the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. Everyone is capable of acting in pure self-interest at least some of the time. Unfortunately, this bill gives the truth tick only to the police and brushes the Law Society's concerns to one side. As a classical liberal, I know which body of people is most likely to abuse our rights and undermine our freedom. Lawyers may have money, but police have guns. Individual policemen may be fine human beings, but there is no escaping the institutional reality that they are part of the executive and the executive ought to be restrained. I do not look forward to saying, 'I told you so,' when this law is used—just as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act in the United Kingdom was used—to pursue illegal dumping, dog fouling, unpaid rates, minor welfare fraud and petrol stations comparing fuel prices.


Mark my words, however, that is what will happen. It may take a while. It took some time for police forces and local authorities across England and Wales to realise just what they could do with the data at their disposal. But once they got started, misuse became pervasive. I condemn this bill.

Evidentiary certificate relating to ongoing enforcement agency matter



(1) A certifying offer of an enforcement agency may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out:

(2) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (1) by a certifying officer of an enforcement agency and to be signed by him or her:


   (a) is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof; and


   (b) is, in an exempt proceeding, prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the document.


Note: An evidentiary certificate issued under this section relates to an offence under section 182A.


Amendment (10) amends the offences in the bill related to the disclosure and use of journalist information warrants. This amendment limits the offence to ensure it only applies when a person knows that the information disclosed or used relates to a journalist information warrant and that the matter to which the warrant relates is ongoing. The aim of this amendment is to ensure openness and transparency and, in practical terms, to allow reporting on matters that may, in the past, have related to journalist protection warrants. While acknowledging that such an offence provision may be necessary to protect ongoing investigations, these amendments prevent the offence from becoming a barrier to sharing information in the public interest. 


Amendment (11) seeks to clarify the defences available to someone charged with the disclosure or use of information relating to journalist information warrants. It provides that disclosure or use by a journalist for the purpose of disseminating information in the public interest is a defence. In conjunction with the amendments in amendment (10), this amendment will ensure that journalists are free to report on matters of public interest even if they are the subject of a journalist information warrant.


Amendment (12) allows the Director-General of Security or Deputy Director-General of Security to provide evidentiary certificates relating to whether a matter involving the grounds on which a journalist information warrant was issued is ongoing and whether the matter specified was ongoing on a particular day. These provisions are consistent with others in the act relating to the issuing of evidentiary certificates. Under the same conditions, a certifying officer of an enforcement agency may issue a written certificate relating to the same matters. Again, this is consistent with existing provisions for the use of evidentiary certificates in the act.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (16:40):  The government does not support these amendments. Section 102A makes it an offence for a person to use or disclose information about a journalist information warrant. The offence is punishable by two years imprisonment. Pursuant to section 5.6 of the Criminal Code, this offence will be committed where a person uses or discloses information and is reckless as to whether that information is about a journalist information warrant. Amendment (10) would make disclosure an offence only where the person who discloses the warrant knows that the information is about a journalist information warrant relating to an ongoing matter. The offence provisions serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security and integrity of investigations are maintained against unlawful disclosure and protecting the reputation and privacy of subjects of investigations.


Prohibitions on use and disclosure exist so that any private information, even the mere fact that a person has come to the police's attention, is not incidentally used to embarrass, humiliate or harass the person. Given the sensitive nature of TIA Act powers, for those prohibitions to be meaningful they must be backed up by criminal penalties. The media cannot have it both ways. They have sought protections relating to the identification of their sources, yet they are looking to be able to disclose the information about the target of the warrant—that is, the source. The offence provision is consistent with those already in place in relation to other warrants, including telecommunications interception warrants and stored communications warrants. These offences exist in both Commonwealth and state legislation, including relating to surveillance device warrants. They create a need to know within an agency to protect the privacy of the person who is the subject of the warrant.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (16:42):  I could refer to my earlier comments, Senator Xenophon, but I will add an additional point on these amendments, especially for your staff. The provisions regarding unauthorised disclosure that a warrant has been sought are standard in warrant schemes. I think I can elaborate on Senator Brandis's comments that the explanatory memorandum sets out the rationale for these provisions. Let me read those:


153. Section 182A makes it an offence for a person to use or disclose information about whether a journalist information warrant, has been, or is being requested or applied for, the making of such warrant, the existence or non-existence of such a warrant and the revocation of such a warrant. The maximum penalty for this offence is 2 years imprisonment. Section 182A is consistent with equivalent offence provisions already in place in relation to other warrants, including telecommunications interception warrants and stored communications warrants. These provisions create a ""need-to-know"" within an agency to protect the privacy of the person who is the subject of a TIA Act warrant.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:43):  I thank the government and the opposition for their response, but let us put this into perspective. If a journalist discloses after the fact, when, as set out in this amendment, it is clearly in the public interest, that there has been a journalist information warrant sought or obtained—when there is no longer any issue about it being detrimental to the work of the security agency or the authorities but is in fact actually in the public interest—that would still be a criminal offence. How, from a public policy point of view, can that be desirable? There is a threshold in this amendment that says it must be in the public interest for a journalist to disclose that there was a warrant issued.


It might be five years down the track or 10 years down the track. Does that mean forever and a day that this will be secret? Does this mean that in 10 years' time, 20 years' time, 30 years' time or 40 years' time, if this bill is in its current form, that journalists will not be able to ever report that a warrant was sought for their metadata even when the exigency or the need for the warrant is no longer apparent and it is also positively in the public interest to disclose that? That is what disturbs me: that fact that we could end up seeing journalists being jailed for disclosing something that would be clearly in the public interest.

(39) Schedule 2, item 8, page 63 (lines 14 to 24), to be opposed.


As to these amendments, we covered—whether it was last night or the night before, I now cannot remember; it has all started to run together—the issue of the government being able to effectively move the goalposts in terms of categories of data that could be added to the scope of the bill once it is enacted, the number of service providers and companies who could be brought within the scope of the bill and, the third issue, the fact that Attorney-General can unilaterally add agencies to the bill.


The Attorney-General has made much—and I acknowledge the significant change and a significant improvement in the regime that prevails in Australia to date—of narrowing roughly 80 agencies, to use the rule of thumb figure. In theory, it could be much larger than that, because there are in excess of 500 local government authorities in this country. They can, in theory at least, acquire metadata on a warrantless basis by just directly contacting the phone and internet companies. This bill narrows the range of agencies to just under two dozen. But, of course, the door as it closes on one side opens on another: the Attorney-General has allowed himself to unilaterally add agencies back into the bill. We are going back to some of the arguments that we had earlier about this strange 40 sitting day lag that appears where the minister can add an agency; 40 sitting days can pass, which will be six or eight months down the track; and then the parliament is asked to ratify the decision.


Maybe before we go to the substance of the amendments, because what we are proposing to do is remove that power so that if another agency is to come back into the scheme and be able to access people's metadata on a warrantless basis, we believe that is something that the parliament should be engaged in at the beginning of the process and not the end. Just before I put the amendments, what I would like to do is seek your advice, Attorney-General, on what criteria you will bear in mind when agencies come knocking on your door seeking to be included back into the scheme.


That is because, as you have identified earlier in the debate, some—when you read the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act annual reports—agencies like Centrelink and a number of others that have no criminal law enforcement role are among the largest users of these authorisations. I want to know what criteria will guide you when Centrelink, if we take them as an example, come knocking at your door—if they are not already there—seeking to be reincorporated within the scheme.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (16:49):  I will answer your question in a moment, Senator Ludlam. Thank you at least for having the good grace to acknowledge the reduction of the number of agencies to 21 from 85, which is a very substantial improvement on the status quo. That is the point I have been making all along. I tried to make it in my speech winding up the second reading debate. The way this debate has proceeded, you could be forgiven for thinking—if you were not familiar with the legislation and were listening in—that this is an invasion of peoples' liberties, whereas in fact what it does is attenuate very significantly and subject to much more rigorous oversight conduct which at the moment is lawful.


Coming directly to your question, the answer is in accordance with the criteria actually set out in section 110A(4). The criteria that the minister must have regard to in considering whether to make a declaration is set out there, particularly in subsection (c). The minister is, among other things, required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, with a binding scheme that provides for the protection of personal information and with other matters which you can read yourself. This is not an ungoverned discretion. It is a discretion that is governed by the specific matters set out in proposed subsection 110A(4)(b). Because these are amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the discretion is governed generally by the criteria set out in section 180F. That is augmented and strengthened by this bill, which deals with the overarching considerations to be had regard to in accessing information.


You, in an exuberantly rhetorical way, said that the minister can unilaterally add agencies. As a matter of fact, the minister cannot unilaterally add agencies. What the minister can do is promulgate a legislative instrument which adds agencies. But as you well know, legislative instruments are subject to disallowance by either house of parliament.


Lastly, the 21 agencies are set out in the act not by function but by name. In the existing TIA Act additional agencies can be added. That is how we got to this forest of agencies with the capacity to access metadata under the existing act: they do not have to be named agencies; they can be agencies that answer a functional description. That is removed under this act, so that, once again, is a protection which does not exist under the existing law.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:53):  I moved identical amendments to those of Senator Ludlam, so therefore I am speaking in support. I have proposed these amendments in order to prevent regulatory creep through the addition of further agencies. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Just to clarify, Senator Leyonhjelm, you actually circulated these rather than moved them.




Senator LEYONHJELM:
  I did not move them; you are quite correct. I circulated them, yes. They are on the running sheet showing as identical to mine, that is all. Under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, the distinction between a criminal law enforcement agency and an enforcement agency allows for some agencies that have enforcement functions but not criminal law enforcement functions to have limited access powers. In order to have full access powers an agency must have a criminal law enforcement function.


I take the point that, under this bill, the agencies with access will be named in the bill. I think that is an excellent idea, but this takes account of the fact that additional agencies can be added. The amendment seeks to prevent regulatory creep by omitting proposed definitions of 'criminal law enforcement agency' as set out in clause 110A and 'enforcement agency' as set out in clause 176A altogether and reverting to the current approach in the telecommunications interception act of setting up these agencies in the definitions section. There is an express reference to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service in the definition of enforcement agency in amendment (38). By virtue of this amendment, the only way for new agencies to be added will be by an amending act, which will enhance parliamentary scrutiny and oversight, and the distinction between criminal law enforcement agency and enforcement agency is thus preserved.


This approach also ensures that ASIC and ACCC do not get themselves onto the list of government approved, government sanctioned nosy parkers. Those two agencies already have large and intrusive powers, sometimes in excess of those enjoyed by agencies more properly considered criminal law enforcement bodies. Those powers should not be further expanded, particularly as they may be used to pursue trivial infractions such as collusion among service stations over petrol prices.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (16:55):  I obviously have a fundamental disagreement with you about this. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are the two principal economic regulators in this country. They keep the operation of our free market system honest and they ensure that markets operate free of abusive conduct or manipulative conduct.


I think it is a very superficial view, if I may say so, to think that the kind of market manipulation, cartel conduct or abuse of market power which it is the responsibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to police and to enforce the provisions of its act with a view to preventing is a trivial matter. I say this with some feeling because for several years before I came to this place this is what I did. Competition law was my field of practice, and I acted for the ACCC and against the ACCC on many occasions. I have seen in my own professional experience many, many instances of very serious market manipulation, cartel conduct and collusive behaviour at the expense of consumers, which it is absolutely in the public interest to prevent. There are criminal penalties now under the Competition and Consumer Act.


In relation to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, that is the principal corporate regulator in this country. It is our principal guardian against white-collar crime and commercial fraud within the corporate sector. The thought that either the ACCC or, even more so, ASIC do not have a very important law enforcement, including criminal law enforcement, role is quite wrong. An article by Mr Greg Tanzer in this morning's Australian Financial Review has been drawn to my attention. Mr Tanzer, as you may know, is a commissioner of ASIC, who argues very strongly for the retention of urgency within the list of relevant criminal law enforcement bodies. Mr Tanzer says, among other things:


… in the two years to November 2014 ASIC used telecoms data in more than 80 per cent of our insider trading cases.


He goes on to say that the powers sought here are no different in kind than existing powers under the TIA Act already. Mr Tanzer writes:


Changes to the TIA Act do not give law enforcement agencies any new powers but aim to ensure crucial existing powers retain their utility and are not eroded because of profit-driven changes in commercial practices.


Telecoms data is crucial in combating corporate crime.


I know you take a libertarian point of view and I know that is one of the points of difference between you and perhaps the Greens senators. May I say, through you, Madam Temporary Chairman O'Neill, to the Greens senators: the Greens senators have always been at the absolute forefront in their outrage at corporate crime and white-collar crime in this country. I can understand Senator Leyonhjelm's libertarian, anarcho-capitalist point of view, which I do not share but I understand, but I cannot for the life of me understand why the Greens would wish to disable the investigative capability of the agency charged with policing against white-collar crime from having a power akin to police forces and anti-corruption bodies which it has at the moment but would not have if this amendment were to be carried.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  Thank you, Attorney. I must admit I am a little confused. I thought this bill was all about serious crime—terrorism, paedophilia and organised crime are the terms I think that I have heard you use several times. White-collar crime, I suppose, at its most extreme end could perhaps be called organised crime, but it absolutely could not be called paedophilia or terrorism. Insider trading, as I am sure you are aware, is not actually illegal in some countries, including across the ditch in New Zealand. It certainly does not qualify as serious organised crime.


This reinforces, I guess, my prediction that this is mission creep—this is regulatory creep. We are not just talking about serious crimes. This legislation will be used for all kinds of crimes. I doubt very much whether its impact on terrorism or paedophilia or serious organised crime will be very great at all, but it will be very substantial on matters that really do not warrant such intrusive powers.

We obviously have a philosophical difference about that. And it is not mission creep, as you say, Senator, because these powers already exist. These powers already exist under the status quo.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:02):  Labor will be opposing these amendments for much the same reasons as Senator Brandis outlined. But I should also highlight, in relation to this discussion about trivial offences, that, in the amendments introduced by the government in the House, the new threshold that Labor argued for through the joint committee process with respect to access ensures that gravity is one of the factors taken into consideration. This is a very important point to be made here.


We sought to clarify with the Greens in relation to the Greens amendments essentially the point that Senator Leyonhjelm made earlier, which is that they are indeed identical. Like Senator Brandis, I was somewhat surprised at the Greens' approach in relation to ASIC and the ACCC and we could not get back from the Greens confirmation that they understood that the effect of their amendments was that they would be removing from the list ASIC and the ACCC. If I recall correctly—and sorry if I am verballing you, Senator Ludlam—this issue was not addressed in your comments introducing these amendments. It is quite a serious issue, as highlighted by Senator Brandis. I too read the article in today's Financial Review, but there is another aspect to that article, by Greg Tanzer, that I would like to go to. He reports:


Telecoms data is crucial in combating corporate crime. This sort of information is commonly the first source of important information for further investigations and is frequently used to identify suspected offenders or verify preliminary suspicions. Without this data many offences and offenders would never be detected …


This is a very serious issue. As I said, the amendments to which the government has already agreed through the process of the joint committee and that were dealt with in the House ensure that we are not talking about the trivial matters that Senator Leyonhjelm is referring to. Indeed, in the evaluation process of a request for access, gravity is one of the important factors taken into account.

the Commissioner of Police must cause the information or document, including any copies of the information or document, to be destroyed as soon as practicable.


This is reasonably simple and we already traversed the reasoning behind it earlier in the debate, but to refresh our memory: this amendment requires that metadata obtained under the data retention legislation should be destroyed when it is no longer relevant to the matter under investigation. Earlier in the debate, we addressed the idea that, after the two-you mandatory retention period, stuff that had been collected for no other purpose than that people were being forced to collect it under the terms of the bill would be destroyed. However, this goes to the material being retrieved—and we have already discussed at length the fact that there are in excess of three-quarters of a million of these warrantless authorisations reported to the ACMA every year. Once that material is no longer relevant to any kind of investigation, it should be destroyed. We know that it is not. Not just the intelligence agencies are amassing it but the law enforcement agencies and other agencies are collecting it. There is no obligation as far as I am aware—please correct me if I am wrong, Senator Brandis—on the part of any of these agencies to destroy anything that they collect on a warrantless basis.


The software tools for aggregating and mapping this information are way more sophisticated than most people realise. I think the numbers increment by 10 or 15 per cent every year. So 750,000 this year, maybe 720,000 or 730,000 the year before. All of the records that are being grabbed are also being compiled. They are being stored; they are being compiled. And there is no question at all that it effectively means that the private records of phone and internet use, location, data and whatever else are being authorised, collected, archived and kept. This material—we do not know absolute numbers, because that material is not recorded—on tens or potentially hundreds of thousands of people is being stored. 


So I struggle to imagine a justification whereby material is accessed on a warrantless basis for a range of matters—everything from quite serious matters to quite trivial matters. Many people who support these schemes have been at pains to tell us that this is about preliminary discovery so that people can be excluded as persons of interest and not pursued by more intrusive means. Why would you require the retention of their material? Why not instruct agencies to dispose of it when it is no longer needed? That would be in accord with the Australian privacy principles that were legislated and, to my mind, improved by this government about this time last year.

It is for that reason that the government adopted recommendation 28 of the PJCIS that the Attorney-General's Department oversee a review of the adequacy of the existing destruction requirements that apply to documents or information disclosed pursuant to an authorisation made under chapter 4 of the TIA Act and held by enforcement agencies and ASIO. The committee further recommended that the Attorney-General report to parliament on the findings of the review by 1 July 2017. As I say, the government has accepted that recommendation and that review will be conducted. As well as that, you will be pleased to know, Senator Ludlam, in respect of ASIO there is an agreement between ASIO and the National Archives, which was reviewed in 2012, in relation to retained material. The retention and destruction of data by ASIO is going to be examined by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security later this year. So there are in fact two reviews. There is the IGIS review this year and the Attorney-General's Department review, which will report within a little over two years. The government will consider what those reviews have to say. I tend to agree with you, Senator Ludlam, that it is desirable that there should be a destruction date in relation to data in certain defined circumstances. But we will await and be informed by the review in making decisions concerning that issue.

 (Victoria) (17:11):  Labor will be opposing this amendment for much the same reasons as Senator Brandis outlined. As he has indicated, the matter was canvassed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security, which noted that there were existing protocols in place around the retention and destruction of documents—one example that Senator Brandis just gave. It is important that we review those and come with a satisfactory outcome from those processes.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:11):  I withdraw Australian Greens amendments (41) and (42) on sheet 7669. They were consequential to earlier amendments that, regrettably, I did not have the numbers to pass. So I will not be proceeding with moving those. I move amendment (43) on sheet 7669:


 (43) Schedule 3, item 7, page 77 (after line 29), after subsection 186B(1), insert:


   (1A) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), the Ombudsman must inspect the records of each enforcement agency at least once every 6 months in relation to authorisations under Division 3, 4 or 4A of Part 4‑1.


This is the last Australian Greens amendment that we will bring forward. Its purpose is fairly simple. It is to explicitly require the Commonwealth Ombudsman to examine every six months the records of agencies which have access to metadata. The Ombudsman has been brought more closely into the orbit of oversight of the regime. I do not think at the moment that this regime, particularly access to metadata, has anything like the amount of oversight that it is going to need, given the volume of requests that go through and the evident problems and issues that have been well canvassed during this debate. Nonetheless, the Ombudsman does have a closer role. I would like to know the degree to which the Ombudsman's office will be given a greater amount of resourcing to conduct those additional activities. 


We would like to see the Ombudsman have that regular and very cyclical inspection and reporting obligation—the inspection, therefore, being every six months. The reason for this is simple. Unlike the warranted access to material which has that judicial oversight—it is sought through the AAT or it is sought through judges—there is no such oversight role. I am not sure that many people realise that there are probably thousands of people in agencies around this country who are authorised to be in receipt of a two-page form, a double-sided piece of A4 paper, with the target individuals or networks or devices that are handed directly to the phone companies or the internet service providers, and then the material is forthcoming. There is no intermediary. There is no judicial oversight. So, at the very minimum, we would like that to be the Commonwealth Ombudsman, given that the proposal to bring bulk or intrusive metadata within the warranted regime was rejected. This is really a last ditch attempt to providing a greater measure of transparency and oversight to a system that I believe is fundamentally broken.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:14):  Senator Ludlam, the government does not support your amendment. I should acquaint you with the fact that the Commonwealth Ombudsman was in fact closely involved in drafting these powers. These were the powers that the Ombudsman's office, as one of the integrity agencies, thought were appropriate to it to best discharge its oversight obligations—that is, the powers that are already in the bill, which your amendment would change. 


Can I draw your attention, please, to paragraph 685 of the explanatory memorandum, which reads:


Under subsection 186B(2), the Ombudsman is not restricted in the frequency with which the Ombudsman may inspect the records of an agency. For example, the Ombudsman could choose inspection cycles of twelve months, six months, three months or some other period to inspect the records of any particular agency. This flexibility is intended to cater for the significant differences in the size, structure, functions, and internal systems and procedures of the various criminal law-enforcement agencies, the variable nature and flow of investigations and to ensure the new inspection regime is sufficiently responsive to differing contingencies encountered during an inspection. Depending on the circumstances, this may necessitate other adaptive approaches, including, for example, staged or rolling inspection programs, a quarter-sized inspection four times a year, or inspecting different field offices at different times if that was more convenient for the agency from an operational perspective or logistically more feasible. 


So the mischief that your amendment seeks to address is already provided for by clause 186B(2) of the bill in a way which—with the advice of the Ombudsman, as the relevant integrity agency—will actually enhance rather than diminish his capacity to oversee the compliance by agencies with the provisions of this bill. I should also remind you that the intelligence agencies are subject to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security as well.

 (Victoria) (17:16):  Labor will be opposing this amendment because we feel, given what has occurred in recent times, that it is now redundant. Proposed section 186B(1) already provides that the Ombudsman must inspect the records of relevant agencies, and the Ombudsman's office is indeed a highly experienced oversight body. We have, however, demanded and received an assurance from the government that the Ombudsman will be effectively resourced to exercise his new responsibilities. As such—given, as Senator Brandis highlighted, the consultation that occurred with the Ombudsman himself—we have no doubt that he will be an effective and diligent watchdog over the data retention scheme.

After paragraph


119.7(3)(b) of the Criminal Code



   Insert:


   ; (c) the publication of the advertisement or item of news was not in the public interest.


This amendment addresses issues relating to disclosures of information by journalists, through amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, the Crimes Act 1914 and the Criminal Code Act 1995. These amendments address changes to these acts made by the previous bills in this tranche of legislation, primarily the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2014. 


Make no mistake about it, these issues go to the heart of press freedom in this country in relation to the ability of investigative journalists to do their work. These bills insert into these acts new offences relating to the disclosure of information relating to a special intelligence operation, as well as for publishing advertisements or items of news that contain information about recruitment of people to armed forces in a foreign country. I want to make it clear that, in relation to any publication of information in respect of a special intelligence operation that could endanger the lives of those involved in the operation or other lives directly as a result of that disclosure of information, I do not oppose the imposition of a penalty. If we are talking about endangering lives—if, for instance, there is an ASIS or ASIO officer whose life is put in real danger by the disclosure of their identity—then that is a serious matter. But we are talking about a whole range of other circumstances where there can be no such consideration; where there is no question of any lives being endangered; and where, in fact, what is being endangered by not publishing that information is very much the public interest and some key democratic principles. 


At the time that the bills were being considered in respect of section 35P, I expressed my concerns about the provisions relating to disclosure of information and how this would impact on journalists reporting on matters in good faith and in the public interest. At the time, I also moved an amendment to include the consideration of the public interest as a defence to these offences. This amendment expands on these original concerns to address the matter more fully. I am grateful to the mainstream media organisations that I have spoken to—major media organisations which have been very helpful with useful suggestions as to how this clause could have real protections for journalists who are doing their job in the public interest. 


Firstly, in relation to disclosure of information, these amendments introduce a concept of 'knowingly disclosing information relating to a special intelligence operation, disclosing information with the intent of endangering the health or safety of any person, or prejudicing the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation'. Further, the amendments provide exceptions to this offence which are consistent with existing whistleblower protections. They also include an exception where the person was working in a professional capacity as a journalist and published in good faith as a matter of public interest, and where the report was not likely to enable staff of security organisations to be identified. 


The amendments also provide an extensive definition of what matters can be considered to be in the public interest. These include matters that increase public debate and promote the integrity and accountability of security organisations or officials, and matters relating to conduct that contravenes certain laws or standards. These amendments provide the same defences in relation to disclosing information about delayed notification search warrants under the Crimes Act. 


The amendments also address issues relating to the publication of certain matters under the Criminal Code. The new offences in the act relate to the publication of recruitment material, and, in essence, I believe these offences are suitable. However, there is capacity for these offences to capture media organisations in the following ways. Firstly, it is possible that a journalist could publish a story that contains information about recruitment—for example, an investigative piece that looks at recruitment strategies of terrorist groups or how an individual has been personally affected by this. Secondly, it is possible that a major news organisation with many publications could unwittingly publish an advertisement that, while it does not overtly seem so, relates to recruiting activities—for example, for a town meeting that turns out to have recruiting elements, unbeknownst to the news organisation. 


To address these concerns, the amendments in this item change the existing offence from a person being reckless to the fact to a person publishing with the intention of encouraging recruitment. Further, in relation to the offence of publishing more detailed information about recruiting, these amendments provide that the offence can only apply where the publication is not in the public interest. This would, for example, come into effect when a story is published about recruitment taking place at a certain location and time for the purpose of raising public awareness.


I want to briefly raise a matter that relates to ASIS, not ASIO, but the principles are the same. There is, of course, the issue in respect of the allegations that ASIS planted electronic surveillance, electronic bugs, in 2004 in the East Timorese cabinet room, allegedly to gather information regarding negotiations of the Timor Sea treaty, the sharing of energy resources between Australia and Timor. That cannot be seen, on any reasonable basis, as a national security issue. In March 2014 the International Court of Justice ordered Australia to stop any such behaviour. Bernard Collaery, a former Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory, representing East Timor, alleged in 2013 that his offices had been raided by ASIO. A key witness, known as Witness K, was detained and had his passport cancelled, which of course has all sorts of consequences for Witness K. I am not sure whether he has been charged. 


My concern is with cases such as that, cases of botched operations, and it does happen from time to time. As good as our intelligence agencies are, as good as the AFP is, there are occasions when they get it wrong, where they have exceeded their powers, and it is in the public interest to expose that. There is no protection for journalists, as I see it, under the current legislation or 35P. We know what the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, representing journalists in this country, have said about this. And leading academics are concerned that section 35P in its current form is simply too restrictive and draconian and needs to be amended.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:24):  This is an attempt to litigate the issue of section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was debated and canvassed extensively in this chamber last year during the debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014. Because this has been debated very extensively in this chamber and this is an attempt merely to relitigate it—it is not immediately germane to this bill; it has, as it were, been tacked on—I do not want to take too long in responding to Senator Xenophon. But let me make a couple of points to you, Senator. 


First of all, section 35P of the ASIO Act is confined to the disclosure of special intelligence operations. Special intelligence operations are themselves a defined term, a defined form of operation that was introduced into the ASIO Act last year. They can only be conducted in exceptional circumstances and only if the Attorney-General is satisfied as to a variety of matters that are specified in the relevant provisions of the ASIO Act. But, to give you the flavour of what special intelligence operations are, they are about things like officers of ASIO, under cover, becoming associated with terrorist cells, for example, in order to gather intelligence. That is what ASIO does, Senator Xenophon: it is an intelligence-gathering operation. 


In order to gather human intelligence, or HUMINT, to use the jargon term that is used in the intelligence community, officers subject themselves to very, very serious risk of physical harm. And they are entitled to be protected; they are entitled to be protected from disclosure. You can readily imagine, Senator Xenophon, that if the fact of a special intelligence operation that involved, for example, an undercover ASIO officer or officers penetrating a terrorist cell were disclosed, that could well put the lives of those officers or their families at risk. I know you would not wish to do that, Senator Xenophon—of course you would not. But that is the mischief—




Senator Xenophon:
  Mr Chairman, on a point of order, my amendment does not say that or do that. I respectfully suggest to the Attorney that he read my amendment. It does not do that.



The CHAIRMAN:  Senator Xenophon, there is no point of order.




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is the purpose of section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was inserted, over the objection of crossbench senators, last year. It is no answer to say that perhaps prohibition should only apply to a current operation but not to a past operation, because often people need protection for years, or even decades, after an intelligence operation. You know, Senator Xenophon, the Australian government protected the identity of Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov until the day they died, 30 or 40 years after the Petrov affair. 


It strikes me as a crowning irony in this debate that those who are extremely concerned to protect the confidentiality of journalists' sources would, in the next breath, expose the confidentiality of intelligence operations. I know that is not your motive, Senator Xenophon, but it is the effect of the argument against section 35P. 


This was looked at by the first PJCIS report, recommendation 28, and adopted in a bipartisan manner. I should say that the section 35P protections of ASIO are modelled on the longstanding protections of the Australian Federal Police for protected operations by AFP officers; they are modelled on like protection provisions that exist under state and territory law for state and territory police officers. It should never be controversial, frankly, that the identity of officers involved in covert operations should be protected. 


Lastly, this is not a provision about journalists, as I have said many times. This is no more a provision about journalists than the law relating to drink-driving is a law about journalists. This is a law that makes it an offence for anyone in the community to disclose or prejudice a covert operation. That is what section 35P does. We had that debate in this chamber last year. Section 35P was passed in the teeth of a reasonably furious media campaign. But, mindful of the sensitivity of the press freedom issue that some journalists and news organisations have raised, additional protections were added. In particular, the Director of Public Prosecutions himself issued a directive which is available on his website setting out certain public interest criteria that would be applied in enforcing section 35P.


As well, I made a directive to the Director of Public Prosecutions requiring the consent of the Attorney-General for any prosecution under section 35P. So if it were thought that a prosecution was in some way inappropriate or inimical to the freedom of the press, by requiring the Attorney's consent—that happens in a number of cases, but they are unusual—it would mean that the Attorney-General of the day, whoever he or she may be, as the responsible political officer would accept personal and public responsibility. So it would not merely be a matter of prosecutorial discretion exercised by the Commonwealth DPP; it would be a matter of the Attorney-General of the day accepting public and political responsibility as well. So there are safeguards. I will defend to the utmost, Senator Xenophon, the proposition that the confidentiality of covert operations ought to be protected, as it is in section 35P, by criminal sanction.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-26,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:31):  The Attorney has grossly misrepresented my position. If he remembers, during the debate in respect of section 35P there was an amendment moved, from memory, by Senator Lambie, then a member of the Palmer United Party, to increase the penalty from five years to 10 years in circumstances where lives were endangered by someone disclosing a special intelligence operation. I supported that. I supported that because there must be no ambiguity when it comes to information that could lead to a person involved in a special intelligence operation having their life endangered or, indeed, having the lives of their family members endangered by virtue of the disclosure of their identity. I just want to make that absolutely clear. I would be grateful if the Attorney would acknowledge this: I have never argued that endangering the life of a person by disclosing information should not be a most serious offence.


But I do draw the Attorney's attention to comments made by Tim Wilson, the Human Rights Commissioner—an appointment that the Attorney made. He has raised concerns about section 35P. He made the point in an opinion piece that:


As former independent national security legislation monitor Bret Walker has argued, in its most extreme form 35P could stop the reporting of a citizen being killed during a botched special intelligence operation. I have no doubt that is not the intention of the government, or any in the near future. But that shouldn't mollify critics.


He expresses real concerns in respect of that.


My concern is that section 35P in its current form does not give protection to journalists where there is no question of revealing the identity of someone involved in a special intelligence operation. We are aware of raids in the past that have been botched by our police and intelligence operatives. Things have gone wrong. It seems to me that in those circumstances there will be no protection for journalists reporting that. We have very fine journalists in this country such as Cameron Stewart who report on these matters. He is highly regarded. I think that he would be constrained in reporting on those sorts of issues.


The government seems to be coming from the position that intelligence agencies can do no wrong. Well, they are not infallible. They do make mistakes. We have seen throughout history that this is a very dangerous position to take. The media plays a vital role in exposing those intelligence operations which have gone wrong, where it is in the public interest to disclose them and where there is no question of any lives being endangered by that disclosure.


I just want to make it clear on the record that I supported an increase in the penalty from five years to 10 years in order that if disclosure endangered the life of someone involved in a special intelligence operation that should be treated seriously by the courts. But this is about ensuring that the media can do their job in cases where there is a clear public interest to disclose an intelligence operation that effectively goes wrong.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-03-26,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:35):  Senator Xenophon, I do not for a moment suggest—and I said this before—that you would wish to oppose a provision that protects the lives and health of ASIO officers. But you are directing yourself to subsection 35P(2), which is on the aggravated offence. It carries a penalty of imprisonment of 10 years. The problem with your argument, Senator Xenophon, is that, under subsubsection 35P(2)(c), there is an element that:


(i) the person intends to endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation; or 


(ii) the disclosure of the information will endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of a special intelligence operation.


That carries the higher range penalty of 10 years imprisonment.


Senator Xenophon, you detained the Senate for some time this morning arguing very persuasively, if I may say so, the case for having a purpose test and an effects test so that unintended consequences could be caught as well as deliberate conduct in relation to another provision of the bill before the chamber. The same logic that you advanced earlier on in the debate applies here. Disclosure may not be intended to or for the purpose of endangering lives or health. It is very unlikely to be. But that may be the incidental effect of it. That is why, if it is the inadvertent or incidental effect of it, we need section 35(1), which does not contain those limitations.


As well, although I spoke about life and health as the extreme case here, there are more consideration at play than merely that. For example, there are operational techniques. To disclose operational techniques is not necessarily to endanger the life or health of agents or officers engaged in an operation, although it could, either currently or in the future, but it certainly prejudices the capacity of ASIO to effectively carry out those operations if its tradecraft, if its techniques, if its wherewithal, are the subject of public disclosure.


Let us be realistic here, Senator Xenophon. ASIO is a covert intelligence gathering body. It was established in 1949 by the Chifley government to be a covert intelligence gathering body. That is what it does and because we are a liberal democracy that cares about values like personal freedom and the freedom of the press, when we establish a covert intelligence gathering body in the middle of a liberal democracy what do we do? We subject it to the most stringent limitations and oversight mechanisms and accountability mechanisms, and the architecture of those mechanisms, including the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, including the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, including various requirements of accountability to the Attorney-General, including reporting requirements to the parliament, has been integral to the confidence that the Australian people have had in ASIO since 1949. That confidence, I believe, has never been significantly prejudiced because although over the years ASIO has made mistakes, frankly it has not made many, in the scheme of things, since 1949. So, Senator Xenophon, the essence of your proposition is that it should not be against the law to disclose the special intelligence operation of an agency which was designed and built to operate covertly. That is what you are saying.




Senator Xenophon:
  No I'm not.




Senator BRANDIS:
  That is the effect of what you are saying, whether you are prepared to acknowledge it or not, and I fundamentally disagree with you

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:39):  Not only am I prepared not to acknowledge what the Attorney has said, but I repudiate what he says, because the amendment is clear—it must be in the public interest. There is a whole framework there in respect of the public interest. Let me give one example. On 4 August 2009 there was a front-page story by The Australian's Cameron Stewart, one of the most respected journalists in this country. It was headed 'Army base terror plot foiled', and it related to a plot by Islamic extremists in Melbourne to launch a suicide attack on an Australian Army base being uncovered by national security agencies. TheAustralian's story caused a massive fuss at the time. So I am not accused of plagiarism, I am reading from a piece from a MediaWatch story on this on 6 October 2014. I am going to confine my remarks to Mr Stewart's story. There was a huge fuss at the time, with the AFP and the Victorian police accusing Cameron Stewart of putting their operation at risk by reporting the police raids on the day they were going to take place. Cameron Stewart, in response to MediaWatch questions on 3 October 2014, was asked whether he believed his scoop would have been blocked by the new law. It was unclear, because ASIO was also part of Operation Neath, said Mr Stewart—he said he suspected it could have been declared a special intelligence operation under those new provisions, and he did not see how it could have been possible to publish his stories without breaking the law and being liable for jail. Does the Attorney consider that Mr Stewart should be charged under section 35P for that front-page story in The Australian newspaper on 4 August 2009?

Let me explain very simply why he could not be. The activity about which Mr Stewart reported was the execution of a search warrant, it was not a special intelligence operation. ASIO does not need and has never needed a special intelligence operation authorisation to execute a search warrant. In fact, the search warrant powers of ASIO I think have been powers of ASIO since the original ASIO Act of 1955. ASIO was created in 1949 but it was put on a statutory footing I think in 1955. If Mr Stewart was apprehensive that that was so, Mr Stewart is wrong, and the example Senator Xenophon gives is wrong. If that is what concerns you, I can relieve your concerns entirely. Section 35P does not apply to search warrants.


The other example you give, Senator Xenophon, is wrong too. You refer to allegations in relation to spying on East Timor. These are only allegations. But the allegations are in relation to ASIS, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. Whether those allegations be true or false, this is about ASIO. So, with the two examples you give, one is about the wrong agency and the other is about the wrong procedure. Section 35P applies to neither.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-26,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:43):  I indicate my support for Senator Xenophon's amendment. It is well known in free speech circles that 35P went too far, even to the extent that the member for Grayndler, Mr Albanese, wrote in a public forum to that effect. Free speech advocates including Bret Walker, Professor George Williams and Tim Wilson, amongst others, have expressed concerns about 35P. The distinction that Senator Xenophon's amendment makes is between recklessness and intention, and I think the amendment brings it back into the realm of intention in an appropriate fashion. There are safeguards in it to protect ASIO personnel, and the grave danger here is that, as we almost did with the torture issue, we would be giving cover for misbehaviour by ASIO agents that, if it was reported, if it was brought to the public's attention, would constitute a crime, so it would be a crime to report what ought to be a crime. 


Senator Xenophon's amendment nominates what would be in the public interest and what it would not be a crime to report, which includes maladministration, an abuse of public trust, an officer of a public agency abusing his or her position and action which gives a reasonable ground for disciplinary action. I think the amendment is appropriate and ought to be adopted.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:45):  Labor noted its concerns about section 35P and its effect on freedom of the press when this was last agitated. We asked the government to refer the matter to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and, despite initial objection, the government agreed to do this. The monitor will be holding hearings and reporting back to the government on this matter in the coming months. It would be inappropriate to pre-empt that process with amendments tacked onto an unrelated bill. As a result, Labor will not be supporting this amendment. I note that Senator Xenophon has also sought to amend other disclosure provisions in Commonwealth law and, again, it is not appropriate for these matters to be agitated in this bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:46):  I am grateful to Senator Collins, not for not supporting the amendment but for pointing out that Roger Gyles is looking at these matters. But I think there is an urgency in dealing with them now. I understand what the position is. I hope—hope against hope—that, depending on what Mr Gyles concludes, this will be re-litigated, revisited or whatever. I have a serious concern about this.


I will refer to what the Australian Financial Review's international editor, Tony Walker, has said. In the Australian Financial Review on 27-28 September 2014, he said that it:


… will have a chilling effect on reporting of security matters in an environment in which parliamentary oversight provisions are extremely weak. 


The legislation will sit on the statute books like a rotting carcass.


Cameron Stewart, who reports on security matters for the Australian, in responding to Media Watch questions on 3 October 2014, said this—and it is very telling:


… Australians will know less than they deserve to about what is happening inside security agencies at a time when they are larger and more powerful than ever before.


I would pose a question to the Attorney—and this is a question that could relate to any attorney. It could be that he could be Attorney for the next 20 years but there will be a successor to the Attorney one day. Under these provisions in respect of 35P, is it not the case that the Attorney has a wide discretion as to what can be declared a special intelligence operation? Could that not, for instance, declare that the execution of a warrant itself could be a special intelligence operation?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:48):  No, Senator, because the warrant application procedure under the ASIO Act and the special intelligence operation procedure under the ASIO Act are quite separate. I hope my staff can remind me of the section that deals with special intelligence operations. The special intelligence operation is the most complex kind of covert operation that ASIO will undertake. It will be undertaken rarely. It requires a series of criteria specified in the ASIO Act to be satisfied before the Attorney authorises it. The application for a search warrant is a much more straightforward procedure. To compare a special intelligence operation to the execution of a search warrant is to compare two procedures, one of which is a very complex and unusual procedure and the other of which is not an especially complex and a much more common procedure.



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  But, Senator Xenophon, if ASIO wanted a search warrant they would apply for a search warrant, and it is a lot easier to get a search warrant than it is to get authorisation for a special intelligence operation.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-03-26,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:49):  I thank Senator Xenophon for bringing this amendment forward tonight. I can guarantee that this is not the last time that this chamber will deal with the issue of the fact that the Australian government, with the support of the Labor Party, last year sought to effectively criminalise forms of national security reporting. I did not expect Senator Brandis, who was the sponsor of that bill, to have changed his mind, and nothing that he has said tonight has been particularly surprising. The reason that this amendment was brought forward and the reason that the Australian Greens are supporting it is that it gives the Australian Labor Party a chance to do something about the buyer's regret that it suffered last year.


The data retention campaign and bill has been a little bit different, but last year, after the ASIO bill passed, there was a remarkable outpouring of anxiety, concern, alarm and, I would say, regret from some in the Press Gallery and from some in the Australian Labor Party. We are giving you the opportunity tonight to do something with that buyer's regret and fix the mistake that was made when the ASIO bill passed into law last year. I am very pleased to join with my crossbench colleagues in providing the kind of opposition that this country needs on matters such as this and to provide the Labor Party with the chance to do something with some of the concerns that it expressed after it supported Senator Brandis last year.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:51):  I do not want to prolong the debate—and I expected Senator Ludlam to say what he had to say; he has his view and I have mine—but I just wanted to add to my remarks to Senator Xenophon. It has been pointed out to me that not only in a practical sense would ASIO never seek a special intelligence operation authorisation where all it needed was a search warrant, it actually cannot.


The jurisdiction under section 35C and 35D are the relevant provisions of the ASIO Act. The jurisdiction to grant approval to a special intelligence operation is only exercisable in circumstances where there would otherwise but for the authorisation be a breach of the civil or criminal law. That is a not uncommon provision in relation to covert operations. For example, if an officer engages covertly, pretending to be a member of a terrorist cell, for argument's sake, he could find himself engaged in conduct which might constitute the offence of preparation for a terrorist act—playing along, as it were, with the cell that he was trying to penetrate. These are matters of fine operational judgement. But the point I am making to you, Senator Xenophon, is that because a special intelligence operation can be authorised under section 35C of the ASIO Act only in circumstances involving conduct that would otherwise breach the criminal or civil law, it could not—it actually is a matter of law, not just practicality—overlap with a search warrant application, because of course to execute a search warrant is not a breach of the criminal or the civil law.

So of course we will consider Mr Gyles's recommendations when we receive them. I mentioned two, but as Senator Collins has, rightly, reminded me, there are actually three oversight mechanisms that we have introduced post the debate: firstly, my direction under the Commonwealth DPP Act to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a prosecution of a journalist under section 35P could be engaged only with the Attorney-General's consent; secondly, the Commonwealth DPP's own guidelines, which further limit and add additional elements to the exercise of his prosecutorial discretion in a case like that; and, thirdly, the review of this provision which the Prime Minister and I referred to Mr Roger Gyles so that he could bring an independent mind to bear on the issues—in good faith, obviously—that you and other colleagues have raised.
