"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-03-21,"—I did not think this motion would be moved at this time of the day. I believed it would probably be moved after 11 o'clock or thereabouts, because I had pointed out that I had a problem with the terms of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002. There is some question that this bonus will mean that more women will be having babies later, in order to qualify. I will not argue the case at the moment, but I think that particular issue is certainly not non-controversial. I would hope that that bill could be taken off the list pending some discussions about the matter and some further explanation.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-21,"—by leave— We have had extensive consultation with all senators with respect to each of the bills that I have listed. I do not choose to call them non-controversial; I just call them lunchtime bills. As Senator Brown said in his remarks, he opposes two of the bills but he has very kindly allowed the bills to be considered in the lunchtime slot. As I understand what Senator Brown has said, he will be recording his opposition, putting forward his views but he will not be forcing a vote. 
I suggest to Senator Harradine that we have been trying to discuss those issues and we had told his office that this was normally the time when this motion would be moved. I would like the list to stay intact on the basis that, after negotiations with the relevant minister—it may well be me—in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002, if we cannot satisfy Senator Harradine's objections to the bill, and he says he will be wanting to vote against it—
—No.
—I give an undertaking that we will not proceed with it at lunchtime. The effect of that may well be that the bill does not get passed in this session; however, I undertake that if Senator Harradine's concerns cannot be assuaged or if we cannot convince him not to vote against it, I will not proceed with it at lunchtime. But I would seek his support to at least, by passing this motion, allow it to stay on the list for lunchtime, subject to agreement. If agreement cannot be reached I will commit here, on behalf of the government, to remove it and not proceed with it in that lunchtime slot.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-03-21,"—by leave—I move:
That Health Insurance Determination HS/5/01, made under section 3C of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and published in the Commonwealth Gazette of 30 October 2001, be disallowed.
This is a very serious matter and, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I want to put a few remarks on the record in support of the disallowance. The situation is that the government has moved a regulation which would have the effect of providing Medicare rebates to six positron emission tomography scanners—PET scanners—at various sites around Australia. PET scanners are used for the effective treatment of cancer patients, and the effect of this regulation is to licence six centres to provide that function and receive Medicare rebates.
The reason this is of most serious concern is that, in the tender process undertaken by the government, the six successful tenderers did not include the Melbourne Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. The reason for Labor concern about this decision is that, prior to this decision, there were two centres of excellence in Australia in relation to PET scanners. One was the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre in Melbourne and the other was the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. Those two organisation have, over the last 10 years, pioneered PET scanning and they have been the centres for much of the activity in relation to this technology and the treatment of cancer.
What occurred is that in the tender process the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital was successful but for some unknown reason the Austin Repatriation and Medical Centre was not. This has caused a great deal of concern throughout Australia. I think it is fair to say that people regard this decision as inexplicable and perverse. The Austin is regarded as the leading teaching and research institution in these matters in Australia. It has a very high international reputation, and anyone connected with the technology and with the research in this area was absolutely dumbfounded that the Austin had not been selected as one of six successful tenderers. I do not want to cast any aspersions on any of the other successful tenderers, but the reality is that a number of them do not have anywhere near the sort of experience—and some have no experience—and record and standing in this field that the Austin has.
There is a real sense of outrage about this decision in the medical community. The Anti-Cancer Council has written to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing, expressing their concern that, because the Austin is also the leading teaching institution, vital clinical experience will be lost and the cancer research capability in Australia will be reduced. Also the Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine have condemned the decision, saying:
... a decision that effectively excludes experienced teaching hospitals, and in the case of ARMC, a facility with 10 years experience in PET, cannot and would not be endorsed by this Association.
That is reflective of the concern in the community. Labor concedes that the disallowance is a very blunt instrument, but we are concerned to ensure that the funding for Austin is not removed and that the government makes a proper decision with a proper health outcome in this matter. This is the only avenue open to us to ensure that the government reconsiders this matter. At the eleventh hour we have received an offer from the minister, which I acknowledge but which we find unsatisfactory. We want to see that the Austin's place in this important research field be maintained and that the 10 years of effort, experience and skills that have been built up in Austin are not lost to potential cancer patients in Australia. This is our only way of forcing the government to overturn their decision and make what everyone considers to be a proper health based decision.
I welcome the fact that the minister has, by her late offer, indicated that she accepts some of the logic of the need to overturn this decision. But I think, as with a number of late decisions by Minister Wooldridge, the former Minister for Health and Aged Care, there really is a need to go back and look at the basis of those decisions and ensure that they are based on proper health outcomes and not on other outcomes. I do not want to labour the point that this decision was taken just prior to the election being called—and in fact the regulations were promulgated in the caretaker period—but I do want to say that Labor's concern in this is to get a proper health outcome. This should have been fixed. The Austin should have been allowed to continue as the leading medical institute in this area. They have done tremendous work for cancer patients over the last 10 years. We are concerned to make sure they are allowed to continue that role and continue that funding.
As I say, I accept this is a blunt instrument, but this is the only way the Senate can use its powers to force the government to make sure proper decision making processes are followed and to ensure the continuation of the Austin's very important work in this regard. I urge the Senate to support the disallowance motion, which will have the effect of making the government reconsider what I think is a very wrong decision.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to speak.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to put the government's position and then Senator Lees may want to respond to that. I am happy to speak after her, but she may want to comment on what the government has to say.
—I am quite happy about that. I was actually expecting the minister to come down so that we could have some full and frank debate on the issue.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE DETERMINATION HS/5/01</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-21,"—by leave—I thank Senator Lees. The minister was keen to have a debate on this, but is not able to be here at this time and has asked me to make some remarks on behalf of the government. She views this issue as a very serious breach of a process that had the utmost efficacy. We are, through a political process, effectively overturning a tender that was run entirely properly by the department. I have to say from my own experience in running government tenders that, if the parliament acts in this way, it sends some interesting and very unusual and undesirable signals to the marketplace. Having run a tender, and having asked people to put in significant work and enter into a considered financial risk in complying with the tender, to then overturn the result of that for political reasons will increase the financial risks to people who comply or become part of government tender processes in the future. I do not think that should be understated.  
The government regards this as an outrageous proposition. To allow this motion to proceed will totally compromise what has been an open and transparent process that has ensured that very important services— and there is no disagreement on that—for the care and treatment of cancer patients are delivered equitably to all Australians. To allow this motion is to allow a hospital supported by the opposition to effectively blackmail the government.
The PET process is an emerging diagnostic technology that enables molecular imaging. At present, the major clinical applications of PET are in oncology, cardiology and neurology. The Commonwealth commenced this tender process for the provision of services to Australians in 2001. The Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre was unsuccessful in the tender for the purchase of PET services across Australia. This tender was conducted, as I have said, openly and transparently, which has been confirmed by an independent probity adviser. The Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre has admitted that they were:
 both ambitious and arrogant. They assumed that because they had enjoyed the benefits of Commonwealth funding in the evaluative phase of PET—
that is in the past—
that somehow the clearly documented rules of the tender process did not for some reason apply to them.
I confirm that the submission from the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre far exceeded the capital allocation for the tender, which was the highest weighted criterion. I also confirm that the department advised the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre on two separate occasions seeking clarification and revision of their submission. We reiterate that: they were warned, they were told, the red flag went up. They were asked to revise their tender and, for reasons best known to them, they chose not to do so. They in their own words have classified their approach to the tender as `ambitious and arrogant'.
The opposition believes, clearly with the support of the Democrats, that this was somehow unfair to that medical centre. In taking this action today they are saying that the rules only apply to some and that we can always create exemptions. This disallowance will require the Commonwealth to continue to fund the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre for PET services at a rate of $2,100 per service. You can say there are no aspersions on the successful tenderers but in this we are saying to the Australian people that we will pay this hospital that has on its own admission been `ambitious and arrogant' in the tender process, has almost sought not to comply with it, was warned it was not complying and was warned of the risk of failure. The seven successful tenderers have agreed to provide the services to Australians at $900 per service. Further, they have all agreed to not pass on any additional fees to their patients.
This disallowance clearly corrupts a process that sought to deliver important oncology services and the services provided by the PET technology on an equitable basis across Australia. It sought to do so in an open and fair manner. It sought to remove the politics from the allocation of these services, just as the government's processes in relation to allocating MRI licences does. This is yet another example of the Labor Party corrupting an independent process that focuses on high quality care on the most equitable basis and saying that you cannot have an independent process and if you do have one they will overturn it for cheap, populist, political reasons. 
For that reason, we believe this motion, if passed, will create a serious injustice to all Australians, to the advantage of one organisation. The minister has gone further in this regard. Having said all of that about the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, she has made a further offer outside this process—in other words, allowing the fairness of this process to stand, so this motion would not get passed—to fund the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre with some additional Commonwealth expenditure. But that is not good enough for the opposition. They want to score a cheap political point—but it is not a cheap political point, it is a very expensive one. It is at the expense of hundreds of other Australians whose care will be diminished because of this cheap, populist stunt by the opposition. I hope Senator Lees accepts some of these arguments. I hope that Senator Lees will accept that in this case the Labor Party have not made a case for what would be a significant rorting and distortion of a process for very short-term political gain.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE DETERMINATION HS/5/01</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2002-03-21,"—by leave—I must comment on some of the extraordinary statements that Senator Campbell has just made. The very reason we are here is that this process was so flawed. It did not have transparency, and I would argue very clearly that the whole tender process was not run properly. If there is any message we are sending out today, it is that health ministers cannot separate themselves completely from a process such as this. The message that we are sending says that people involved in these types of tenders, these sorts of processes, must have some qualifications in the area in which they are accepting tenders. 
It is not satisfactory to engage a consultant as was done in this case. They went through the formal processes. This particular consultant was out of the country at the time that the full tender process was under way. He was asked for his advice and he gave them advice on the technical aspects of the tender. However, he says, `None of my comments and suggestions for changes were acted upon.' He then heard nothing else whatsoever from those who were involved in the tender process. If we are sending any message, it is a very clear one: we cannot just rely on economics, economists and market forces when it comes to the issues of medical research and quality delivery of services—in this case, very high-tech services that this particular hospital has led the way in. It has led the way not only here in Australia but internationally.
The minister has claimed in her comments that this whole process was transparent. It was far from transparent. Where is the evidence of experience on the part of those people who have won the tenders? Why can't we see the documentation where they claim to be so much better, presumably, than the Austin? Where is any detail of what they are offering by way of research, what they are offering by way of training? No, none of that material is available. I read through with interest some of the additional questions in estimates, but such material is simply not forthcoming—and presumably we are going to be quoted some commercial-in-confidence reasons. It is certainly not a clear and open process.
The comments that the minister has sent to the chamber, relating to the Austin's request for capital funding, made it very clear that, in fact, there were three different tender options. Yes, one of them did have capital funding. Why did they have capital funding? Because they have been in this industry so long using PET technology. They developed in Australia a range of possibilities for the use of this technology, particularly in the diagnosis of cancer, and they needed a new cyclotron. This cyclotron not only provides them with their raw material, their radioactive material, but it also supplies other hospitals, including one in my home state, the Royal Adelaide. Yes, that cyclotron is at the point where it is nearing the end of its life, and that was put as part of the tender process because they could see no other way of continuing to supply the Royal Adelaide, as well as themselves, with the new upgraded camera that the Victorian government has put money into. This hospital is not just relying on federal funding; it is relying as well on state funding, which it was successful in getting. 
It had been reimbursed under Medicare since 1997, and it is now moving on to look at other routine users for PET. The Commonwealth did drop them out of this tender process—and I do not think we will ever get to the bottom of why some bureaucrats decided not to fully examine all three options they put forward. Reading through various questions and the material that has come from the college as well as independent sources, you can see that people who work in this industry are absolutely amazed that our top facility can be simply shuffled to one side without any decent explanation.
This hospital is now looking at the use of PET in other procedures, in particular looking at neurological problems, and this is an essential part of its process. It is a research facility, our major research facility. It performed the first PET scan in 1992, and it is doing about 1,300 to 1,500 scans a year. I just find it extraordinary that the minister has sent in here a statement that suggests that somehow this was a proper open qualified tender process. It was anything but that.
I can assure Senator Campbell, this is not some sort of political stunt. The Democrats have looked into this at great length, and I thank my staff for the work they have done. I also thank Senator Allison, who has spent time at the Austin and who has gone to great lengths in her home state to see that this facility is ongoing and its work is guaranteed.
I have no qualms whatsoever in supporting this disallowance. Indeed, in order to make sure that a disallowance motion went through today, we were about to move one of our own, because its funding runs out before parliament resumes. It is an extraordinary decision, particularly given who some of the other successful tenderers are. But, as Senator Evans said, I do not think we should go in any way into discussing the successful tenderers. We just need to make the point that the top facility in Australia has been unsuccessful.
This motion is a very blunt instrument, and I acknowledge one point that Senator Campbell made: this hospital will now be paid at the old rate. Part of the government's decision involved cutting the Medicare rebate from $2000-odd back to around $900. We wait on the government. We do not have the ability to write the right regulation. This regulation has gone; presumably, by the time we get back here for the budget, the government will have written another regulation that we can support. In that way, we can ensure that Australia's top research facility in the area of PET scanning is able to continue.

"Tchen, Senator Tsebin",LP,2002-03-21,"—On behalf of the Senate Regulations and Ordinance Committee, I present the annual report for 2000-01.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—In view of today's busy program, I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I will incorporate a brief statement to accompany the tabling of this report.
The statement read as follows—
This report highlights the longstanding commitment and dedication of the previous committee to ensuring that high standards of technical and parliamentary principles are adhered to in the making of delegated legislation. May I note that I am pleased to make this comment with complete objectivity and impartiality, having only recently joined the committee, and the praise for a job well done rightly goes to my fellow members of the committee. 
Included in the report are some statistics that I think reflect this dedication.
During the reporting period the committee scrutinised 1,859 instruments, 204 more than in the previous financial year. Of these instruments, the committee raised concerns on 208. This compares with 265 in 1999-2000, 107 in 1998-99 and 175 in 1997-98. Senators may note that in recent years the number of concerns has increased significantly although the reasons for such an increase are not readily apparent. The committee intends to monitor this trend. 
Senators will be aware that the committee has been reviewing its practices and procedures with the objective of increasing awareness of its work, making delegated legislation more accessible and adopting procedures that are open and transparent. The result of this review was the introduction of a Scrutiny of Regulations Alert, a Disallowance Alert and the tabling of correspondence. 
Of these initiatives, there has been early but encouraging evidence that the Scrutiny of Regulations Alert has helped to improve the timeliness of ministerial responses, thus avoiding the need for the committee to instigate disallowance procedures. This improvement was reflected in the reduction in the number of notices of disallowance given by the committee from 70 in 1999-2000 to 47 in 2000-2001, all of which were subsequently withdrawn. The committee welcomes the decrease in the number of notices.
Although the committee continued to raise concerns about explanatory statements during the reporting period, it noted an improvement in the quality of information being provided. In particular, more departments and agencies had been more attentive to providing an assurance that retrospectivity was not prejudicial, and to giving reasons for and the basis upon which fees or charges were levied.
Notwithstanding these improvements, it is disappointing that the frequency of simple drafting defects remains high. As in 1999-2000, the committee again found a significant amount of its work centred on quality control concerns rather than substantive issues raised in instruments. On numerous occasions, the committee had to draw the attention of ministers to fundamental defects in instruments including:
·	the failure to state clearly the authority under which the instrument was being made;
·	the failure to include rule making words or/and the name and signature of the person authorised to make the instrument;
·	the failure to number instruments (particularly those that will be part of a series) in order to make access and identification easier; and 
·	incorrect references and cross references.
The committee therefore re-iterates its view that those responsible for the preparation of disallowable instruments should introduce quality control procedures to ensure that instruments are free from drafting defects.
I take this opportunity to express the committee's appreciation to the former Chair, Senator Coonan, for her valuable contribution and work, particularly in relation to initiatives designed to streamline the work of the committee. 
I also wish to record the committee's appreciation of Professor Stephen Bottomley, who provided excellent advice to the committee during the reporting period.
Finally, on behalf of the committee, I thank the committee secretary and his associates for their diligent and loyal support that enabled the committee to meet all its obligations.
I commend the 2000-2001 Annual Report of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to the Senate.

Those concerns were not allayed by the responses given by the Minister for Justice and Customs last night. While I acknowledge his willingness to respond to most of the questions I asked, I think in many cases his answers raised more questions and certainly more concerns on the part of the Democrats. I will just reiterate some of the key flaws of the bill and the real dangers of establishing precedents for treating people in this way.
The bill extends the regime of excising offshore places and excluding people from the migration zone of Australia that was introduced last year. It means that once people have been taken to places like Nauru and PNG for any length of time they can consequently be brought into Australia and still be completely unable to exercise any legal rights in relation to their refugee status. The bill, particularly as amended, or including as amended, contains very significant loopholes. The minister and the government always say it is intended to be used in a particular or a certain way, but that does not guarantee that that is how it will always be used. It again highlights the danger of establishing precedents. The bill provides complete power for a Commonwealth officer to use `necessary and reasonable force' in removing a person, detaining a person et cetera, but there is no definition there of necessary and reasonable force. The explanatory memorandum does not specifically address the question of what sort of level and nature of force that is. 
People are supposed to be being able to be brought into the country for a temporary purpose but, as the minister said last night in one of his responses, there is no time line and no definition of temporary. The minister's second reading speech indicated that this power to bring transitory persons would be exercised only in exceptional circumstances, which one would assume is likely to mean not very often. The usual meaning of `exceptional' is `not normal'. But that is simply how the minister said the power is going to be used; it is not how the power could be used. It could be used to bring people in at any stage for any length of time, and they would of course be detained throughout that period.
Of course, with an amendment to the bill, they are now able to apply to the Refugee Review Tribunal for assessment of their status if they have been detained in Australia for more than six months continuously, but again there is an enormous number of loopholes in relation to that right. It is better that it is there than not, but it is a very weak right which is impossible to enforce. The government has the power to remove that right by a non-appealable administrative decision of the departmental secretary. The government has the power to remove a person from the country while their refugee claim is being considered by the Refugee Review Tribunal. The minister says that is not going to happen. I take his word that it is not going to happen under this government, but it is there and I think it is a dangerous precedent for people to be able to be removed from Australia while a fresh examination is being made of their case by the Refugee Review Tribunal.
We also have a new precedent where an examination of someone's status as a refugee can be halted by virtue of an administrative decision of the secretary determining that someone has behaved uncooperatively. Obviously, the Democrats do not support people behaving uncooperatively, and we recognise the desirability of people behaving cooperatively, but I do not think that, simply because someone is being non-cooperative, it should be possible to remove the right of someone to have a determination made about whether or not they are a refugee—a right which the government has now allowed by the amendment they moved. A determination being made by the Refugee Review Tribunal that someone is a refugee is a fundamental right and a fundamental issue—whether or not somebody is a refugee and whether they should therefore not be returned to face a situation of persecution—yet the government can override that determination process by virtue of an administrative decision that somebody is not cooperative enough. I think that is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. It is perhaps slightly preferable that people have been given the right to be assessed by the RRT which they would not have had under the bill before it was amended, but we now have a precedent in place where a person can have the assessment of their refugee status halted by a departmental secretary making an administrative decision about them being non-cooperative, when that is defined very broadly and when that decision by the departmental secretary cannot be appealed at all, except in undefined circumstances direct to the High Court. That is an extraordinary situation.
Again it has to be emphasised how tragic it is that the ALP has once again gone along with the government in having an incredibly significant amendment to our laws relating to the treatment of asylum seekers railroaded through this place with virtually no notice. This issue I am addressing at the moment about the power to stop a refugee assessment being conducted only came into this place yesterday. It was not even in the original bill; it came forward as an amendment yesterday, less than 24 hours ago. For something as significant and potentially far-reaching as that to be forced through this place with less than a day's consideration is simply unforgivable.  
There may be all sorts of political reasons why the ALP felt it was necessary for this to be pushed through quickly. I recognise that they have got internal differences of opinion about the issue, and all parties have that at some stage. Obviously they felt it would be easier for them to handle those differences of opinion if we just got this awkward matter of changing the law out of the way before too much attention was attached to it and then they could go on in a more leisurely way figuring out their amended position. It might be the easiest way for the ALP in terms of organisational harmony and convenience, but the price is being paid by the refugees and by asylum seekers. They are the ones who continue to pay the price for the political convenience of the ALP. 
The government, of course, is continuing down its now well-worn path not just in continually extending exceptional, unprecedented extra powers to the minister and to the department but in continually removing more and more rights from the asylum seekers to be able to have any assessment of their situation. I guess to that extent we should not be surprised, although again the fact that there is always this insistence that it be railroaded through, that it be rushed through and that it is urgent is simply a furphy.
The government keep proudly trumpeting how fabulous their people-smuggling measures are and how successful they are. They are so proud of them that they insist on railroading them through without anyone having a chance to look at what is actually happening. If they were as fabulous as they keep insisting, surely they would open them up to greater scrutiny so that people could examine the detail and walk away full of awe and wonder at the brilliance of this government. But the government do not do that; they prevent it going to any proper Senate committee examination. They ensure that there is not public awareness about what is happening. They simply remove the rights by railroading it through before people are aware of what is happening. 
This is a growing concern for the public of Australia. It may be the case, as the government like to assert, that a majority are still in favour of their approach. The Democrats continue to assert that a lot of that is due to the fact that the public are not aware of the realities of the detail of what the government's approach means. The public just think the broad picture is that we have a problem with boat arrivals and the government are fixing it. Firstly, I think it is questionable that they are fixing it and, secondly, there are standards for how you address issues and problems. 
It has to be recognised that this is not just an issue for Australia but an international problem, and it is a problem for other countries much more than it is for Australia. I really hesitate to use the word `problem' in relation to Australia because it is minor by comparison with many other countries. So it is an issue of concern to the public. We do not pay much attention to petitions anymore in this place, which is a shame, but a petition was presented today requesting that the Senate review procedures relating to political asylum seekers and remove all practices which are in contravention of international obligations. Senator Patterson tabled that petition on behalf of her constituents. I hope she is in support of the petition that she tabled. That is a small indication that there is growing concern amongst the Australian community about this issue. There is continuing concern amongst the Democrats in particular about the inability of this government to allow proper scrutiny and about the continual cooperation or connivance of the ALP with the Liberals in continuing to rush through wide-ranging removals of rights and wide-ranging increases of power to the minister and the department and new, unprecedented expansions of and modifications to laws relating to asylum seekers. 
Such changes can have international ramifications. There is no doubt that other countries are taking note of what Australia is doing, and it can have an impact and is having an impact on how other countries deal with this issue. There is no doubt, despite what this country says, that Australia's reputation is continuing to be damaged by this approach. People may say, `Who cares what the rest of the world think; we run our own show.' That is fine: I am all in favour of Australia running our own show. But we cannot pretend that it is not a factor and be like Robert Mugabe, saying, `It doesn't matter what the world thinks; I run things the way I want and that is okay.' It is very obvious that Zimbabwe is doing a lot of damage to its national interests, as well as its own individual citizens, by the way it is behaving in its breaching of human rights. It makes it much more difficult for Australia to be credible on the international stage in complaining about other countries' breaching of human rights when we do it so blatantly ourselves and in such a shoddy way of rushing things through without debate. That is the sort of approach we simply should not have in a parliament like this, and I think it is detrimental to our reputation in many ways.  
We can put forward an argument that the Sydney Olympics was worth all the investment and expenditure that was put on it because of the international goodwill that we gained. I think it was a worthwhile investment. It was great for Australia's reputation and it produced enormous long-term social and economic benefits for us. But you cannot say that that is really important and then say, when we do stuff that makes us look appalling in the eyes of the world, `It doesn't matter, it doesn't have any impact.' Of course it has an impact. If people have a perception that Australia is a harsh, unfriendly and intolerant place, they are far less likely to come here for starters, and that affects the tourism industry and even things like business investment.
No-one can deny there are racial undercurrents in relation to this policy of the government, and that is clearly detected and picked up by countries in our region. The government, quite rightly, finally now talks about the benefits of multiculturalism, which is not just valuable because it is a feelgood thing; it is valuable particularly in a globalising world because it enables us to engage effectively and in a positive way with the rest of the world—economically, socially and in all sorts of ways. If we do things that send out negative messages about our tolerance and our support for human rights, then there are negative effects. If people perceive Australia in that negative way around the world, then there are flow-on consequences. It is not just a matter of wanting to be popular; it is a matter of the national interest. This is clearly against the national interest. The number of times I hear from everyday Australians who have been overseas to all parts of the world and who are, repeatedly now, challenged about our treatment of refugees when they are in other parts of the world is large. It is becoming a very clear and consistent component and aspect of Australia's reputation on the global stage.
The Democrats are extremely disappointed that, once again, we are in a situation where very major, significant, far-reaching changes to migration law are being rushed through without debate and proper consideration, with the combined support of the ALP and the Liberals. The issue is not going to go away. I find it particularly astonishing, given all the revelations about this government's approach to accuracy in relation to asylum seeker issues. The Senate was sufficiently concerned about the falsehoods relating to the `children overboard' issue that it established a Senate committee into that incident and expanded the terms of reference to more broadly examine the Pacific solution. It is not simply a politicised focus on one incident but a broader look at policy issues. To have that committee specifically established to have a look at the Pacific solution and then allow legislation that directly impacts on it to be railroaded through before we have had a chance to examine the issue is simply negligent. It brings into question the genuineness of the ALP in wanting to examine those issues. Whether they just agreed to that so they could get their focal point on the `children overboard' incident, and the price they had to pay was to have a look at some policy issues as well, I do not know, but it is very disappointing when we actually have a process in place to look at this issue in depth and we ignore that and push this legislation through regardless. It again seems to indicate that, at least in this sort of issue, political self-interest wins out over broader public interest, and that is a great shame. 
As I say, the issue is not going to go away. Once again we have had a setback with this particular bill, but the cracks and flaws in this government's approach will continue to grow ever wider and you will not be able to continue to patch them up with more and more exotic legislative inventions like these. Eventually it will come collapsing down. It would be much better if we could dismantle it in a more ordered and sensible way than try to fix it up as it falls down around us. It will remain an ongoing interest for the Democrats, and I certainly hope that the ALP is able to take a more appropriate approach in the future.
As a final comment, senators may recall that there was debate last week in this chamber about regional forest agreements legislation. That took up an hour or two! During that debate Senator Brown repeatedly attacked the Democrats because we were not present for some stages of the debate, despite the fact we made significant contributions. I expressed my displeasure at the time and indicated that it was no representation of our lack of concern and that our contribution and our concern was substantial. I note Senator Brown has not been present for anything other than 10 minutes of this debate. I do not draw a reflection from that that he is not interested. I know he is interested and supportive of our concerns. I ask him to, in future, recognise that cheap shots like he made last week are not helpful. I am not going to return the favour on this occasion. I am sure he will also be voting against these bills and I am sure that his concern with them is genuine. I recognise that he probably felt that I would be sufficiently able to raise the issues myself and explore them adequately, which I think I have.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-21,"—I thank honourable senators who made contributions to the second reading debate on this bill. Senator Murray has made a number of comments and I understand that he will move some amendments during the committee stage. I will make some comments at that stage in relation to the particular amendments. Suffice it to say that we will oppose them; however, I do thank Senator Murray for his comment that we ministers of state are actually underpaid. It is very nice to know that there is somebody who believes that, but I have a funny feeling that people out in the community may not necessarily share that point of view.
This bill simply makes the appropriation for that which the Remuneration Tribunal determined. I note that the ALP have put forward a proposal in relation to former ministers undertaking certain activities after their retirement, but this is a bill that just seeks to make an allowance for the Remuneration Tribunal's determination. Senator Cooney made a good contribution to this debate, and he said that ministers are paid modestly. He also said—and I think this is an interesting point in relation to the Democrat proposal—that laws do not always bring a function to things; you will not necessarily bring the results that you want. I note that Senator Murphy also made a contribution to this debate. 
This is a very simple bill. The Remuneration Tribunal made a determination some time ago in relation to parliamentarians' salaries. There is a flow-on to ministers and, under the Constitution, there has to be an appropriation made for ministers to be paid. An increase has to be made available for the Remuneration Tribunal determination to be put into effect.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-03-21,"—The measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Income Tax (Superannuation Payments Withholding Tax) Bill 2002 form part of the government's superannuation election package. They will allow persons who have entered Australia on a certain class of visa and who then permanently depart Australia access to their superannuation benefits. The benefits accessed under this new regime will be subject to withholding arrangements. That is a new tax—or perhaps I should call it a new departure tax to return the tax concessions already provided for the superannuation benefit. In providing for a new tax, these measures evidence the breaking of the Prime Minister's promise before the election that he would not introduce any new taxes. On 1 November 2001, Prime Minister Howard made his promise during an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW. Mr Mitchell asked:
Will you agree or will you promise not to introduce any new taxes?
The Prime Minister replied:
This is our commitment, and that remains our commitment.
Yet, just a few days later, on 5 November 2001, the Prime Minister outlined the first of his new taxes, that being an effective departure tax imposed by these bills. The date of effect of these measures is 1 July 2002. It is worth noting that the government originally promised they would commence on 1 January 2002 but straight after the election announced a deferral of six months.
This is interesting, because Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer responsible, stated that the deferral was required because legislation needed to be passed and the industry must be given time to implement the changes. I would be interested in hearing an explanation from the minister as to why the government was not able to understand the basic requirements in November—before the election—when the government made the promise. It does not ring true that it suddenly realised that changes such as this require legislation and consultation. Perhaps, given its lack of attention to such matters during the process of tax reform, it is conceivable after all.
The failure to introduce these measures by 1 January this year is the second broken promise these bills represent, in addition to the promise not to introduce any new taxes. This is not a great start in the area of tax for this government's third term. It is possible that the delay was due to the minister's attitude towards the government's superannuation election package, as indicated by the comments she made on ABC radio in December 2001. In relation to the government's election promises, she said:
I think some of the announced changes are very good ones.
Perhaps this is one of the changes she thinks is very good; perhaps it only rates as moderately good or even just okay. Under the new arrangements, a person who receives a departing Australian superannuation payment is liable to pay tax on that payment at the rate decided by parliament. Under the bills, it is proposed that the rates be: for so much of the payment as represents undeducted contribution or post July 1994 invalidity component, nil; for so much of the payment as represents an untaxed element of the post June 1983 component, 40 per cent; and for the remainder of the payment, 30 per cent. It appears that most payments will be taxed at the 30 per cent rate.
Many of the temporary visa holders affected by these measures are high income earners and, consequently, pay the surcharge tax of 15 per cent, in addition to the 15 per cent contributions tax, leaving the remaining 70 per cent of their money to earn interest in the superannuation fund. On departure from Australia, under this new system they will generally pay another 30 per cent in tax, meaning the effective tax rate will be 51 per cent. That has been confirmed by Treasury. This is the highest personal income tax rate since Labor reduced the then 60 per cent rate in the 1980s. This tax rate is far higher than the tax concessions currently allowed on superannuation for many people, including many of the claimants. 
Treasury argued during Senate estimates in February, and again during the Economics Legislation Committee review of the bills this week, that because there is a timing benefit that accrues to the superannuation contributions a relatively lower rate of taxation than this 51 per cent tax rate is appropriate. Treasury officials further confirmed during the Economics Legislation Committee hearing on Tuesday that even for lower income earners the tax rate in many cases will be significantly higher than they would otherwise have to pay as personal income tax.
Due to the fact that in many cases the tax rate is relatively high and due to the bureaucratic process involved in actually getting their money, it is possible that some of the people eligible to access their benefits may put off doing so. That may mean the government will not realise the projected revenue, which is estimated at $255 million over three years. But the government are the ones with the access to the data. They have made some underlying assumptions, so I can just wish them all the best in collecting the money. Superannuation fund trustees will have to ensure the correct tax is withheld from the payments. They will also have to do considerable work to pay out the benefits as the regulations, at least in the draft form released by the government on 8 March, require a significant amount of paperwork to be completed.
The class of people eligible to access their superannuation under these provisions is not spelt out in the legislation but will be left to regulations to prescribe. The draft regulations currently provide for a substantial number of classes of eligible temporary resident visas—everything from the predictable inclusions, such as subclass 413 Executive, to the more unusual, such as subclass 499 Olympic Support. It is worth noting that the classes of eligible visas also extend to those that do not carry with them the right to work in Australia. Hence, it should be highly unusual for these people to have Australian superannuation funds. It would be interesting to see how many tourists apply for their superannuation under such circumstances, given that it requires an admission in most cases that they have been illegally working in Australia.
This new process for obtaining superannuation benefits differs significantly from the existing regime. Currently, individuals departing Australia, regardless of whether they have been Australian residents or temporary visa holders, on a permanent basis generally only have access to their superannuation entitlements at or after the preservation age. The preservation age is a minimum of 55 years, but for those born after 1 July 1960 there is a phased increase in the preservation age up to 60 years.
The explanatory memorandum to these bills states that the policy objective of this legislation is to reduce the administration and compliance costs that superannuation funds incur and pass on to all fund members in preserving the superannuation benefits of temporary residents who have permanently departed Australia. This contrasts with the apparent policy driver conveyed in the second reading speech that emphasises the fact that temporary residents who leave Australia will not be retiring here and so the government's intention is to fulfil their desire to take superannuation with them. I am sure, however, that the significant revenue to be gained—or that the government believe they will gain—from these measures is also factored in to the government's policy decision. 
It should be noted that it was the government that tightened up the release provisions in 1998 for people permanently departing Australia. At that time, the Labor senators, including me, on the superannuation committee charged with examining the government's proposed changes strongly argued that temporary visa holders who permanently depart Australia should be given access to their superannuation. The government insisted that this should not be permitted. This proposal represents another U-turn in respect of superannuation policy.  
Other measures announced in the government's election policy package include the reduction in the rate of the government's own superannuation surcharge tax, the introduction of co-contributions—which they promised to deliver before the 1996 election but then scrapped and now will provide for in a very limited way for low income earners—and the introduction of a requirement on employers to make quarterly payments of superannuation guarantee contributions. Yet again, this is a half-hearted change from the government, following their repeated refusal to pass our legislation over the past few years that would have ensured much sooner that contributions were made quarterly. The government's attempt at this policy will not see mandatory quarterly contributions until July 2003. In response to this, Labor introduced a private member's bill in the House of Representatives on 11 March 2002, which was aimed at providing protection for employee superannuation, commencing from 1 July 2002. It is yet to be seen whether the government will support this significant improvement on their proposal.
It is interesting to note that the people we are talking about—who will be paying a tax rate percentage effectively in the low fifties when they transfer their superannuation out of Australia—do not vote. While Labor believe that these measures highlight the inconsistency of the government's approach to superannuation and include two significant broken promises, we will be supporting the bills in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2002-03-21,"—The Democrats believe that the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2002 is worthy of support because it is a step in the right direction. Having said that, we have some concerns. Indeed, a number of concerns have been raised with me about the Therapeutic Goods Administration system for registering listed medical devices. We need to be very careful here. We need ongoing monitoring and very careful scrutiny of these devices. I seek leave to table some concerns as expressed by Professor John Dwyer AO of the Division of Medicine, Prince Henry Hospital, University of New South Wales.
Leave granted.
—This document simply expresses his concerns and they are worthy of being put on the record. I know there are many in the community who believe that this bill is a step in the right direction. In particular, the Consumers Health Forum were consulted on this bill. They believe we are going down the right path for health consumers. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2002 enables Australia to adopt a global regulatory model for medical devices, thereby aligning us with international best practice. It will ensure that consumers have access to new technologies and that both consumers and industry will benefit from avoiding unnecessary costs through the removal of regulatory duplication. There will also be increased emphasis on post-marketing activities with the requirements for manufacturers and sponsors to report adverse events involving medical devices to the TGA within some specific time frames. Australia's involvement in an international post-market vigilant system should reduce the likelihood of repeated adverse events and influence how new medical devices are developed and marketed. 
I am also aware of concerns in the community about the tracking of medical devices. While this is a serious issue which must also be addressed, it cannot be tackled within the bounds of this legislation. The Council for Quality and Safety in Health Care has, as one of its priorities, to examine a system to track implanted medical devices. I am informed that the council is currently developing such a system to deal with issues of manufacturers, sponsors and medical practitioners. There has also been a suggestion for a nationally operated implant tracking system that would use the Health Insurance Commission database to record patients and their implanted devices. We are seeing some positive steps along this path and I look forward to the government advising us in future of where we are up to. To sum up, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2002 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2002 will ensure that consumers have timely access to new technologies and will benefit from not having unnecessary costs.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS (CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-03-21,"—The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Bill 2002 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2002 seek to allow the introduction of an internationally harmonised framework for the regulation of medical devices in Australia. Australia will be aligning with international best practice by adopting the global regulatory model for medical devices. This will ensure that consumers have timely access to new technologies. Consumers and industry will also benefit from the removal of regulatory duplication and associated costs. Medical device safety will be improved by moving to a comprehensive risk based classification system that will allow an appropriate level of regulation to be applied to each class of device. There will also be an increased emphasis on postmarket activities that should reduce the likelihood of repeated adverse events as well as influence the development of safer medical devices. These bills will benefit all Australians by allowing the introduction of a medical device regulatory system that will deliver better protection of public health while facilitating access to new medical technologies. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-03-21,"—The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card Extension) Bill 2002 before the Senate today seeks to extend the gold card, or the `repatriation health card for all conditions', to Australian veterans who are aged 70 or over and who have post World War II qualifying service. In this brief speech I will consider the background to the gold card, the history of repatriation health care in Australia and some concerns about the administration of the Department of Veterans' Affairs's private health scheme in light of recent evidence emerging from the Senate estimates committees about the blow-out of health care costs.
I turn firstly to the issue of background information on the gold card. The Veterans' Entitlements Act already provides entitlement to the gold card for veterans of the two world wars who are over the age of 70 and have qualifying service, amongst many others. The gold card entitles veterans to free health care for all conditions, including private hospital cover to a varying degree in each state. This bill implements the policy of both the government and the opposition at the last election, namely, to extend the gold card to post World War II veterans who are over 70 years of age and have qualifying service. The gold card has a considerable history because it is a benefit of great comfort and value to the holder as well as an administrative tool which brings considerable efficiency to DVA operations. A gold card entitles the holder to the full range of repatriation health care benefits. Benefits include treatment as a private patient in a public or private hospital, choice of doctor, pharmaceuticals at the concessional rate, optical care, physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry and chiropractic services. It is also a badge which grants status as a veteran or a veteran's widow, and hence the importance of the criteria for its issue. While once the card was issued to those most likely to have the need for more intensive health care as a result of their gruelling war service—that is, POWs and TPIs—that is no longer true. 
The bill is important because for former serving personnel it now effectively draws a line for qualifying service. There are some veterans who will not receive a gold card even after this extension. Those who will not receive a gold card after the passage of this legislation include: those veterans who do not meet the service criteria, including those servicemen who enlisted to serve but were not sent overseas and were not in an area of Australia that came under hostile enemy action, and Allied and Commonwealth veterans who served with a Commonwealth or Allied force, unless they actually lived in Australia before enlisting in Commonwealth or Allied forces. 
In his 1975 report of the independent inquiry into the repatriation system, Justice Toohey identified the philosophy behind the provision of repatriation benefits to veterans. The philosophy is based upon the following principles:
Australia is indebted to those who served it in time of war, risking their lives and health and probably suffering economic loss. Australia, consequently, has a duty to properly care for those who serve and their dependents. Those who served overseas or in a proclaimed theatre of war are likely to have encountered greater danger and or more arduous service than those who had home service and as a result should have more expensive cover. Compensation and other benefits should be available as a matter of right and not as a welfare handout.
These principles underpin the present legislative scheme.
At this point I think it is relevant to consider the history of the provision of health care services to veterans by the Repatriation Commission. When injured Australians returned from overseas service in World War I they had considerable need for health services due to injuries sustained during their service. At that time, Australia had no universal health system such as we have today. Consequently, it was critical for the government to provide health services for those who had served their country and who had been injured in that process. Similarly, World War II left many young men requiring medical attention for their injuries. Once again, the government provided health services, at the time a role for which the government did not have any responsibility in regard to other Australian citizens. 
Since that time, the provision of universal health care has become an important function of government. The increase in health care provided for the general population has been consistent with the increase in the entitlement of the veteran population to health care. For example, the gold card provides a far greater range of services than was ever envisaged by the Repatriation Commission when it provided health care for injured veterans returning from the world wars. The running of parallel health systems for the general public and for veterans necessarily means that attention needs to focus on the Repatriation Commission's administration of the health care system for veterans. Effectively, the DVA card system—comprising the white card for specific compensatable service related injury and illness and the gold card for all conditions—is a de facto private health scheme where the criteria for membership are now seen as a matter of right, no longer of need, free of charge. 
The opposition supports this bill but has serious misgivings about some aspects of the administration of this private health scheme. In this context, it is important to note recent evidence that emerged from the estimates process at the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade committee, which is of particular concern. Evidence to the committee demonstrated that there has been a considerable blow-out in costs of the provision of health services to veterans through the white and gold cards. Over the last five years the cost of major private hospital treatment of veterans has risen from $354 million in 1996-97 to $669 million in 2001-02. This amounts to an increase of over 185 per cent in expenditure on private hospitals for the provision of veterans health services in just five years. 
The sale of two repatriation hospitals previously owned by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the private sector undoubtedly accounts for some of this increase in private hospital expenditure. Ironically, it is these two hospitals where costs have been best controlled. Additionally, there is always the argument that the ageing veteran population is requiring additional health services. However, the veteran population is ageing consistently across the states. The fact that the veteran population is ageing cannot and does not account for the extent of the blow-out in health care costs in some states.
The Department of Veterans' Affairs advised during committee hearings that there has been a shift from public to private treatment. Again, this does not account for the magnitude of the increases in some states nor does it account for the variation between the states. The extent of the blow-out in health care costs is evident from the analysis of costs and separations in private hospitals by state over the last five years. The increase in separations ranges from a reasonable 40 per cent in Western Australia and 43 per cent in Queensland, to a remarkable increase in separations of 142 per cent in Victoria. I say that the increases in Western Australia and Queensland are possibly reasonable because the increasing average age of entitled veterans combined with rising costs of health care goes some way towards explaining that increase.
However, the variation between states and the percentage increase in separations over five years is absolutely astounding. The percentage increase in private hospital separations in South Australia and the Northern Territory has been almost three times the increase in Western Australia. Separations in Victoria over five years saw more than 3½ times the increase in Western Australia. Tasmania had double the increase in separations that Western Australia had.
The variation between states is exemplified by the fact that the percentage increase in separations in Victoria over five years of 142 per cent is double the average increase across the states, which came to 70 per cent. The figures for the Department of Veterans' Affairs expenditure in private hospitals over the last five years are similarly intriguing. Notable examples are the figures from South Australia and the Northern Territory. As I said before, the number of separations increased by 142 per cent in five years. During the same time frame, costs increased by 245 per cent. It seems costs are spiralling out of control in South Australia and the Northern Territory, with cost increases way out of proportion to increases in the number of separations. Once again, though, the numbers are too great to accept the lame excuse of ageing and escalating health costs—the figures are just too contradictory. There is no explanation yet proffered that justifies the increase in costs way out of proportion with other states.
The situation in other states is as follows. In New South Wales and the ACT, the increase in costs has been less than the increase in separations, so costs have been increasing at a lower rate than the number of separations. In Western Australia and Queensland, the percentage increase in costs has been kept within 12 per cent of the increase in separations. In New South Wales and the ACT, the percentage increase in costs has been almost 1½ times the percentage increase in separations. In Tasmania, the percentage increase in costs has almost doubled the percentage increase in separations. There is no consistent correlation between the percentage increase in separations and the percentage increase in costs. 
There are so many questions raised by these figures. Why are cost increases not even remotely consistent with the separation increases on a state by state basis? Why are percentage increases in the number of separations not consistent between states? Why are percentage increases in costs not consistent between states? These are serious questions and we look forward to a response from the Department of Veterans' Affairs in due course.
The Australian National Audit Office report on the administration of veterans health care tabled in February 2000 revealed a range in per capita spending on non-hospital services for veterans with a gold card from $1,123 to less than $200. The same report also noted:
Although there might be minor differences in health needs between regions, there was rarely sufficient to explain this difference in the use of services noted in the analysis.
The findings of this report suggest that either health care use is supply driven or access to health care services is inadequate in certain geographical regions. Either of these outcomes is cause for concern and further analysis of trends in these areas is critical. The relationship between the health care needs of veterans and the proportion of veterans obtaining health care services needs to be better understood.
The costing of this election commitment to extend the gold card indicated that treatment costs incurred by the Department of Veterans' Affairs will increase 140 per cent over the next three years. This extension of the gold card will rise from $30.6 million in 2002-03 to $43.1 million in 2003-04. The increase in total expenditure is a result of an anticipated increase in individual costs from $7,600 in 2002-03 to $9,150 in 2004-05.
In conclusion, the opposition supports the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card Extension) Bill 2002, which implements the election policy of both the government and the opposition. However, we note with some concern the matters I have referred to in my speech with the administration of the system by the department. The figures revealed through the estimates process relating to rising private hospital separations and expenditure mean that the system will need to be observed even more closely in the future. The opposition supports the bill before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD EXTENSION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-21,"—This is the first piece of veterans' legislation the Senate has considered since the government was re-elected. We have a new minister and a new shadow minister in that portfolio. I would start by welcoming Minister Vale and Senator Bishop to the Veterans' Affairs portfolio, which is one that is often seen as a very minor one. I think that is a great shame because it affects a very large number of Australians and a very special group of Australians who have special needs.
This particular piece of legislation extends full repatriation and health care entitlements, otherwise known as the gold cards, to Australian veterans aged 70 or over who have qualifying service from post-World War II. This will largely impact on veterans of the Korean War, the Malayan emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and veterans of the Vietnam wars who have reached the age of 70. I assume it will also eventually affect Gulf War veterans and people who are becoming veterans as we speak and others as they eventually reach the age of 70 years where the government recognises those conflicts as qualifying service.
The bill is an initiative that the Australian Democrats support and have called for previously. It is something that I as veterans' affairs spokesperson first called for in this place in April 2000, nearly two years ago, although other Democrat senators have raised it before that. It gives an entitlement that began with World War I veterans who received a similar entitlement to health care in 1918. World War II veterans of qualifying service received it in 1999. The important point is that all World War I veterans receive this entitlement. However, when in 1999 World War II veterans received this initiative, it was limited to those with qualifying service. I have a second reading amendment today which was circulated in this chamber a few days ago which addresses that anomaly and calls on the government to fix that anomaly. 
The Democrats recognise the special obligations owed to veterans and we support this legislation. The amendment I am moving is to acknowledge a group that many people believe has missed out, so it is probably appropriate if I move that amendment standing in my name. It is unfortunate, when the government announced last year the initiative contained in this bill, that it was interpreted at the time by many veterans to mean that they would receive the gold card, even though they did not have qualifying service. I am sure they have been very disappointed— in fact, I know they have—to find out that that is not the case. If the government were to take on board the aim of the amendment the Democrats are moving, it would make it the case and they would receive the gold card that many believe they were promised by the coalition before the election.
Many of those who enlisted and served in World War II do not have qualifying service, through no fault of their own. Service personnel went where they were sent and the differences in where they were sent can often be quite arbitrary in terms of what counts as qualifying service and what does not. In one letter I received on this issue, and it is one of many, it says:
We agreed to serve our country and our King anywhere we might be sent by our service chiefs. We could not choose nor change our postings or appointment. We went where we were sent, and most of us for five or six bob a day. It seems we are being penalised for the decisions of our service controllers.
The author of this letter serves with the RAAF from 1941 until 1945 and in the Australian Navy from 1946 until 1949. What constitutes qualifying service throws up a number of anomalies where service personnel did face warlike dangers but that is not recognised by the government. In 1942, Australians faced the threat of invasion. Darwin was bombed, killing hundreds. A Japanese submarine entered Sydney Harbour, and many other significant events occurred that brought the war near our shores.
This year, on the 50th anniversary of what was probably the greatest threat Australia has faced in a military sense, it would be appropriate to recognise the war efforts of all who served on our shores during that time. What constitutes qualifying service can be quite an arbitrary decision in some cases. The provision of the gold card to some members of the veterans community and not others certainly causes divisions. If you served in Darwin during one period of time, you are recognised as having qualifying service but, potentially, if you were there just a few days later you were not.
There were World War II veterans who served in the Second World War in Australia at the closest point to Timor that are not recognised as having qualifying service and therefore will not receive the gold card. An artillery Army unit went from Perth to the north of Broome, where it was thought the Japanese would invade. Half went by sea and therefore would have a gold card; the other half went by motor transport and did not qualify. That is a major distinction when you are within the one battalion. The chairman of the gold card campaign provided that example. Eligibility entitlements is an area of ongoing review, and we can see that with the Moore review and the current review of veterans' entitlements in this legislation itself.
We must remember, and I think it is appropriate when you are dealing with an issue of gold card, which obviously relates to people's ill health, that many veterans literally paid the price of losing their good health as a result of their service to this country. They were healthy when they enlisted or they would not have been able to serve in the first place and they went where they were sent. If they need medical care now then I believe we as a nation have a responsibility to provide it. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “, but the Senate calls on the Government, having recognised Australian veterans aged 70 or over who have qualifying service post World War II, to extend the same full Repatriation Health Care (Gold Card) entitlement to all World War II veterans whether or not they have qualifying service”.
I urge the government to recognise the genuineness of its intent and take it on board. I also hope that the ALP would give it support as well.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD EXTENSION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-03-21,"—I would have made some comments, Senator Bartlett, in my second reading address as to the amendment just moved by the Democrats but it had not been circulated. Just for the record, the amendment essentially seeks to extend the gold card to all veterans who served in World War II. The current distinction is derived from the application of the Veterans' Entitlement Act, which extends the gold card to veterans who had qualifying service. Qualifying service in shorthand means those who are engaged in warlike activity away from Australia. It essentially means the distinction to date in policy terms between those veterans who went overseas into theatres of engagement and faced the enemy and those veterans who remained in Australia. 
Senator Bartlett referred to a large number of anomalies, and there are indeed all sorts of odd anomalies in the application of that test under the current act. I am advised that in my own state, if people crossed over from the mainland of Australia to Rottnest Island— less than two or three kilometres—to go to a munitions depot store there during the war for training purposes, they have qualifying service and are hence entitled to better benefits. Whilst not denying any comfort to those persons who enjoy that benefit, there does not seem to be any logic in it at all. I share Senator Bartlett's concerns about some of the anomalies that exist under this act. Perhaps they might be addressed in due course by the review instituted by the minister in recent times.
On my rough figuring, the second reading amendment moved by the Democrats means that the benefit currently paid would be extended to somewhere in the order of 50,000 persons who remained in Australia as part of the ADF and did not enjoy overseas service. Questions on notice in recent times have revealed that the current annual cost of the provision of the gold card is something in the order of $9,000 per person, and so simple arithmetic tells you that on current calculations the cost inherent in the proposal moved by the Democrats is something in the order of $450 million. That is not something that the opposition has been able to give consideration to in the last two or three days. It is not consistent with the policy we had prior to the last election, and it is something I would want to give serious thought to sometime in the future. So, simply on that issue of short notice and the basis of cost, without passing any comment at all about the merit of the amendment moved by the Democrats or the worth or otherwise of those people who would enjoy the benefit if the amendment were passed, the opposition is unable to support the amendment at this stage.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD EXTENSION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-03-21,"— For more than 80 years the Australian repatriation system has provided a comprehensive range of benefits to compensate veterans and their dependents for injury, disability or death resulting from their wartime service. This government continues its commitment to those who have sacrificed and served their country. The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card Extension) Bill 2002 will extend eligibility for full repatriation health care benefits to include all Australian Defence Force veterans who are aged 70 or over, who have qualifying service from conflicts after World War II and who live in Australia. The further extension of the gold card will make full repatriation health care immediately available to eligible Australian veterans from the Korean War, the Malayan emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and the Vietnam War and to those Australian veterans involved in bomb and mine clearance activities. Furthermore, in later years it will provide a gold card for Australian veterans with qualifying service from more recent conflicts, such as the Gulf War, East Timor and the coalition against terror.
This measure builds upon the Howard government's extension of eligibility for the repatriation gold card in 1999 to include Australian veterans and merchant mariners who have qualifying service from World War II, are over the age of 70 and are resident in Australia. This government has also acknowledged the service of Commonwealth and Allied veterans and Allied mariners who served alongside Australians during World War II, and has provided them with full access to prescription medicines under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, with effect from 1 January 2002. There is also an exception for those veterans of Commonwealth or Allied forces who were domiciled in Australia before enlistment, on the basis that these veterans had a connection with Australia before their service. If any British, Commonwealth or Allied veteran feels that they meet this exception, they should certainly apply for the gold card. The health and wellbeing of our veterans and war widows has been of prime concern to this government. There are now almost 282,000 members of the veteran community with a gold card. We are committed to ensuring that those members of the veteran community receiving income support payments receive maximum benefit through the provision of a fair and equitable system. 
With regard to the amendment moved by Senator Bartlett in relation to the extension of the gold card to all World War II veterans regardless of qualifying service, many senators would know that this government is committed to bringing clarity to the issues surrounding the eligibility for veterans' entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The Prime Minister's election commitment to establish an independent committee to review veterans' entitlements has been implemented, and the review has already commenced, under the chairmanship of the Hon. Dr John Clarke QC, assisted by Air Marshal Douglas Riding and Dr David Rosalky. This committee has been asked to consider perceived anomalies, including the issues of some groups of World War II veterans who do not have qualifying service. While I cannot pre-empt the committee's report, let me say that in making any decisions the government will be guided by one fundamental principle: our belief in providing fair, consistent and appropriate benefits to Australia's veterans. That is a principle which has been the driving force behind our Australian repatriation system for almost 85 years.
Today's legislation is about a very special kind of respect and regard from this government that is due to a very special group of Australians. I thank honourable senators for their contributions, and commend the bill to the Senate.

Original question agreed to.

Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD EXTENSION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-03-21,"—The bill being debated in the Senate today, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Budget 2000 and Other Measures) Bill 2002, is the same as that submitted to the House of Representatives in the last parliament but which lapsed due to the prorogation of the parliament prior to the election last November. At the outset may I state that the Labor Party does not oppose this bill, because it is beneficial in nature and generally aims to resolve some operational issues within the administration of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, which parallels the Social Security Act in many areas to do with income support matters. We will, however, be moving a second reading amendment by way of protest against what can only be described as government bloody-mindedness on the matter of means testing veterans' disability pensions. 
I will not address the particulars of this bill, as they have been canvassed in the original debate and yesterday in the House and there is little to add. I do, however, wish to highlight that part of the bill that deals with the changed treatment of compensation payments of an income support nature as they have been applied to date to couples. In short, the proposal to limit the offsetting calculations for such payments from third parties to the payee first and only to the payee's partner second, rather than jointly as is currently the case, is both fair and equitable. The Centrelink policy relating to the offsetting of income support payments from third parties such as insurance companies where compensation for lost income has been paid is a very important element of general policy, but it is one where there is blatant discrimination against ex-service people in receipt of disability pensions for their service related injury or illness. Equally, I should mention that some insurance companies also employ an offsetting policy which, depending on the terms of the policy, may also be discriminatory—but that practice is not the subject of this bill.  
This is a major weakness in the way the means test under the Social Security Act works. For the record, while income support payments of the kind referred to in this act are included as income in the means test, other payments for pain and suffering are not. Strictly speaking, the latter is not income. It is compensation for the loss of life amenity and for the physical loss that has lowered the quality of life that otherwise might have been expected. This is also how the Veterans Entitlements' Act works for those who are in receipt of a service pension—that is, their disability compensation is not counted as income in the means test, the same means test as in the Social Security Act. Yet if an ex-service man or woman is in payment of a benefit from Centrelink, such as the age pension or disability support pension, the disability pension paid to these people by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for service related injury or illness is so counted. 
For the Labor Party this has been a matter of some contradiction for many years and, as I said before, `discriminatory' is probably a more appropriate description. Despite opposition attempts to amend legislation such as this in the Senate, the government has stonewalled and has failed to honour its own previous promises to make the amendment. This is not a new issue. We know that the government has done the costings and we believe that as we have now refined it the cost is likely to be less than $20 million per year. The beneficiaries, as we can best determine, are about 4,000 ex-service age pensioners, predominantly those who enlisted to serve in World War II but who did not leave the country—through no fault of their own, as they say—and up to 500 younger ex-service people, most of whom are TPIs. For these people, the exclusion of their non-taxable, non-means tested DVA disability pension from the means test at Centrelink would result in immediate and substantial relief. A single person on a disability pension of 50 per cent and with no other income, for example, would be better off by $10 per fortnight. For a single TPI pensioner in the same circumstances the increase would be $65 per fortnight. This would make an enormous difference, especially for those with family responsibilities. 
We have seen the government brazenly boast that they have spent an extra $2.6 billion on veterans during their term in office. We have seen $508 million committed in the last budget and in the election promises, all in the clear knowledge that this was an outstanding issue of merit. So let us not have any budget stringency plea or the much-bandied excuse, which is now worn out, of competing priorities. 
We know that the government has now erected a time stalling device in the form of a judicial review, which will no doubt be used to keep this and a whole lot of other veterans' issues on ice for a year or two until the eve of the next election. Affected by that stalling device are those in the SAS whose dangerous service is not adequately recognised. We on this side share the concern of all SAS personnel present and past and we openly acknowledge the strength of the case they put. Where we differ, though, is using access to the Veterans' Entitlements Act as the remedy, for the reasons I have outlined. Strictly speaking, this is a conditions of service issue and needs to be addressed by the Department of Defence as a top priority. It is to be hoped that this legislation now being drafted for the new military compensation scheme will address this matter in full. 
I have addressed the appalling state of policy in this portfolio previously, and I refer in particular to my speech in the adjournment debate on 11 March, where I set out a detailed list of criticisms which in aggregate rendered the committee's task under Justice Clark quite difficult. Foremost amongst those was the impossible mission of trying to sort out the meaning of `qualifying service', which, as the Senate knows, is the gateway to the service pension and the gold card. Associated with that, however, is a seemingly total misunderstanding of the government's own policy framework with respect to the recognition of risk and the status of coverage for peacetime service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. For the record, there is a long history here whereby successive governments have preserved the act for operational—that is, overseas—service only, with all peacetime domestic service covered by the former Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act, and since 1994 by the Military Compensation Act. The only exception to that—and in retrospect this may have been a mistake—was the reopening of the act for peacetime service from 1972 to 1994.  
On top of this, the government has committed itself to the recommendations of the Tanzer review, which recommended that a new military compensation scheme be legislated to replace the VEA for all service. So why the government is even entertaining the inclusion of certain peacetime service in the VEA at this stage is problematic. 
There are examples, too, of administrative blundering which I will also mention in passing, none of which provide much hope for veterans. I raised in the adjournment debate on 20 March the dilatory action by the Minister for Defence on the plans of the French government to build an airport costing $16 billion over the top of Australian graves on the Western Front of World War 1. It has taken five months to make even the most elementary representation government to government. Then we have what can only be described as negligence in the attitude towards Anzac Day. The minister's silence on this issue has been most noticeable for, as part of the general government lack of interest in the matter of public liability insurance, the buck has been passed to the states. But this is a national issue. Anzac Day is a national day, and its preservation requires a national response. At least in New South Wales the Premier has given an assurance that Anzac Day will be protected in that state—to his great credit—but, again, it seems that the Howard government is taking no action on this point.
I conclude by making specific reference to the work done in this country by ex-service organisations. The popular press would have us believe that volunteerism had its origins in the Olympic Games, whereas we all know better. Volunteerism is an intrinsic part of the Australian psyche, and it is nowhere better reflected than in the enormous work done by ex-service organisations. In every RSL branch and sub-branch in Australia there is a welfare function which underpins the commitment to service to members. It is similarly the case with Legacy, the War Widows Guild, the Vietnam Veterans Association and the Vietnam Veterans Federation, the TPI Federation, the Retired Defence Forces and Welfare Association, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, the Naval Association and all the many others too numerous to list. All these organisations, and all the unit groups who serve to maintain linkages with mates, do wonderful work for their members which is rarely recognised. Without them, the system would collapse.
Since taking responsibility for the veterans' affairs shadow ministry, I have taken whatever opportunity has presented itself to meet with as many of these groups as I can, to hear their views on policy issues in particular and also to understand the nature of this wonderful veteran community. I do not wish to select any particular group, but I must say that the commitment shown to assisting their fellow veterans is astonishing. For many, such as those in Legacy, there may in fact be only a limited past association with the forces—for in many cases legatees come from non-military backgrounds—and also they pay for the honour of doing the hours and hours of work assisting widows and their children. This is an outstanding and often unrecognised effort, and I am sure that everyone in the Senate will join me in thanking them.
As has been indicated, the ALP wishes to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill. That amendment has been circulated in my name. In summary, the Labor Party and, we trust, the Democrats want the government to honour its promise to exempt veterans' disability pension at the general rate from the definition of income within the means test in the Social Security Act. The reasons for this have already been carefully explained, but in a nutshell we believe that ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen are being seriously discriminated against. The amendment is good policy, as the government have previously conceded, and we simply ask them to act with honour to regularise the policy, remove the discrimination and help those most in need. I move: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate calls on the government to remove the anomaly whereby veterans' disability pensions are assessed as income for social security purposes”.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BUDGET 2000 AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-21,"—The Democrats support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Budget 2000 and Other Measures) Bill 2002, which will bring about minor positive changes that are largely already reflected in the social security system. It enacts a more generous treatment of pension payments received by partners of compensation recipients, amends treatment of financial assets which are unrealisable for the purposes of hardship cases under the assets test and streamlines income streams under social security law. Having responsibility on behalf of the Democrats for the social security portfolio as well as the veterans' affairs portfolio, I recall our support for those measures when they were passed in a complementary fashion with the social security law.
We support this legislation, as I said. Because others spoke after I had moved my amendment during the debate on the previous bill, I will briefly, with the indulgence of the Senate, note the comments that were made in relation to it. Obviously, cost is always an issue. I do not think in this case that timing should have been an issue, because the amendment was circulated a couple of days ago, but I hope that, given there is a review being conducted by the government on gold card entitlements, these aspects will be taken into account.
When we are looking at veterans' entitlements, whether relating to health or to the other issues that we are dealing with under this legislation, there are often anomalies, and veterans often suffer hardships because of gaps in other aspects of public policy. One of the reasons why we have such a big demand for increased access to the gold card, in the Democrats' view, is because of inadequacies in our public health system. If we had a properly funded public health system, and if older people generally had faith that the public health system could look after them, there would be a less desperate struggle to obtain the gold card. It goes back to the issue of the cost of extending the gold card. If the appropriate level of funding were put into health services rather than wasted on things like the private health rebate, there would be less demand for the gold card and more funds available to provide it for those who should be entitled to it. So I think it is an appropriate matter to consider further.
The Democrats support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Bishop on behalf of the Labor Party. Indeed, in June 2000, on behalf of the Democrats, I moved an amendment which had the same intent as the one that Senator Bishop has put forward. We were pleased that the ALP supported that amendment at the time and we are pleased that they have moved a similar amendment which at least expresses the principle that the government should remove that anomaly. The spokesperson for the ALP then was Senator Schacht. In this area, he has provided a good legacy for Senator Bishop to try to fill and build upon.
I recall that our amendment on this issue was an amendment to social security legislation, because the negative side of the anomaly is the treatment of income and compensation by the social security department and not the treatment of it by the veterans' affairs department. So the legislation that needs to be amended is the Social Security Act rather than the veterans' affairs act, and I presume that is why the amendment we are considering is a second reading amendment that expresses that view relating to veterans.
As I recall, it was passed by the Senate as a substantive amendment to the legislation, but the government did not accept it. It bounced backwards and forwards a couple of times, and eventually the Senate did not insist upon it. At the time the government said they would consider the issue in the budget context. We know that a submission was put forward to the government by the department to remove that anomaly, and it was knocked out by the Expenditure Review Committee— the razor gang—in the finance department. At the time, Senator Schacht gave a commitment that if Labor got into government they would move to amend this. That did not happen, of course, but I trust that, if we have an opportunity to press it in a substantive sense regarding social security legislation, that support from the ALP will still be there, because the passage of this amendment will not make that happen. It is a good amendment and we support it as it increases the pressure on the government for action in that regard. 
At that time, nearly two years ago, the government rejected the amendment that the Democrats put forward. They claimed that it was not correctly drafted to achieve what we wanted to achieve. The government did not offer to provide any assistance to draft what they thought would be a suitable amendment, which they obviously had the resources to do. So that aspect still needs to be resolved as well. The present situation, where the disability pension is included in the social security income test, is in contradiction to the government's position that this pension is paid to veterans as compensation.
As has been said by Senator Bishop, the coalition promised to review this matter before they won government in 1996. The review that was undertaken was unfortunately an internal one. For reasons that I still do not understand, the government refused to provide copies of that review or to publicly release it. We have established from answers in this place in the budget estimates that the measure would cost about $20 million, as Senator Bishop said, which is not a great deal of money to correct an anomaly which is very significant to those affected. It seems strange that the government cannot bring itself to correct this admitted anomaly which takes money away from a significant number of veterans. It makes one wonder what the point is of promising to review anomalies if not only no action is taken—even though the anomaly is still acknowledged—but also no-one is even allowed to see the contents of that review.
It is notable that all the speakers on the bills say they support veterans. Quite rightly, many speakers pointed to their relatives who are veterans or to people in their community or their electorate. They pointed to the admiration they have for them. Senator Bishop pointed to the quality of their efforts not only during their service but also to their continued efforts as members of the community. It is a group that, in a political sense, often gets more praise than just about any other group in the community, but when it comes to making decisions that affect their lives directly we cannot seem to advance the issue. I really hope this is one area where we can get some advances during the term of this government. 
I recognise there are always financial and anomalies issues and some others, which we have referred to in the context of the gold card debate. But the issue we are debating is always pretty close to the top of the list for veterans. It is one they would like to see addressed; it is not particularly expensive. It has been a source of frustration for many years and I really hope we can get movement on it. There are other issues that would benefit veterans but that also seem to have stalled. One I would point to, and of which others would be aware, is the rate of the totally and permanently incapacitated pension, the TPI, which has also been a matter of concern for some time.
I would like to take the opportunity while I am speaking on this legislation to express formally the condolences of the Australian Democrats to the family and colleagues of Brigadier Alf Garland, who passed away recently. He served as President of the RSL for five years from 1988, following a long and honourable military career. He served overseas on many occasions, starting with the Korean War, and he commanded the first Australian SAS squadron in Borneo, a particularly poignant point as the SAS is serving at the moment in Afghanistan.
With regard to the SAS, I should also mention the support of the Democrats for changes to the treatment of SAS personnel who are injured during training. Their training is more hazardous than most qualifying service in most circumstances, and they would certainly benefit from the amendment that we are considering. Again, it really comes back to the issue of anomalies when you are looking at what determines qualifying service. The rate of injury amongst SAS personnel is amongst the highest in the defence forces—regardless of whether or not they are going into combat situations—because of the special nature of their activities. They are far more likely to get significant injuries and, as I said, their training is often more hazardous than some of the situations that relate to qualifying service. 
In conclusion, the Democrats support the bill and the amendment that calls for an exemption of the disability pension from the social security income test. The Department of Veterans' Affairs rightly recognises the veterans disability income as compensation, but for some reason the Social Security Act and the department continue to count it as income. That allows them to substantially reduce the amount paid for Veterans' Affairs pensions. The disability pension for veterans is compensation for disabilities and disease incurred during service and, in the view of the Democrats, it is part of the special obligation owed to veterans. In some instances, we are talking about people with extremely severe injuries related to their service and they are losing a large chunk of their pension when they receive that disability payment, which is meant to be compensation. So it is long overdue for that anomaly to be addressed and removed. For that reason we support this amendment and also signal that we will continue to pursue it, as I am sure the ALP will, as other opportunities arise in this chamber.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BUDGET 2000 AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-03-21,"— Very briefly, the amendments in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Budget 2000 and Other Measures) Bill 2002 provide fairer treatment for the partner of a person receiving a periodic compensation payment. They provide for the direct recovery of debts from compensation payers and insurers where there has been an overpayment of income support pension because of the treatment of periodic compensation as ordinary income. They provide fairer treatment for income support recipients in relation to unrealisable assets under the hardship provisions of the assets test, clarify the conditions applicable to income streams under the means test and align the rounding of income support systems with that of the social security system.
With regard to the amendment moved by Senator Bishop, I wish to put on record that the issue of the disability pension being assessed as income is a matter that is under consideration by the review referred to in my earlier speech. Accordingly, the government will await the outcome of this review before considering the matter. This is not a stalling device. It is an appropriate mechanism for enabling ex-service groups and others to make submissions and for these complex issues to be considered. The government does not accept that amendment but commends the bill to the Senate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-03-21,"—I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002. This bill is the government's major initiative in family tax policy for its third term. If anything illustrates the poverty of this government's third-term agenda, it is that fact. However, the government did commit to this proposal before the election and Labor does not intend to oppose the bill. 
There are flaws in the government's approach and our amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill notes those weaknesses. The proposal is undoubtedly a poor instrument for supporting women. The bill is regressive. We sometimes use that term to mean that a proposal does not direct more assistance to those who need it more. But this bill goes much further. This bill actually directs more support to women who earned more before their child's birth. That really is extraordinary. It would be like reducing marginal rates for income tax as a person earns more. 
As a consequence of the regressive nature of this government's bill, the more a woman earned before the child's birth the more this government will assist them through the so-called baby bonus. Women who earn the same income after their child's birth are treated differently from one another. Not all Liberals think this sort of provision is a good one. I note a speech by Senator Vanstone only last week in which she said:
... I think people on lower incomes should get more help than people on higher incomes. ... I think people should get assistance based on the number of children that are dependent on them.
That was from Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone could say the same thing about the government's first child tax rebate, this so-called baby bonus. It benefits the rich more than it does people on lower income levels. It offers minimum benefits to people who earn so little that they do not pay tax and it does not give assistance based on the number of dependent children. So, on all the tests that Senator Vanstone ascribes to herself, she should be in here voting against the bill. The bill does offer specific financial benefits to a large number of women and it is consistent with the Prime Minister's undertakings during the election campaign. For that reason, Labor does not intend to oppose the bill itself. However, I stress that this bill is regressive. It is ineffective in meeting its stated objectives. It is contradictory to the claimed aim of the new tax system, of simplifying payments to families. Indeed, its complexity is such that it is likely that many women will miss out on their entitlement. I therefore move, as an amendment to the motion for the second reading: 
At the end of the motion, add:
	“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes that the Government's proposal is unfair and a poor instrument for supporting families because, even though families face similar costs in raising children, the Baby Bonus provides greater support to high income families and, as a result women earning $50,000 will receive five times more assistance than those earning $25,000; and
	(b)	further notes that in addition to being unfair, the Baby Bonus is:
	(i)	ineffective in meeting its stated objectives, because it is paid as a lump sum at the end of the financial year, not during the year when families need it;
	(ii)	contradictory to the claimed aim of the New Tax System of simplifying payments to families, because it introduces a separate rebate; and 
	(iii)	complex, and therefore it is likely that many women will miss out on their entitlement”.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-21,"—This Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002 attempts to implement a policy announced by the government in the throes of the 2001 election. Its sentiments are right in some ways. Many Australian families are under considerable pressure as more and more women enter the paid labour force and more and more households have two workers and the presence of quite young children. This makes efforts to reduce their burdens and increase their choices and indeed to improve the quality of family life an important target of government policy. My party and I entirely support such a policy intent. Unfortunately, the heat of an election campaign is not always conducive to good policy design. For this reason, I will be proposing, on behalf of the Democrats, a number of amendments to the bill in an attempt to make it more effective while also allowing evaluation of its effects and consideration of other means to improve the situation of working families, especially working mothers, on the birth of a new baby.
The baby bonus as currently structured in this bill is expensive and regressive. It gives more to a well-paid new parent of a first born who gives up her job entirely and much less to the lower paid parent who goes back to work after having a first baby. It is pitched at `first child events', in the awkward language of the bill, and households where a new parent gives up paid work. It is stretched out over five years and delivers only at the end of the tax year, through a tax refund. It does too little for those families who juggle jobs and kids, especially new babies, on a daily basis. Parents must deal every day with the pressures that the Prime Minister, as he called the election, correctly named as one of the country's greatest challenges: the pressures on working families.
There are much better policy options than this Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002 but, at the very least, the bill should be modified. The fact is that the arrival of a new baby, whether a `first child event' or a fourth, affects families significantly and immediately. These effects do not conveniently await the timing of the tax year—they hit rich and poor parents and those in between, and there are strong arguments for making any assistance closely targeted to those most in need, particularly families reliant at least in part on the income of women.
The baby bonus in this bill gives a tax refund at the end of the financial year after the birth of a first baby or, transitionally, any new baby, if you meet certain rules. Basically, the benefit ranges from a maximum tax credit of about $500 a year, if you earn less than $25,000 a year, through to a maximum of $2,500 a year, if you earn a higher income and give at least some of it up when you have a baby.
There are six main problems the Democrats see with the scheme. Firstly, the benefit is very delayed. Most mothers to whom the benefit will mainly flow will wait some months for a tax refund, when it is the weeks and months immediately after a baby's birth that are often the most financially and socially stressful. In this way, to use a poor pun, the refund is lumpy and poorly timed. Secondly, the benefit is stretched out over five years. By that time, a great number of mothers have taken up some form of paid work. It is timed to arrive a long way after the early period of new parenting, when the costs are most burdensome and when you need the greatest incentives to give full-time attention to the new arrival. Thirdly, the benefit is highly skewed. It favours mothers who give up their jobs and stay at home. Of course, such a choice deserves support. The fact is, however, that many women cannot afford to do that and have to return to work while their children are still young. Their motivations vary, but earning a living to help support their households is very important to many of them.
The baby bonus benefit is reduced by the proportion of pre-baby earnings that are earned by returning to work. It is complicated. Lifetime earnings of women are very sensitive to career breaks. That is one of the reasons why so many women go back to work or work part time after having a baby. They know that employers' perceptions about their skills deteriorate with long career breaks and that workplaces move on quickly in terms of technology and opportunities. The baby bonus swims against this labour market reality by offering an inducement that rises as new mothers distance themselves from the labour market. Many will reject this course. As a result, many will receive only minimal benefit from this bill. 
Fourthly, the benefit is much greater for those who are high earners who stay home or who go back to work part time. If you are earning the minimum wage, the highest refund you can receive is $500 a year for five years, or less than $10 a week. If you are earning more than about $53,000 and stay out of work for five years, then your refund will be $12,500 over five years, or $48 a week. To those that have shall be given. The baby bonus, as currently structured in this bill, is highly regressive. Those on higher incomes receive up to 2½ times more tax assistance.
Fifthly, the benefit is pitched at first babies. It can be argued, however, that the juggle of work and family becomes much more complicated and costly on the birth of a second or third child. It is then that many mothers decide to take time out of paid work. The participation rate of women with two children under 15 years is considerably lower than for women with one dependant. But the baby bonus will give them nothing new. It is essentially pitched at women with first babies.
Finally, and sixthly, the scheme is costly. By 2005-06, the scheme will be costing $510 million according to the explanatory memorandum. This amount would go a long way towards providing a much better, less complex scheme for all Australian mothers who take time off work when they have a baby— namely, paid maternity leave. Twelve weeks at minimum wage would cost around $5,000 per birth. This would give working women an extended break when they need it. Many low-income women return to work far more quickly than they might choose, because their families are dependent upon their income. That is not good for a small child. We think the prospect of a small tax refund at the end of the year will do little to expand their real choices. That is why most countries deal with the pressures that arise around the birth of a new baby through paid maternity leave, and not through complex tax reforms like this one that take effect over long periods at a minimal level and, in this case, only in the event of a first child event.
The International Labour Organisation recognises that the best way to support working mothers is not through a patchy system of employer provision that is costly for business, unavailable to many women and will especially disadvantage small business but through a universal system of paid maternity leave that is supported out of government revenue. That is why I propose a second reading amendment which adds a call by the Senate to the government to cease its bandaid approach to the assistance of Australian working women of child bearing age and to instead establish a national paid maternity leave scheme for all Australian working women.
It is time for us to undertake a systematic inquiry to examine and report on the best means of establishing a national paid maternity leave scheme for all Australian working women. There is common and strong support for this across all political persuasions. Such an inquiry is long overdue. It was a recommendation in the 1999 report to the National Pregnancy and Work inquiry carried out by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The report arising from that review, called Pregnant and Productive: it is a right not a privilege to work while pregnant, resulted in government action on some of its recommendations, but the government rejected its recommendation that economic modelling and analysis of possible paid maternity leave options be undertaken. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner has since indicated her intention to conduct such an inquiry of her own volition. However, it is time for the parliament to consider the way forward on this issue—hence my recommendation for an inquiry.  
There are other issues about this bill that I intend to take up through amendment. These deal with increasing the minimum payment from $500 to $1,000 a year to women or those eligible on lower incomes or outside the workforce; decreasing the maximum payment from $2,500 to $1,500 a year for women or those eligible on higher incomes; making the payment payable over three years after a child event rather than over the five years stipulated in the bill; and reviewing the operation of the scheme and its effects and whom it has assisted after three years.
The effect of these changes is to load the refund up into the early years after a new baby is born, rather than to stretch the benefit out over five years. It is to increase the benefit for women on lower incomes and to cap it at a lower level for higher income women. The outcome of these changes for women earning less than $25,000 a year will be to refund them a total amount of $3,000 over three years, instead of $2,500 over five years. The budget implications of these changes will be to bring forward the financial effects of the measure into earlier years, to shorten the period of refund for households and to redistribute the benefits in a fairer way.
The final budgetary effects of these amendments are difficult to calculate. I understand that the government has undertaken some modelling of the possible impact to the scheme set out in this bill. In fact, in the absence of relevant ATO or ABS data about key issues like characteristics of children and income data, even the government's calculations are somewhat rubbery. I regret the fact that the parliamentary sitting schedule and the government's determination to have this bill dealt with like this today mean that these amendments have not been costed by economic modelling even of the rubbery kind that might be available. However, the effect of these amendments will be to reduce the years in which the refund can be claimed, while increasing the amount available to those most in need and reducing it for the more well-off. These changes will have a balancing effect. My amendments will have the effect of changing the timing of payments, increasing the sums available to lower income women and limiting those for upper level income women. For the great majority of women having a first child, these amendments would mean a refund of $1,000 a year for three years, which is much better than that available through the current bill.
Many Australian women want to spend time with their young children. However, the Howard government should set aside its hope that women will stay at home in response to a small tax refund. Many will not do so, because they need more substantial income support, specifically around the birth of a child, in order to exercise real choices about juggling work and family. That is why the Democrats response to this bill is to attempt to increase the immediate benefit to women and new babies, especially those on lower incomes, by increasing the minimum payment and loading the benefit up closer to the birth of a baby. Beyond this, we want to see a response that takes on a long overdue and more comprehensive and significant reform: a national paid maternity leave scheme. It may be too late for this budget round, but by next year we want to see the parliament consider a practical national approach that will assist Australian businesses to make the most of their women employees, while giving families coping with new babies what they most need—an extended paid period of leave for a mother for the time immediately after the birth of a baby. I foreshadow that I will be making a second reading amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-03-21,"—I seek leave to incorporate Senator Collins's speech in this debate in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Today I want to focus on the government's unfair, but much promoted, support for families in the 21st century. While the opposition does not wish to hold up this Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002, it is important that it is examined and that the Australian people are made aware of what is really occurring.
I am personally appalled that we have lost this opportunity to give Australian families something better than what we have before us today. I note that a second reading amendment in the other place summed up much that is wrong with this bill. It condemned the baby bonus as: unfair and a poor instrument for supporting families; ineffective in its timing of assistance to families; contradictory to the claimed aim of the new tax system of simplifying payments to families; and complex, creating confusion in the general population. The word `unfair' is an apt description of the government's big family initiative of its third term agenda. Few Australian families will receive any benefit from this initiative, and fewer still will come close to receiving the $2,500 benefit per year that has been heavily promoted. In an era when families face enormous challenges and strains, the protection provided by the baby bonus is very limited. 
As was highlighted in the other place, Labor's analysis indicates that in the first year of operation of the baby bonus just 12,500 families—half a per cent of all Australian families—would receive the full bonus of $2,500. This is in contrast to the ninety per cent, or 2.5 million, of families with children who would get nothing. Of the remaining 10 per cent who got something, more than half would receive $500 or less. The unfairness of the bill is highlighted in its very operation. The bill provides a tax rebate for a mother following the birth of her first child. Over a five-year period, mothers can claim annually the tax paid on their income in the year prior to the birth of the child, up to a maximum of $2,500 per annum. The amount due is calculated by comparing the mother's taxable income in the year prior to the birth of the first child with her taxable income in the year that she is claiming. As such, the bigger the loss in the woman's income, the greater the tax rebate: in other words, this is regressive in nature, allowing a greater burden to rest on those who can least afford it. To illustrate the point, if a woman is earning under $25,000 before the birth of her first child, she will receive $500. However, a woman who earns over $50,000 prior to the birth of her child will be entitled to a rebate of $2,500. A person who is on twice the income is able to claim five times as much benefit under the government's bill. A person who is able to financially cope more with the birth of a child is able to receive government assistance of five times greater value than that received by the woman who is on a low income.
I must admit that this regressive payment is hardly surprising from this government, given the unreasonable hardship that has been wrought on Australian families through the administration of the family benefits payment system in the last few years. The opposition pointed out with that initiative that we could do better and that there would be problems, and the same warning is now being sounded about the baby bonus.
I do not believe it is just the senators on the opposition side who realise the flaws in this bill. I was heartened by a touch of sanity from Senator Vanstone on the government benches last week during question time. The Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Vanstone was answering a question from Senator Harradine on how to support families through the tax system. In her answer, she said:
“I support that element of the policy because I think people on lower incomes should get more help than people on higher incomes.”
Senator Vanstone was able to see the excellent civic principle that those in greater need should be able to receive greater assistance from the government. Obviously, Senator Vanstone's sound thinking was not recognised in the cabinet room in regard to the matter before us today, but I would enjoy listening to her in this place expanding her thoughts on how to better target family support. Perhaps Minister Vanstone could tell us who developed this silly policy? If it was not her or the Department of Family and Community Services, as discovered in estimates, who was it? It could not have been the Federal Commissioner for Sex Discrimination, Ms Pru Goward: her recent contribution on the need for paid maternity leave as a way to advance women highlights her priorities.
I lamented earlier the lost opportunity the government has delivered us. Easily, the greatest opportunity was the simple increasing of the maternity allowance to equate to 12 to 14 weeks minimum income support or paid maternity leave. Labor introduced the maternity allowance in 1995 as a step towards meeting ILO standards on paid maternity leave. At the time, it was equivalent to six weeks minimum income support in social security. It would have been quite logical to ensure that all Australian families were extended a better targeted and more equitable benefit. The maternity allowance is made when a child is born, the time when the family needs the extra support.
I raise this initiative in the light of the fact that Australia has a woeful record on providing paid maternity leave. In fact, Australia and the United States are the only industrialised nations that have not implemented the ILO convention of a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave not tested by length of service. The government would write off any increase in the maternity allowance as too costly and put it in the `too hard basket.' However, the cost of the baby bonus program in 2005-06, when the program is in near full operation, is projected to be $510 million. Given that the current annual maternity allowances expenditure is $202 million, there is ample scope for increasing the benefit. Such an initiative would also fit with the government's objective of keeping the tax system as simple as possible. The baby bonus, in all the complexity of its operation, simply adds more confusion to the whole family allowance and taxation arena. I note that others are also backing the concept of introducing paid maternity leave. It has been suggested that 12 weeks paid leave would cost $300 million a year, giving a woman the equivalent of the basic wage, which is about $413 per week. 
On top of the need to support families better, the baby bonus bill could have negative side effects. The bill creates an incentive for women to work as hard as possible in the year before they give birth to a child. Women could push themselves to work harder, take on more responsibilities or work longer hours through overtime and the like, in order to increase their taxable income. This is not an appropriate incentive for pregnant women's health! It has also been suggested that in extreme situations women could even delay children in order to get further up the corporate ladder. Such an incentive is in direct contradiction to the stated aim of the bill.
Finally, it needs to be said that the baby bonus is not just inequitable. Not only are there better options, not only could there be side effects, but the government has put a flawed solution to a very critical national problem. Australia's birth rate has fallen to 1.75, not enough to replenish our current population level. There are many factors contributing to this dangerous situation; but the decline in our nation's birth rate can be linked to the government's failure to develop a better work and family life balance. Other countries have realised that their future depends on better balancing work and family life for all the population, not just a select few. It is vital that we get our mix of government support for families right, and half-baked policies created by a government on the run in the heat of an election will not secure our national future.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-03-21,"—The government's intention was very good when it announced this scheme as part of its election campaign, but there are a number of problems with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002. I know we are running out of time, so I will cut down my speech and just give you a couple of examples to illustrate the problems. One example is that of two people whose financial commitments require them to return to work after leaving to have a baby. One earns $30,000 a year and the other earns $60,000 a year. If they both return to work on the same salary of $30,000 after having a baby, the one who was previously on a higher salary of $60,000 will continue to receive half the baby bonus—that is to say $1,250—whilst the other receives nothing.
In case A, the working woman on an annual salary of $60,000 has a child on 1 July 2002. She can claim a baby bonus of $2,500, which is paid over a period of five years. She can return to work and earn $30,000, but still receive half the baby bonus. In case B, the working woman on an annual salary of $30,000 who also has a child on 1 July 2002—exactly the same day—can claim a baby bonus of $1,076 paid over a period of five years. She can return to work and earn the same salary as before—$30,000—and she will receive no baby bonus at all. That seems to me an example of the unequal treatment of two women whose circumstances I have described.
Whilst the legislation is a step in the right direction to assist families who have more children, it neither addresses adequately the costs involved in parenting nor provides any significant assistance to ensure women do have a real freedom of choice in this area. I am inclined to support policy suggestions such as those of Women's Action Alliance, which favours an inclusive system, rather than what they have called a divisive haves and have nots arrangement such as this legislation seems to present. In a letter to the Canberra Times of 8 March 2002, the alliance wrote:
The Government has made a pre-election commitment to a substantial first-child tax rebate in addition to the current maternity allowance of $980. Women's Action Alliance believes that where taxpayers' funds are used to assist mothers at the time of birth an inclusive system is required rather than a divisive `haves and have nots' arrangement. 
The two benefits should be rolled into one substantial maternity allowance to all mothers irrespective of their paid workforce status before and after the birth.
We salute those strong women who went before us and we pledge ourselves to continue their work.
On that note, I will conclude my contribution. I hope that the government may take a number of these matters on board for the May budget. I indicate that I have been advised by the Treasurer's office that, if this bill does not go through this week, there will be substantial problems with regard to the administration of this in the Taxpack and the like.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-03-21,"—I have some information for Senator Crowley relating to an Australian Taxation Office ruling, and if I need to update this information I will. On 28 November last year the ATO issued draft GST ruling GSTR 2001/D7 on prizes. The draft ruling explains how the GST law applies to providers and recipients of prizes. The draft ruling explains `when a prize is a taxable supply made by the provider and when it is consideration for a supply made by the recipient of the prize'. Clubs, businesses and fundraising bodies should not encounter anomalies if they apply the principles and follow the examples set out in the draft ruling. They should not face an added GST compliance burden as a result. The draft ruling explains the commissioner's view of the law as it applied from 1 July 2000. Clubs and businesses need to account for all taxable supplies they have made since that date. The ruling provides the commissioner's preliminary, though considered, position in relation to GST on prizes. The commissioner will be engaging in further industry consultation and will take into account all of the submissions received prior to the final ruling.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Rulings</title>,Questions Without Notice,36,1

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-21,"—I will be brief. The purpose of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 is to amend various parts of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the ITAA 1997 to provide benefits for the plantation forestry sector. It has two major effects. It allows for immediate deductions for some prepaid expenditures when invested in a plantation forestry managed agreement and it amends the non-commercial loss rules specifically at the commissioner's discretion. Those amendments will allow the commissioner's discretion to be exercised for all relevant years where it is consistent with the nature of the business. Long-time horizons and sporadic revenue flows in the plantation industry raise difficulties when applying the existing non-commercial loss rules to the forestry industry. 
As senators will know, particularly those who went through the agonising saga of the mass marketed tax investment schemes, forestry plantations have figured in very controversial interchanges with the tax office. The difficulty with that is both the good and the bad get mixed up with the indifferent and you have a view that this is an industry which is less attractive than it might otherwise be. We should all recognise—and the Democrats do—plantation forests have a major part to play in the provision of a much needed natural resource in this country. Accordingly, we do not have any intention of opposing the bill. We will seek, though, to amend it, and I will address that in committee.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-03-21,"—I asked a question the other day with regards to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and its financial impact. The minister at the time indicated she would be prepared to organise a briefing for me. In fact, I just received a call from her office advising me they had a briefing written for me and that they would bring it around or email it. I have asked them to bring it around and I hope I will get it before I finish. I am rather interested in the costings, but I will deal more fully with those in the committee stage of the bill.
With regard to what is proposed in the bill, in essence, I support it. I think there are some significant equity problems associated with what is proposed in the bill that specify treatment for one particular aspect of agribusiness. I think that raises some questions with regard to competition principles and, as I said, it does raise some serious questions about the equitable taxation treatment of different industries. I know other industries receive some different treatment in respect of taxation application but I think this poses a very serious problem. A number of other industries in the agribusiness sector have the same or similar problems the forest plantation industry have with regard to the taxation arrangements under the 13-month rule. That is another area that needs to be addressed.
The plantation industry per se is a very critical industry. Right now, it is in a mess. We had a process in place arising out of the National Forest Policy Statement, which was developed under the previous Labor government. The process set down, if you like, a broad agenda and an objective to achieve by the year 2020 some 3 million hectares of forest plantations. As a part of that, there were to be tax incentives, if you like. Taxation treatments would be arranged to encourage investment through tax incentives provided to potential investors. In the first and second years of the release of the 2020 vision strategy that went forward in leaps and bounds. For all of us who may look at it from a prima facie point of view, we would say, `What an extremely successful outcome. This has been an enormously successful process.' But the problem is that, yes, we have had several hundreds of thousands of hectares planted with trees but getting those trees in the ground has been at significant taxpayer expense. Why is that the case?  
Senator Murray alluded to an inquiry I chaired—the Senate Economics References Committee into the mass marketed tax effective schemes—which, in part, touched on the plantation taxation issue. What was interesting to me was the Taxation Office evidence to the committee. I questioned them with regard to the fees and charges being applied to investors for the development of plantations. My research suggests that the average cost to an investor through a prospectus company on a per hectare basis for an investment in forestry plantations is around $7,000 per hectare. The members of the committee know from evidence presented to us, from the industry and from others, that the cost of the establishment of a blue gum plantation, for instance, is somewhere between—and this depends on the hectares you plant—$900 and $2,500. 
There has been significant concern for a long time about the amount of money that is not going into onground or business activity in respect of forestry plantations—and not just forestry plantations but a whole range of agribusiness industries. In focusing on the plantation sector and the tax office's evidence that I was referring to, I asked them what they believed was a fair cost for the establishment of a blue gum plantation— indeed, I asked this question with regard to vineyards and viticulture et cetera—and they said they worked on bands which ranged in price. I think for blue gums it was between $6,000 and $20,000 per hectare. For Polonia, which is a fast-growing Chinese wood, it was $20,000 to $60,000 per hectare and for pines, it was $4,000 to $8,400 people hectare. I think it was a Mr Oliver from the tax office who said in evidence at the time that for viticulture, for instance, it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
What worries me about this—and I have raised these questions previously with the tax office and I have not been given a satisfactory answer—is that the taxpayers of this country are in effect funding these developments. I have no complaint about that—in fact, I support that because this type of approach can and should be a very good process, but right now it is not. Let me refer to the words of the Treasurer on 14 February 1997, when the government moved to end what was considered to be a rorting of the infrastructure bonds investment program, which was a part of government policy. I do not have the words in front of me so I cannot quote them but the Treasurer said something like, `This is not a good use of taxpayers' money'. What was happening in the infrastructure bonds investment program was that people were claiming significant tax deductions but the real money that was going into the developments was only a small amount.
That is what is happening in the plantation sector, because a lot of the prospectus companies have people managing them that have had no historical association with the timber industry. They are charging very high upfront fees and charges, some as high as almost $10,000 per hectare for something that might cost as little as $900 per hectare. The money is being taken out of the system. There is one very good example of what happens when you cream significant profits off the top: Australian plantation timber. That is an example of where things have gone wrong. Companies have been put into voluntary administration and have remained there, simply because of the practice of not leaving enough money in the process to properly manage the plantations. We have seen the share prices of most of the prospectus companies—except one—that are significantly involved in this process plummet. You ask yourself why, and people say, `It was because of the action taken by the tax office on mass marketed schemes.' Yes, that may have had some impact, but I do not think that had the most significant impact. 
These prospectus companies advertise that the hectare plantings that they put in of blue gums or other species of eucalypts, for instance, are going to yield around 300 cubic metres—300 tonnes—per hectare after a 10- or 11-year rotation period. But the reality is that is not going to be the case. We already know, where harvesting has commenced in Western Australia, that the yield from the plantations is between 40 and 60 per cent less than what was projected. We know, from the relevant state authorities and from the CSIRO, that the scientific work that has been done shows that you can only achieve those sorts of growth rates and that sort of yield in extremely good conditions: (1) you need very high quality soils, (2) you need rainfall in excess of 800 mm per annum and (3) you need to make sure that you have very well managed plantations in terms of weeds, pests et cetera. But if you look around at the plantations within Australia today—and I have visited a significant number of them— there are real problems with regard to the management practices. In my own state a company known as Forest Enterprises Australia has around 18,000 hectares of plantations under management but most of those plantations are in very poor condition. They are overgrown with weeds, they have bad insect infestation and there is no way that those plantations are going to deliver anything like 300 cubic metres per hectare at the end of the rotation. 
Let us translate that into the revenue side. We have got the government coming forward with a bill that says that the revenue cost is $25 million, and what is interesting is that the explanatory memorandum says this:
The cost to the revenue resulting from the prepayment measure is estimated to be $25 million in 2002-03, $5 million in 2003-04, nil in 2004-05 and $25 million in 2005-06 and each year thereafter.
As I said during question time, if you just take the amount of money that will go into the plantation sector alone this financial year, you cannot get $25 million.
I have just received a one-page brief from the minister. I have not had the chance to read it fully. I might leave that for when we go into the committee stage. It is not just important from a revenue point of view, but one of the reasons that I have proposed we have an inquiry into the plantation sector through a select committee of this chamber was the problems that are currently associated with the industry. There is no strategy here—no long-term strategy for downstream processing in this country, no real long-term strategy for import replacement from these plantations and, I have to say, no real long-term strategy for plantations to become a resource replacement for harvesting in significant areas of native forest. If we do not do something about this, regardless of whether there is a state election coming up in Tasmania, regardless of the view of the Victorian government, regardless of the view of the New South Wales government or anything else, we will be abrogating our responsibilities in this chamber.
I listen to and have conversations with the opposition, the Democrats, Senator Brown, Senator Harris and Senator Harradine about the issues that clearly exist in respect of the plantation industry. We do need to do something about them within the next five years. You can say, `That's a long time; we have still got five years to do something.' But this thing is going to fall over and in the next few years we will see a continuation of a very bad result, because taxpayers' dollars are being invested to the tune of making a few people rich and delivering a very poor outcome. That is what is happening right now, and the sooner the government and the opposition realise that the better, because we might then take a few steps towards actually addressing the problems of this industry. It is important that we do something about it. 
I get people ringing me up—I wish I could put their names on the record but I will not because I want to make sure that they are protected—from within the industry, people who operate woodchip mills, and they say to me, `You're on the right track. This industry needs to be sorted out because if we don't do something about it we're going to have a real problem.' That is from people within the industry. I get companies involved in the plantation sector saying to me, `Yes, you're right, there are problems with this industry. We do need to tighten it up. We do need to take steps to bring it into line.' The evidence of yields and returns is there for the government and the opposition to consider—and not just returns to the investors but returns to the Commonwealth. The former Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey, talked about a seven per cent net return to the Commonwealth. In a pig's ear! That is just not possible. Then he directed his department to try and come up with some figures. They were all over the shop. We had them analysed by external financial analysts, and they said they just could not comprehend how AFFA could get it so wrong. I will deal with this a bit more when we get to the committee stage. I will now take the opportunity to read this very short brief. We will see how the government responds when we get into questions during the committee stage. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-21,"—The Greens oppose the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. It is really a huge further injection of funds, misdirected funds, into an industry which is being badly managed from federal government level right to the forest floor or the plantation establishment. Generally, as you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the prevailing tax deductible situation is that you get the tax deduction for the year in which the investment is actually made and the work done. This will allow a tax deduction where money is put into plantations but the work is not carried out until after that. What is more, the tax concession applies only to trees that are planted in order to be cut down. We should have moved way beyond that to where, if people invest in putting trees in for the benefit of the nation to re-create shade belts or to take carbon out of the atmosphere—the much touted carbon banks—so that they are in the national service, people should get a deduction for that. But no, this last-century view prevails: if you are not chopping the trees down, you are not treating them as goods. That blighted thinking is written large in this piece of legislation. The government says that this will cost $25 million or so each year, but it will not. The concession actually means—and I think Senator Murphy is absolutely right on this—$100 million to $125 million a year. The cost of the plantation establishment alone is about $5,000 per hectare. An investor on the top marginal tax rate of 48½ per cent can claim that as a tax deduction. The Treasurer estimates an extra 50,000 hectares of plantations will be planted because of the concession. If you multiply 50,000 by $2,500, you come up with $125 million per annum. That is that.
There is no doubt that this legislation will accelerate the clearing of native vegetation. We have seen that, consistent with the changes in tax arrangements in recent years. Make the tax arrangements better and the rate of native vegetation and loss of the environmental amenity increases, and vice versa. In Tasmania 5,320 hectares of native vegetation on private land were cleared and replaced with plantations in the year 2000-01, according to the Forest Practices Board annual report. There are no effective clearing controls in Tasmania. In that state the government's approach to vegetation loss was described by yesterday's Australia State of the Environment 2001 report, as you will have noticed, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, as `grossly inadequate'. Elsewhere in Australia clearing of remnant vegetation and old hollow trees which are the stronghold and nesting places of a big range of Australian wildlife continues where plantations are established. In other words, plantations destroy the crucible, the cradle, of the Australian wildlife system. The hollows that so many birds, bats and marsupials depend upon are simply planned not to ever happen again because the plantations get cut before the trees get to the age at which those hollows form. This legislation will accelerate the loss of that public amenity.
The legislation will also create huge heartache in traditional farming lands like in Tasmania. We are getting food lands—dairy farms, potato cropping farms, beef and lamb grazing farmlands—converted into plantations. Is that because there is a demand for the wood? No, it is not. Millions of tonnes of that are being exported each year. Is it because it is good for the community? No, you cannot eat trees. Why is it? There is a tax deduction there. It is simply a financial gain. There is an absence of an ethic in the plantation industry as it exists at the moment and this legislation, no doubt at the behest of those people who have made pots out of it, will simply compound the problem. These tax concessions, as I have said, only apply to trees which are planted in order to be cut down. Any claimed environmental benefits are illusory and at best they are temporary. There is no equivalent general tax concession for planting trees to restore the environment, as I see it. What a greater benefit it would be if the government were putting $125 million a year into the environment, as called for by yesterday's State of the Environment report.  
Importantly, this is one of the few situations where an environmental assessment of a Commonwealth action is required under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It can be done either by the Treasurer now—and the Greens have amendments to help the Treasurer do that— or by the Commissioner of Taxation for each product ruling later. But one way or another it is required under the EPBC Act. I would advise the minister to look very carefully at that act and he will see that that requirement is there. A product ruling, if it is left to that, is the determination that a particular plantation investment prospectus meets the conditions and qualifies for the tax concession. The EPBC Act does not require environmental assessment of actions by the Commonwealth that constitute an authorisation or a grant, but the provision of a tax concession does not fall within these exemptions and therefore requires assessment. I hope the minister is listening to that.
In summary, we do not need any more plantations. We are now exporting six to eight million tonnes of unprocessed wood each year, largely for the job and economic benefit of somebody overseas, and over a million tonnes of that is sawlogs. The plantations are not required. We have over two million hectares of them already in this country, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President. We do not need them to meet our wood needs in this country. This is simply a moneymaking arrangement. Effectively, this legislation is saying that taxpayers will be part of the profit bottom line. That is what it is saying. I have a second reading amendment. I move:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
		“further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the first day after approval is obtained for the taxation arrangements proposed by the bill, in accordance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999”.
I have already explained that. There is a requirement by law there. If it is not done now by the Treasurer in general because of the impact of this financial assistance to this industry, which is having a very clear impact on the environment, it will have to be done case by case according to the product rulings of the taxation commissioner. I would be very interested to hear what the government has to say about that. I raise the matter because it appears today that it has not dawned on the government that that requirement is there.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-21,"—I thank the senators who have made a contribution to this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I want to briefly refer to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Brown. The government will not be supporting that. I am advised that it is not necessary. This legislation has been in the wind for a long time: it was part of the coalition's election commitment and it was widely known as part of the Labor Party's election commitment as well. If Senator Brown were serious about this particular issue, then he would have raised it before five minutes ago—which is when I first saw it. I understand everyone else also saw the proposed amendment by Senator Brown for the first time five minutes ago.
I do not say many positive things about Senator Brown but at least you can give him credit for being committed to a course of action that will not have any forest activity within Australia at all, whether it is plantation or native forests. Mark my words: the goalposts will keep shifting so far as Senator Brown is concerned. Everyone will recall that during the RFA debate Senator Brown said plantations were good. I am not quoting him there, but the implication of his arguments was that we should not bother with the RFA because we have got enough plantations, plantations are good and that is the way that Australia should be going. Senator Brown now wants to hold this bill up and divert it. He knows full well that if it is not passed today then it will have a major impact upon the plantation investments in this country for next year and, I suggest, years to come. The government will not support that. 
I want to refer to the amendments proposed by the Labor Party for the benefit of the opposition. Although these are committee stage amendments, we disagree with all of them, as the opposition knows. Proposed amendment (3) actually deals with the non-commercial activities of the bill. Unfortunately, we have only just seen your amendments in writing in the last 10 minutes, although we are familiar with the fact that you were going to move some in relation to a sunset clause. My advice is that the sunset clause should not apply to the non-commercial losses amendment. The non-commercial losses apply more generally than to just forestry specific areas. The amendment is technical in nature, designed to address an unintended limitation on the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to provide relief for lost deferral rules. If it will assist the chamber and the opposition in particular, I will make some taxation officials available to your advisers to explain just why your amendment (3) should not proceed. We do not think that amendments (1), (2), (3) or (4) should proceed but, even if you were able to carry the day on the sunset clause issue, subclause (3) will have an enormous impact on the non-commercial losses area, whereas your committee amendments focus on forestry. Proposed amendment (3) deals with the whole non-commercial losses which, as you are aware, extend far beyond the forestry arena. So, if your advisers are interested in talking to the taxation officers, I am quite happy to make them available. It is important that we do not inadvertently cause problems for everybody that will have to be amended at a later stage.
We do not support the sunset clause amendment that will be moved in committee—as Senator Conroy mentioned in his second reading speech—because we think it is bad for the industry. The whole purpose of this industry is to encourage plantation forestry. We have had a major success for forestry investment this week—and I include the Labor Party and the Independent senators—with the passing of the RFA Bill. The whole purpose of the RFA Bill was that it gave certainty and security and assured conservation values in the native forest areas. It was all about providing certainty.
This bill intends to correct an inadvertent error that I have to say with some hesitation, or with some humbleness, the government made in some amendments it put through a couple of years ago. What we want to do is reinstate the investment enhancement for plantation forests. It is not a big investment enhancement because it is simply agronomically related rather than taxationally related. It relates to the fact that the money required for plantation work must be paid at one time but the actual expenditure does not happen until the next year. Trees, stupid as they are, do not understand financial years. They do not understand that human beings and the laws of the land have changed the situation so that, rather than looking at a growing season, we look at a fixed period of 365 days from 1 June. The bill is all about putting certainty back into the industry, assuring investors that they can get the full deduction for their investment. I remind you that they would get the deduction for the investment in any case, but they would get it in a different year. What we want to do is reinstate the deduction provisions that were in the act previously and were inadvertently taken out.
The sunset clause provides uncertainty for the industry, rather than certainty. It is certainty we want. We cannot just say that we will do something for four years, then have a look at it to see if it is working and, if the government and the parliament of the day think it is not working, we can cut it off. That does not provide the certainty we need. I would urge the opposition and the Democrats to consider what the purpose of this bill is. It is to correct an `error', some legislative enactment the government did a couple of years back which had unintended consequences. It reinstates the position. It is providing that absolutely necessary certainty for the industry so that it can provide for Australia's future in wood and for Australia's benefit in the jobs that it creates and the activity that it creates in small country towns. 
We have a $2 billion trade deficit in wood and wood products. A lot of that deficit comes from forests that are far less sustainably managed than are Australia's forests. Australia has one of the best records in the world for sustainable forest management, both with native forests and with plantation forests, and it is getting better. We have a $2 billion trade deficit. What we want to do by encouraging forestry activities, and particularly on this World Forestry Day, is to provide that certainty for investment, which really means jobs—jobs in rural and regional Australia—and security for those small country towns. 
I have been given a note by my advisers that the Manager of Government Business wants me to hurry up. That is going to be difficult, seeing as there are quite a number of amendments before the chamber which are going to take time.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I am being gagged, but I do seriously say to the Democrats: please understand what this is all about. Senator Murray, I have your amendment. 
—I thought I said Senator Murray. If I said Senator Brown, I meant Senator Murray. I did say Senator Murray. I am not quite sure what you are on about, Senator Conroy. Obviously, it has been a long week. I know you have a very important dinner tonight—and perhaps you are encouraging Senator Campbell to get me to shut up. Senator Murray, please have a look at this. I do not quite follow your amendment, but no doubt you will explain it in the committee stage. Again, what we really want to do is to provide certainty. 
The bill contains two tax measures. One is an amendment to the prepayment rule which requires deductions for prepayments to be apportioned over the period in which the related expenditure occurs. Relaxing the prepayments rule for the forestry industry should particularly stimulate investment in the plantation forestry managed investments industry. The seasonally dependent nature of aspects of the forestry operation, such as planting, requires that funds are raised in one year to pay for activities in the continuing year. That is the point I made. Stupidly, trees do not understand that 1 July is a cut-off. They grow in their time, and they have to be supported with work and tending during the growing period, regardless of where that period falls in an artificially created taxation year. By doing what we propose, the government supports the 2020 vision target to treble the plantation estate to three million hectares by 2020.
The national forestry policy statement of 1992 aims to expand Australia's commercial plantations to provide an additional economical, reliable and high quality wood resource for the industry. The measures arise from direct consultation with representatives from the plantation timber industry. Industry representatives have indicated that they fully support the measure in its current form. They are particularly grateful to the government and to the Senate for the fact that we have been able to get this bill into the parliament and through the House of Representatives by this particular period of the year. 
The other measures affect non-commercial taxation losses. I will not go into them. All senators are well aware, from the explanatory memorandum, what that is all about. This bill does address all of the problems that have been identified, by allowing the commissioner to continue to exercise discretion for those non-commercial losses for all relevant years where this is consistent with the nature of the business activity.
I do again urge support for this in its current form. We are somewhat surprised by the Labor Party's suggestion for a sunset clause. We note—and I have mentioned this, but emphasise—that prior to the election the Labor Party did express support for the passage of this legislation to give effect to what was described as a new prepayment option for the forest industry. The sunset clause would very heavily qualify that support by making it temporary, at best, and by denying the industry the certainty it needs to make long-term planning decisions. 
I note that Mr Latham, in the other place, suggested that there might be better options for helping the plantation forest industry to maintain its long-term growth. If Mr Latham or any of the senators have an idea on that, we would like those options to be put on the table. As I indicated in the other debate on forestry matters in these sittings, I am always open to good initiatives. If there are other ways we can help to achieve the goal that I know the Independents, the Labor Party and certainly the Liberal Party and National parties have for the forestry industry and for those jobs and the small communities that rely on them, I am very happy to work in a cooperative way with all parties to get the right results. As I have mentioned also previously, this is not a political debate. It is not about scoring political points; it is about doing the right thing for the industry, which means jobs for Australians and security for the small country towns.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-03-21,"—I was going to present a full speech on the Quarantine Amendment Bill 2002— there are quite a lot of things to say—but I am mindful of the time and the progress we are making. In relation to amendments which have been circulated, I will make contributions on those in the committee stage and seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading debate.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
This Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives only last Thursday.
A draft of the Bill and a short briefing note was provided to me prior to its introduction.
The Minister also offered me a briefing on the legislation. The first opportunity for that briefing was on Tuesday 19 March.
While simple in its form this is an important piece of legislation that should be given proper consideration by this parliament.
The timetable the Government is working to is unacceptable to the Opposition.
As I said the Bill was only introduced into the other place last Thursday.
We are now debating this Bill today just seven days later.
The Government then told us it wanted the Bill treated as non-controversial legislation in this place with both its introduction and passage before question time today.
That is not good government.
This Bill provides for the Minister, following the Governor-General's declaration by proclamation, to provide authority to exercise coordinated response powers to deal with an epidemic, or the danger of an epidemic, which has the potential to affect a primary industry of national significance.
It also amends the scope of quarantine to put beyond doubt that quarantine measures extend to the destruction of animals, plants or other goods or things and the destruction of premises.
The Bill also extends to a range of matters for which the Commonwealth may enter into arrangements with the States and Territories.
It also creates a new offence for commercial smuggling that will carry a maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment and/or 2000 penalty units for individuals and 10,000 penalty units for corporations.
And it makes some technical adjustments to the existing illegal importation and removal offences in the Quarantine Act 1908 in accordance with the Criminal Code 1995.
The Council of Australian Governments agreed in June 2001 to the need for continued high priority review and revision of national whole of government frameworks in relation to a major emergency animal disease outbreak such as foot and mouth disease.
As part of that process the Commonwealth, the States, the Territories and industry have been reviewing these frameworks and legislation in relation to the necessary powers to ensure rapid, effective and nationally consistent response measures.
As animal production and health issues are regarded as the responsibility of the States and Territories, it is predominantly State and Territory animal health Acts which will be utilised in the event of an emergency.
However, any such response will require consistency of approach by the States, Territories and the Commonwealth. 
This Bill will amend the Act to provide for the Commonwealth to authorise State and Territory agencies to take necessary actions under Commonwealth quarantine powers known as coordinated response powers.
The coordinated response powers will allow the Minister to authorise persons who are the executive heads of national response agencies to give such directions and take such action as the persons think necessary to control, eradicate or remove the danger of the epidemic by quarantine measures or measures incidental to quarantine.
On the face of it those are wide ranging powers that require careful consideration by this parliament.
According to the Government these are not powers to be imposed on the States and Territories but rather the provision of additional powers to them, if and when they are considered necessary.
According to the Government the guidelines are yet to be formulated by the States, Territories and the Commonwealth to provide processes by which the powers provided in this Bill are to be utilised.
The manner in which this legislation is to operate—that is the shifting of certain powers from the Commonwealth to the states and territories— is therefore yet to be determined.
That detail must be an essential part of the consideration of these proposed new arrangements but we are being asked to tick this off sight unseen.
According to the Government the states and the territories support the amendments.
The important questions for the states and the territories are do they agree on guidelines to be followed in the application of this new power.
That is a question that cannot be answered because negotiations on these guidelines have not yet actually commenced.
The Bill also raises a number of important issues relating to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States that may have implications beyond the management of an animal disease outbreak.
Labor supported the Bill in the other place and will support it in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-21,"—The very important amendment that the Greens will be putting to this legislation is to ensure that the ecological as well as the economic component of threat to the nation is taken into account. The Quarantine Amendment Bill 2002 is an important piece of legislation. Effectively, it is to bring into play national emergency measures where a primary industry is threatened by some form of pathogen coming from outside. One just has to think of the cane toad—which was deliberately brought to Australia and is now invading Kakadu and heading for Darwin— to see how important it is that we stop that process at the outset, or indeed the present huge crisis in Tasmania with, it appears, the deliberate introduction of foxes. We have to look beyond primary industry to our ecological systems, and the Greens amendments do that. They do not detract from this legislation; they add to it. They add an enormously important national component of responsibility by saying that, where an ecological community of national significance is threatened by some imported pest, we will take emergency action to stop it. Ultimately, that is good economic as well as good environmental sense and I recommend those amendments to all members of the chamber.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2002-03-21,"—I wish to express, in the second reading stage, some concerns relating to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. This is a very good example of a bill that should not be rushed, but as we all know it is certainly being rushed through. It was exempted from the cut-off and is now being put through in a manner and in a space of time in which we are unable to put it through a full committee process. It is a relatively simple piece of legislation but one that requires full consideration, given its nature. It allows the government to simply determine what is a potential threat to Australia is and then, basically, circumvent the Therapeutic Goods Act by not putting materials or goods through the normal processes if the government decides they are necessary to respond to a potential threat.
The Minister for Health and Ageing can basically do what she—or perhaps in the future he—likes. She can impose time limits and revoke exemptions. All sorts of decisions can be made. The bill gives the minister enormous power. There is no disallowable instrument. Hence, I will be moving some amendments in the committee stage to try to get to a situation where at least there is some parliamentary examination of what the government is planning to do. If there had been a proper committee process, quite a number of organisations would have liked to have discussed with government the types of goods they imagine would need to be rushed through to either be imported or manufactured here—goods that should not go through the normal therapeutic goods processes. We are short of time to even discuss the bill in this chamber, but I will foreshadow some questions, if I may, to the parliamentary secretary and ask for some examples of what exactly the government foresees as a potential threat and some examples of the sorts of material the government thinks would not need to go through the therapeutic goods processes at all.
It certainly is a major cause for concern for us. We understand that the government has an arrangement or has done a deal or whatever with the Labor Party so that the Democrat amendments will not be supported and the powers of the minister will simply be ticked off. I understand the government also has an agreement with the ALP relating to the power of disallowance regarding stockpiling of these hazardous or dangerous goods that have bypassed the processes. I wait with interest to hear the explanation for that.
I really must stress that the Democrats believe that the minister must be accountable to parliament, and he or she will not be. Other than making parliament aware of an exemption, we are not even going to be told exactly what it is. While I understand there are some security concerns in this matter, surely we are able to have a far clearer indication of the sorts of events that have at least precipitated this sort of action. 
In circumstances where there is an ongoing emergency situation and where the threat to public health continues well after that, it may well be appropriate that the Senate and, indeed, the parliament of Australia are involved in ongoing decisions of this nature. But there will be none of that, other than the disallowance motion on actual storage. We are simply not going to be able to respond appropriately.
I will close by saying that this is a very powerful means of putting goods that are potentially dangerous into the Australian community. People in the community, whether they are in the environment movement or the health sector, have not had the opportunity to fully examine what this actually means.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-03-21,"—The Labor opposition supports the bill, and we will be supporting the bill when we come to the vote. I want to indicate though that we do share some of the concerns of the Democrats about this question of the need for the disallowable instrument in relation to both stockpiling and other matters, and we have been pushing the government to introduce disallowable instrument measures into the bill, to provide those protections we seek. We think the bill would be improved by that.
We are also very conscious of the context in which we are operating and the government's firm view that the original amendments that we were going to proceed with would be rejected when the bill went back the House of Representatives. We generally reflect the same concerns that Senator Lees has expressed and which are represented in her amendments. We have this afternoon been trying to negotiate with the government, to try to find an outcome which goes some way to meeting our concerns and which also allows the bill to be passed, because Labor is very concerned to ensure that the bill is passed in this sitting. We accept that the government has legitimate reasons for having the legislation passed, and we do not want to delay the bill. In that context, we have been trying to find a way through which will provide some of the protections with the use of disallowable instruments, particularly in relation to stockpiling, which we have concerns about, but which would also allow the passage of the bill today.
We have been trying to work through that problem, and so we have drafted some amendments of our own, which I think will be agreed to by the government and which will get us to that place. They do not go as far as Senator Lees is advocating we go. Otherwise, I am in complete sympathy with most of the arguments she puts forward, but we are also trying to ensure that we do not unnecessarily delay the bill. I think there is a problem at the moment with the distribution of my amendments. It is hopefully being rectified as we speak. We will be moving those. We are concerned that they do not go quite as far as we would like them to go. As I said, I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Lees, but we are also concerned to make sure that the legislation is passed and that we do not end up with an unnecessary delay.
I will not traverse all the old ground about whether we have had enough sitting time. We have all made those points, but today is the last sitting day of the session. It is unfortunate that already at this time of the year we are having this sort of pressure on the legislative process. Labor will be supporting the bill, but we will be moving amendments at the committee stage which seek to provide some reassurance by virtue of use of a disallowable instrument, without perhaps going as far as Senator Lees would like or Labor would originally have liked.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-03-21,"—  This is important legislation. It will ensure not only that essential unapproved medicines can be rapidly supplied in an actual national emergency but also that any necessary unapproved medicines can be imported or manufactured for stockpiling to meet a potential threat. In answer to Senator Lees's query in her speech, I would like to inform her that the types of products currently being pursued for stockpiling are antibiotics for the treatment of a number of potential biological weapons such as inhalational anthrax and plague. Those antibiotics are ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and amoxycillin. Technical information is being sought from potential suppliers of old and new types of vaccines for smallpox prior to taking a decision on stockpiling. Other products being pursued for stockpiling are chemical antidotes for treating people affected by the release of nerve agents in a presumed act of terrorism. Internationally, a number of organisations have published lists of essential pharmaceutical treatments for dealing with CBR attacks. 
The legislation does recognise that there are risks inherent in allowing unapproved therapeutic goods to be stockpiled or supplied. For this reason the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 includes a range of provisions to prevent abuse of these new arrangements and to ensure adequate disclosure of the decisions made in relation to those unapproved medicines. I recognise the support of both the opposition and the Democrats for the aims and general application of this bill, but I am disappointed that they plan to move amendments to such a significant bill. I will leave my comments on the amendments themselves until the committee stage.
Question agreed to.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-03-21,"— The opposition will not be pressing the amendments. I just indicate that there are considerable problems. We are very unhappy about not having our amendments accepted. However, the operation of the review in terms of the agreements that have been struck, I believe, will provide an opportunity to address some of the real concerns that people have about this particular measure. I seek to leave to incorporate my reasons for our decision.
Leave granted.
The reasons read as follows—
Madam President, the bill before the Senate provides for funding for the program of Establishment Grants. This program has now been before Parliament four times.
·	The first time, in 2000, the Government failed to allocate enough money—by a factor, they said later, as high as 300%;
·	The second time, they tried to tuck the relevant clauses away in a huge omnibus bill on research funding and innovation the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. This bill was the vehicle for the Government's much-vaunted Innovation Package, its flagship policy initiative for higher education. The Opposition requested that the two entirely unrelated matters dealt with in the bill—university research funding and policy on the one hand, and funding for private schools on the other. The Government, despite its pride in the Innovation Package, refused to take the bill to its conclusion—over the issue of Establishment Grant funding levels. It did this rather than accede to the Opposition's demand that the bill be split appropriately into two. 
·	Later in 2001, the Government at last did what the Opposition had suggested—it split the bill. And, because the Government was again intransigent over Labor's amendments, the bill failed to pass through the two Houses before Parliament was pirogued.
·	Now we have it back for a fourth time. A bad penny always turns up, as they used to say before decimal currency.
Cost
Initially, the Government thought that this program would cost a bit over $4 million over four years. But only a few months later it decided that it had been wrong—that it had vastly underestimated the likely cost. In panic, it tried to legislate not for $4 million, but for $14 million. New schools, it said, were now, suddenly, on average much bigger than it had thought. So big that one of them mysteriously appeared on the scene in Western Australia—a brand new school with 837 students! We now know that this, and several other so-called “new” schools were not new at all.
Now the Government has revised its estimate for the four-year cost down a little—back to just under $12 million. Perhaps it is not expecting any giant schools mysteriously heaving into sight on the horizon before 2005.
But the rubbery estimates associated with this program over the last year don't inspire confidence. It is clear that, here, the Government and its executive arm, the Department, have been wrestling with a program that embodies some fundamental flaws.
New form
But this time the bill is in a new form. The Government has given up—as a bad joke—its futile attempts to predict with accuracy exactly how much to allocate for what is essentially an open-ended program, an open-ended commitment.
Instead of nominating global amounts for successive years for this program, the Government has presented us with a per capita formula. This underlines the fact that, here, we are asking the taxpayer to foot a bill for establishment grant funding for new private schools that has no real cap or limit.
The Opposition is uneasy about this. We are uneasy because what it underlines for us is that the program, as it stands at the moment, and in particular the administrative framework that surrounds it, is shaky. It is less than satisfactory.
The fact that the Government has been unable to make up its mind how much this program would cost, and has resorted to an uncapped per capita formula as expressed in this bill, this fact shows that the program as conceived has serious problems.
Labor's commitment
Madam President, Labor is committed to providing the assistance promised by the Government to the deserving, genuine new schools that are expecting monies under this program. We believe that all schools—not just private schools—face additional costs when they are struggling to establish themselves.
The Government has consistently tried to portray the Opposition as opposing Establishment Grant funding for struggling schools that serve relatively poor communities.
We do not oppose this funding, and never have done so.
The problems
However, we have also been consistent ourselves: ever since they became apparent in early 2001, we have consistently pointed to anomalies in this program as conceived by the Government. We have consistently pointed out problems with its administration. We have been consistent in demonstrating that the guidelines for this very program were being flouted by the Government's Departmental officers in administering it.
This meant that:
·	What were essentially new campuses of existing schools were provided with establishment Grants;
·	A school that did little more than change its ownership and Board of Governors was funded;
·	Long-established preschools extending their offerings by one year (to six-year-olds) were funded;
·	For-profit schools were apparently funded.
The problems were there. They still are, the Opposition maintains.
Our suite of amendments was designed to address these problems in a genuine and serious manner.
Labor's amendments
We are extremely disappointed in the Government's refusal to countenance all but one of these amendments. As I say, the amendments intended to strengthen this legislation and to strengthen this program. Their purpose was to address the very weaknesses and anomalies I have been discussing.  
They dealt with the lack of clear, coherent eligibility criteria to define “new” schools as eligible for an Establishment Grant.
The amendments also dealt with the inherent inequity in the program as conceived by the Government. They went to the issue of inequity in that the Government's program provides for a flat per capita amount for all eligible private schools—rich and poor alike.
So Reddam House School in Sydney, with its marble bathrooms, its café and its TV studio, gets the same amount per student as the Ballarat Steiner School that he opened up in the church hall at Bungaree. The Aboriginal school in the Kimberley receives the same amount per child as the opulent private school set up on the campus of Murdoch University down south in Perth.
And schools that charge fees well above the average per-student amount provided fir public schools—up to $11,500 per year in the case of Reddam House—these schools receive the same as the very low-fee schools catering to families that can't even imagine paying that sort of money.
Labor's amendments would have dealt with these problems by, first, creating a sliding scale of per capita grants that reflects the SES status of each school. Second, our amendments would have denied Establishment Grant funding to schools where high fees were charged, and where, as a consequence, facilities are much more luxurious than those that most Australian children are fortunate enough to enjoy.
Government rejects our amendments
Our amendments were reasonable and sensible.
Yet the Government chose to reject all but one. We are extremely disappointed, Madam President, that the Government has been so petty-minded and intransigent. There were good reasons to accept our amendments, and the Government knows it. It knows that its program, and its legislation, are seriously flawed.
How do we know this?
We know because the Government did not reject the most crucial of our amendments, the one that concedes the point: the provision, inserted in the bill by Labor, calling for a thorough review of the administration of the program before the end of next year.
The review
This review is the centrepiece of the set of amendments moved by the Opposition. It is at the nub of our concerns and, we are confident, will address the serious problems that Labor has consistently pointed out for over a year.
This review, to be carried out by the Government's own Department, will go to:
·	Eligibility criteria of schools for these grants;
·	Accountancy and transparency; and
·	Administration of the program.
These are all the issues that we have been tirelessly drawing the Government's attention to. The very issues about which the Government has been in a state of denial until today. The issues that they went to absurd lengths to sweep under the carpet and to explain away.
Now they have admitted the error of their ways. They have agreed to a review.
This review will be established and carried out in consultation with a representative reference group made up of school authorities and organisations. It will report publicly before the end of 2003.
Policy review
Madam President, following the Federal Election of last year, Labor has embarked upon a major and, in some ways, sweeping policy review—in all areas of policy.
This policy review will include education. We have committed to a close examination of our approach and of the detail of our policies.
In terms of school funding, we will be looking again at the fundamental issues that underlie our policies. We will be subjecting our assumptions to the clear light of day.
We will not abandon our fundamental principles—the principle of universal access to high-quality public education for all Australian kids, and the principle that all schools should be funded by the Commonwealth on the basis of genuine need.
In fact, the principles of Knowledge Nation, I am sure, will continue to inform our policy approach.
On Establishment Grants, and on policies surrounding the funding of new private schools, Labor will be genuinely seeking policy measures to ensure that there is rationality, prudent planning and equity in the Commonwealth's approach. The kinds of amendments we have proposed for the legislation before the Senate today, and that the Government has unfortunately rejected, indicate the general directions we might well be looking at.
Our commitment to policy review is genuine. 
The Government's policy failure
The Government, for its part, has failed comprehensively to meet its responsibilities and to be honest about the problems it has created for itself in the funding of private schools—including new private schools. It has failed to look honestly at its own inadequacies in this area.
These problems and anomalies have been, and are, legion. They have exposed the Government to ridicule. And yet the Government declined to act until forced to do so by the Opposition.
The review of the Establishment Grants program that the Government has now, finally, agreed to is to be welcomed. It is a major victory for the Opposition, and our tireless tenacity in brining the Government to account.
Labor will not be pressing our other amendments. If this review is undertaken properly, working with a genuinely representative reference group, it will be a major step in strengthening the Establishment Grants program and brining an end to the problems that have been endemic to this program since its inception.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-03-21,"—In the debate on these appropriation bills tonight, I wish to speak briefly about an issue that concerns me and a number of people who are members of the New South Wales State Emergency Service. Last year and early this year, there was a series of very significant fires in New South Wales that led to the destruction of a lot of property and livestock—but, fortunately, no lives. A march was held in Sydney on 8 February, which was an opportunity for the people of Sydney particularly but also of other places to say thank you to the firefighters and other people who had given their time, their experience and their ability so ably to help fight those fires. At that march, Mr Anderson, then representing the Prime Minister, made an announcement that there would be an ex gratia payment made to volunteer firefighters, those volunteers who belonged to or were registered with firefighting brigades. They were told that they would be eligible to receive an ex gratia payment of up to $160 a day, in lieu of wages forgone and to help to cover their incidentals. 
There has been quite a deal of complaint from the firefighters who at that time were members of the SES, because they were not included in this ex gratia payment. They are upset, because they spent many days also fighting these fires and risking their lives to assist the bush firefighters. In many cases where firefighters are brought down from the rural and regional areas, they often wear two uniforms. It depends on what the emergency is. They might have their yellow uniform on for the firefighting brigade they belong to, or they might have their orange uniform on for the SES. But those who had their SES orange uniform on will not be paid any of the ex gratia payment—and they feel that this is very unfair. 
We have just completed the International Year of the Volunteer, and these people—and a lot of other volunteers too; we are talking about a couple of thousand people here— assisted with the water-loading of water bombers, as we saw in the pictures taken of Elvis. Many SES people were involved in those logistics. They were also involved in the removal and evacuation of many people, and some of those evacuations took place in very scary situations. One can only pay tribute to the valour of these very heroic people, be they bush fighters or SES and other volunteers. They were also responsible for making sure that the firefighters were fed and watered, and this is an important role as well. But these people are being ignored, and they do not feel particularly happy about it.
The Premier wrote to the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has written back saying he is only undertaking the same payment that was paid in 1994 when there was another series of disastrous bushfires in New South Wales. I have been advised by Craig Ronan, the President of the SES Association in New South Wales, that he is aware of a number of SES volunteers who, in 1994, did receive the ex gratia payment. They are justifiably quite upset about the issue.  
Mr Anderson has said the dates for which they could be paid would be 24 December to 16 January. This is fine, but those were the dates when the big fires took place around Sydney. There were many other fires in New South Wales which received a schedule 44 classification, which means they were recognised as serious and dangerous bushfires. One burnt around Yeoval for about three weeks. It burnt out many hectares in a national park and on private land. When it broke out onto private land, it killed many thousands of head of livestock, and a number of houses and vehicles were burnt. Fortunately, again, no life was lost. This one was put out well before 16 January but in fact it had started on about the first or second of December. The big blaze that killed the livestock took place prior to 24 December so those firefighters are not eligible.
There was a significant bushfire in the Oberon area, and those firefighters are not eligible. Another significant bushfire nearly wiped out the small village of Eugowra, and those firefighters are not eligible. It is incumbent upon the Prime Minister to have a review of this. One group of volunteers feel they are being given a privilege above the rest. It is not that the firefighters feel the SES should not be getting it; in fact, the voluntary bushfire association is strongly supporting the request of the SES volunteers and other volunteers. It is very important to make sure this discrimination is corrected. 
As I said, the Prime Minister said they did not get it in 1994, but I am told by the SES people that a number of them did receive ex gratia payments. So I think it needs to be revisited. It is an important issue that has a number of people in my area, where I live and work in rural New South Wales, quite upset because they are feeling they have been discriminated against. They feel the fire that occurred at the Goobang National Park around Yeoval and Peak Hill is just not getting any recognition. That lack of recognition upsets them greatly, and I want to see that situation rectified.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2001-2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-21,"—I recognise a number of people are trying to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2001-2002 before 6.30 p.m. so I will be briefer than I might otherwise have been. I am actually going to speak to the bill for a change. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002 is interesting in a few respects. It appropriates $5.3 million for the Australian Research Council, $3½ million of which is a transfer from the old DETYA budget. Senators will be aware that in January this year the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, instructed the Australian Research Council to devote 33 per cent of the National Competition Competitive Grants program to four priority areas. Whilst there is nothing intrinsically wrong with establishing priorities, there are serious questions as to the process by which the decision was determined, the implications for basic research in other fields, the level of the funds devoted to these four areas and the criteria for assessing the success or otherwise of the strategy. 
What this direction to the ARC also indicates is the poverty of the government's approach to an industry policy. Indeed, government control over universities and funding agencies to deliver industry and commercial outcomes has become their de facto industry policy. So it will surprise nobody in this House, given recent events, that there is another issue of accountability at stake here. Last year the Senate debated at great length the establishment of the Australian Research Council. I suspect we all thought we were establishing a rather more independent body than what has emerged. Be that as it may, it is required in the act that any direction the minister gives to the ARC must be tabled within 15 sitting days.
Today marks the 14th sitting day of the other place since Minister Nelson gave his direction and we still have not seen any tabled directions. So the Democrats will certainly be very interested to see whether Minister Nelson fulfils his obligations on the first day back on 14 May. He would certainly look a bit silly if we had to move a motion of contempt or sought a civil action to ask the board to disclose the direction. He would look even sillier if a non-government parliamentarian chose to table a copy of the document on the minister's behalf. The bill also appropriates an additional $21 million for ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. I understand none of this money is in the contract for Lucas Heights. Whilst we do not seek to denigrate the many fine scientists, technicians and other staff who work for this organisation, it is well to remind ourselves of the extraordinary secrecy and obfuscation that has gone on concerning the contract for the new reactor with INVAP and the arrangement with COGEMA to preprocess waste. 
This week alone, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr have moved returns to order concerning very serious questions about the management of accidents and the viability of the new reactor given the parlous state of the Argentinean economy and thus the efficacy of guarantees of INVAP's long-term capacity to fulfil contractual obligations. What characterised the government's handling of these returns to order was the repeated resort to commercial-in-confidence, national security and confidentiality. With the new information that has come to light from Argentina on the state of the Argentinean economy and the state of the relevant organisation which has tendered for the new reactor, to continually hide behind national security, commercial-in-confidence and confidentiality is simply not good enough from the Democrats' point of view. 
It is an issue my colleague Senator Murray has pursued in recent times to try to get a better standard of the application of the principle of commercial-in-confidence. The Democrats recognise there are legitimate occasions when that may apply but it seems quite clear that more and more it is being applied inappropriately as an excuse for keeping things from the public eye. The constant resort to commercial-in-confidence could easily be interpreted as yet another instance of this government's contempt for very important institutions such as the Senate and the parliament and the High Court.
In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2001-2002, the Department of Family and Community Services is seeking $226 million for:
Participation in the labour force and community life ... facilitated by income support measures and services that encourage independence and contribution to the community ...
That all sounds very good. It is likely that this will be significantly funding the Australians Working Together program of $157 million. This program involves extending mutual obligation—and, therefore, breaching—to sole parents by compelling them to attend annual interviews and by compelling sole parents of 13-year-old children to undertake part-time work and training. Whilst a program and the use of money in this direction may sound like a good idea, the potential of it being utilised in the context of greater breaching and an extension of breaching is something of concern to the Democrats. 
There is one other line item in the appropriation bills that caught my eye as I was going through them, and it is an issue that the Democrats and others will continue to follow up in the break, while we are not sitting here. As senators would know, I am a member of the so-called `children overboard' committee—the Senate Select Committee for an Inquiry into a Certain Maritime Incident—which, while it will look at that one incident, is also charged with examining the Pacific solution. Of course, one of the aspects of that is the costs and the impacts. 
Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2001-2002 provides a bit of the answer, and it is a bit of a tragic answer at that. This bill provides additional funding of $145 million to address unauthorised arrivals, and that is just over the course of the last six months—it is not even a full year's worth of expenditure. The cost to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs alone—not to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, not to Defence—for just the initial stages of no longer than six or seven months, in terms of additional funding to address unauthorised arrivals, which is code for establishing Manus Island and Nauru, is $145 million.
To put that in context, I have just mentioned that the entire Australians Working Together program costs $157 million. The total investment in the first-year implementation of the so-called groundbreaking Backing Australia's Ability program was $155 million, and here we are, throwing $145 million, less than a year's expenditure—if you extrapolate that figure over 12 months, it would go well over the costs of both of those other programs—simply to allow this government to take asylum seekers away from Australia and assess them somewhere else. As we have seen with the legislation that we passed in this place today, it is quite likely that they will end up back in Australia in various guises anyway.  
So, even apart from the inhumanity of this policy and its breaching of international conventions and basic standards of decency, the cost of $145 million that is contained in this bill to cover little more than six months of expenditure simply shows how far this government is prepared to go to buy an election. There is no-one who could justify this or suggest that it is actually an effective policy to assess people in Nauru rather than in Australia or on Christmas Island and then have them come back to Australia anyway, which is where the refugees will end up. If you think the rest of the world is going to take refugees that are Australia's responsibility, you have got to be joking. We will have the refugees back here anyway, we will have the people who are rejected back here anyway under the legislation we passed this morning, but we will be $145 million poorer as a consequence—and that is just the immigration department for that six-month period. There are no forward estimates about how much it will continue to cost Immigration and there is no estimation of cost for Foreign Affairs, for Prime Minister and Cabinet or for Defence. 
Those are issues that the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident will explore in detail over the course of the next month or so because, quite clearly, there are costs to and operational impacts on the defence forces, in particular, as well as our aid program and our foreign affairs areas in the Pacific region. This is a first indication. If we had a bit more time to explore this issue further, I would do so in the committee stage and, potentially, move an amendment in relation to it. But, yet again, as a symbol of my cooperation—I have been so cooperative about so many things in the last couple of days, despite this government not deserving it at all—I will not do that. I will provide some space for my opposition colleagues to speak, even though they do not deserve it either, given that they supported the government's bill. But there you go, I will be cooperative with everybody, for reasons that escape me. But it is a serious point to make: $145 million is being unnecessarily spent to generate extra hardship and to undermine the cooperative global approach to dealing with refugees and asylum seekers. It is hard to think of an example of money less well spent than this. Certainly, this part of the appropriation bill would be one that I personally would not be in favour of letting through.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2001-2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1

I seek leave to table a New South Wales Ombudsman's report into the Educational Testing Centre at the University of New South Wales, dated February 2002, and a New South Wales Auditor-General's report into the same affair, dated November 2001. I have shown these two documents to the government.
Leave granted. 
—I seek to incorporate my speech in support of these documents.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Madam President, I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4, 2002. I also seek leave to table documents pertinent to my remarks, namely the reports of the NSW Ombudsman and the NSW Auditor General's inquiries into the Educational Testing Centre of the University of NSW.
I wish to raise some matters of serious concern on the issues of quality, probity and accountability in connection with research carried out in universities.
An article appears today in the Sydney Morning Herald that concerns the Educational Testing Centre at the University of NSW. This is a large unit, employing at various times during the year up to 1000 staff, that carries out surveys, research and educational testing and competitions. The article I mentioned refers to a report by the NSW Ombudsman detailing his findings on the conduct of the University in its consideration of a protected disclosure alleging maladministration in the Educational Testing Centre. It is to the issue of the alleged maladministration that I wish to speak. 
DEST/DETYA contract
Let me preface my remarks by noting that, according to an answer provided on notice to the Senate Estimates Committee by the Department of Education, Training and Science, this Centre was under contract to the former DETYA in 1998-2000 to the tune of $200 000. The contract involved survey research undertaken on behalf of the Schools Division of the Department connected with the Discovering Democracy program.
The letting of this contract, according to Departmental guidelines, required an open tender process. The Department, however, with the explicit approval of the Minister, went only to limited tender. The then Minister, Dr Kemp, also approved the selection of the Testing Centre for the contract.
This Testing Centre at UNSW, whose reputation, as the Senate will soon understand, is seriously under a cloud, was granted a contract with this Government on the explicit approval of a Cabinet Minister, in a manner contrary to the Government's own minimum procurement standards.

The Educational Testing Centre has been the focus not only of a damning Ombudsman's report— the details of which I'll come to presently—but has also been the subject of a report of the NSW Auditor General, made public on 21 November 2001.
The Auditor General found that the University did not:
·	Adequately monitor the Educational Testing Centre's performance
·	Have an adequately documented process to approve ETC's budget, or
·	Exercise appropriate oversight of ETC's business decisions and activities.
Further, the Auditor General found that the ETC itself was deficient in its exercise of control over financial and operational management. The findings included, among other things, that the Centre had poor control and allocation of costs and overheads, and inadequate use of budgets for performance monitoring. There was failure to comply with University requirements for:
·	Purchasing
·	Approving expenditure
·	Recruitment and employment of staff
·	Approving expenditure on staff functions, and
·	Soliciting gifts from suppliers.
The report is damning. It demonstrates clearly that the maladministration and irregularities in the Educational Testing Centre have led to wastage of public monies and substantial unnecessary costs. For example:
·	The Director, Professor James Tognolini, has admitted that, “...we lost another $300 000 [in 1997] because of errors caused by suspect quality control procedures.”
·	An internal University report found that an IT development project at the Centre involved a cost blowout of almost 300%, or $1.5 million.
·	ETC's purchasing procedures for printing services (totalling $2.5 million in 2000) did not comply with University procedures, nor with sound practice.
·	Business Name Certificates for University products and services, including the name Educational Testing Centre itself, were registered in the name and private address of the Director of the ETC. The Auditor noted that this practice was “entirely inappropriate”.
Draft Report and AUQA
Now this Auditor General's report, in final draft form, was in the hands of the University's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Niland, during the time that the University was under examination by the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA) in October and November 2001. The Management of the University had that report, but did not provide a copy, nor draw attention to its existence, to the AUQA representatives nor was a similarly damning draft final report from the State Ombudsman, also in the hands of the University at the time of the audit, provided to the AUQA. Nor were the University's responses to these reports provided.
The Audit Office expressed its concern as to whether other activities within the University could be functioning with a similar lack of corporate governance and accountability arrangements. The Audit Office considers that “there is an urgent need for the University, and for other universities, to review their corporate governance and accountability framework.” [p.3 Performance Audit Report UNSW Education Testing Centre, NSW Auditor General 12 November 2001]
With this sort of condemnation, perhaps one shouldn't be surprised that this report was not passed on to the AUQA.
The mismanagement seems to be endemic to the Centre's administration. Here we have clear evidence of financial irregularities going back many years, and involving millions of dollars. Where whistleblowers have sought to clean up this shoddy affair, they have been persecuted and treated in the shabbiest fashion. 
The NSW Auditor General's Report and Ombudsman's Report originate as a result of a complaint made under the NSW Protected Disclosures Act 1994. The complaint alleged mismanagement, waste of public funds, bullying, harassment, nepotism and cronyism within the Education Testing Centre. The Auditor General's Report also refers to the Ombudsman's report, and, if it had been provided to the AUQA, then the extent of this scandal would have had a substantial bearing on the AUQA's work.
The NSW Auditor General expresses great concern that it was as a result of the whistleblower that these problems were revealed: “Many of the problems had existed for several years, but the University failed to detect them or act on them.” 
This, I put it to you Madam President, was a serious omission on the part of the University. It behove the University to draw the attention of the AUQA to this report. Not to do so could be said to be concealing vital information and findings from the AUQA. This failure calls into question not only the motives and behaviour of the University of NSW, but the strength, adequacy and effectiveness of the AUQA itself and its processes and powers.
What is the point of establishing a Quality Agency, to safeguard and monitor standards of probity, transparency and so on in universities if the Agency does not have access as a matter of course to vital documentation relating to the University's performance? How adequate are the processes associated with the AUQA? Does it really have the teeth necessary to do its job?
Madam President, these are serious questions. They go to the Government's very intentions in establishing the Quality Agency.
Establishment of Quality Agency
It's worth going back and looking at that issue.
Why did the Government establish the Australian Universities Quality Agency? It did so largely because of the grave concerns raised, and the significant issues pointed to, by the Opposition about quality assurance in Australian universities—especially in the Senate Estimates process, over the last few years.
The Report of the Senate Committee of Inquiry in 2000, Universities in Crisis, proved to be a site where many of these concerns and profound structural and systemic problems came together and were analysed. This report showed the eroding effects of certain aspects of commercialisation on university activities, including teaching and research.
The Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee has recently written to me, pointing out that, in terms of university research income, the proportion of this funding that emanates from the Commonwealth has declined over the last decade from 66% to just 55%. Nearly half of university research funding now comes from industry and other commercial sources. Commercial funding, as the report Universities in Crisis notes, is volatile. It often comes with strings attached. While this commercial funding indicates a welcome and increasing engagement between universities and industry, it also represents a creeping privatisation of the research activities of universities. Nearly half of university research funding is from private sources—with Telstra, its semi-privatisation came only after a vigorous and lengthy public debate. Here in universities, however, we see a similar outcome with no explicit debate at all. A public-sector activity is also being privatised.
Commercial pressures, and the pressure to increase private income as the Howard Government withdrew from funding of universities, have proved to be crucial in the factors undermining and threatening quality and standards—and probity and financial accountability—in our universities.
The heat, to put it simply, became too great. The Government had to be seen to be doing something. It established the AUQA.
The question is: has it done enough? Does the AUQA as established by this Government meet the concerns of the higher education community, and the Australian community more generally, about quality assurance? Does it, or will it, safeguard the international reputation of our universities' teaching and research? Their standards? Their processes and management? Their financial probity?
Ombudsman's Report
I turn now to a second report that goes to some of these matters in relation to the Educational Testing Centre at the University of NSW. This is the Ombudsman's Report, referred to in today's press. This is the report that I have sought to table.
It sets out a number of problems associated with the administration and financial management of the Centre. For example:
It states that the ETC signed a consultancy agreement with a legal firm, in which the son of the Centre's Director was employed. Two matters arise in this regard: 
·	First, the fees charged by the firm were said by the Ombudsman to be 200-300% higher than the range of estimated fees for the work concerned; and
·	Second, the ETC, as an unincorporated body, did not possess the legal power to enter into a consultancy agreement, or to sign contracts of employment with key personnel covered by the agreement.
It would appear that the University did not know that these agreements had been entered into. Why not?
And who footed the inflated bill for legal services? The answer is that, in the final analysis, the University footed that bill—the public university, the University of NSW.
Was the Ombudsman's report available to the University of NSW when the Quality Agency visited it late last year? Did the University draw the attention of the Agency to the findings of this report? Once again, we have a report that casts doubt on the processes of the University, and on the assiduousness with which its officers implemented its safeguards, monitoring mechanisms and due process.
Conclusion—Quality assurance—no assurance
Madam President, the Government's Quality Assurance watchdog for Australian universities, despite its genuine efforts, does not have the powers or the capacity to do its job properly. Until a more robust regime is put in place, the Australian community, and the international community, cannot be assured that we are discharging our collective responsibilities to safeguard the vital reputation of our higher education system and its fundamental responsibilities: teaching and research.
The financial and administrative irregularities of the Educational Testing Centre, given the findings of both the Ombudsman and the Auditor General, are of such seriousness that ICAC should examine these matters. A body such as ICAC provides the opportunity not only for citizens to come forward, but for allegations to be tested in the open.
—While I am on my feet, I also seek leave, given the time—and we are pressed for time here—on behalf of Senator Conroy to incorporate his speech, which the government has seen, on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2001-2002, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2001-2002 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2001-2002.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Appropriation bills. 
This set of appropriation bills provides us with an excellent opportunity to review the Government's record as a financial manager. 
In 1999, this Government heralded a new era in financial reporting with the introduction of accrual accounting. 
Accrual accounting—the Treasurer told us— would result in more “transparent and informative public accounts”. 
Accrual accounting—the Treasurer told us— would result in “more business like reporting in the public sector”.
More “business-like” reporting? 
To which businesses, I wonder, was he referring. 
In the last year, newspapers have been filled with reports of businesses that have failed after financial frailties were hidden from view by creative accounting. 
Financial frailties that, at best, their auditors failed to see.
And at worst, their Auditors conspired to conceal.
Fortunately in Australia, Government financial accounts are subject to independent scrutiny by the Auditor General. 
The Auditor General publishes reports on whether Government financial statements satisfy accounting standards and so provide a fair reflection of the Government's financial position.
Government accounting requirements are set down in Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) 31.
These standards are not guidelines. They are set down in law. 
In December last year, the Auditor General released his report on financial statements of Commonwealth Entities for the period ended 30 June 2001. 
And the Auditor General came to the view that not all aspects of the Government's accounts satisfied Australian Accounting Standard 31. 
He issued two qualifications. 
Regarding the first qualification, the Auditor General states in his report that:
“Taxation revenue in the Commonwealth Financial Statements is recognised when tax payments are due and payable or upon assessment by the ATO”  
He goes on to say that:
“This policy does not accord with Australian Accounting Standard AAS31 Financial Reporting by Governments which requires that all of the Governments assets and liabilities be recognised on an accrual basis, that is in the period to which they relate, regardless of when cash is received or paid.”
Regarding the second qualification, the Auditor General says that the Commonwealth Financial Statements do not recognise, as revenue, the taxes associated with the GST.
Nor do they recognise, as expenses, the associated payment to the States and Territories of the monies raised through this tax. 
The Auditor General further states that this treatment of GST does not accord with Accounting Standard AAS31. 
During senate estimates hearings in February, The Department of Finance were asked why it is that Commonwealth Financial Statements breach AAS31. 
The Minister of Finance interjected, saying that he: 
“appreciates that the Auditor General feels bound by some technical ruling”. 
Some technical ruling?
The Government considers the application of Australian Accounting Standards as “some technical ruling”. 
It is, of course, a coincidence that if GST was recorded as Commonwealth revenue as required by Accounting Standards, this Government would be the highest taxing ever. 
And it is of course just a coincidence that the impact of ignoring accounting standards was— according to the Auditor General—to overstate consolidated fiscal performance by more than $5 billion.
Speaking of $5 billion:
Treasury submitted evidence to the Estimates Committee in February showing that the Government had sustained a cumulative loss of almost $5 billion over the last four financial years in the course of managing its liabilities. 
These losses were recorded in the financial statements of the Annual Report of the Australian Office of Financial Management, the Treasury agency charged with the responsibility managing the Government's debt. 
These financial statements are prepared according to Accounting Standard 31. 
You would, of course, have had to read as far as page 80 of the Annual Report to find any mention of the losses.
There is no mention of the losses in the main body of the report. 
The Chief Executive's Review in the Annual Report instead noted that AOFM had, during the course of the financial year, focussed its capabilities and resources on achieving “its vision of global excellence in sovereign debt management”. 
I wonder what response the Chief Executive of a listed company would get if he told shareholders that the company was pursuing its vision of global excellence, while at the same time presiding over a loss of $1.9 billion in the current financial year and a cumulative loss of $4.8 billion in the last four. 
But then again, he would probably not get away with failing to mention the losses until page 80 of the Annual Report. 
Now, where do we find these losses in the budget?
When officials from the Australian Office of Financial Management were asked this question in Senate Estimates they replied: 
“In the AAS31 statements you can see the unrealised foreign currency positions reported”. 
But what about the budget?
AOFM officials went onto acknowledge:
“In the GFS framework (the losses) are below the line”.
Below the line?
These losses do not appear in the budget. 
Treasury officials later argued that the losses that are shown in the financial statements that are prepared on an accrual basis under AAS 31 are meaningless. 
Their exact words were 
“Frankly, I wonder why we calculate these numbers—“. 
The Secretary of the Treasury proceeded to argue the weaknesses of accrual accounting. 
This Government was the architect of the accrual accounting system. 
The Treasurer hailed the move to accrual accounting, saying it would result in “more transparent and informative public accounts”. 
But when this new transparency highlights government mismanagement on a massive scale, suddenly the system has weaknesses. 
But of course the issue of these foreign exchange losses is larger than simply how they are recorded in the financial accounts.
The real issue is the financial mismanagement that allowed these losses to occur in the first instance.
The mismanagement that allowed these losses to grow unchecked for five years until they had reached almost $5 billion. 
The policy of swapping the Government liabilities into US dollars began in 1989. 
The rationale behind the policy was sound. 
Interest rates were lower in the US than they were in Australia, creating the potential for substantial savings in the cost of servicing Government debt. 
Up until 1996/97 the policy was hugely profitable, generating savings for Australian taxpayers of $3 billion.
The profitably of this policy under Labor was confirmed by Treasury officials at Senate Estimates and the Treasurer himself, speaking on the 7:30 report on March 7, 2002. 
The Treasurer admitted.
“I think it is fair to point out that the policy commenced under the Labor Party and the Treasury position was that it was actually a profitable position”. 
The policy was profitable because the savings from lower US interest rates more than compensated for any movements in the exchange rate. 
However, since 1997/98, the policy has generated losses of almost $5 billion. 
The reason was very simple.
By 1997 the rationale for the policy had disappeared. 
There was no longer any difference between the level of Australian and US interest rates and hence there were no longer any cost savings from swapping Government borrowings into US dollars.
Since this Government came to office the policy has been reviewed no fewer than nine times. 
The Treasury itself conducted three reviews in December 1996, November 1997 and August 1998.
The first two were the direct result of the disappearance of any interest savings and the third was triggered by the collapse in the exchange rate.
The Treasurer has refused to release these reviews.
But he insists that none of the reviews recommended a change in policy, despite seismic changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Despite the fact that there was no longer any rationale for swapping Government liabilities into US dollars. 
What defence has the Treasurer offered?
He started by arguing that he inherited the policy from Labor.
·	A policy that he kept in place for more than five years. 
·	He argued that there were in fact no losses.
·	Well this depends on which set of the Governments numbers you look at. 
·	He then argued the losses had no implication for the budget.
·	They are “below the line”.
·	He later argued that he did not know of the losses until November 2001.
·	Yet the Treasurer, as responsible Minister, signed off on the swaps strategy annually. 
·	And each year the Treasurer tabled the Annual Reports from AOFM and Treasury in the Parliament that recorded the losses. 
He argued that in allowing the exposure to foreign currency to breach its limit of 15% he was acting on the advice of the Reserve Bank. 
·	For the record, in December 2000 the Reserve Bank argued against the “mechanical application” of the limit in favour of a “more gradual resolution as market conditions permitted”.
·	I am not sure that by “more gradual”, the Governor was suggesting that exposure be allowed to increase unchecked to over 20% by June 2000. 
·	I am not sure that by “more gradual” he meant waiting until the last swap matures in 2008 before finally recognising the losses in full. 
·	After the Treasurer ended the policy, the Reserve Bank approved the proposed schedule for reducing foreign currency exposure to zero 
·	But stretching it out until 2008 is a policy decision by the Treasurer. 
·	Under this policy, taxpayers will remain exposed to the risk of further foreign currency losses until 2008. 
However, the Treasurer's key defence of his failure to take any action to stem the mounting losses was that he always acted on advice from Treasury and external consultants. 
This is untrue.
Last week, the Treasury finally released the reports from these external consultants. 
The June 1998 report from UBS recommended a substantive change to the way the Government managed its debt. 
The report recommended in the Executive Summary that the “portfolio should be split into two parts” and that the foreign currency “benchmark continue to apply to that portion of the debt that is not targeted for repayment”.
When the Treasurer was asked in Question Time on March 11 why UBS's advice in 1998 was not followed, he had no answer. 
He finally issued an evening press release that said this advice had “in effect” been followed. 
“In effect”? 
The advice was not followed. 
If it had been, debt repayment could not have contributed to the breach the 15% limit on foreign currency exposure. 
The benchmark portfolio would have been insulated from the impact of debt reduction.
That was the whole point of the advice given. 
So the Treasurer did not always follow the advice. 
And that failure to follow advice has cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
Had the advice been followed, from that time forward only part of the portfolio would have been exposed to currency movements and the losses would have been substantially reduced. 
The Treasury would have initiated an orderly run down of foreign currency exposure in that part of the portfolio earmarked for debt repayment. 
This would have been made easier by the fact that they would have been reducing their exposure when the $A was rising through the second half of 1998.
But the opportunity was passed up. 
So let me say, once again, for the record that the Treasurer did not follow all the advice that was given.
And his failure to do so directly contributed to the size of the losses.
The Treasurer finally acted to, in his words, “end the policy” in September 2001.
He took this decision, he said on the 7:30 Report on March 7 2002, “regardless of market advice”. 
Which is it Treasurer?
You maintained the policy because of market advice or you ended the policy regardless of market advice?
So, what other defences are there? 
Treasury argues that they were not speculating on foreign currencies.
Since US and Australian interest rates converged in 1997, the only way the Treasury could hope to save money by swapping liabilities into US dollars was if the $A rose. 
Treasury was speculating that the Australian dollar would rise. 
Treasury has argued that by the time the policy went sour there was nothing they could be done. In their words
“if you had attempted to liquidate in, say, August 1998 or October 1999 you would have needed to have liquidated between $US8 billion or $US7 billion at any point in time....It is almost certain that you would have had some impact on the foreign exchange market. As I said earlier, we are a big player in this”
Did they only have two discreet choices: maintaining the exposure in full or cutting it to zero?
Could they not have begun a gradual reduction in their exposure as market conditions permitted? 
And market conditions did permit. The currency rose in the latter half of 1998 and they could have used this strength to reduce their exposure. 
Perhaps they were hoping that the $A would return to its former highs and all the losses would be undone. 
The risk posed to foreign exchange markets by the Government mismanagement of their currency exposure did not diminish over time. 
By late 2000, as we now know, the risk had become so great that the Reserve Bank felt compelled to intervene. 
The Defences of both the Treasurer and Treasury have been laid bare. 
Or as the Courier Mail concluded: 
“The defence of this ineptitude mounted by the Treasurer and the Treasury has been equally as pathetic”.
With one or two exceptions, the Press have found the Treasurer's arguments unconvincing. 
Alan Wood, writing in the Australian, did argue that if we condemn these foreign exchange losses, we should extend this condemnation to losses sustained as a result of the fall in the value of Telstra of which the Government is a shareholder. 
The difference is, of course, that there is a public policy rationale behind the Government holding shares in Telstra—a public policy rationale that the Labor Party continues to support. 
There has been no public policy rationale behind the Government swapping its debt into US dollars since 1997, when US and Australian interest rates converged. 
Telstra also pays dividend streams to the Commonwealth budget which are unaffected by the vagaries of the stock market.
But we are paying interest on the Treasurer's foreign currency losses. 
In its editorial on March 16th, the Australian Financial Review politely argued that the Treasurer “might have got out of its foreign currency exposure a bit quicker”. 
The Treasurer did not “end the policy” until five years after its rationale disappeared, until it had conducted nine separate policy reviews and accumulated $5 billion of foreign currency losses. 
No bank would, or indeed could, have allowed such a loss making strategy to continue for five years after its “raison d'etre” had been invalidated. 
But then again, banks don't have that unique lender of last resort, the taxpayer.
Is the foreign currency swaps debacle the only example of Government mismanagement of foreign currency risks? 
Sadly, no.
In May 2000, the Auditor General released a report on Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Risk Management Practices. 
The report showed that up until April 1999, exchange rate movements had increased the cost of some 220 Defence Departments projects in progress at that time by just shy of $3 billion.
The Auditor General recommended changes to the Government's practices for managing foreign exchange risk.
In June 2000, a task force was set up that was to report within a month on how to respond to the Auditor General's report. 
The report was apparently completed in July 2000 but no action has been taken. 
Since that time, Defence has been given an extra budget allocation of $493 million to make up for a further blow out in costs due to currency movements. 
The Finance Minister argued that the practice of automatically making up for currency losses with additional appropriations was the “right response”.
He said that the Government adopted a “no-win no-loss” approach to foreign currency management. 
“No-win, no-loss?”
We know the losses— where are the wins?
Do some Departments win as a result of the fall in the dollar—are they perhaps raising revenue in US dollars?
Or is the Finance Minister adopting the Treasurer's approach to foreign exchange risk that “it'll be alright in the long run” 
I call on the Finance Minister to respond to the Auditor General's recommendations to review automatic supplementation for foreign currency losses in order to impose some discipline on Departments to manage foreign exchange risk. 
I also call on the Minister to respond to the Auditor General's recommendation to determine an overarching Commonwealth position statement on foreign exchange risk management. 
So, in conclusion:
This Government has long trumpeted its achievements as a financial manager. 
However, a closer examination of the facts paints a very different story.
Government financial mismanagement has cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
The Treasurer's foreign currency gambling losses has cost close to $5 billion.
The Finance Minister's failure to manage foreign exchange risk has cost another $3.5 billion and counting. 
These $8.5 billion in losses equates to $1700 for every family in Australia.
Money that could have been spent on schools.
Money that could have been spent on hospitals.
Money that could have built roads or funded tax cuts. 
The Government has failed to respond to advice from its own consultants that would have reduced the losses.
The Government has failed to respond to recommendations from the Auditor General to protect taxpayers from future losses.
Instead the Government has spent its time utilising creative accounting practices in order to hide these losses from public view.
This Government's claim to sound financial management does not stand up to scrutiny. ",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2001-2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-21,"—I rise to speak this evening on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2001-2002 and related bills, more so because of what is not there than what is there. Whilst one might say that the issue I am going to discuss does not necessarily receive the highest priority in our community, it is one that undoubtedly touches very many indeed. It is an issue that I speak on because of the recent tragic death of a very young person from our state by the name of Luke Harrop. Luke was a very promising triathlete who unfortunately was killed in an accident on the Gold Coast earlier this year while training. I did not know him personally, but I know that he was respected by his peers. He showed great potential and was a real prospect for a medal at the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.  
One might say, `What has this got to do with the appropriations?' Quite specifically it goes to the fact that when I went to search for what is being done in the area of promoting safety for cyclists, whether the cyclists use their bikes for recreation, sporting or commuting purposes, I found very little or no evidence of action by the federal government in this area. It was only when I went to the Department of Transport and Regional Services web site that I found out about the extensive use of bicycles throughout Australia and the need for this government to pay some real attention to the difficulties that are now arising not only in my state but in many states throughout Australia. I found that bicycle ownership, for example, is at least as high as 50 per cent across Australia, that family groups and those in their late 20s and 30s are now involved more in cycling both for recreation and commuting and that the cycling participation rate is increasing. 
However, the disturbing thing that I found on the web site was the fact that the cost of bicycle fatalities and serious injuries in Australia annually is estimated at $500 million— a very extensive cost indeed. The web site itself admits that this is unacceptable. The web site says:
Bicycle accidents represented a disproportionately high percentage of all vehicle accidents resulting in hospital treatment of victims—about 10 to 15 per cent. Bicycle crashes represent 2.4 per cent of road fatalities and an estimated 6.3 per cent of serious injuries.
So the program that was adopted by this government back in 1999 which has a life to 2004, Australia Cycling: the National Strategy, becomes very important indeed. The accident that touched everyone, not only in Queensland but I am sure right throughout Australia, has put a focus on the difficulties that are facing cyclists. 
I must confess I have a personal interest here in that I am found out on the roads and the bikeways riding my bicycle, as is my son, who was almost in a serious accident himself in recent times. Also recently while travelling I picked up a Sydney newspaper and there was a story about a young person of 34 who had suffered a bad accident commuting to work. I do not know the follow-up from that particular accident, but the person was in a critical state as a result of a car recklessly, I can only assume, ploughing into the cyclist. That is how the particular article read. In the wake of the problem in Queensland, the Queensland government called a summit, but I found that there is growing concern about this issue. As I say, when I searched for the way in which the government has backed up the national strategy, I found it difficult to come across any clear evidence as to what it is actually doing.
Aware of the time, I am just going to turn to the fact that the strategy addressed a number of issues, including the health aspect, the fact that it is good for both transport and recreation and is bringing people a healthier lifestyle as well as—as the strategy itself admits—reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and congestion. So there were a number of advantages seen in the strategy that the government adopted. The strategy itself covers a number of objectives, and one of the objectives looks at the fact that the strategy is a partnership between all three spheres of government. It is all well and good to have a strategy, but it is another thing to have the strategy implemented and properly funded and the outcomes of the strategy being reported. Whilst it may not be one of the most prominent programs that the government has run, there was very little evidence that I could find of the outcomes of the strategy.  
It is worth while just looking at some of the objectives or strategies that were undertaken as part of this national strategy. I will go through a couple of the items. Again I got this from the web site of the department of transport. Under the heading `Strategies', it says that the program aims to develop and implement a national public communication strategy to improve the awareness of all road users as to how they can better share our roads. Then it talks about the responsibilities of the three spheres of government and looks at the performance measure. But when I looked for the performance measure, which is supposed to have some positive outcomes by 2001 and to look further to 2003—of course we cannot get that far yet—I could not even find any result of the outcomes of that particular strategy. Whilst it involves the three spheres of government, one would think that the federal government, as the peak government and the organiser of the strategy, would be able to show some results and some outcomes from this particular program.
The second strategy is: `To develop and implement a national public communication strategy to improve the awareness of path users as to how they can best share our paths'. So we have road users and path users, and if one believes that there is safety on the bike pathways one needs only to ride on those pathways and meet the difficulties that are confronting the users there. One has the dual area—the roads and the pathways. I think the statistics that I have mentioned here already bear testament to the fact that there is a need for a vigorous campaign and a vigorous program in this area. The strategies go on to talk about `safety audits and identification of blackspots'. It goes on to talk about developing and implementing `behavioural programs/initiatives relating to all road users which improve cyclist safety in areas such as motor vehicle speeds and helmets' and also about establishing and monitoring the casualty rate for cyclists.
Whilst those are all very good objectives, I am putting my complaint about safety on the plate now because it is an issue. Whilst I have not been to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee estimates hearings before, I think I will turn up on the next occasion to pursue this issue, seeing there is such a great interest in it across Australia. When I have flagged with a number of people that I intended to raise this issue in this place, they all expressed their concern at the safety of cyclists in our community. I will be looking to this government and the responsibility that it has—being the senior partner in this strategy, being responsible for the strategy—to ensure that the strategies are being funded properly, that the strategies are working and that there is a reporting of the outcomes.
It was interesting, in the wake of the unfortunate death of Luke Harrop in Queensland, that when the Queensland government held the summit to try and address the immediate problems that arose out of that accident it became quite clear from the participants that one of the major problems being faced by cyclists on the road is the issue of road rage. We should be making cycling a healthier and a safer sport for people to participate in.
We should be ensuring that the government is properly funding this national strategy. Whilst it has a life of 1999 to 2004— and one could say that we are midway through it—one would nonetheless hope that in reading an annual report or reading some of the documentation that is put out one would find some element of federal government funding there. As I have said, to date I have not been able to find that. Maybe it is submerged in some other programs. It may well be a subprogram of one of the major programs under the portfolio. If it is, it is not very clear and it is not very apparent. 
It is an important issue. It is an issue that touches all states of Australia. It is an issue that needs to be addressed seriously We, as either the parliament or the general public, need to be able to identify positive outcomes arising from an initiative which was obviously warmly embraced by not only the federal government but also the various state governments and local governments signing up to the national strategy affecting cyclists in Australia. I look forward to some positive action by the government in the future.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-03-21,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the appropriation bills. I make two very brief points. I accept that Senator Bartlett and the Australian Democrats hold their view sincerely in relation to the boat people situation. Whilst they would ascribe improper motives to us as a government, I would not do that to them but do suggest that, unwittingly, they provide succour and comfort to the criminal elements that engage in people-smuggling.
In relation to Senator Hogg's comments, let me declare an interest as a keen cyclist as well, having just the other Sunday done a 35-kilometre trip. If my history is right, Senator Hogg would follow in the great tradition of another Queensland senator, Senator Ian Wood, who used to ride his pushbike to the office and back. Once you have achieved that, Senator Hogg, we will talk again. Senator Hogg's comments were very interesting. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-21,"—Madam Deputy President, you will be aware that this motion for approval of works within the parliamentary zone was on the agenda this morning. I did say that I wanted to make a short statement before the motion was put through, but it was then put on the Notice Paper for May. I was well enough acquainted with the matter at hand to know that that would have created enormous potential administrative difficulties and, potentially, a threat to the whole of the V8 supercar race. I am not a supporter of that race, but I have been here long enough to know that one does not wittingly thwart the will of the Senate—and I am not doing that; I am now allowing this to proceed.
Had the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, been in the house when this was brought before it this morning, I do not believe this difficulty would have arisen. Had he communicated with me, I do not believe it would have arisen. Had he understood the nature of the motion that is before the house and the timetabling in it—
—He had nothing to do with it. It was all my doing.
—Nevertheless, the minister has carriage of this matter and is responsible for it. It is very clear when you look at the attendant papers that there are certain works that are required to proceed before we come back on budget day, and that is not permissible under the terms of this motion. So Senator Abetz allowed a very important permission from this parliament for works in the parliamentary triangle, required to begin between now and the budget sittings, to await the budget sittings. It is a complete bungle by the government and by Minister Abetz. I could not understand it this morning. Senator Abetz said, `Let's wait until May,' but he had not read the substance of this motion. He put at risk the whole of the race and its timetabling, because I doubt that parliament would have been of a mind to be recalled simply to rectify his oversight. What a way for a minister in charge of an important event like this to fail! The Manager of Government Business is good enough to be shepherding him and saying, `This was a matter in my hands,' but the fact is—
—You are missing the target.
—The target is the government.
—You are in the wrong gear, Bob.
—I am not in the wrong gear at all, and time is ticking away so you had better let me finish what I am saying. Let me sum up the misgivings I have about this particular race. First of all, it is losing money. Last year, it lost $1.5 million, which ultimately comes from the people of the ACT. An amount of $23 million has been allocated to this race over the coming years; that is equivalent to $200 per Canberran. If you look at the figures, you will find that $850,000 is paid this year to a Queensland entity, simply for the rights. Also, when you look at the figures for the first day last year, you see that the bumper return from the first day the year before of 58,000 fell to 39,000. Ticket sales and numbers were down, revenue was down and the race ran at a loss. That is a matter for the government and the ACT administration, but I also want to put on the record that many businesses in and around Canberra, rather than winning from this, lost out. Traffic was significantly disrupted, tourism in the parliamentary triangle was down, noise pollution standards were breached and places like the Lobby restaurant and the Bookplace restaurant at the National Library lost significant business, one would have thought. It is not for us to determine the wherewithal of this race, but it seems to me that there will be more than the losers in the cars who are going to lose out of this race. 
Finally, let me say that the government has manifestly bungled this. It is by the good grace of the Greens that I am back here tonight to allow this to go through, but that is proper form.
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,Parliamentary Zone,50,1
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2002-03-21,"— Earlier this week the Senate considered the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2002. In his speech in the second reading debate on this bill, Senator Carr, as the lead speaker for the opposition, lamented the controversial and deeply divisive debate over private school funding which, in his words, `raged throughout the last parliament' and which, again in his own words, `has wrought such damage to the body politic'. Strangely, Senator Carr did not feel concerned about the damage that debate might have wrought not on the nation's body politic but its `body educational'. Senator Carr was also too modest to mention that he had been the chief architect, lead contractor and principal selling agent of that debate.
But he was right about the potently divisive nature of such a debate, especially when so much misinformation, emotion and fixated opinions can affect its content. Let me demonstrate this with one immediate example provided by Senator Carr himself. On Monday night, as he endeavoured to demonstrate what he saw as the unreasonable support that the government would give to rich schools, Senator Carr cited, under parliamentary privilege, the Reddam House school in Sydney. One of the issues Senator Carr had with Reddam House was that it is associated with three companies that are registered on the ASIC register, none of which is listed as not for profit. To quote verbatim from the Hansard record, Senator Carr said:
Not-for-profit schools are, of course, not eligible for Commonwealth recurrent establishment grants assistance.
Of course, the exact reverse is true. For profit schools are not eligible for Commonwealth recurrent establishment grants assistance. Only not-for-profit schools are eligible. Yet this was not just a Freudian slip by Senator Carr: he then went on and expanded his argument on this point for another 15 minutes. I am not deliberately targeting Senator Carr, because I do not believe Senator Carr sought to mislead the Senate. I think he made a genuine mistake. It was not a casual mistake, however; it was a genuine mistake. He is so wedded to the idea that only government schools should receive public funding, he has transferred his fixation to the idea that non-government schools do not deserve public funding, regardless of their circumstances or their contribution to education. Obviously, if we listen to the debate on this issue, we realise that Senator Carr is not alone in this delusion. This is a great pity because the education of young Australians is the most important and fundamental responsibility of the current generation. The future of our nation and ourselves is tied up with the quality of the education that we give our children. As John F. Kennedy said: 
Think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.
Every Australian parent wants the best possible education for his or her children. It is their right. Part and parcel of this desire is the opportunity for them to have a choice about where their children can receive that education. This also is their right. It is the government's responsibility and obligation to enable parents to make such a choice. 
In discharging this responsibility and obligation, governments should support both public sector education and private sector education. There has never been a federal government that has done more than the Howard government to build up—indeed, rebuild—public sector education while helping and improving the ability of non-government schools to deliver quality education. Since 1996, the Howard government has increased Commonwealth spending on government schools by 36 per cent, through additional funding for national education programs in literacy, numeracy, science and indigenous education, as well as through indexation arrangements that top up Commonwealth funding at significantly more than the inflation rate. It has been the state governments—responsible for 88 per cent of funding for government schools—that have been lagging in education funding. For example, in its last budget, the Labor Victorian government increased funding for government schools by less than two per cent, while the Commonwealth increased its share of funding by more than 5½ per cent.
While funding is important, the Howard government has been equally successful in another essential policy area: that is, building community confidence in all schools by funding support and by raising the standards of education these schools provide. Over the last two years I have had the great pleasure and privilege of visiting 57 schools in Victoria: government schools; non-government schools; inner suburban schools; country schools; schools with over 1,000 students; one school with just 70 students; historic schools dating from the 19th century with some of the same buildings still in use; brand-new schools; Catholic schools; Islamic schools; infant schools; senior schools with a VET focus; senior schools with a successful academic focus; senior schools with both. All these schools share one common feature: in every one of them I found dedicated teachers, committed parents, supportive community participants and confident and interested children. Truly, in such schools private hopes and dreams are fulfilled and translated into benefits for all and strength for our nation.
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I have listened very carefully to what Senator Tchen has had to say. He clearly reads the Hansard much more carefully than I do. I must acknowledge that he is correct: there was an error in the speech that I made. The words `for profit' should replace the words `not-for-profit'. I seek leave of the Senate to have the record corrected.
Leave granted.
—I thank Senator Carr for correcting the record. He probably should have done it earlier.
—I didn't know about it.
—He didn't know what he said. I pay tribute to all the teachers, parents, members of school councils, parents and friends associations and other supporters of those 57 schools I visited. Young Australians are, indeed, in good hands. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of the 57 schools, together with their localities and the names of their principals.
Leave granted.
