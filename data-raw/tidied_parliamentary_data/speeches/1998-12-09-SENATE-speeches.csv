"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—by leave—I move:
(1)	 Clause 9, page 9 (after line 5), after subclause (3), insert:
	 (3A)	 The Minister for Finance and Administration must not make a declaration under this section in respect of a transfer of assets unless the arrangements for the transfer specify the responsibilities of parties to the transfer for any community service obligations under section 15A.
(2)	 Page 10 (after line 26), after clause 12, insert:
Part 2A—National Transmission Network Reserve
12A Establishment of the National Transmission Network Reserve
	 (1)	 A fund called the National Transmission Network Reserve is established.
	 (2)	 The Reserve is a component of the Reserved Money Fund under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 .
	 (3)	 The purpose of the Reserve is to make payments for subsidising the costs of community and national broadcasting services in transferring to digital broadcasting.
12B Payments into the Reserve
		 There is to be paid into the Reserve in any financial year an amount equal to any amount received by the Commonwealth as a result of a transfer of assets under section 9 (either directly or indirectly in any form including shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares) in that financial year.
12C Payments out of the Reserve
	 (1)	 Amounts in the Reserve are to be applied for the purpose of assisting community and national broadcasting services to transfer to digital broadcasting.
	 (2)	 Amounts in the Reserve may also be applied for the payment of carriage fees and fees for access to sites or telecommunications transmission towers on behalf of a customer who is a nominated customer because of subsection 15(3) or (6).
	 (3)	 Total payments out of the Reserve in any financial year must not be less than payments into the Reserve in that year.
	 (4)	 The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts is to decide what proportion of the fund in any year is to be applied for the assistance of national broadcasting services and what proportion is to be applied for the assist 
 ance of community broadcasting services, provided that not less than 5% of the fund in any year is to be applied for the assistance of community broadcasting services.
12D Investments and income of the Reserve
	 (1)	 So far as is practicable, money in the Reserve that is not required for the purpose of making payments out of the Reserve is to be invested in accordance with the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 .
	 (2)	 Amounts equal to income derived from the investment of money in the Reserve are to be transferred to the Reserve from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
12E Payments
		 Amounts required or permitted to be paid under this Act are to be paid out of money appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose.
The Democrats have several amendments to the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1998  and the National Transmission Network Sale (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998  and have several questions for the minister as well. Both the first and the second Democrat amendments relate to the establishment of a National Transmission Network Reserve. This would be a fund to hold the money that comes in from any sale under this act. The money that is so held would be allocated by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts for the purpose of mainly digitisation of the national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. A maximum of five per cent of the fund would be to assist the community sector in changing to digital, and the rest could also be used for various other purposes which would include payment of carriage fees and fees for access to sites or telecommunications transmission towers on behalf of customers.
The nominated customers—the ABC, SBS, community broadcasters, emergency service organisations, commercial broadcasters in declared remote areas, non-profit bodies and any government bodies—could have their fees paid by the government through this fund as well. I think the government estimates at the moment that the money that would come in from the sale would be between $200 million and $300 million—I do not have it down 
 here, but I think that is right. Perhaps the minister could enlighten us.
As we all know, the amount of money that the ABC will need to transfer to digital for both their broadcasting and their transmission facilities has been estimated by Arthur Andersen in the report to be about $180 million. If they sell off as much of their property as they possibly can, which I think is a very bad idea—and, if I recall, Arthur Andersen thought it was a very bad idea as well—they would need anywhere between $84 million and $108 million. Obviously that money has to come from somewhere.
At the moment, the government has promised $21 million plus about another $22 million or $23 million, which comes nowhere near $180 million or even $84 million. It seems to us that this would be the most sensible way and, indeed, the easiest way to make sure that both the national broadcasters and the community broadcasters have the funds that they will definitely need—it has to happen—to transfer their television to digital. Then, of course, there will be the extra funds that will be needed to transfer radio to digital. That has not even been decided yet. We have not seen that legislation yet. There are no standards yet for that.
Having the fund in reserve as an amount of money which could be used to do all those things seems to us to be an eminently sensible way of doing it. The minister, Senator Alston, did say during the digital bill that the government would fund the ABC to transfer to digital. The money has to come from somewhere. We think that, if this is put aside for where the money comes from, everybody—the ABC, SBS, community broadcast listeners and workers—will feel a lot more sure, a lot more certain, that digitisation of the national broadcasters and of community broadcasters will be able to happen smoothly. There will be a lot more certainty about it than there is at the moment.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—The proposition put by the Democrats is, in summary, to accept the proceeds of the sale, squirrel it 
 away for a few years and hypothecate it towards the expenditure that will be required on the roll-out of the digital network for the ABC and SBS. As Senator Bourne has said, the Commonwealth has already made undertakings in relation to the funding of that roll-out. Simply put, it is a three-stage process—but I am sure there are lots of substages in those three stages—and it will occur over a number of years. It will probably be at least five years, and some parts of the roll-out could take even longer than that.
This government shares the view of the previous government. The Labor government, as I recall, year after year stood firm against the concept of hypothecation. The Commonwealth has made it clear that, with a couple of small exceptions, we intend to use the proceeds of the sale for debt repatriation which will help the Commonwealth budget and assist us in meeting our commitments on a range of issues—in particular, commitments in relation to the future roll-out of digital for the ABC and the SBS. We think there is no solid case to create this form of hypothecation in this matter.
In terms of the sale proceeds, Senator Bourne asked what the estimates were. A number of public estimates have floated around. They depend on an enormous number of variables. We considered some discussions, and I am probably foreshadowing what Senator Harradine might ask in future about controls over foreign ownership potential. We looked at what might occur if you sought to put a range of different restrictions on foreign ownership, and the potential sale proceeds varied enormously. I am using this as an example of the sorts of considerations you would have to take into account when placing a value on the network. Effectively, the network could be unsaleable with some constrictions placed on it and, therefore, the market value of it could go down to zero. So I would not like to speculate on a price.
We have had a number of bidders who have shown interest in the network, but it is a process of talking to the bidders, talking through the process of the sale, finalising the sale procedures and documentation and then seeing what comes out. So I think it would be 
 highly speculative, almost hypothetical and unhelpful to mention any figures. It could fall anywhere between $100 million and $500 million. Senator Bourne mentioned two or three figures in her speech in the debate. We would hope the higher end of the scale, from the Commonwealth's point of view, would be found.
That fundamentally is the reason the coalition opposes this proposal by the Democrats. I know it is very well intended, but the Commonwealth has already made it quite clear in its statements that we will be funding the digital conversion of the ABC. As I understand it, we have already made some forward estimates in relation to some of those aspects, which shows our bona fides in this regard.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-12-09,"—The opposition has considered the amendments and the background brief circulated by Senator Bourne from the Democrats. We have been persuaded by the merit of her argument that the moneys necessary—whether it be $100 million or $200 million—for the digital conversion process for the national broadcasters should be allocated and set aside. Accordingly, we will support this amendment when it comes to a vote.
I do have a question of Senator Campbell in a similar vein and it relates to the second and third five-year periods. In the bill before us, the government has undertaken to guarantee funding for broadcasting or transmission costs for the ABC and the SBS in the first five years. Would the government care to comment on its current intentions in relation to guaranteeing or otherwise the transmission costs for the national broadcasters in the second and third five-year periods?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—The ABC, as Senator Bishop has picked up, has the option to renew those contracts out to 15 years. As far as the funding goes, the Commonwealth does forward projections of its budget out to four years. I do not think we have gone out to five years yet, and I do not think any previous government has committed 
 funding of any program beyond four years at this stage.
We have actually gone beyond that with the ABC and committed to five years in respect of this relatively small proportion of their budget. To ask us to go out to 15 years would be unprecedented. I am sure the people at the ABC would love to have some sort of forward commitment of 15 years. I know that the previous government certainly gave no undertakings to the ABC about any of their funding certainty for more than three years—four years at the absolute most. Our giving them five years security, safety and comfort in relation to this relatively small aspect of their budget has given them a lot of certainty to ensure the transmission is a smooth one. To ask us to go out to 15 years would be unprecedented.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I acknowledge the point made by Senator Campbell. The issue that arises is that, if this bill goes through in its current form and the National Transmission Agency is owned and managed in private hands, the consequences are that in significant parts of outlying Australia—regional Australia—there will be a private monopoly that has effective control of transmission and broadcasting services. Our concern is that the ABC and the SBS will no longer be able to rely on provision of service by a government agency or instrumentality but will have to take the rate that is set by that private agency in the second and third and subsequent five-year periods.
It appears to us that if the agency is going from being a public monopoly to a private monopoly, it is only proper that that private monopoly will seek to maximise its interests for return to its shareholders. And that is best achieved by extracting monopoly rents from recipients—the ABC, the SBS and other community broadcasters—in those second and third five-year periods.
I note that the government says that it is unable to commit for periods post four years. In this situation, in five years time, the two national broadcasters may or may not have received adequate funding to convert to digital broadcasting. Then in the final 12 
 months, when they sit down to have their negotiations to guarantee transmission services with the new private owner, that private owner will be able to extract monopoly rents from the ABC, the SBS and any other interested community broadcasters. That is of great concern to the opposition. We seek undertakings from the government that the agency will not be able to extract those monopoly rents.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I can give that undertaking. The point that needs to be made very clearly in this Committee of the Whole today is that the rate is actually set now for 15 years. It is a bit like the rent at Centenary House, Senator Bishop, except the escalation factor at Centenary House that gets charged to the taxpayer through the Auditor-General's office escalates at a factor of nine per cent per annum. The rate of escalation in the contract for 15 years between the NTA and the broadcasters is actually set at an escalation factor that is below the CPI. So the rate is already set.
The point that should be made is that the ABC will have market power on its side. It will have a contract. I guess if you took a picture of the NTA you would see a lot of aerials and towers and wires and nuts and bolts, but what you are really selling is the income stream from the contracts, and the Commonwealth is putting that in place. I guess it is a bit like an office building: people look at office buildings and think you are selling the bricks and mortar; you are not really, you are selling an income stream from the tenants. The tenants in this case are the ABC and the SBS. They have a 15-year contract, but the option is on the side of the ABC. So the ABC and the SBS actually have the market power at the end of the five years. The NTA have got to be responsive to their needs in terms of the digital roll-out and their maintenance contracts and so forth.
This is a competitive marketplace. As we have seen with the revolution in technology, there are new networks being rolled out very regularly. We have just had in the last 
 month—I am not saying the technology is compatible for TV transmissions, but we have had a new low earth orbiting satellite network established—entirely foreign owned but providing a fantastic transmission service for satellite telephone users in Australia. There will be other networks in place for TV transmission. Providers of transmission services will be competing for contracts, so if the price that is put forward by the privatised NTA is not competitive with what the ABC and SBS and other broadcasters can find in the marketplace, then they will lose the contract. But in terms of the guarantees of the price, they are set in place now. The ABC could actually exercise the double five-year option. Their price is guaranteed for 15 years, regardless. I am informed that that is with an escalation factor which is below the CPI which, as you and I both know, is extremely low at the moment.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—On the same subject, this new version of the bill changes the contracts that the minister was talking about from two five-year contracts to three three-year contracts. When I was talking to the department about that, they said it was to coincide with the national broadcaster's triennial funding arrangements. The ABC do not seem to think they have a triennial funding arrangement with this government and that this government has not been forthcoming in giving them very much certainty about anything at all really. The triennial funding is one thing that the ABC do not think the government has given them much certainty about.
Can the minister tell me whether he believes the ABC have a triennial funding arrangement with the government at the moment? If they do—or even if they don't—when would these three three-year contracts start? Would they start as soon as this bill goes through and, therefore, in the middle of what I believe the government thinks is a triennial funding arrangement, and then go to the middle of another triennial funding arrangement somewhere in the future? Or would it start with the beginning of the next triennial funding arrangement? Or does the government believe—as I believe the ABC do—that there 
 is no triennial funding arrangement at the moment at all?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—Mr Chairman, through you to Senator Bourne: I am informed that the contract negotiations are taking place at the moment. I guess they will pay cognisance to the progress of this legislation and the progress of the sale, but the contract negotiations in some respects are happening anyway.
There is, I am advised, reference in the explanatory memorandum about the renewal periods. I think originally the ABC was seeking five plus five plus five, and there is a reference in the new EM to three plus three plus three that reflects the state of what the ABC wants. I think in my references previously I was speaking of five plus five plus five, but it is in fact three plus three plus three. It since has gone back to five plus five plus five, I am informed, at the ABC's request. So the EM is out of date. I was out of date, back to date and up to date again.
So those contract negotiations are taking place. At the moment, they include a five plus five plus five; that is what the ABC is seeking. As you would know better than most in this place, the triennial funding cycle for the ABC is into its second year at the moment, so we are roughly halfway through or just past the halfway mark in a triennial funding cycle.
I think that is really all I can say—that the ABC seem to be happy to look at a five plus five plus five. But I put the view that the ABC are in a strong position in these negotiations; they are the people who have the market power here. The NTN will not be worth very much in a few years time if the ABC say, `Look, sorry, we can get a better deal from another transmission network.' So the National Transmission Network will need to look after its customer in this respect.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-12-09,"—On that point: the earlier point I raised related mainly to the issue of private monopolies and perhaps the fear of extraction of monopoly rents in outlying states and regional and rural areas. In the 
 seventh paragraph of your second reading speech on the National Transmission Network Sale Bill, you stated:
In the medium term, we recognise that there is likely to remain limited competition in the transmission services market, especially outside major metropolitan centres.
That suggests to the opposition somewhere in excess of five and less than seven or eight; that there is not to be the great wealth of competition that you might have outlined; and, hence, there is more meat, if you like, in negotiations for the ABC. I again return to the point in terms of funding in those second and third five-year periods in light of the government's own comments in the second reading speech.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I will make a couple of quick points. Firstly, the government recognises that in some parts of the marketplace and some parts geographically of Australia, competition will not be as strong as it is, for example, in a densely populated metropolitan area. That is why the bill and the government's telecommunications regulatory regime generally—but particularly in relation to this bill—have picked up an access regime which I think is overseen by the ACCC in a similar way to the handling of some other telecommunications infrastructure. So that is required there.
But also the negotiations between the ABC and the NTN I think have been conducted to date on the basis of a package for the whole of Australia. That, I would imagine, would be the practical reality of future negotiations. As I said in my summing up of the speeches in the second reading debate in this place last night, funding for the expansion of the network has always been an on budget funding decision year by year by governments, and that will continue to be the case. If there is a need to expand the network, the government will have to fund that.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-09,"—I think this is an appropriate stage to ask the committee a question and be informed by the minister about what the government 
 intends in respect of funding assistance for, for example, community broadcasters and the transmission costs which they need to bear. I—and I imagine a number of other senators—have received representations about these matters. I have received representations from Ros and John Langlois, from Don Wing MLC and a number of others about this question. They have indicated that they have taken the opportunity—which I will do now—of reminding the committee of what Senator Alston wrote to the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia. He wrote:
. . . irrespective of the means used to address this problem, the security of the community sector, including affordable access to the means of delivering services, is our objective.
I wonder whether the minister would kindly let the committee know what deliberations the government has had on that matter in the last few days. Would he be able to enlighten us about its intentions in this regard?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I am happy to respond to that because it is an area of concern for the government. Honourable senators would know that, in May of this year, the minister announced an annual grant of $30,000 to the Community Broadcasting Foundation. That funding was effectively to pick up any difference between a subsidised or cross-subsidised rate and the commercial rates that are being applied—firstly, since the NTA has been corporatised and, ultimately, if and when it is privatised.
There are a number of organisations—and, Senator Harradine, I think probably all of us have received submissions from them—some of which are not on NTA sites at the moment but seeking access to them, which actually have commercial arrangements already on private sites. But, as I have said, they are seeking access to NTA sites because the coverage is better in some circumstances.
Based on the commitments that Senator Harradine has referred to and the government's commitment to ensuring that the community broadcasting sector does have access at reasonable rates to these facilities, 
 the government has announced—and I announce formally today—that we will be increasing the annual grant to the CBF, the Community Broadcasting Foundation, by a further $50,000. So that will take its annual funding up to $80,000. On the estimations that we have, that should ensure that across Australia those organisations will have access, at similar rates to those they are on at the moment, to NTA sites where they are required. So we understand that funding will, Senator Harradine, allay any fears.
The feedback we have had from those broadcasters is that they are very supportive of this measure and they agree with the government's contention that the extra $50,000 will fund any gap—probably not a good word to use at the moment with the health debate taking place. That should plug the funding hole, let us call it, for those very important community broadcasters. I am happy to formally announce the $50,000 annual increase going to the Community Broadcasting Foundation.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—That is good news for community broadcasters, but I have just one final plea on these two amendments. Although the government says it will fully fund the ABC to broadcast and transmit in digital, the ABC has not had the background to believe that. I have not seen the background to believe that they will be fully funded. I fervently hope that is the case.
I think that everybody in here knows that Mr Mansfield recommended a couple of years ago that $500 million was the absolute base for running a national radio and television network. The government is now giving the ABC, I think, $467 million or $468 million without the orchestras, which Mr Mansfield did not include. So that is way below the $500 million that even Mr Mansfield thought was the minimum that was needed. The ABC is not getting that.
The ABC required $180 million. They estimated that it was about $180 million to transfer their metropolitan and rural television networks to digital for both broadcasting and transmitting. The government—I am sure, not because it did not believe them but because 
 it wanted to have the ABC backed up—asked Arthur Anderson to check on that. Arthur Anderson came up with a report that agreed with the ABC, which said that the ABC would need $180 million to transfer over to digital. I know that is the whole amount, and I know the government is telling us that, yes, it has promised $21 million—$21 million is nowhere near $180 million—and that, yes, it has promised another, I think, $23 million or $24 million. We are still up to about $44 million or $45 million or something like that—still nowhere $180 million.
The ABC and Arthur Anderson confirmed this. They said that if they sold a lot of their own property, if they got rid of their facilities and if they cut themselves down to a skeleton for broadcasting and transmitting, then they would need only $84 million to, I think, $108 million to properly transfer over digital broadcasting. Digital broadcasting is coming. We have already had that bill through the Senate, and it will happen. All commercial and free-to-air broadcasters will go over to digital broadcasting for television, and the ABC requires a great deal more funding than this government has promised them.
I take the point that that is only the first stage, but the money has to come from somewhere. If the money is coming from the government anyway, I cannot see any reason why the government cannot say, `Okay, this is where it will come from. If there is more in this fund'—the minister hands out the money after all—`than is needed for the national broadcasters to go over to digital broadcasting, then it will go into consolidated revenue.' The government is going to do that anyway. The government tells us that it is going to fully fund the ABC and the SBS to transfer over anyway, and I am glad to hear the news about community broadcasters.
If that is going to happen anyway and if there is a great deal of unease out there in ABC listener land—which is somewhere that I live—amongst ABC watchers and listeners, especially in rural and regional areas, about whether there will be adequate funding and whether they will be able to go over to digital at all, especially in regional and rural areas, why cannot this parliament say, `This is 
 something that we want to be sure of. We want to demonstrate that the government is absolutely true to its word. Here is the money'? The government says it is going to give the money to the ABC and SBS anyway, and we have heard the promises about community broadcasting. When digital has been achieved, anything that is on top of this will go back into consolidated revenue, which is where the money would have come from anyway. Everybody out there watching and listening to the ABC would be so thankful and happy that they may even vote for the government next time around.
This would demonstrate to all of us who are so fearful about the future of the ABC—and there are a great many people out there who are really fearful—that this government actually does have its heart in the right place with respect to the ABC, that this government is prepared to put in absolutely full funding for the digitisation of ABC television at least. This will ensure that everybody in Australia—rural, regional and metropolitan—will be able to watch ABC television well into the next century after the digitisation has gone through.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I will just make a few comments, because it is a very important issue. I will reiterate what the government has done to date. We have agreed to provide $20 million in real terms over the next five years and to meet any outstanding debt incurred by the ABC for phase 1 of the upgrade of its facilities and equipment from analog to digital. That $20 million goes to what is happening inside the studios. It is an extremely small component of the whole process.
I do not think anyone in the ABC would be able to tell you within tens of millions of dollars what the conversion will cost. It is a highly complex, lengthy process to shift across to digital for television, and for radio down the track. The government will provide $16.9 million in real terms over five years to the SBS to assist with phase 1 of their upgrade of equipment and facilities. The govern 
 ment has also indicated that it will give consideration to additional funding for the second and third phases—that is, the internal signal reticulation and the transmission costs of both broadcasters once these costs are more certain. As I said, there is incredible uncertainty about what will take place, and the government needs to make independent assessments of what those costs are.
The digital TV act—and I think this is an important point—places an obligation on the national broadcasters to participate in the digital television conversion process and the government will provide them with funding to meet these statutory obligations. In other words, the government has required them under that act to do these things. We have an obligation, which I am restating today, to fund them to do that.
The problem with this hypothecation, which the Labor Party opposed vigorously for 13 years in government, is that, two and a bit years into opposition, they have all of a sudden chucked out of the window here today the principle that they stood by in relation to every single policy. They have said: `Right, we will chuck out what was a sound principle,' because it suits their short-term political ends. But that is, I guess, the game they are in at the moment. If you haven't got a long-term policy you just have to play the game kick by kick.
For the rest of the Senate, who think about these things more seriously in the long term, I make a couple of points. Let us presume—and I put the word `presume' in great big capitals and underline it for the sake of Hansard and for the sake of any potential bidders who might be paying attention to this debate; I am sure all of them are—that the income from the sale is only $150 million and the cost of digital conversion is a couple of hundred million dollars. You still have to go to the budget to find the change.
Let us go to the other alternative and say that the fund has in it a couple of hundred million dollars, and the cost of conversions is only $150 million. Your amendment, Senator Bourne, makes no allowance for what would happen with the other $50 million. There is actually a drafting mistake there which would 
 ensure that any balance in the fund will have to sit there forever. That highlights the problem of hypothecation. It is very hard to make an arrangement, particularly in this circumstance. I know that people like to say, `Let's put road taxes into road funding.' I guess that is a more direct relationship because building roads is something that governments around the country need to do every day of every week.
—That's what you fellows used to say in opposition.
—I know we did. And you always said, `No hypothecation.'
—It's amazing how it changes. So we are both consistent.
—That's right. Both have had to cross the Rubicon, or cross the road. This highlights the problem. I guess that with hypothecating road taxes with road expenditure, at least road expenditure is something that takes place every day somewhere around the country, even if it is not on the Sydney orbital at the moment. But with this, you are looking into a process and a program of expenditure and infrastructure upgrade which will take place over at least the next five years and probably the next seven to 10 years in relation to all of the networks.
We really have only the vaguest idea of the sort of expenditure that will be incurred. We have picked up this asset, which has some sort of link to the whole process, but only very tenuous, and said: `Somewhere between $100 million and $300 million might come out of the NTN sale and setting up digital might cost somewhere between $100 million and a couple of hundred million, so let's take the money out of this and give it to that and set up some sort of fund but not make any provision or have any discussion as to what happens if the fund falls short.'
Obviously we will have to go back to the budget anyway. The cabinet is going to have to make decisions about where the money comes from out of this fund, so a decision is still going to be made, even though you have said that the money from this fund can only 
 be spent on certain things and so we can't use it for anything else. But ultimately a minister or the cabinet is going to have to make a decision to spend the money and, I presume, if there is not enough money in the fund they will have to find some other money, which is exactly the situation we are in at the moment.
What we have done, to reiterate, Senator Bourne, is to place an obligation on the national broadcasters to convert, which is the only practical thing we can do. We can make a core promise to say that we will spend X million dollars, but it really is meaningless until we know what the requirements are. The ABC are assessing that at the moment. I think it is a messy way to go about it. I don't think it is going to help the ABC. I don't think it is going to assist people who live in ABC listener land, like I do—for those of you who want to meet Christopher Lawrence from ABC Classic FM, he will be at the ABC shop tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock—but I don't think it is going to make any of us more comfortable about the ABC. It is a big process they are going through. I think it is a noble intent of Senator Bourne's but it is a very messy, and ultimately unproductive, way to go about it.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—I don't want to take up the time of the Senate. I know we have other amendments to go through, but this is probably one of the subjects I feel most strongly about. The minister tells us this is exactly the situation we are in at the moment, where you would have to look for more money. But the point about this is that whatever money comes out of the sale would have to go first to the ABC and, after digitisation is completed—and there is a finite time when it will be—then anything left over would obviously go into consolidated revenue. The government has hundreds of funds around the place. There is a heritage fund. There are funds all over the place. Money just doesn't sit there forever. That is silly—of course it just doesn't sit there forever.
Friends of the ABC, people who listen and people who watch have noticed that the ABC has been downgraded in the last two years. The reason for that is that it is not getting 
 enough funding. Nobody trusts this government to fund the ABC correctly. There is a very good reason for that. There is an excellent reason for that. They are not doing it. The minister said that the government has—and this is excellent—promised $20.7 million, not $20 million, for the first stage of digitisation and they will cover any further ones. I think that brings it up to between $44 million and $46 million. That is nowhere near what will be needed.
I hope that the government will take out of consolidated revenue—if this amendment doesn't go through—the money that is needed by the ABC and the SBS to fully digitise. But it would be an awfully easy thing for the government to do, if it really wanted to destroy the ABC, to just not quite fund them enough, to just not give them quite enough money so they couldn't quite digitise enough, so they couldn't quite get it out there to all those rural and regional areas, so the service would have to be downgraded all over the country, so that the signal would not be as strong as it is—and it is not strong enough as it is. The ABC has already been given the cruddy end of the spectrum. I am sure that will happen again. It would be so easy for that to happen.
I am sure there are an awful lot of people out there—and I am one—who do not trust this government to properly fund the ABC in any way whatsoever. This would give at least some certainty to all those people who are worried about the funding of the ABC, who are worried that the signal will be downgraded because there is not enough money to digitise properly. Then we would have the same problem that we have with digital and analog telephones, and it is a real problem.
The minister mentioned that an independent assessment has been made, as far as we know, by the Arthur Andersen report, and they came up with the same answer as the ABC. The ABC have been proven to know what they are talking about on this issue. Nobody knows the exact amount that will be needed for digitisation, but neither did they know with the commercial broadcasters when the commercial broadcasters insisted that it would cost them between $500 million and $750 million for 
 the three of them—I think $750 million was the top end; it is now accepted to be around $500 million for full digitisation—and the government just accepted that.
I remember Senator Alston standing there, having just accepted those figures, saying, `Okay, the commercial broadcasters say that it has to go through. It will cost them this much money. We accept that figure, and we have to work with that.' Why don't we just accept what the ABC is saying? Sure, it will be a little bit different. Sure, nobody knows how much it will cost, but if the word of the commercial broadcasters is good enough for this government I do not understand why the word of the ABC is not, especially when the commercial broadcasters have not been independently tested by the government the way the ABC has. The ABC has been independently tested with the Arthur Andersen report and found to be correct.
I am sure we all remember that the Arthur Andersen report said they did not think it was a very good idea for the ABC to sell off all its facilities in order to digitise. I do not think it is a very good idea either. I do not recall insisting that all the commercial broadcasters sell off facilities. No, we are making sure that they have a very certain atmosphere in which to digitise.
I will not take up the time of the Senate any longer, but I have to say that a bit of certainty about the funding of digitisation on the part of this government would go down very well with all those people who are going to turn up at 6 o'clock tomorrow morning to the Canberra Centre to say hello to Christopher Lawrence and have a bite to eat. I certainly hope to do that, and I think I will see the minister there.
—For breakfast?
—Yes, Senator Harradine, breakfast is  included. I think all of those people who are interested in the fate of the ABC want to see certainty. They have not seen it so far in the life of this government. If there is one thing in the life of this government that you can be sure of, it is that the ABC will be bashed and underfunded. If we can make sure that there is funding that is guaranteed to some extent at least for this, I 
 am sure that would go over extremely well with ABC listeners and ABC watchers.
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—by leave—I move Australian Democrat amendments (3) and (4):
(3)	 Clause 14, page 11 (lines 24 to 26), omit subparagraph (iii).
(4)	 clause 14, page 12 (lines 10 to 17), omit subclauses (2) and (3).
These two amendments, which I circulated only yesterday, relate to the difference between analog and digital and the responsibilities of the NTN in the bill. That has just been put into the bill in its newest form. It was not in the old bill that we looked at in the last parliament. I cannot find my notes, so I will try to explain to the Senate what I think happened.
The old bill did not include a difference between digital and analog, although this was in the explanatory memorandum. This is coming out of my head, so it may well be wrong, and I ask the minister to tell me if it is. I think the explanatory memorandum said that it was intended to be analog and that digital will be picked up in the digital conversion bill, which went through last session. The digital conversion bill did not pick it up to the extent that we had hoped. I think that is why it has now been put into this bill. What worries me, though, is that the digital act, while providing some access to sites, is not clear enough. It is not clear what the regime will be if this bill goes through in its present form after the changeover from analog to digital. If I could get the minister to give me an explanation of that, that would certainly clarify it for me.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I am happy to do so. The analog transmission services component of the access regime in this bill is intended to provide a safety net for nominated customers who currently have analog transmission service arrangements with the NTA. These customers will have their existing contracts carried over to the new owner of the NTN, with the existing terms 
 and conditions and rights to review those contracts for a total cumulative period of approximately 15 years.
In negotiating the renewal of these contracts, the nominated customers will have the added statutory protection of an analog transmission services access regime. So the existing regime gets transferred across to ensure that the contracts can be renewed on reasonable terms and conditions. The nominated customers will be able to purchase new digital transmission services in a competitive market either from the new owner of the NTN or from an alternative service provider. The digital TV act gives both the ABC and SBS as well as commercial television broadcasters a statutory right of access to NTN and other broadcasting transmission sites to install their own digital television transmitters or to contract with alternative transmission service providers to install transmitters on their behalf.
The NTN Sale Bill gives the ABC, SBS, RPH licensees and other nominated customers a guaranteed right of access to NTN transmission sites to install digital radio transmitters. Self-help groups will also have a guaranteed right of access to NTN sites to install digital radio or television transmitters. Any specific issues relating to access to broadcasting sites for the delivery of digital radio services will be considered by the government in developing a legislative scheme for the introduction of digital radio in Australia.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for that. That is basically the problem. It looks as though the original explanatory memorandum and legislation—and let me know if this is not the case—do not quite match up with the new legislation. The original explanatory memorandum said in part 3 that it was not to cover digital television. It said that issues of access in relation to this would be looked at in the context of the digital legislation, which of course has now gone through. But that legislation did not limit itself to analog services. It deals with access to services and to physical facilities. So it is access to the sites, the towers and what is there already.
When the digital legislation came in, clause 50 only covered access to sites and towers. So we are still only looking at access to sites and towers. We all took that to mean that the access regime to services—the services that the NTN bill mentions—would not be displaced at all and would remain in place. The department said, when they were talking to us and when they were talking to the ABC as well, I understand, that digital transmission services would still be covered by the NTN bill. So, of course, we all worked on that assumption.
But the effect of the new bill, while it may be consistent with the original explanatory memorandum, is to leave no access regime for delivery of digital services anywhere. In all other areas where we are looking at delivery of services, the referee, the ACCC, makes sure that prices and conditions are kept fair. But that is not included in this because digital is taken out and we are only looking at analog. So after digital comes in, that goes away.
Where the NTC is in a monopoly position, the ABC and SBS will be at a disadvantage. That is especially true, as Senator Bishop mentioned earlier, in regional areas where there may be no competitor at all for the ABC or SBS to be able to take up a service with. Unlike the commercial channels, the ABC and SBS have no transmission structure themselves. The NTN is currently their transmission structure. That is how they are able to get their signal out. They have no transmission structure to bring to the table to try to make it fair. The ACCC is not involved in this.
While the ABC, SBS and community broadcasters do get access to the sites under the digital act—that is, the physical site—they have to deal site by site and they have to develop their own service arrangement. I understand that they would prefer to buy services themselves, and the current analog contract is also service based. So that is more realistically how they would like to act to buy transmission services.
The question really is: if digital is not included and there is no arbiter who will make sure that the whole situation is fair and 
 reasonable, why should we leave digital in there when it is inconsistent with the digital act and with what I believe was really the intention of the government in the first place in the spirit of the first act—that is, to have a fair and reasonable access regime for the ABC and SBS? If we take out the word `analog' and leave it so it could be digital or analog, then that would seem to me to be at least a safety net. I know the minister has mentioned that himself and is interested in making it fair and reasonable.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I have listened to the arguments and we do not think there is any inconsistency. The government's regime is to provide an access regime for the sites as opposed to the transmission services. That is a regime that will apply across the industry—that is, the site access regime—which will be overseen by the ACCC.
We think that is fair to not only all transmission broadcasters but also all site owners. If you were to create a special access regime to transmission services, you would create distortions for both the transmitters and for the broadcasting community. The regime is in fact consistent with the digital TV act. It was always the government's intention—I think it was slightly unclear, and we made it clearer—that we wanted an access regime in relation to the sites so the ABC, SBS and other people can get clear, fair access to sites. We do not want to distort it by giving a special deal on transmission services.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—I just want to make sure that I have this straight.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I will be corrected if I am wrong, but I understand 
 that the digital TV act will set up an access regime and arbitration regime in relation to transmission. This act—this is why we are trying to create a clear distinction—puts in place an access regime and the arbitration that goes with that through the ACCC in relation to the sites.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—Does that mean that, because it has been taken out, because it just says `analog' in this, and because this bill comes later, that does not in any way affect the access of the ABC and SBS to the ACCC as the arbiter to decide whether or not they get fair and reasonable access?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I am informed that the digital TV act makes it quite clear—and I think it is actually spelled out in plain English—that it overrides anything in this act in relation to site access.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—by leave—I move Democrats amendments Nos 5 and 6:
(5)	 Clause 15, page 12 (after line 31), after subclause (3), insert:
	 (3A)	 A community broadcasting licensee is a nominated customer for the purposes of:
		 (a)	 the carriage of broadcasting services on a non-profit basis for community and educational purposes; and
		 (b)	 access to sites or telecommunications transmission towers for purposes connected with a community broadcasting service.
(6)	 Page 13 (after line 27), after clause 15, insert:
15A  Community service obligations
	 (1)	 This section establishes community service obligations for the benefit of certain customers.
	 (2)	 If a customer is a nominated customer because of subsections 15(3), (3A), (4) or (6), any fees for access to sites or telecommunications transmission towers which are payable by that customer must 
 be worked out in accordance with an approved marginal cost pricing formula and any terms and conditions of access must be specified in a written contract.
	 (3)	 If a customer is a nominated customer because of subsection 15(3) or (6), any fees for carriage of broadcasting services are the responsibility of the Commonwealth.
	 (4)	 The Minister must determine an approved marginal cost pricing formula for the purpose of subsection (2).
	 (5)	 A determination under subsection (4) is a disallowable instrument.
I have discussed my amendments Nos 5 and 6 with the department, and the parliamentary secretary has got back to me with some notes relating to community broadcasting licensees which really clarify who is included in that. The parliamentary secretary does have some notes to put on the record, I understand, about this. And I think if he does intend to put on the record the same notes that I have got, that would take away the necessity for even moving those amendments. So, if we can listen to the parliamentary secretary, we may be able to get through this a bit faster.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—Democrats amendment No. 5 relates to the extension of the transmission services component of the access regime to community broadcasting licensees, as I understand it. The transmission service component of the access regime in this bill applies to the ABC, SBS, RPH community licensees and self-help groups, who currently have analog transmission service arrangements with the NTA. The NTN Sale Bill gives community broadcasters a right of access to NTN sites and towers to install analog or digital transmitters. This provides statutory protection for their existing site access arrangements. It is not necessary to give community broadcasters a statutory right of access to transmission services provided by the new owner of the NTN, given that they do not currently require these transmission services from the NTA.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
—Amendment No. 6 is my final amendment. This is the one relating to community service obligations, and it just extends community service obligations a little from where they are in the bill. I believe the extension would be sensible. If I could get an explanation from the parliamentary secretary about how far he believes the community service obligations go and why he believes that they are adequate—and I am sure he does—I think that would be helpful.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I think Democrats amendment No. 1, which was not successful in the committee of the whole, also relates to this issue. I think amendment No. 1 would have prevented the sale of the NTN unless certain things were done, unless fees payable by community broadcasting licensees, emergency service providers, et cetera, were determined by a marginal pricing formula which was set out in a disallowable instrument.
The Commonwealth makes the point here that we would prefer to fund this area in a transparent way in the budget. One of the ways we have sought to do that was the establishment of the Community Broadcasting Foundation, which we have explicitly and transparently funded to the tune of $80,000 a year to assist those community broadcasters. If some future government were to seek to alter that or if, for example, community broadcasters came forward and suggested to the government or to honourable senators that that was not enough for some reason, then that becomes a transparent and obvious issue for the government deal with. That is the way that we have been dealing with it. We think is the appropriate way to handle it, and we seek to continue to do that. You might doubt 
 our bona fides in relation to the funding of the ABC, but I think we have put our money where our mouth is in relation to community broadcasters.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I have a question to Senator Bourne. I am unsure of the intent of her clause 15A. Is it seeking to extend the nominees who will receive favoured treatment in terms of access to the CSOs or is it seeking to address the method of delivery of the CSOs, as outlined by the parliamentary secretary?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-12-09,"—I am not surprised you are a little unsure, Senator Bishop. The whole idea is to strengthen the CSOs. This clause 15A would put in new community service obligations for the benefit of certain nominated customers. The nominated customers are the ones we mentioned before—the ABC, SBS, community broadcasters, emergency service organisations, commercial broadcasters in declared remote areas, non-profit bodies and government bodies. The community sector is defined in the bill as Radio for the Print Handicapped, non-profit community specific broadcasting services and educational broadcasting. Access to NTN sites is based on these definitions.
Nominated customers would be able to negotiate their access fees to the NTN sites under an approved cost pricing formula that would be determined by the minister. The pricing formula would be a disallowable instrument. The broadcasters and the transmission facility owner would specify the fee for access and any other terms and conditions for that access in a written contract. We think that this would provide greater security for community broadcasters and enable them to negotiate fairer and more reasonably priced access.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I might say for the record that the government has, through the mechanism I described in my last intervention—that is, on budget funding—guaranteed that all these organisations will not be paying any more. I think it is guaranteed for at least the next five years, is it? It is up to 15 years if they pick up the option. We are doing it through a transparent process. We are funding it directly to the organisations that are in this situation for the CSO component—not all of them have a pure community service obligation component. They are being looked after through a direct, transparent on budget process.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-09,"—I want to go to the question of employment. I apologise to the committee for raising this because it is more of a parochial matter, but it is important. At present Telstra has the tender for the technical work of maintaining the services of the National Transmission Agency in Tasmania at least, and I believe in a number of other states as well. As I understand it, Telstra has made it perfectly clear that it is not going to tender to extend its NTN contract beyond June of next year. Could the parliamentary secretary advise the committee on what the prospects are for those persons who are currently employed by Telstra. What are their prospects and what are their options? Are there going to be situations which they could take advantage of or are we going to see yet another problem arising in employment terms in Telstra?",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—It is an issue that I have spent some time looking 
 at and it is an issue that Senator Harradine has raised with me over a long period. I have done a lot of work in this area. We have sought to confirm what Senator Harradine asks about Telstra. Senator Harradine may treat this with a grain of salt—because we are having discussions with Telstra on another issue at the moment—but I have `unequivocal' advice from Telstra which says that it intends not to tender for that contract. 
It is important for the committee to understand that, regardless of whether the government is to sell the NTN or not, Telstra has made it quite clear that they are not going to tender for that work. I understand that was a decision taken by Telstra back in 1995. It bears no relationship to privatisation, deregulation or anything else. It was a decision that Telstra made—prior to even the 1996 election—not to stay in that business. It is entirely unrelated to this particular sale bill and, I might add, it was entirely unrelated to the partial sale of Telstra itself. It was a decision that was made by Telstra management a year before this government won the 1996 election.
In relation to the 12 staff that are employed in Tasmania, there can be no certainty as to where those individuals would be employed. I share with Senator Harradine the hope that those individuals—and their families who rely on those individuals as their breadwinners—would be able to stay in Tasmania, if they wanted to. I think there is a lot of hope for that, because we are dealing with an area of employment that is expanding, not contracting.
We have had indications from two of the bidders that they are keen to talk to the Telstra management because they are keen to recruit those Telstra staff. So that is very one good sign of hope. The other good sign of hope is that we have spent much of the last hour talking about digital conversion. All the advice we received from people involved in that process and international experience shows that digital conversion will see a massive increase in the number of technical staff involved in this area of work, both in the building of the digital roll-out and in ongoing 
 maintenance. There will be more involved in maintenance.  
We estimate that there will be an increase in Tasmania of around 15 jobs per year, at least over the next five years. They are saying that there will be an employment impact. I will read it specifically:
The NTA and its advisers to the sale have estimated that in the order of 1,000 to 1,500 man years—
`person years' for the politically correct, I guess—
will be required for the construction phase of the digital television conversion.
That is 200 to 300 jobs per year over the next five years. They have estimated that Tasmania's proportion of that will be about 15 people. So there is immediately a demand for technicians in this area. As I have said, there is then an ongoing requirement for maintenance personnel.
It is important to point out, for those of us who have practical minds, that the people required to maintain the transmission network cannot be located in Ballarat, Bendigo or Meekatharra. They have to be near the towers and the infrastructure. If something goes wrong, under the contracts they need to be able to perform this maintenance work at very short notice. These are jobs that cannot be transported to the mainland. Although the decision made by Telstra back in 1995 not to stay in this business creates uncertainty in their lives—none of us enjoys that or would wish it on these 12 people—the reality is that there are a number of reasons for hope in relation to the prospects of those 12 people in Tasmania.
The same applies to other people and for the honourable senators who represent all other states. This is one area of massive expansion in Australia. Telecommunications and the IT sector generally are expanding very rapidly. Being at the dawn of the digital era, there will be an expansion in employment prospects in the transmission area.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

 casting act. It still appears to us from the digital act—I would like the minister's clarification of this—that NTN sites would be accessed for the purposes of the site but not for services. The services would not be included in that. My intention with the amendment was to include services, whereby access would be available for the purpose of services.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—That is exactly what I said in my intervention on that amendment. The access regime to the sites—if you read the Hansard , you will see that I said the sites, not the services—is guaranteed by the digital act. That is what I want to make quite clear.

NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998

Bills reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-09,"—The three bills before us today are very important pieces of legislation. They are the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 , the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998  and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 . This package of bills is a very important legislative development in respect of regulating nuclear facilities, nuclear installations and sources of radiation throughout Australia. The key bill, of course, is the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998, and it is to that bill that I will be particularly directing my remarks.
I should say at the outset that the opposition is supportive of the passage of the legislation, except we will be seeking to move an amendment at a later stage which would require a public inquiry to be conducted prior to any issuing of a licence for the establishment of a nuclear installation. But I will come back to deal with that in more detail later.
The opposition also notes that, following a hearing of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on Monday, 30 November this year, the government has accepted a range of proposed changes to the bills to strengthen their provisions. We are appreciative of that. Accordingly, as I said, we are supportive of the passage of the legislation with the one exception that I have mentioned.
The stated purpose of the legislation is referred to in the explanatory memorandum. It states:
This Bill proposes to establish a scheme to regulate the operation of nuclear installations and the management of radiation sources, including ionizing material and apparatus and non-ionizing apparatus, where these activities are undertaken by Commonwealth entities.
The object of the Bill is to protect the health and safety of people, and to protect the environment, from the harmful effects of radiation.
That, of course, is a very important objective, one increasingly seen by the people of this country and the people of the world to be at the forefront of issues that need to be resolved at both a national and an international level. The more we can do to ensure that the operation of nuclear facilities and installations and the use of radiation, firstly, are for peaceful purposes and, secondly, take place with the absolute safety of the personnel employed in the industry as well as the general public and with no harm or the least harm to the environment the better.
These bills do represent an improvement upon the existing regulatory system at the Commonwealth level. The bills ensure that all Commonwealth entities and their employees involved with radiation and nuclear activities will in future be regulated under the one set of legislation. Previously, as has been recognised in two important reports, there has been an ad hoc approach to regulation and there have been gaps in the application of particular pieces of legislation.
For instance, in 1993, the Research Reactor Review, set up by the then Labor government to look at the future of the Lucas Heights facility, amongst others, concluded that the current regulatory system was inadequate and needed to be more properly codified and, indeed, strengthened. In the report of that Research Reactor Review—it is known as Future Reaction; it is more commonly known as the McKinnon review—it states in the executive summary when commenting upon the operation of the Nuclear Safety Bureau:
The regulatory machinery even for the small nuclear industry in Australia is unduly fragmented and unclear, and the scope of responsibility for the current regulatory body—
that is, the Nuclear Safety Bureau—
is too limited. Accountability to a Minister different from the one responsible for reactor operations is required.
Further, it states:
The IAEA—
the International Atomic Energy Agency—
licensing requirements provide a suitable basis for licensing arrangements in some other countries which, with adaptation, could be used in Australia.
The arrangement by which the operating organisation ANSTO operates under an Authorisation issued by the ANSTO Board, rather than a licence issued by the regulatory body, is inconsistent with IAEA international principles and requirements.
There is scope for rationalisation of the separate safety and safeguards regulatory regimes which apply to ANSTO.
The regulatory body should have unambiguous and effective sanctions to apply to the operating organisation ANSTO to ensure that conditions it imposes are met.
This legislation does reflect in many ways the recommendations of the McKinnon review that I have just referred to. On that basis, it is an important development.
A further report that forms part of the basis for this legislation is that of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste, which reported in 1996. That is a report that I know is well known to senators, particularly those participating in this debate today. The report was entitled No time to waste. That report also expressed concerns about the problems with the current regulatory system.
On page 24 of that report the committee referred to waste which is currently stored at Lucas Heights, an issue that still causes much concern both in the community of that region, the Sutherland Shire, and more widely throughout the Australian community. It is an issue that at this point in time has not been satisfactorily resolved. In commenting upon the waste, the committee said:
Disputes surrounding Commonwealth bodies' immunity from State laws are not unique to ANSTO, and they raise broader issues which have not been canvassed by the Committee in this Inquiry. It could be argued that if a Commonwealth body complies with State standards as a matter of policy, then it should have no reason to object to complying in law as well, since the difference will not affect its operations. 

In the case of ANSTO the position is complicated by the obvious national security aspect of Australia's nuclear research capability, which underpins the argument for immunity from State laws . . . The Committee accepts this argument, but with a caution. In a liberal democracy, while national security remains paramount, it must also compete with other interests.
It went on to say:
Part of the problem is that ANSTO combines research and advice functions which may involve the national interest, as well as commercial activities in which, arguably, it deserves no advantage over private enterprise.
The Committee accepts the `national interest' argument but does not consider it satisfactory that ANSTO's waste or commercial operations are exempt from controls that apply to its private sector competitors. The Committee believes that this is not an area where self-regulation is appropriate.
It goes on to then recommend the creation of a Commonwealth regulatory body independent of ANSTO to ensure that this area is covered.
One key feature of the legislation before the Senate is that it establishes a new agency—the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA—to oversee all the regulatory aspects with respect to Commonwealth facilities and Commonwealth employees. The agency will operate within the Department of Health and Aged Care.
Further, the legislation provides for the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA. The functions of the chief executive officer are outlined in clause 14 of the bill. Those functions include: to promote uniformity of radiation protection and nuclear safety policy and practices across jurisdictions of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories; to provide advice on radiation protection, nuclear safety and related issues; to undertake research in relation to radiation protection, nuclear safety and medical exposures to radiation; to provide services relating to radiation protection, nuclear safety and medical exposures to radiation; to accredit persons with technical expertise for the purposes of this act; and such other functions as are conferred by this act, the regulations or any other law.
Most importantly, one of the key features of the legislation is that it establishes a licensing system for regulating nuclear facilities, nuclear installations and sources of ionising and non-ionising radiation. Two other bodies will be established to support the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council: a radiation health committee and a nuclear safety committee.
Whilst we do support the legislation, we have raised in debate in the other place, both when it occurred earlier this year and since the election, a number of concerns with the legislation. In particular we raised our concern that there was not sufficient recognition of the rights of community groups and particularly local governments. They should be given a greater opportunity to be involved in the decision-making processes of the ARPANSA.
We are pleased to acknowledge that the government has strengthened the bill since it introduced it earlier this year by including provision for local government to be represented on the Nuclear Safety Committee. That is a very important issue for the community of the Sutherland Shire, where the Lucas Heights facility is located. As honourable senators know, that is where I happen to reside. So I am quite conscious of the views of the Sutherland Shire Council and of the broader community in this regard.
Page 6 of the majority report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee notes that the government will be bringing forward amendments to the legislation to deal with many of the issues that we raised, that other groups have raised, and that other representatives in the Senate have raised. They include: ensuring that the chief executive officer must have regard to the application of world's best practice when issuing licences; ensuring that the minister and the chief executive officer consider nominations from consumer environmental groups before making appointments to the committees; and amending the definition of `nuclear installation' by deleting the references to nuclear power reactors and reprocessing facilities. We understand it is the case that Australia has no intention of building a nuclear power facility, and as such it should not be referred to within 
 that section of the act. The bill also will distinguish between medium scale facilities such as a reactor or a waste storage facility—they will be called `nuclear installations'—and small scale facilities, which might be dubbed `prescribed facilities'.
There is one area where we disagree with the government on this legislation. The opposition intends to move an amendment to provide that, prior to any issuing of a licence by the chief executive officer for the construction of a nuclear installation—we have in mind the new Lucas Heights reactor or a new reactor at any other location in Australia—there must be either an independent inquiry or a public inquiry held pursuant to the provisions of the environment protection legislation. We would ask that the government give further consideration to accepting our amendment in that regard. When we get to the committee stage we will be arguing that there are very good reasons as to why that process should occur prior to a licence being issued.
We do not build nuclear reactors in this country every day of the week or even every year. It is 40 years since the first reactor was built at Lucas Heights. The government has made a decision to replace that reactor with another reactor. There is a lot of concern about that decision in the community. There are very good reasons why it should firstly be determined whether we need another reactor in this country. If it were demonstrated that there were issues as to where it should be located, those issues should be properly addressed in a public forum such as a public inquiry. There is great dissatisfaction and concern being expressed with the current EIS process that is under way in that regard.
With those remarks, I would indicate that we support the legislation in principle, but at the committee stage we will be pursuing our amendments and will listen with interest to the other contributions made in the debate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-09,"—Before I begin debate on the specific provisions contained in this bill, I do feel it is important to restate the Green's total opposition to the nuclear fuel cycle. Despite all the claims to the contrary, the reality is that nuclear material is inherently dangerous 
 and remains so for many years—hundreds of thousands of years in some cases.
I have just returned from Melbourne where two important conferences took place on the weekend. The first one, which I attended, was the international congress of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. The second was a national meeting to establish a coalition of antinuclear groups to campaign against uranium mining, a nuclear reactor and a national radioactive waste dump.
In an international context, recent events, such as the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, have confirmed that the existing nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime has failed. One of the key problems in that regard is the total failure by the five nuclear weapons states to commit to a timetable for nuclear weapons disarmament. That failure contributed directly to the recent tests in India and Pakistan and remains a stumbling block to real nuclear disarmament.
It is also important to note that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is based on a fundamentally flawed premise: that it is possible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons by providing non-nuclear weapon states with so-called `peaceful' nuclear technology. This flawed argument has been highlighted by people such as Elizabeth Clegg from the Centre of Defence Studies at the University of Aberdeen. In an article entitled `Building the bomb: how states go nuclear', to which I have referred previously in this place, she stated:
In conclusion, then, it can be seen that the infrastructure required for the development of a nuclear weapons potential is best created under cover of a well established civilian nuclear industry; in all of the above cases the military option was made possible by the existence of a civilian programme.
Whilst opposing the involvement of the Australian government in the nuclear fuel cycle, the unfortunate reality is that we do have a nuclear reactor and nuclear waste in this country, and proper independent regulation is required.
The introduction of this legislation which provides for the protection of the Australian community from the adverse effects of radiation and for the safety of Australians who 
 deal with radioactive materials is, therefore, extremely important. We know that a number of people have been asking for it for some time. It is too important to be allowed to go through parliament without the Australian community having had the opportunity to register its concerns about the regulatory regime on which we will have to rely to protect us from hazards which have the potential to remain with us for an indefinite period of time.
It was for that reason I pushed for a committee hearing on these bills. As predicted, a range of concerns were expressed by community representatives. Many of these concerns had the potential to be addressed by way of amendment to the legislation. And the hearing has clarified the issues, providing a way forward to strengthen the protection provided by the bill.
A number of community groups expressed concern about how much of the framework of these nuclear regulations is to be contained in regulation rather than in the legislation itself. The government, however, is to be commended for going some way towards meeting those concerns, and particularly for allowing a period of open public consultation on the regulations which are so important to the effective functioning of ARPANSA as a regulating body.
One of the key concerns raised by several parties to the hearing and others who made written submissions is the fundamental issue of whether there is such a thing as a `safe' level of exposure to radiation. It is my view and the view shared by many that there is no safe level of exposure, and to legislate to allow any increase in the radiation to which Australians are exposed is fundamentally flawed.
Even following the presentations by ARPANSA and ANSTO, concern remains about the `allowable' exposure to radiation. A particular concern is the power of the CEO to grant exemptions which could see workers exposed to higher doses of radiation than otherwise allowed. The aim should be to have exposure as close to zero as is technically possible, and there should not be power to grant exemptions over people's lives.
The standard in the legislation purports to be world's best practice. While this should mean `as low as technically achievable'—that is the ALATA principle—the standard in this legislation is set at `as low as reasonably achievable', and that takes in the dollars and cents. If this is world's best practice, it is not good enough, especially when we know that better standards are achievable elsewhere. `World's best practice' does not mean the best practice in the world; it obviously means something quite different by way of compromise.
We believe that world's best practice does not and should not equate to international atomic energy acceptable levels, the International Atomic Energy Agency in many ways being both a regulator and a proponent of nuclear technology. Standards are constantly under review and technological developments are taking place. But best practice in the nuclear industry is constrained by economic forces, which should not be the primary concern in a bill to protect Australians from radiation and provide for nuclear safety.
The precautionary principle must be the most important consideration where nuclear health and safety issues are concerned. For this reason we will seek to delete the threat of imprisonment for ARPANSA inspectors making a false or misleading statement or warrant. Criminal law should quite adequately deal with criminal fraud, should that be a problem. Threats of imprisonment—and we are talking about a maximum of two years imprisonment—in this way in this legislation could be seen as intimidatory and not necessarily in the best interests of the community and, could I say, quite out of proportion to the kind of real, enforceable legislation and regulations on the industry itself. Despite our stated problems with the use of the term `world's best practice', the inclusion of a requirement for the CEO to have regard to world's best practice when issuing licences is an improvement in the current bill.
For the regulatory authority set up under this legislation to have the confidence of the Australian community, it must clearly be independent of the government of the day and be responsible to parliament. The regulatory 
 authority, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, falls some way short of this standard because it is not an independent statutory authority. We are pleased, however, to see that the government has now agreed that the CEO have direct power over the staffing of ARPANSA—but still it falls a long way short of being an independent statutory authority.
The recommendation to exclude nuclear power reactors from the legislation is an improvement in accountability. The Greens, however, are concerned that licences for a nuclear fuel fabrication plant, an enrichment facility, a fuel storage facility and a reprocessing facility remain possible under this legislation, albeit with the approval of the CEO. These activities should either be specifically prohibited under this legislation or, at the least, should not be able to take place without full and separate parliamentary scrutiny.
Over the last couple of weeks, we have heard some quite extraordinary information from the United States about other countries wanting Australia to take their nuclear waste, their nuclear junk. We have to be very, very aware, when launching into a bill like this, of exactly what it is that we as a parliament are giving the tick to, albeit perhaps with the authority of the licensing authority of the chief executive officer of a body which is not quite independent of the government.
When there are financial pressures and the pressure of international scrutiny, we know that in the end arguments such as, `Australia would be very responsible in this current disarmament regime to take other people's core waste from nuclear reactors' and `You've got the best conditions, a nice stable economy and you're going to make a lot of money out it,' will be convincing to a growing number of people, perhaps particularly those on the more conservative side of politics.
We believe separate approval should be obtained for any other new facility, such as a spent fuel conditioning plant, a nuclear waste disposal facility, a waste storage facility or an isotope production facility. It should be noted, however, that any proposal for such a facility would itself be of great concern to the 
 Greens. If our concerns regarding scrutiny of any proposal for any new nuclear facility are not satisfactorily addressed, we will seek to amend the definition of nuclear installation by deleting reference to any nuclear installation which does not currently exist.
Major nuclear installations require much greater prior scrutiny than is envisaged in the bill. In particular, there must be a comprehensive public inquiry into, and parliamentary scrutiny of, the question of whether there is a need for the installation before the process even gets to the stage of an impact statement or an inquiry into the proposal itself. No licence proposal should be considered until a public, open inquiry into the need for the installation and an impact assessment process have been completed. An amendment to achieve that end will be moved in the committee stage of this bill.
Those people who think that these things are done as a matter of course should speak to the people living around Australia's only current research reactor at Lucas Heights. They will tell you what the culture of secrecy is in relation to the nuclear industry in Australia. There were a number of delegates from the former Soviet Union at the IPPNW conference at the weekend. There has been so much secrecy involved in the nuclear issues in the Soviet Union—as we knew—that, ironically, we now seem to have more information from the former Soviet Union about the issues of nuclear proliferation, nuclear materials and the problems of dealing with those than we do from the United States, the UK and, indeed, from Australia.
The proposed government amendment to give public notice of the licensing of a nuclear installation is grossly inadequate. The whole process must be open to public participation, and this should be reflected in the regulations. There is no reference in this bill to the regulation or setting of standards in the uranium mining industry, yet codes of practice in the industry were covered by the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act, which is repealed by a consequential amendments bill. It is desirable for the Commonwealth to have oversight of such standards and for there to be an open, public process for 
 the ongoing development and improvement of the codes, and this bill is silent on this question. Even the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling looked at the lack of oversight in relation to this industry. We commend the government for clarifying the situation regarding existing codes and development of improved codes by agreeing to have the current requirements of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act included in the regulations.
The only role for the community in this bill is a purely advisory one and, even there, it is a role severely constrained by the legislation. A further amendment is required for protection from prosecution for committee or council members who make public any information or concerns that they may have about radiation protection or nuclear safety. There is no point in us moving towards some kind of whistleblower legislation if we put a gagging mechanism in legislation that prevents responsible members of the community being able to canvass with their community some of the issues of health and safety that they are asked to deal with. Otherwise, these advisory committees merely pick out the best and most able people within the community and disarm them—if you can excuse the pun. They literally gag them by taking them out of the process, keeping them busy running around in circles and making them unable to communicate with their own representative constituency.
The Greens (WA) commend the introduction of the conflict of interest provisions for committee and council members in the regulations, and we would like to see that extended to include a register of financial interests. There is a clear need for the strengthening of reporting requirements throughout the bill. We are particularly concerned that the CEO's functions include the monitoring and reporting on the operations of the agency and its advisory bodies, and it is pleasing to see that the government will be moving appropriate amendments in this regard.
There has been a lot of work, a lot concern about the community and some movement on this bill. If this bill had been shoved through at the end of the June sittings, as the govern 
 ment proposed to do, we would have had none of these changes. It was proposed that the bill be coughed through at a lunchtime without debate and divisions, and that of course meant without time for amendments and consultation. We were advised at the time that the community had plenty of time. We, in fact, were told by the community that that was simply not true. The Greens (WA) had a great deal of pressure put on them at that time because we were told by the government that we were the only ones holding back this fabulous piece of legislation. Quite frankly, the legislation has been shown to be less than fabulous.
Although, as I have conceded, the concept of ARPANSA has been asked for by a number of groups over quite a deal of time, it was not a case of `any regulations at all you are prepared to throw at us.' The community were tired of being treated badly, of being kept in the dark and of not having some kind of independent authority as an oversight of the industry. That certainly did not mean that they wanted to go backwards. It certainly did not mean that they wanted commercial pressures in the end to come through and override them—steamroller them—by way of this legislation.
Our concern—and there are still some concerns remaining which we will deal with in the committee stage—is that this bill will end up being a Trojan Horse: something that looked attractive; something that was in the guise of a proposal that the community wanted, but something that contained elements much more problematical; something that could lead to other areas of concern where the parliament would then have no scrutiny or no redress. We had a situation where, in the hands of a CEO who would be responsible to the minister and whose staff at that stage would have been selected from ministerial staff, ticks could be given to activities which in no way the community would be happy to have outside parliamentary and public scrutiny. 
So this bill has been problematical. I don't think it is perfect and I don't think it is going to get anywhere near perfect, but I am happy that we have had at least some chance in the 
 last few months to move somewhat closer to some level of public health and safety. There is still a long way to go.
In summary, whilst the Greens (WA) are pleased that the government has made some concessions to acknowledge community concerns about this bill, we feel that further amendments are required to ensure adequate protection for the community from the dangers of radiation and of nuclear activities.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-09,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support in principle the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998. The Australian Democrats recognise the importance of protecting the Australian community from the adverse effects of radiation. We believe that people who work with radioactive materials deserve a rigorous and comprehensive regulatory system to ensure that they are not exposed to any unnecessary dangers associated with radiation.
I oppose generally, and my party generally opposes, the use of radioactive materials in places where there may be a risk. Basically we believe that there are no safe levels of radioactivity. As we know—I assume all in this chamber know—radioactivity can cause harm. I would like to see a blanket ban on radioactive materials and other toxic materials everywhere. Internationally there is a recognition that radioactivity is unsafe at every level and that there is no safe dose. The recent UK National Radiological Protection Board describes in recent studies of low dose radiation and health effects that one hit of radiation is enough to cause cell damage, and this of course can lead to cancer. This is enforced by a recent report in the New Scientist magazine which reports on the work of the Medical Research Council on cell damage from low dose radiation.
Perhaps even more importantly, this is an issue that we believe has been left out of the government's and the opposition's reckoning on radioactivity: radiation causes cell damage as well as hereditary damage. This hereditary damage cannot be measured using ordinary techniques and, therefore, continues to remain 
 outside the reporting of most studies and most regulated reporting requirements. Certainly, the Democrats share some of the health concerns that have been raised in this chamber today, in particular some of the concerns raised by the Greens (WA) about what is considered an acceptable dose of radiation as well as the possibilities of the CEO granting exemptions in relation to acceptable doses.
This concern about radioactivity underpinned many of our proposed amendments to the recent  Space Activities Bill 1998 . In regard to that legislation we sought not to prevent radioactive materials being launched into space, although we would have preferred a blanket ban, but to prevent radioactive and toxic materials being launched into space without a hazard and a risk assessment prepared by or organised by the minister. So we have an ongoing concern in this area.
We believe that the community has a right to be involved with any major developments in the way we regulate the use of radioactive terms in workplaces and in industries. This issue is far too important just to leave to governments, bureaucrats and experts without the full consultation of the community and their involvement.
The community will have to rely on this new legislative framework for protection against the harmful effects of radioactive material for an indefinite period of time, potentially quite a long time, into the future. Therefore, it is particularly important that we get this right now. I echo again my statements from last week's debate on the Space Activities Bill 1998 , where we sought to regulate commercial activities in space. It was an important piece of framework legislation and it should have been done—indeed, we attempted to do it—correctly. It is the same in this case. It is important that we get this legislation right, now that we have the opportunity.
The Democrats are also aware of the many concerns raised by community groups and consumer groups during the committee's inquiry into this bill. I am pleased to note that the government has attempted to address some of these concerns, including allowing a period of public consultation on the regulations to 
 the bill. We support this process. We believe it will allow for greater community input into the way this new regulatory regime will function.
The Democrats recognise that radiation is used in a variety of fields, including archaeology, medicine and the construction industry. Other applications include defence, the food industry—that is, the sterilisation of food—and scientific research. In particular, we acknowledge the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to protect the estimated 3,500 Commonwealth workers who utilise radiation in their work. These include people working across a range of difficult fields, such as customs, the postal service, defence, medical and dental practitioners, telecommunications, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the CSIRO.
The Democrats acknowledge that the current regulatory regime does not adequately protect these workers from any potential harm associated with radiation exposure through their work. The existing laws controlling exposure to radiation in Australia come from a mismatched system of Commonwealth, state and territory legislation which does not necessarily provide comprehensive coverage.
Senator Forshaw referred in his comments in the second reading debate to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste entitled No time to waste and the Democrats support recommendations 7 and 8 of that 1996 report. This report identified that while radiation exposure was covered by state laws, a regulatory gap persisted because these laws often did not apply to the Commonwealth or to Commonwealth employees. We understand that this bill addresses recommendations 7 and 8 of the No time to waste report, which called for the development of a nationally agreed regulatory scheme for the regulation of the use of radiation.
The Democrats understand that Australia is contemplating signing the International Atomic Energy Agency's Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management 1997. This convention requires, among other 
 things, each contracting party to establish a legislative and regulatory framework to govern the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management. Article 19 of the convention requires national safety requirements and regulations to be in place and a system of licensing of spent fuel and radioactive waste management activities to be adopted with appropriate inspections and enforcement of the regime. The Democrats would support Australia signing this convention and taking a leadership role in the management of radioactive waste.
Most people in this chamber—certainly Senator Margetts has referred to it and I have no doubt that our environment spokesperson, Senator Lyn Allison, will as well—were extremely disturbed to see the promotional video produced by Pangea Resources, which states that Australia would be the best country to store much of the world's high level nuclear waste. The company assert that they have met—and I acknowledge that these are the company's assertions—with Australia's ministers and officials about their plans for a nuclear waste dump in Australia.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—I acknowledge the interjection from Senator Margetts that they have met with Western Australian ministers. In question time the Democrats pursued this issue. We asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources whether or not he agreed with this claim that Australia is the best place to store high level nuclear waste. We also asked him to rule out completely any involvement of this government in setting up an international nuclear waste depository in Australia. I was pleased that the minister stated unequivocally that:
. . . no high level radioactive waste facility is planned for Australia and the government has absolutely no intention of accepting the radioactive waste of other countries.
The minister went on to state that the government policy in this area is:
. . . clear and absolute and will not be changed. We will not be accepting radioactive waste from other countries . . . it will not be government policy to accept radioactive waste from other countries nor to accept high level radioactive waste. 

We are very pleased to hear that. On the basis of this, the Democrats seek to enshrine this commitment in legislation in order to protect the community from the harms associated with any commercial nuclear waste disposal facility.
We are also committed to restoring faith in the government in the parliamentary process. As part of this commitment, we are opposed to political partisan appointments in any field. My colleague Senator Andrew Murray has previously brought to the attention of the Senate the matter of the Nolan committee from the United Kingdom. Finally—it has taken a while—even that class rigid society has got sick of the ministerial patronage that went on there. Through the Nolan committee, it has recommended a wholesale review and overhaul of the system of ministerial patronage and has advanced a transparent, accountable and open appointment system.
We have sought to do this on a number of occasions with a number of bills. I think Senator Murray last moved these amendments in relation to the wheat marketing board. Individuals and organisations, together with other constituencies, often express to us their fear of dominance or capture by partisan or particular interests when governments have had a hand in any kind of board, authority or organisation where people are appointed to manage it. That fear is regardless of what political party is in power.
As senators will have noted, the amendments of the Democrats will address the matter of appointments of members to the council and set out the general principles whereby those members would be appointed. Frankly, we should not have to do that in legislation, but the history of this country seems to be no different from any other country where people have had the power to appoint others either on the basis of nepotism, the basis of mateship or the basis of conferring a benefit. Whatever happens, that is a partisan way to approach things. We believe it is an unacceptable way, and our amendments seek to redress that.
It is my belief and that of my party that it is in the interests of all Australians of any political persuasion to accept that a system of 
 transparent appointment on principles and merit, independent scrutiny, probity, openness and transparency would be to the benefit of any organisation, including the one we are discussing today. I will be attending to that area of interest when the bill comes before the committee for debate.
The Democrats believe that the CEO of ARPANSA should be able to hire staff independently of the Department of Health and Aged Care. This is necessary to ensure that ARPANSA can function as a truly independent body. We will move an amendment that allows the CEO of ARPANSA a greater degree of independence than is currently allowed under the bill.
I understand that the government amendments have just been circulated. I was not sure what stage we were up to with government amendments, but certainly we have made it clear that we will support government amendments that make explicit the obligations of ARPANSA to comply with any agreements made by Australia in relation to the safe conduct of radiation and nuclear activities and the adoption of standards, codes and best practice, that reference the functions and composition of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council and supporting committees, and that require a community representative to be included on the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Committee, the Radiation Health Committee and the Nuclear Safety Committee.
The Democrats will be supporting the opposition amendment which would require public consultation to take place before a new nuclear installation could be licensed. We agree to the need for community consultation. We also agree that there should be a legislative requirement, and we fully support that amendment.
The Democrats will also be supporting Greens amendments which bring greater accountability to the bill and which ensure that the community will have more substantial involvement in any future regulatory developments. In particular, we support the amendments which restrict the application of the bill by excluding major nuclear installations. We believe this is vital to ensure that the govern 
 ment of the day cannot instigate a major nuclear facility without full community consultation.
We will also support the amendments relating to increased reporting requirements to ensure that the public is kept fully informed of any problems arising with this new regulatory regime. Those amendments that we will be supporting, those amendments that we will be moving, are aimed towards ensuring greater accountability and transparency in the bill.
We have also put on record our concerns about doses of radiation. I made it a point at the committee hearings to ask nearly all the witnesses what they considered was an acceptable dose of radiation—if there was such a thing—or what was the low level dose that people could be subject to without too many risks. It was interesting to hear the variety of opinions from councils which said that there was no acceptable level right through to various discussions from ANSTO and ARPANSA representatives.
I draw the attention of the chamber to a document produced by Jean McSorley, whom I am sure we are all familiar with for her work in investigating issues of radioactivity and nuclear materials, specifically looking at the environmental impact of those materials as well as looking to prevent members of the community being subject to such materials. She quotes from a UN paper examining the problem of low dose radiation. She believes that it challenges the notion of negligible harm. She says:
Radiation, by its very nature, is harmful to life. At low doses it can start off only partially understood chains of events which lead to cancer or genetic damage. At high doses it can kill cells, damage organs and cause rapid death.
She goes on to question aspects of Lucas Heights, particularly the proposed environmental impact statement, and whether it is possible to measure the health impact of radiation exposure at Lucas Heights. She then goes on to talk about the objectives of the ARPANSA bill in relation to protecting people from the harmful effects of radiation. Her concerns are as follows:
Harmful is not defined in the bill. However, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that what is meant by `harmful' in this situation is perceived as the most manifest effects of radiation, certainly the most damaging that is—early deaths through cancer and insignificant numbers. As with the terms `as low as reasonably achievable' or `acceptable dose limits', the word `harmful' in this context raises many questions. Certainly, if it is taken as that suggested, it does not convey the full effects that radiation can have on a single person or across a given population.
She goes on to talk about the fact that there is no safe dose of radiation.
The Democrats and I subscribe to that view. We do oppose generally the use of radioactive materials in places where there may be a risk. That is why we are particularly concerned about issues such as nuclear materials and radioactive materials being made available in the community, whether they are on earth or being launched into space. We will continue to maintain our attempts in this area to make sure that, hopefully, one day we will see a blanket ban on some of these radioactive materials, although recognising there may be some exceptional circumstances in that they may be used for the purposes of health. But we will continue to pursue matters such as these in the Senate as well as ensuring accountability and greater transparency in bills such as these.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-09,"—This package of legislation provides for the protection of the Australian community from the adverse effects of radiation and for the safety of Australians who deal with radioactive materials. As my colleague Senator Stott Despoja said, a key concern raised by several parties to the hearing and those who made written submissions is that fundamental issue of whether or not there is such a thing as a safe level of exposure to radiation. That leads me to discuss a very topical and important matter—that is, the proposal for a nuclear waste dump in Australia.
Some years ago, as I recall, Australia did a study into the suitability of this country in terms of its geology and its demographics and declared that basically 75 per cent of Australia was suitable to store waste—the rationale being that if it was far enough away from 
 population centres and in a stable geographic area, then it was okay for nuclear waste. I recall saying at the time that this was a very dangerous message to send to the rest of the world. By saying that we were not going to accept nuclear waste from overseas but indicating that so much of Australia would be suitable to do so seemed to many of us at the time to be extremely dangerous and extremely unwise.
This week we are being told that, in the interests of a secure world, Australia should accept waste that might otherwise find its way into the laboratories of terrorists and unfriendly nations to create nuclear weapons. How much work has already been done on this proposal away from any sort of public scrutiny is anyone's guess. But the leaking of a promotional video last week made by Pangea Resources blew the lid on what appears to be a two-year campaign. This Seattle based company wants to create a dump in the outback of either South Australia or Western Australia.
Its representatives claim that they have discussed this with Australian ministers and bureaucrats. We do not know who exactly. Senator Minchin has already denied any knowledge of meetings at a ministerial level. Senator Margetts says today that the Court government has had meetings. It is a very intriguing convergence of events. We have Pangea's campaign and, at the same time, something of a boost from the Clinton administration. The message that Australia needs a dump has come from no less a figure than President Clinton's special envoy on weapons of mass destruction, Robert Gallucci. He has maintained that Australia would be making the world a safer place if it accepted the world's nuclear waste and plutonium. But the reasons he chose to single out Australia are perhaps more complex than any sort of idea that we might be a model nuclear citizen.
Mr Gallucci admitted on the ABC just this morning that the US has produced much of the world's spent nuclear fuel. It just so happens that the United States government has an enormous problem in deciding what to do with this fuel. It made a commitment in 1982 to acquire and to store all spent nuclear 
 fuel from commercial plants. The deadline for starting this acquisition was January this year, but nothing has happened because a storage facility has not yet been agreed upon. It is quite understandable that the utilities are very angry about having to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars for temporary storage while the US government tries to make up its mind. This adds to the pressure on Australia.
In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, nominating the Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the only site to be considered for a permanent waste facility. However, Nevada politicians, public and scientists opposed this. They say that that mountain has the potential for earthquakes, volcanic activity and underground flooding. A draft environmental impact statement is due in the middle of next year. Both the Senate and the House have passed legislation to create a temporary storage facility there, but President Clinton has threatened to veto this.
The US has started a $2 billion program to dispose of 50 tonnes of excess plutonium, some of this produced in the dismantling of nuclear weapons. So the US has a lot of nuclear waste, a lot of plutonium, and no place to put it. The American public will not buy the idea that radioactive material is safe. And, instead of more encouragement of renewable energy, the response, it seems, has been to look for a docile country like Australia.
Mr Gallucci basically admitted that the choice of Australia was motivated not so much by geology as by political fallout. He said, `I don't know enough about the geology of the United States,' when he was asked by the ABC why a dump could not be sited there. Of course, the `political fallout' that he refers to is the very real risk of public exposure to radioactive material. I think that Australians should be very wary about taking advice from someone who admits to ignorance about the United States' geology, yet professes to know all about Australia's. Mr Gallucci went on to say:
If you ask me if this—
referring to the dump—
is possible in the United States, I would tell you that politically I doubt it would be possible. 

Special Envoy Gallucci's remarks, I think, show a great deal of naivety about Australia. The message is basically that we should accept a dump because we here are not as politically organised or as aware as Americans. I think this is not just naive, it is also very insulting. Australia has not gone down this path of nuclear energy or nuclear weaponry, and a key reason for our caution on the nuclear industry has been in the past—and it remains today—the health of those people who would be exposed to radioactive material.
Mr Gallucci said an Australian dump would address `the needs of so many countries who don't have the geology for the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste'. The question that must be asked is: why are these geologically unstable countries actually encouraging proliferation of nuclear power without providing for safe and long-term waste storage? And I use that word `storage' advisedly. We are not talking about disposal; it is storage. We do not know what to do with nuclear waste material.
Simply by housing a dump, Australia will not solve the problems associated with countries refusing to take responsibility for their own nuclear waste. The United States has one of the poorest safety records in the world when it comes to operating nuclear power plants. This is not just a not-in-my-backyard principle. Australia should not become a dumping ground for what has now amassed as 148,000 tonnes of the world's high-level nuclear waste, any more than it ought to become a dumping ground for the world's dioxins or DDT.
Moreover, a dump that begins as a small facility can very easily be made larger, and this phenomenon too can be demonstrated overseas—it is very much a case of `out of sight, out of mind' when we are talking about the very large area of Australia which is only very lightly populated. Nor is it improbable that a dump that initially accepted only domestic waste might further down the track take international waste.
There has been longstanding cooperation between the United States and Australia in nuclear matters. An American company has 
 been brought into the Maralinga area to vitrify radioactive waste in situ. This year, the United States announced it would be using an Australian technology, Synroc, to immobilise plutonium. This may make quite compelling any arguments about whether Australia should accept high-level waste from the US and other countries—if it so safe, why doesn't its country of origin take it back for storage? I guess another argument is: if Australia continues to dig up uranium and continues to open uranium mines, such as Jabiluka, what sort of message does that send to the rest of the world about responsibilities for the waste that has been created?
Senator Minchin told the Senate yesterday that a preferred site for a national waste repository would be nominated by the middle of next year. The senator said that such a repository would be `good for South Australia'. He ruled out accepting waste from overseas—at least for now. Perhaps he is waiting for national opinion to be tested by the likes of the Institute of Public Affairs. Lo and behold, in the Herald Sun last Saturday, IPA executive director Mike Nahan recommended Australia should consider taking overseas waste. He argued that nuclear power is here to stay. This argument is morally equivalent to the argument that poverty, AIDS and despotic governments are here to stay and, therefore, there is no reason to do anything about them. The fact is that the nuclear industry is inherently unsafe. The waste is deadly and, at present, poorly handled in most places in the world. We argue that vested interests should not be allowed to prevail over the health of future generations and over our environment.
In any case, there have been no nuclear plants commissioned in the United States since 1978, and more than 100 planned reactors have now been cancelled. Nahan said in the article that `permanent disposal is needed and the best locations are sites remote from people'. Further on in the story he said that a dump `would also probably need to be located on Aborigines' land which would require their permission'. A dump on Aboriginal land cannot by definition be remote from people. It seems that Nahan made an uncon 
 scious slip here, a slip that has the unmistakable ring of terra nullius to it.
 The Democrats are urging the Prime Minister to write to President Clinton expressing dissatisfaction with Mr Gallucci's remarks. Any United States pressure on Australia to carry the can for America's unsafe nuclear industry is unwelcome, and we ought to say so to the President. Despite Senator Minchin's comments to the contrary, there is no doubt that the campaign for Australia to take on the world's nuclear burdens has really only just begun. As we open up more and more uranium mines, that campaign will gather momentum.
This bill puts in place some protections for people who work with radioactive material, and we support that. But it will not protect us from the rest of the world seeing Australia as a convenient dumping ground for them. On behalf of my colleagues, I give the Senate notice that the Democrats will be working on that much greater—and, in many ways, more important—level of protection from becoming the world's nuclear waste dump.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-09,"—in reply—I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998  and two associated bills, and in particular I thank those senators who participated in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. The report of the committee—authored by the committee chair, Senator Sue Knowles—was based on a number of submissions received in public hearings and has previously been made available to all senators. It gave us good advice and raised issues that have been addressed. I think most of the points that have been raised in debate today by the various speakers have at different stages been taken into account in the deliberations on this important piece of legislation.
The need for the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency as an independent regulator of Commonwealth radiation and nuclear activities is undisputed. This series of bills ensures for the first time comprehensive national regulatory oversight 
 of radiation sources, apparatus including cyclotrons and irradiators, and, importantly, nuclear installations. The bills have been subject to intense scrutiny. They have been the subject of considerable debate by a range of interested groups including environmental groups, local government, state and territory agencies, and industry.
The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry that I referred to into the scope and contents of the bill earlier this week has confirmed multipartisan support for this legislation. I welcome Senator Forshaw's comments that the Labor Party intend to support the legislation. That process has also identified some aspects of the legislation which can be further improved, and the government proposes to move some amendments to the  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 . In summary, the amendments ensure that the CEO of ARPANSA has regard to world's best practice; that consumer and environmental groups are invited to provide nominations in respect of membership of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council and supporting committees; that the CEO will monitor and report to parliament on the operations of ARPANSA, the council and committees; and that the definition of `nuclear installation' is clarified to exclude nuclear power reactors or nuclear reprocessing facilities and to include facilities such as nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities.
The Senate committee report has also recommended that the regulations developed under this bill be subject to community consultation over the next two months. The government is committed to ensuring extensive consultation involving community, environmental, scientific and other interested parties. We are confident that this will result in strong and effective regulations. While the consultation process will no doubt identify areas where regulations can be enhanced, the government will ensure that the matters referenced by the community affairs committee are addressed in the regulations. These matters include requiring that, before making licensing decisions in respect of nuclear installations or prescribed radiation facilities, 
 the CEO publish a notice that an application for licensing has been received.
In the case of licensing decisions in relation to nuclear facilities under clause 31, the regulations will require: that the CEO take into account matters raised in any public submissions received and include in a report to parliament both the matters that were raised by public submissions and the basis for the CEO's licensing decisions; mechanisms for developing and ensuring codes previously developed under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978; and the CEO to list new and existing licences in the quarterly report to parliament, addressing any conflicts of interest.
I note that several of the speakers, particularly from the Democrats and the Greens, seem to be preoccupied on this matter of nuclear waste. I am surprised, given the comments that were made in this parliament by both Senator Hill and Senator Minchin on 1 December, that they still hold those apprehensions and fears. It would be interesting to note the bedtime reading of the Greens and the Democrats—it would probably be rather scary. Let me put into the record again the comments that were made on 1 December.
The Democrats leader, Senator Lees, specifically addressed the issue that both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Allison have raised this morning. I do not think it can be any clearer put than the answer that Senator Minchin gave when he said:
In relation to the press reports this morning—
that is, 1 December—
I can confirm that as far as this government is concerned there have been absolutely no ministerial level discussions with that company, Pangea Resources. I am advised that representatives of Pangea have had discussions with government officials over the years—I think going back before we came into government—on the general issue of radioactive waste management, but those discussions have always been clearly on the premise that it is not government policy and will not be government policy to accept radioactive waste from other countries nor to accept high level radioactive waste.
Senator Hill made this point in answer to a question on the same day from Senator Margetts:    
I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs would say that the government is under no pressure; furthermore, it is not intending to build a facility for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste.
It is important to recognise that this legislation separates the regulatory aspects of this important issue from policy and certainly ensures the integrity of ARPANSA.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-12-09,"—Today I would like to say something about the great economic potential of the Kimberley region of Western Australia and in particular how that potential could be enhanced by the provision of cheap electricity from the proposed Derby hydropower project. I thank the Kimberley Development Commission for much of the material used in this speech, which I am sure senators will find very interesting, as will those people listening to the broadcast of proceedings around Australia.
The Kimberley's advantages include its location, with its proximity to Asia and the emerging northern markets in our region; its market focus, with industries focused on new markets and the development possibilities which thereby exist; its extensive natural resources in the form of minerals and other resources, such as pearling and fishing; as well as its great tourism and pastoral resources. In general terms, the Kimberley is like a great unopened box of treasures.
The biggest disadvantage the Kimberley has in terms of secondary industrial development is the cost of power. That is the major hurdle for the development of industry in the Kimberley. The cost of power is the major disadvantage that Western Australia in general faces when development is considered, because the cost of power in Western Australia is higher than it is in any other part of the country. In 1995-96 the nominal price per kilowatt-hour of electricity for commercial use in Western Australia was 10.72c. Unfortunately, that has increased since then. By contrast, around the rest of the country in 1995-96 the average cost of power was 8.06c per kilowatt-hour, and that has since come down. So Western Australia does have a disadvantage in terms of the cost of power.
As I said, the Kimberley has enormous potential in terms of mineral development and mining. The mining potential of the Kimber 
 ley could be transformed by access to cheaper power. For example, at the moment the Kimberley mining industry contributes something like $485 million per year to the regional economy. The outlook for the industry is good, with Western Metals expanding operations in the area by opening up one of the world's largest zinc mines. The Pillara project, which is also a lead and zinc project, will bring into world markets very large amounts of lead and zinc. There is also one of the world's largest bauxite deposits on the Mitchell Plateau, but at the present time it is uneconomic to mine that bauxite deposit because of the cost of power. The process involved in converting bauxite to aluminium demands huge amounts of electricity, for which reason aluminium is sometimes described as `solid electricity'. For the mining industry, for the benefit of people in the towns in the Kimberley, for the potential development of tourist resorts and, in general, to enhance the lifestyle of the people in the Kimberley, the provision of cheap power will make an enormous difference to the cost economics of projects in that area.
For the benefit of the Senate, I would like to outline some details of the proposed Derby hydropower project. A proposal has been put forward to harness the tidal power of the Kimberley. The Kimberley has some of the very highest tides in the world, reaching 11 or 12 metres. It is proposed to use the rise and fall of the tides in the Kimberley to generate hydro-electricity which would then be distributed around the Kimberley by a conventional grid.
The location for this proposal, as I have said, is at Derby, which is the old regional service town of the West Kimberley, although it has now perhaps been somewhat eclipsed by Broome. The area around Derby is one of tidal flats. In Doctors Creek, it is proposed to put in a hydropower facility which will produce up to 48 megawatts of electricity output. A new company, Derby HydroPower Pty Ltd, is undertaking studies and working to gain the necessary approvals from the EPA and from the government in Western Australia. 
Tidal power has many advantages. It is a clean source of energy. It is renewable energy, which I am sure would meet with the approval of my colleague Senator Brown if he were here listening to this. There being no pollution, the use of tidal power helps meet Australia's greenhouse emission commitments.
The tidal power station proposed for Derby is designed to have an operational life of 120 years. As time goes on, the price of electricity produced from this facility will get cheaper and cheaper because, apart from the capital cost of building the facility, tidal power generation costs are immune to such things as Middle East crises, increases in the price of oil, or other factors such as concerns about the use of uranium in nuclear power, which might mean that such a means of generating electricity could in time be unacceptable to the community.
Two options exist, I am told, for the proposed hydropower project in Derby in Doctors Creek: one, a so-called double basin option; and the other, a twin basin option. The location of this project is about 12 kilometres from Derby where there are two tidal creeks in the mangroves. In the double basin option, barrages will be built across the mouths of both creeks to control the water levels; sluice gates will allow the tide to run into the west creek, which is the high basin; and in the east creek, which is the low basin, water will only drain out at low tide. Turbines, to be located in the channel between the two basins, will be driven by water flowing from the high basin to the low basin. So there will be a continuous renewable source of energy providing power to the Kimberley area.
Obviously, tides rise and fall. During the neap tides, which will occur about two days each fortnight, power output will be reduced. To meet consumer demand and provide security for supply, it is proposed to provide supplementary thermal electricity generation in various locations around the Kimberley from traditional methods such as the use of diesel and other hydrocarbon fuels. But this will only be used to supplement the electricity produced from the Derby hydropower project.
The potential of this project is enormous because generating electricity from the tides at Derby, as I have said, will provide non-polluting reliable power, replacing the need for diesel generation or the use of other hydrocarbon burning fuels. It will allow for stable electricity prices at a low level. And, most importantly perhaps, it will help Australia meet its greenhouse commitments, because the use of the Derby hydropower project will mean a reduction of some 150,000 tonnes in CO2 emissions each year from powerhouse generation in the Kimberley alone.
One of the greatest benefits for the Kimberley from the development of a hydropower project will be the ability to establish a Kimberley grid. That will mean that, instead of small electricity stations running on diesel in the mines and towns of the Kimberley, a grid can be established which would cover the areas from Broome to Fitzroy Crossing, the Western Metals new mine at Pillara and any other new developments which occur in the area.
Western Power has, at the present time, asked for submissions on how the Kimberley power system might be improved, and it has certainly shown a great deal of interest in the prospect of very cheap hydropower from the Derby hydropower project. Of course, as I have said, there is the Mitchell Plateau bauxite deposit, which is one of the largest deposits in the world. Currently, it is simply not feasible to even consider developing those deposits. But, with a similar hydro scheme on one of the fiord-like gorges which form the Kimberley coast further north of Derby, the possibility of developing Mitchell Plateau bauxite becomes quite realistic—and not just a matter of turning it into alumina, but perhaps processing it all the way to aluminium.
Essentially, as I have said, aluminium is regarded as solid electricity, and the bauxite which we process in Australia into alumina is exported to countries like Norway and Canada; there it is further processed because those countries have cheap power. This project would bring to Australia electricity of comparative price to that in Norway and Canada where it is also generated by hydro electricity.
The Derby hydropower proposal is a very visionary scheme which will make use of one of Australia's greatest renewable energy resources—that being the huge tides on the Kimberley coast of Western Australia. The establishment of hydropower will bring extremely cheap electricity to the Kimberley; it will open up the region for development, which will transform the Kimberley; and it will also contribute to Australia's greenhouse emission reduction targets.
In conclusion, the Derby hydropower project has applied to be considered for a funding grant under the renewable energy showcase initiative, to which the coalition government has committed $10.5 million. I would put on record the fact that I believe this project would certainly be worthy of being awarded showcase funding. I certainly endorse the Derby hydropower's application for such funding because, as I have said, this is a very exciting and visionary project which will transform that area of the far north-west of Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Kimberley: Economic Potential</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-12-09,"—A question from Senator Jacinta Collins was taken on notice by me last week. It was a question on the Child Support Agency's staff identification policy. The following advice was provided to the Minister for Community Services, and I propose to table it.
—And incorporate it?
—I will incorporate it too, if you like. I am happy to do that. You can also use a photocopier. I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
QUESTION ON NOTICE OF 3 DECEMBER 1998 FROM SENATOR JACINTA COLLINS ON CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY STAFF IDENTIFICATION POLICY
The following advice was provided by the Minister for Community Services. 

The Child Support Agency encourages staff to give their full names to clients because clients feel more comfortable dealing with staff who have introduced themselves.
However, the Child Support Agency understands that, in some instances, staff may have good reason to prefer not to divulge this information. No staff member is obliged to provide their personal details.
Staff are required to provide clients with their first name, site location and the 131272 number as a contact number.
The staff identification policy and guidelines are readily available to all staff and allow for the use of alternative forms of identification on occasions when a staff member has a genuinely held concern that giving their full name could compromise their safety.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Child Support Agency: Staff Identification</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Robert Ray today, relating to superannuation.
During his answer, Senator Kemp made one of the more despicable allegations you could make in this chamber. He accused all Labor Party members of voting against the 15 per cent superannuation levy in order to enrich themselves. He did so deliberately and he knew the statement was false.
The issues involved here are of both principle and process. The Labor Party reaffirms here today, as it did then, that we support the principle of 15 per cent superannuation tax. What we did not like then, and what we do not like today, is the process adopted by the government. That was a process adopted simply so the government could avoid calling this a tax. That was a process adopted simply to keep the facade of a prime ministerial promise that he would not increase taxation over the life of the first parliament. By having that facade, it meant that many people on lower incomes were levied administrative fees for the processing of this particular tax and were worse off. It also meant that those who had not supplied their tax file numbers, no matter what their income, would be charged the 15 per cent.
When Senator Kemp comes into this chamber and deliberately accuses the Labor Party of self-interest, he fails to distinguish between principle and process, and he is not fit to be a minister of the Crown if he cannot do so. No-one on our side of the chamber has accused Senator Kemp of promoting the private health insurance rebate to enrich himself, and no-one will. No-one will accuse Senator Kemp of supporting the GST simply to enrich himself. He should make a complete apology for that accusation made here today.
But we are used to Senator Kemp. He is a minister who comes into this chamber and cannot answer a question. He was asked today 
 specifically what happens to the superannuation tax on deceased Australians. We did not get an answer out of him. Why? He was not even trying to cover up. He just simply did not know. He comes into this chamber and gets scores of questions to which we get no detailed responses. He is not on top of his portfolio. Heaven knows what he does during the week. He must just sit up in his office and look at the ceiling—not read his briefs, not attend meetings with his departmental officials so they can explain matters to him.
What does this Assistant Treasurer do that makes him so ignorant and so incapable of answering any questions? After all, this is a government that spent tens of millions of dollars developing the GST proposal and spent $15 million trying to sell it to the Australian public via taxpayers' money, and what do we have? We have an Assistant Treasurer who does not understand one iota of his own bill.
Heaven knows what is going to happen when the 16 bills arrive in this chamber. Are they going to bring in a designated hitter to replace Senator Kemp to put the legislation through? He is not capable of putting it through. He is not capable of answering any questions on the GST other than by way of the mindless mantra that he goes on with in this chamber. He should spend some time listening to his colleagues, who occasionally attempt to answer questions. Senator Ian Macdonald came in straight after question time and added further and valuable information to his answer to Senator Woodley's question. Would Senator Kemp ever do that? Never. He is a total and absolute flop as a minister. He is someone whom the first time around John Howard ignored and did not put in his ministry. He only got in after Senator Short got turfed. Why did he get in? You had to have a Victorian for balance; they were not happy with the Prime Minister because, basically, they did not get a good run in 1996.
We are not going to put up with Senator Kemp coming into this chamber and imputing motives for the way we vote. There was never a question in any Labor senator's mind as to whether they would be worse off or better off through the legislation. What was in our 
 minds was to protect those in the community who were worse off, those whom this legislation impacted against, simply because this government did not have the guts, the honesty, to admit that this was a new tax, not a surcharge. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Surcharge</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1998-12-09,"—The questions in recent times about the surcharge and when the surcharge went through have certainly highlighted that this has been a very complicated piece of legislation. As Senator Kemp has strenuously attempted to explain over many days, many months, this was introduced as an equity measure. I think a lot of the questioning indicates that, nowadays, we are very wise after the event. I only wish that the sort of collective wisdom that we are seeing at the moment could have been applied earlier, that it could have been put on the record during hearings of the committee of which Senator Sherry and I were members. I do not recall this particular issue of a death benefit being raised before the committee. Indeed, it is certainly one of the issues.
One of the difficulties is that it is associated with this advance payment. Because it is an advance payment, it is not a provisional tax. This is one of the difficulties with it being a surcharge; they call it a tax at a later date. You did not alter a number of the other issues, which included the advance payment. If you were going to change it to be a tax, you would have assumed, other things being equal, Senator Sherry—I think you might have been responsible for putting that amendment through—that you should have also changed the definitions, et cetera, in relation to the advance payment.
The notion of the advance payment as such was that it was somewhat akin to a provisional tax; but it was not a provisional tax, because at the time it went through it was a surcharge. If you were consistent when you had your big victory in changing it from being called a surcharge to being called a tax, you should have at the same time changed the definition and the naming and the application of the advance payment. It is really in this advance payment area where we run into the 
 sorts of difficulties that Senator Ray outlined in his question.
So because it is an advance payment, it is not a provisional tax. Therefore the provisional tax provisions, such as variation, et cetera, do not apply to the advance payment. This is an oversight which in time I would like to see amended.
I would even like to go further. I have been somewhat outspoken in terms of the application of this. I think a lot of the people who passed this legislation at the time did not fully appreciate the implications of the tax, both to the wider community and, might I add, to themselves. I think a lot of people have got assessments that they have been somewhat surprised about. A number of our colleagues who have left this place or are leaving this place are obviously getting some assessments far in excess of what they would have ordinarily expected.
The difficulty really comes back to the fact that, when the Labor Party changed these rules, they should have gone a bit further and changed the definitions and the applications, et cetera, in relation to the advance payment. Because most people were not aware of the implications, it went through unannounced, unamended. If you were a vigilant opposition, you certainly would have been on your feet saying, `These are the people who are being affected.' True, you did that in relation to certain eligible termination payments; I give you full credit for raising that, because that could cause certain problems. But at the end of the day I think you will find that certain adjustments will be made.
In relation to your particular problem, Senator Ray, I would hope that the tax office, with an astute executor, would make sure that that adjustment will be made. So essentially it is a timing issue but, undoubtedly, it does cause a problem at the time it is issued.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Surcharge</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I have listened intently to the contribution made by Senator Watson. It appears from that contribution that Senator Ray would have been better informed if he had asked the question of Senator Watson rather than Senator Kemp. At least there would have been some understanding of 
 the answer instead of the waffle that we were treated to just over half an hour ago in Senator Kemp's response.
I think it is worth while making the point to the Australian public that Senator Kemp is, in fact, the Assistant Treasurer. That is the position he holds in this government—although the public could be forgiven for wondering whether that is the case. You certainly would not get that understanding from listening to the answers that Senator Kemp gives to questions in this chamber or the contribution he makes to debate on economic issues. In responding to questions, I must say that he is very good at answering anything but the question actually asked of him.
Senator Kemp is very good at obfuscating the issues. He is very good at understanding what is happening in the Labor Party, or reading what snippets might be in the newspapers that morning. But, when it comes to dealing with issues that fall under his portfolio and issues that are of importance in economic terms to the Australian people, then he seems to suffer—suffer very significantly—from lack of memory or selective memory. In fact, one would argue that, in many instances when dealing with economic issues, his memory borders on amnesia.
Over the past two weeks of the parliamentary sitting we, as an opposition, have asked some 20-odd questions and 20-odd supplementary questions of Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp, in response to those questions, has demonstrated a significant inability to explain: what the powers of the ACCC will be over profiteers after GST changes; whether banking fees will attract the GST; the application of the GST on discounted books and its impact on independent booksellers; the impact of the GST on the sale of farms; the impact of the GST on housing; the GST as it relates to bank charges and EFTPOS fees; the collection of superannuation charges; whether claimed industry savings of $10 billion will be passed; the level of input credits that will be GST free; the GST as it applies to private tuition and public school charges; the effect on the CPI of GST-induced house price rises; fringe benefits tax on group certificates; and 
 a host of other issues that have been raised by the opposition in the past week or so. It is no wonder that Senator Kemp is known around this building as `Senator Waffle'.
—Order! Would you please refer to the minister by his correct title.
—Senator Kemp is well known around this building by his nickname—in fact, better known by his nickname than by his title of Assistant Treasurer. Senator Ray in his contribution asked what Senator Kemp does: does he look at the ceiling; does he talk to people in his department; does he take advice on issues relevant to his portfolio?
—He just helps the economy. No help from you lot.
—There would have to be a significant question mark over that. But it would seem that he does not have much to do with the Irish-Australia Association, and he certainly was not much help to Senator Calvert in his quest to be re-elected president of that organisation last night. Senator Kemp, it would appear, probably spends most of his time in the Treasurer's office, making the tea, taking the biscuits backward and forward into the Treasurer's office and having tete-a-tetes with the Treasurer.
It is very obvious that the Treasurer does not take Senator Kemp into his confidence. The Treasurer certainly has not taken him into his confidence with any of the key issues that are of importance to the Australian public in terms of the introduction of a goods and services tax—because Senator Kemp has demonstrated his inability to deal with those questions in this chamber.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-12-09,"—Senator Kemp does not make the tea for the Treasurer, he does not run the biscuits for the Treasurer. All those are just lightweight comments that Senator Campbell has made. We all know that they are not true. The Assistant Treasurer, in fact, has the record of guiding through this parliament in 1996 this government's first budget which was one of the toughest budgets—unfortunately we had 
 to make the tough decisions—ever to go through the parliament. It was a budget which you blocked and checked and delayed all the way. But there was a plan behind that budget which Senator Kemp guided through, and now we are reaping the rewards. We were left with a legacy of $10 billion government deficit, and we had to attend to it. Senator Kemp was party to that with the Treasurer.
After taking the bad times, it is good enough for us also to be able to enjoy the accolades. The accolades are now there for Senator Kemp. We now have, as the Prime Minister put it, the golden days. We now are reaping the benefits of that very tough budget which Senator Kemp had to guide through this Senate—this obstructionist Senate. We now are reaping the rewards of the work put in by Senator Kemp in those very tough days and late nights—rewards such as five per cent growth; such as unemployment now notching below the barrier of eight per cent; such as the lowest interest rates for over 30 years and heading down, with our expecting another notch down in interest rates in the next coming months; and, of course, such as the lowest inflation. Each one of those runs into another and, with each one, the process was begun because of the very tough budget, the 1996 budget, which Senator Kemp helped craft and guide through this Senate.
—He did not.
—He did so. He had the carriage of that budget through the Senate. Now he takes the accolades. If that budget had failed, if the economy were in trouble, the buck would stop on Senator Kemp's table—of course it would. But that has not happened. Therefore, your argument does not stand up—and it certainly does not stand up because, as we saw, Senator Campbell started to waffle and drift off. I think he had run out of material when he began talking about something that had happened in the Irish friendship group that Senator Kemp was not there to support Senator Calvert. No-one has a clue about what he was talking of.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I ask my honourable friend and colleague Senator McGauran, whenever he refers to the other 
 Senator Campbell, to use his Christian name, because I do not want to be associated with a senator who almost single-handedly closed down the construction industry of Australia for one decade.
—There is no point of order, but it would be helpful if people were to actually be able to identify the correct senator to whom they are referring. There are several senators here who have the same name, so it does help.
—That is a fair point of order, and Senator Ian Campbell is quite right. We must distinguish between the two Senator Campbells, there is a great difference between them—and I will make that distinction.
Senator Ray began by accusing the Labor Party of self-interest in regard to the superannuation surcharge. It is in their interest—that is a fair point—just as it is in ours. We all benefit or we are all disadvantaged by it. So I think the point was a bit exaggerated, and you seem to be oversensitive on it. Then Senator Ray and the other speaker—you have had two so far, and I suspect Senator Sherry will be getting up soon—
—No, he's not.
—He's not? So you are dumping the whole issue completely.
—No, you've got me. You had better hurry up.
—This is really just an attack on Senator Kemp. We will have no intelligent argument or debate on the superannuation surcharge—is that it? I would like to make a couple of points on the superannuation surcharge, if I can, and take the politics out of this issue. The other day, Senator Sherry made the point about the administration costs. At least Senator Sherry makes some solid points, and we expect you to as well, Senator Quirke. Instead of just attacking the good Assistant Treasurer, you should make some points.
—Senator McGauran, would you like to address the chair, please.
—Madam Deputy President, if they could make some points about this surcharge and if we could have a focused debate on it, then they will see that the surcharge is indeed an equity measure.
—Please, John.
—Well, why did the House of Representatives support it? Why did your leader, Kim Beazley, support the surcharge and, by the time it got up here, it was being rejected? No-one has yet stood up to explain that. Perhaps Senator Quirk can. What happened between the Houses for the surcharge to be rejected? And you have not let go of it since. It has gone through and you still have not let go of it. That is one contradiction.
—The assessment notices are only just going out.
—There are several contradictions you have to answer in this debate. I want to answer one of the main criticisms, and that is the administration costs and difficulties that this surcharge is facing. It is correct that the collection time has been delayed somewhat. The costs—I only take Senator Sherry's figure on this; he said it was $160 million—
—It was ASPA. ASPA said that.
—Then we will accept that figure, Senator Sherry. As Senator Watson said, it is a complex piece of surcharge or tax—we are happy to call it a tax, and this has been amended in the preamble, I believe. But that is a first year charge. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Surcharge</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-09,"—Firstly, it is very good to see Senator Watson here because we want to thank him for answering the question. In a sense, it is a pity that we did not have Senator Watson on a few other days because he could have filled in all the blank spaces—which, by the way, was all of them, because Senator Kemp never answered anything at all.
I must say that I find this whole debate rather interesting. It used to be the case that there were two things you could rely on: deaths and taxes. Now you can rely on taxes 
 in death. A motion was circulated this morning which impinges on certain benefits that MPs will get when they leave this place in one form or another—horizontally, vertically or however else they leave this joint. This motion, which will be the subject of a debate this afternoon, has a few people worried. As I was walking up and down the corridors a large number of people—people who were rather hypocritically nodding in agreement with the Assistant Treasurer this afternoon—consulted me about how this 15 per cent works.
As Senator Watson said, the cat was out of the bag. Apparently, somebody has been given a very large bill and it is slowly dawning on some of them over there what this means. They come in here and say one thing but when they are out there in the corridor, let me tell you, you cannot even get to the men's room. They want to know how much it is going to cost them and how the whole thing is calculated. Then when we come in here, Senator Watson says that it is all our fault because, if we, as the opposition, had been doing our job properly, we would not have let them make mistakes. That just has to be one of the best chestnuts of the year. I will remember that one for a long time. Somehow or other it always winds up as our fault.
Senator Kemp was missing last week and we went through about 12 or 13 questions. Sometimes we did 14 and 15. We did not have that problem this week. Senator Kemp was back and we were down to fewer questions and even fewer answers. I really thought that Senator Ray asked the one question that we would have to get an answer on. I thought even Senator Kemp would have to tell us whether someone who had died during the course of the year would be dug up and given the bill for this surcharge. I cannot say tax, because it is not a tax; it is a surcharge. What is the difference between a surcharge and a tax? Go and ask the bloke who has just been dug up. You might as well ask him because if you ask Senator Kemp you are not going to get an answer.
You may as well go to the poor individual or the family who has the bill and say, `I don't know whether you realise it or not, but 
 poor old Fred is no longer with us. We miss him. We particularly miss the few quid that he should have paid while he was here, and here is the bill that has been sent to you.' I do not know how you can get anything more straightforward than that: the bloke expires during the course of the year and a bill is sent along to whoever is on the receiving end of this.
We wanted to know whether this was the way the system works. What we were told was, `It's all your fault because, if you had been smarter and a better opposition, you wouldn't have let us do this. You wouldn't have let us set this whole system up. But, you're right, the poor bloke is going to get dug up and given a bill, but it is all your fault.' In fact, I do not know why they just did not offer to give us the shovel to go out there and dig the guy up and say, `I'm sorry, we should have done a better job on this. It's our fault. You've got the bill from this government because we couldn't stop them.' Well, dear oh dear. I think you are going to have to do a lot better than that. I think we should take this break over Christmas to hope that Senator Kemp can take a couple of weeks out to read a few of his briefs before he comes back.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I move the following amendment to the motion just moved by Senator Calvert:
At the end of the motion, add:
""and,
(1)	 in respect of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998, the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report on 8 March 1999; and
(2)	 in respect of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on 15 February 1999."".
I will not delay the Senate too long. I just want to make it clear that when the Selection of Bills Committee cannot reach agreement on matters, particularly reporting dates, we have to bring the matter to the chamber. It is very rare that agreement is not reached; I think it has only happened on a couple of occasions in the last year or so.
The government regards both the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998  and the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  as important pieces of legislation. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill that was before the previous parliament before that parliament was prorogued was indeed the subject of an inquiry and report by a legislation committee, so the bill has already gone through that process. Some honourable senators—I think they were from the Labor Party—sought to have the bill referred once again and were seeking an extremely long reporting date, if I recall correctly, out into May or June or something like that. We have suggested that an appropriate date, which would allow that committee the best part of three months to do its inquiry, would be 8 March 1999. This would allow the parliament the opportunity to deal with that bill in the sittings before Easter.
In relation to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill, the proposals from various other parties, I think, were to look at a reporting date of 22 March. That is in the week leading up to Easter. The government is very keen to avoid—excuse the pun—a logjam of bills in 
 that period leading up to the Easter break. Yesterday, on behalf of the government, I offered a compromise to the committee to have a shorter reporting date on that, but we really do need to deal with this piece of legislation.
We have just heard in the giving of notices that Senator Murphy will seek to refer a range of the policy issues associated with the regional forest agreements to the Rural and Regional Affairs References Committee, with a reporting date foreshadowed for June. I think it is quite appropriate that references committees look into those policy issues, and the government will not stand in the way of that. But in respect of this legislation we believe that, even though there is going to be a Christmas break—hopefully all honourable senators will have some time off during that period—you would be able to do a sensible, considered and thorough examination of the RFA bill 1998 in the more than two months that are available between now and 15 February. Usually, legislation committees are able to do inquiries in a much shorter period. We believe 15 February allows ample time. So we seek the Senate's support for what we regard as reasonable propositions on the reporting dates for both of those important bills.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-09,"—I move an amendment to Senator Ian Campbell's amendment:
Omit ""15 February 1998"", substitute ""22 March 1998, with particular reference to:
(a)	 any legal and constitutional defects of the bill, including (but not limited to):
	 (i)	 whether it is inconsistent with section 99 of the Constitution;
	 (ii)	 whether it is invalid to the extent that it refers to instruments not yet in force or which are able to be varied without reference to Parliament; and
	 (iii)	 whether it is invalid to the extent that the compensation provisions in the RFAs attempt to bind Parliament or fetter the exercise of executive power; and
(b)	 the environmental impacts of the bill, including (but not limited to):
	 (i)	 how it relates to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, in particular, the activities regulated 
 by each and their respective geographical coverage;
	 (ii)	 whether it will fetter the capacity of the Commonwealth to meets its obligations under the World Heritage Convention, Climate Change Convention or other international treaties, especially by virtue of the compensation provisions in the RFAs; and
	 (iii)	 whether the requirements of the Australian Heritage Act 1975 , the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974  and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992  have been met (notwithstanding declarations to that effect in the RFAs) and the environmental impact of RFAs overriding those Acts"".
I do not believe that February is time enough for this extremely important matter to be adequately canvassed by the committee. I am also concerned that the committee have particular reference to the constitutional ramifications of these regional forest agreements and the legislation which is aimed to cement them into place.
On the face of it, there are inconsistencies. This legislation has difficulties with section 99 of the constitution and it needs to be investigated by this particular committee. Moreover, the legislation has major environmental ramifications. If we do not look at those through this committee, I am not sure where they are going to be looked at.
 Let me give you the example of the impact of this legislation on global warming. Evidence is now rapidly coming to the fore that the best security the planet can have against global warming, which is hardly a disputed effect these days, is to keep our forests intact because they are the best terrestrial carbon bank available. This committee needs to investigate whether locking those forests out of their function as a carbon bank in the future is not a major mistake for this nation to be making. This is new science. It needs to be looked at.
 The legislation that this committee is looking at will lock the Commonwealth out of effectively having a say in Australia's forests for the next 20 years. It actually locks all governments out of having a say. It delivers the forests into the hands of the big 
 logging corporations, in particular the woodchip corporations.
Many citizens would not know that to protect forests in the future—whether they be in New South Wales, in Victoria, in Western Australia, in Tasmania or with a regional forest agreement coming up in Queensland—the public will have to buy them back. Governments are going to have to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to buy back forests to protect them as national parks or as carbon banks, with all their wildlife, from these corporations who are not paying a penny. This legislation is effectively handing Australia's magnificent wild forest resource and the wildlife across to the woodchip corporations on a platter—no price and basically no searching questions asked.
This is a critical moment for the history of this Australian parliament's governance of one of our most critical resources for the future—and that is the forests. I may maintain that the forests should be left standing, and members opposite may maintain that they should be blitzed and sent off to the woodchip mills and then to the paper dumps of Japan. But there is more to this legislation than that. This has constitutional ramifications. It has ramifications far beyond the forests and profits for how Australia is going to handle the increasingly dire problem of global warming.
Scientists tell us that, in the last 15 months of global weather measurements, every month without exception has been the hottest month on record. It is something that we cannot keep our heads in the sand about any longer. We have Australian scientists saying, `The best way that Australia is going to be able to ameliorate this factor in the future'—amongst a suite of other sensible provisions—`is to keep our best carbon bank intact. Don't trade that bank away for woodchips or for short-term profits.' But that is what this legislation does.
They are some reasons as to why this is important. This committee must have a particular reference—and time—to look at the matters that I have canvassed. I commend this extremely important amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-09,"—I want to speak briefly to this amend 
 ment and a number of other amendments. This amendment, and others, and various references are really causing indigestion for the rural affairs committee. If the chair of the legislation committee were here, he would also say the same thing. We actually now have three references with three different reporting dates.
We have an amendment from Senator Brown which, in a way, goes beyond the scope of the legislation committee to deal with. It is more a references committee matter. Then we have a reference on policy matters from Senator Murphy, which also deals with the same matter. The Democrats will not oppose this amendment, but I think the committee itself will have to take these various references and rationalise them in some way. I give that notice to the Senate. I thank Senator Murphy for the fact that he did have some discussions with the committee about how the terms of reference might be framed. But I thought, as chair of the references committee, I ought to at least signal that the two committees will need to rationalise in some way these various amendments, various reporting dates, and the fact that both the legislation committee and the references committee will have to deal with the matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I want to foreshadow that I will move a further amendment. I think it is an amendment to the amendment to the amendment.
—Yes, that is correct.
—I foreshadow that I will move:
Paragraph (a) omit ""8 March"" substitute ""19 April"".
Paragraph (b) omit ""15 February"" substitute ""22 March"".
The debate at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee seemed to me to revolve around whether the appropriate reporting date was 8 March or 22 March. As I understand it, another date is proposed in the motion as outlined but in a different form from the written one that appears in the chamber. 
The suggestion that there was some compromise offered may be the position. However, the reality is that the debate centred on whether we would be reporting on 8 March or 22 March. I point out to the chamber that the difference in terms of the government's ability to debate the bill is one sitting week. That is, we will have the bill available for debate in either the first or the second sitting week in March. That is the difference between the parties.
This is clearly a complex bill. Look at the matters that Senator Brown seeks to refer to the committee. I would have thought it competent for any witness to raise with the committee any of the matters contained in his amendment. Therefore, his amendment is not necessary. We agree with his reporting date, as that is consistent with the position we took at the Selection of Bills Committee. We think that Senator Brown's amendment is unnecessary. If submissions arrive before the committee, the committee can deal with those matters. Senators who are on the committee or participating on the committee can seek to advance arguments accordingly.
—Well, support it.
—We will not support it, because it is not necessary. We do, however, support the date of 22 March, which you put forward. In relation to that, we say again that this is a very complex area. This is an area where there is a lot of feeling.
Given the likelihood of submissions being received between now and Christmas being small, and allowing the many members of the community who have an interest in this matter to present submissions to the committee, it would be appropriate that the closing date not be until perhaps late January or early February. Given the need to allow witnesses in parts of Australia other than Canberra to give evidence, the committee will need to travel, and there is limited time to do that. There also needs to be time for the secretariat to prepare the report, given the other work that Senator Woodley indicates it has. We urge the Senate to support that aspect of our amendment.
I want to pick up one point about the RFA reference that was made by Senator Ian 
 Campbell. The implication of what he said about Senator Murphy's proposed reference, which at this stage is a motion and not a fact, is that perhaps the government is supporting it. I look forward to the confirmation of that matter.
In relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill, the argument that Labor puts is that it is necessary for this committee to travel and to allow members of the Aboriginal committee in the west, north-west and northern Australia to present their submissions. Again, there will need to be time for those submissions to be prepared. The reality is that this is a complex issue and a complex legal issue which cannot, in our view, be resolved by relying upon the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra triangle to be the source of evidence in the matter.
We urge the Senate to support the amendment that we have outlined and to make the reporting dates 19 April for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill and 22 March for the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I am looking at what the government is proposing here and what Senator Woodley said with regard to the discussion. I raised at a committee meeting of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee the possibility of looking at some of the circumstances with regard to the RFAs that are both in place and being negotiated in this country. I did so out of concerns that have been raised with me by workers and contractors in the industry.
The RFA has one key objective among many. One of the key objectives is import replacement, job creation and the utilisation of what is a very valuable resource in what can be and could be a very significant industry in this country. But having had experience over a long time with the national forest policy statement and, prior to that, all the inquiries in our state, I understand some of the circumstances that have confronted the industry over a long time. The industry has been looking for resource security. It is important to have resource security for the 
 purpose of investment. I totally support that notion.
What is happening in the industry currently is totally unacceptable in terms of what is a very valuable resource and the utilisation of it. Many people are losing their jobs. In an adjournment speech, I referred to people in New South Wales who were mentioned on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald. They lost their jobs by having their names drawn out of a hat. I was talking to people about a sawmill in my state that closed last week. Five people lost their jobs. Why? They were told that there were no logs to supply that mill. Frankly, I find that totally unacceptable. I know that throughout the state there are more than enough logs to supply a mill. This was the Cue River sawmill, which has been operating for about 100 years. It is for those reasons that I moved the reference to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. This parliament, including the Senate, has a responsibility to assess processes that were put in place by agreement with the state and Commonwealth as a result of a Commonwealth initiative. If they are not working, we should take steps to rectify those problems.
If we pass the regional forest agreement legislation, it effectively rules the Commonwealth out of the game. It will put in place a regional forest agreement and legislation which, if there is a breach of the regional forest agreement, means that the only occurrence that can take place is the termination of the agreement. I do not think anybody would want to see that happen.
That is why I think there has to be greater flexibility in regional forest agreements and the legislation that underpins them. There needs to be a process through which the Commonwealth and the states can discuss and agree on remedial action to bring about the achievement of objectives where they are not being met, particularly in respect of the import replacement of forest products. The trade deficit within Australia is running at around $2 billion per annum in forest products, so it is not as though there is no scope for us to have some import replacement strategies and some export strategies. Many 
 reports, some of them commissioned by state and federal governments, tell us that there is a significant shortage in supply over demand in hardwood timbers in the South-East Asian region, let alone in other parts of the world.
We know that the forest resources of the countries to our immediate north are declining at a significant rate and that forests cannot continue to be cut at the current rate. Therefore, I think we have a responsibility as a country in this region of the world to better manage our forest resources and utilise them in a way that maximises the benefits to the states, to the economy and to the country as a whole, particularly as it relates to jobs.
—And the environment?
—And the environment. When the Prime Minister and the then premier, Tony Rundle, signed the regional forest agreement for Tasmania, there was an announcement about 1,000 new jobs. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I will not take terribly long because I think the key issues have already been canvassed. I just want to make two points. Firstly, I support the amendment foreshadowed by Senator O'Brien. This is a very complex issue. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has had a brief discussion about the work it would undertake when Senator Murphy foreshadowed that he would seek to move a notice of motion to the effect that he has done today. Secondly, we are aware that it is likely that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee will have to look at the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 .
I support the remarks of Senator Woodley. This is an issue that is going to require some detailed work by both committees and it certainly should not be rushed. It is quite clear that the government's proposal is ridiculous, given the requirements of the Senate committees and the Senate itself when we resume in February next year. I also want to place on record that, while I acknowledge that it is somewhat late in the process, we have been endeavouring to bring these various reporting dates into some appropriate se 
 quence. I raised with the parliamentary secretary and other representatives whether we would be able to defer this matter and further consider and resolve it, but that does not appear to be the case.
—You can't hear a bill in two months—is that your problem?
—No—a day, Senator Ferguson. Even you would not be able to cope with that. Beyond that, I strongly support the foreshadowed amendment of Senator O'Brien.

—I put the question that Senator O'Brien's amendments to the amendment moved by Senator Campbell be agreed to. As a division is required, ring the bells for one minute.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-09,"—I move the following amendment to the motion just moved by Senator Calvert:
At the end of the motion, add:
""and,
(1)	 in respect of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998, the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report on 8 March 1999; and
(2)	 in respect of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on 15 February 1999."".
I will not delay the Senate too long. I just want to make it clear that when the Selection of Bills Committee cannot reach agreement on matters, particularly reporting dates, we have to bring the matter to the chamber. It is very rare that agreement is not reached; I think it has only happened on a couple of occasions in the last year or so.
The government regards both the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998  and the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  as important pieces of legislation. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill that was before the previous parliament before that parliament was prorogued was indeed the subject of an inquiry and report by a legislation committee, so the bill has already gone through that process. Some honourable senators—I think they were from the Labor Party—sought to have the bill referred once again and were seeking an extremely long reporting date, if I recall correctly, out into May or June or something like that. We have suggested that an appropriate date, which would allow that committee the best part of three months to do its inquiry, would be 8 March 1999. This would allow the parliament the opportunity to deal with that bill in the sittings before Easter.
In relation to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill, the proposals from various other parties, I think, were to look at a reporting date of 22 March. That is in the week leading up to Easter. The government is very keen to avoid—excuse the pun—a logjam of bills in 
 that period leading up to the Easter break. Yesterday, on behalf of the government, I offered a compromise to the committee to have a shorter reporting date on that, but we really do need to deal with this piece of legislation.
We have just heard in the giving of notices that Senator Murphy will seek to refer a range of the policy issues associated with the regional forest agreements to the Rural and Regional Affairs References Committee, with a reporting date foreshadowed for June. I think it is quite appropriate that references committees look into those policy issues, and the government will not stand in the way of that. But in respect of this legislation we believe that, even though there is going to be a Christmas break—hopefully all honourable senators will have some time off during that period—you would be able to do a sensible, considered and thorough examination of the RFA bill 1998 in the more than two months that are available between now and 15 February. Usually, legislation committees are able to do inquiries in a much shorter period. We believe 15 February allows ample time. So we seek the Senate's support for what we regard as reasonable propositions on the reporting dates for both of those important bills.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-09,"—I move an amendment to Senator Ian Campbell's amendment:
Omit ""15 February 1998"", substitute ""22 March 1998, with particular reference to:
(a)	 any legal and constitutional defects of the bill, including (but not limited to):
	 (i)	 whether it is inconsistent with section 99 of the Constitution;
	 (ii)	 whether it is invalid to the extent that it refers to instruments not yet in force or which are able to be varied without reference to Parliament; and
	 (iii)	 whether it is invalid to the extent that the compensation provisions in the RFAs attempt to bind Parliament or fetter the exercise of executive power; and
(b)	 the environmental impacts of the bill, including (but not limited to):
	 (i)	 how it relates to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, in particular, the activities regulated 
 by each and their respective geographical coverage;
	 (ii)	 whether it will fetter the capacity of the Commonwealth to meets its obligations under the World Heritage Convention, Climate Change Convention or other international treaties, especially by virtue of the compensation provisions in the RFAs; and
	 (iii)	 whether the requirements of the Australian Heritage Act 1975 , the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974  and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992  have been met (notwithstanding declarations to that effect in the RFAs) and the environmental impact of RFAs overriding those Acts"".
I do not believe that February is time enough for this extremely important matter to be adequately canvassed by the committee. I am also concerned that the committee have particular reference to the constitutional ramifications of these regional forest agreements and the legislation which is aimed to cement them into place.
On the face of it, there are inconsistencies. This legislation has difficulties with section 99 of the constitution and it needs to be investigated by this particular committee. Moreover, the legislation has major environmental ramifications. If we do not look at those through this committee, I am not sure where they are going to be looked at.
 Let me give you the example of the impact of this legislation on global warming. Evidence is now rapidly coming to the fore that the best security the planet can have against global warming, which is hardly a disputed effect these days, is to keep our forests intact because they are the best terrestrial carbon bank available. This committee needs to investigate whether locking those forests out of their function as a carbon bank in the future is not a major mistake for this nation to be making. This is new science. It needs to be looked at.
 The legislation that this committee is looking at will lock the Commonwealth out of effectively having a say in Australia's forests for the next 20 years. It actually locks all governments out of having a say. It delivers the forests into the hands of the big 
 logging corporations, in particular the woodchip corporations.
Many citizens would not know that to protect forests in the future—whether they be in New South Wales, in Victoria, in Western Australia, in Tasmania or with a regional forest agreement coming up in Queensland—the public will have to buy them back. Governments are going to have to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to buy back forests to protect them as national parks or as carbon banks, with all their wildlife, from these corporations who are not paying a penny. This legislation is effectively handing Australia's magnificent wild forest resource and the wildlife across to the woodchip corporations on a platter—no price and basically no searching questions asked.
This is a critical moment for the history of this Australian parliament's governance of one of our most critical resources for the future—and that is the forests. I may maintain that the forests should be left standing, and members opposite may maintain that they should be blitzed and sent off to the woodchip mills and then to the paper dumps of Japan. But there is more to this legislation than that. This has constitutional ramifications. It has ramifications far beyond the forests and profits for how Australia is going to handle the increasingly dire problem of global warming.
Scientists tell us that, in the last 15 months of global weather measurements, every month without exception has been the hottest month on record. It is something that we cannot keep our heads in the sand about any longer. We have Australian scientists saying, `The best way that Australia is going to be able to ameliorate this factor in the future'—amongst a suite of other sensible provisions—`is to keep our best carbon bank intact. Don't trade that bank away for woodchips or for short-term profits.' But that is what this legislation does.
They are some reasons as to why this is important. This committee must have a particular reference—and time—to look at the matters that I have canvassed. I commend this extremely important amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-12-09,"—I want to speak briefly to this amend 
 ment and a number of other amendments. This amendment, and others, and various references are really causing indigestion for the rural affairs committee. If the chair of the legislation committee were here, he would also say the same thing. We actually now have three references with three different reporting dates.
We have an amendment from Senator Brown which, in a way, goes beyond the scope of the legislation committee to deal with. It is more a references committee matter. Then we have a reference on policy matters from Senator Murphy, which also deals with the same matter. The Democrats will not oppose this amendment, but I think the committee itself will have to take these various references and rationalise them in some way. I give that notice to the Senate. I thank Senator Murphy for the fact that he did have some discussions with the committee about how the terms of reference might be framed. But I thought, as chair of the references committee, I ought to at least signal that the two committees will need to rationalise in some way these various amendments, various reporting dates, and the fact that both the legislation committee and the references committee will have to deal with the matter.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I want to foreshadow that I will move a further amendment. I think it is an amendment to the amendment to the amendment.
—Yes, that is correct.
—I foreshadow that I will move:
Paragraph (a) omit ""8 March"" substitute ""19 April"".
Paragraph (b) omit ""15 February"" substitute ""22 March"".
The debate at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee seemed to me to revolve around whether the appropriate reporting date was 8 March or 22 March. As I understand it, another date is proposed in the motion as outlined but in a different form from the written one that appears in the chamber. 
The suggestion that there was some compromise offered may be the position. However, the reality is that the debate centred on whether we would be reporting on 8 March or 22 March. I point out to the chamber that the difference in terms of the government's ability to debate the bill is one sitting week. That is, we will have the bill available for debate in either the first or the second sitting week in March. That is the difference between the parties.
This is clearly a complex bill. Look at the matters that Senator Brown seeks to refer to the committee. I would have thought it competent for any witness to raise with the committee any of the matters contained in his amendment. Therefore, his amendment is not necessary. We agree with his reporting date, as that is consistent with the position we took at the Selection of Bills Committee. We think that Senator Brown's amendment is unnecessary. If submissions arrive before the committee, the committee can deal with those matters. Senators who are on the committee or participating on the committee can seek to advance arguments accordingly.
—Well, support it.
—We will not support it, because it is not necessary. We do, however, support the date of 22 March, which you put forward. In relation to that, we say again that this is a very complex area. This is an area where there is a lot of feeling.
Given the likelihood of submissions being received between now and Christmas being small, and allowing the many members of the community who have an interest in this matter to present submissions to the committee, it would be appropriate that the closing date not be until perhaps late January or early February. Given the need to allow witnesses in parts of Australia other than Canberra to give evidence, the committee will need to travel, and there is limited time to do that. There also needs to be time for the secretariat to prepare the report, given the other work that Senator Woodley indicates it has. We urge the Senate to support that aspect of our amendment.
I want to pick up one point about the RFA reference that was made by Senator Ian 
 Campbell. The implication of what he said about Senator Murphy's proposed reference, which at this stage is a motion and not a fact, is that perhaps the government is supporting it. I look forward to the confirmation of that matter.
In relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill, the argument that Labor puts is that it is necessary for this committee to travel and to allow members of the Aboriginal committee in the west, north-west and northern Australia to present their submissions. Again, there will need to be time for those submissions to be prepared. The reality is that this is a complex issue and a complex legal issue which cannot, in our view, be resolved by relying upon the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra triangle to be the source of evidence in the matter.
We urge the Senate to support the amendment that we have outlined and to make the reporting dates 19 April for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill and 22 March for the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I am looking at what the government is proposing here and what Senator Woodley said with regard to the discussion. I raised at a committee meeting of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee the possibility of looking at some of the circumstances with regard to the RFAs that are both in place and being negotiated in this country. I did so out of concerns that have been raised with me by workers and contractors in the industry.
The RFA has one key objective among many.

But having had experience over a long time with the national forest policy statement and, prior to that, all the inquiries in our state, I understand some of the circumstances that have confronted the industry over a long time. The industry has been looking for resource security. It is important to have resource security for the

What is happening in the industry currently is totally unacceptable in terms of what is a very valuable resource and the utilisation of it. Many people are losing their jobs. In an adjournment speech, I referred to people in New South Wales who were mentioned on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald. They lost their jobs by having their names drawn out of a hat. I was talking to people about a sawmill in my state that closed last week. Five people lost their jobs. Why? They were told that there were no logs to supply that mill. Frankly, I find that totally unacceptable. I know that throughout the state there are more than enough logs to supply a mill. This was the Cue River sawmill, which has been operating for about 100 years. It is for those reasons that I moved the reference to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. This parliament, including the Senate, has a responsibility to assess processes that were put in place by agreement with the state and Commonwealth as a result of a Commonwealth initiative. If they are not working, we should take steps to rectify those problems.
If we pass the regional forest agreement legislation, it effectively rules the Commonwealth out of the game. It will put in place a regional forest agreement and legislation which, if there is a breach of the regional forest agreement, means that the only occurrence that can take place is the termination of the agreement.

There needs to be a process through which the Commonwealth and the states can discuss and agree on remedial action to bring about the achievement of objectives where they are not being met, particularly in respect of the import replacement of forest products. The trade deficit within Australia is running at around $2 billion per annum in forest products, so it is not as though there is no scope for us to have some import replacement strategies and some export strategies. Many 
 reports, some of them commissioned by state and federal governments, tell us that there is a significant shortage in supply over demand in hardwood timbers in the South-East Asian region, let alone in other parts of the world.
We know that the forest resources of the countries to our immediate north are declining at a significant rate and that forests cannot continue to be cut at the current rate. Therefore, I think we have a responsibility as a country in this region of the world to better manage our forest resources and utilise them in a way that maximises the benefits to the states, to the economy and to the country as a whole, particularly as it relates to jobs.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I will not take terribly long because I think the key issues have already been canvassed. I just want to make two points. Firstly, I support the amendment foreshadowed by Senator O'Brien. This is a very complex issue. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has had a brief discussion about the work it would undertake when Senator Murphy foreshadowed that he would seek to move a notice of motion to the effect that he has done today.

It is quite clear that the government's proposal is ridiculous, given the requirements of the Senate committees and the Senate itself when we resume in February next year. I also want to place on record that, while I acknowledge that it is somewhat late in the process, we have been endeavouring to bring these various reporting dates into some appropriate se 
 quence. I raised with the parliamentary secretary and other representatives whether we would be able to defer this matter and further consider and resolve it, but that does not appear to be the case.
—You can't hear a bill in two months—is that your problem?

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-09,"—On behalf of Senator Lees, I move:
That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:
The need to reform the Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme to reduce the level of public subsidy and to ensure that benefits cannot be accessed if a former member is found guilty of an offence against the Commonwealth, or until a former member turns 55 years old, and for the Government to immediately propose legislation to this effect.
This motion calls for the immediate introduction of legislation to reform the parliamentary superannuation scheme—and it is a very important motion. It is a motion that ought to 
 command the support of the entire Senate. I have been pushed to move this urgency motion by the Prime Minister's extraordinary statements last week in the other place conceding that the current parliamentary support scheme is too generous but that it was a problem `that you will never really solve', to use his words.
That, in my view, is a very major cop-out. It is a cop-out because the public is increasingly calling for politicians to live by the same rules as everybody else. As George Megalogenis, in the most recent of a number of editorial pieces in several papers, said yesterday:
The longer the government puts off these necessary reforms for the past, present and future MPs, the bigger the risk that the voters will falsely view Howard's inaction as greed rather than just plain gutlessness.
My motion refers to the three areas where reform of our parliamentary super scheme is most urgently needed to bring it closer to community standards: first, we have to reduce the level of public subsidy; second, we have to ensure that parliamentarians' access to their pensions is given at the same time as everybody else—and that is not before the age of 55; third, we have to ensure that, if an MP is found guilty of an offence against the Commonwealth, they should not be entitled to keep the publicly funded part of their superannuation. These are the minimum reforms needed to quell public anger, and let me go through them.
The public subsidy of the superannuation scheme, according to the Government Actuary's advice to the Senate superannuation committee, is the equivalent of around 69 per cent of salary; that is, around $57,000 a year public subsidy on top of a backbencher's salary of around $82,000. That means, for every dollar a parliamentarian is paying into their super scheme, the public will eventually have to pay around $6. Just in comparison, the public pays just over $2 for every dollar that public servants pay into their superannuation scheme.
By anyone's standard, the parliamentary super subsidy is excessive. But it gets worse, because the level of public subsidy depends 
 on how long a member has been in office. So, if a member leaves with less than eight years of service, it is a very low subsidy. With eight years of service, it peaks at over eight times their personal contributions, falling to 4.88 times at 18 years of service and to 3.17 times at 24 years of service.
An accumulation scheme with a fixed government subsidy set at a much lower multiple would be fairer to all parliamentarians and would be seen as fairer by the public—and this is, I think, very important. The public wants to know that their former parliamentarians access their super on the same terms as other people. Here I acknowledge that, under reforms to the scheme, future lump sum benefits after July next year must be preserved but pensions are still accessible immediately. That sort of largess is not available to public servants taking out a pension or, indeed, to any beneficiaries under pension based superannuation schemes.
This early access to pensions again adds to the unfairness between different groups of members and, whilst I acknowledge that it is perfectly legal, under the same scheme I do not think it is appropriate that a former member after nine years of service can be entitled to an indexed pension for life of $45,000 a year at, say, 35 years of age. Pensions like lump sums should not be accessible until age 55. However, we accept that some form of retrenchment benefit might be appropriate for a short period after a member loses their seat.
The third reform is to address fairly and squarely the issue of access to publicly funded superannuation benefits where the former parliamentarian has breached public trust and committed some offence against the Commonwealth. Again, the public is entitled to be outraged that a parliamentarian, like the former member for Parkes, can be found guilty of misuse of Commonwealth funds and still be entitled to superannuation benefits worth around $1 million, 85 per cent of which is funded by the public. Reforms to allow superannuation entitlements to be frozen where a former member is charged and then allowing only refund of personal contribution if the former member is found guilty, I 
 believe, are essential. If a former parliamentarian is found to have breached public trust, then the public should turn off the `subsidy tap', as it were. As Mr Megalogenis puts it, this should deter anyone else who thinks they could get away with false travel claims.
There are other reforms which should be made, many of which were discussed in detail by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. The information is there and available on the failings of the scheme; and the information is there that the public regards the superannuation scheme as a rort and that reform could help restore faith in politicians in this country.
What is lacking, however, is the will. In response to a question from Mr Peter Andren, the Prime Minister acknowledged that a review of the scheme should look at the level of subsidy, the age 55 preservation issues and the issue of people convicted of criminal offences. He said he did not close his mind to a review, although we have already had a review. But then he said, `You could never really solve the problem and you will not solve the anomalies of this within a short space of time.'
It is now 15 months since the Senate superannuation committee brought down its report containing all of the information the government needed to develop a reform response, and we would argue that 15 months is more than a reasonable time to fix the scheme. The government's response is just not good enough. Passage of this motion will help to show the government that calls for fixing the scheme are not going to go away. The super scheme is a rort, the Senate should label it as a rort and the government should be called upon to fix it.
Madam Deputy President, I note that Senator Faulkner has moved some amendments to my motion. Is it appropriate at this point for me to seek leave to incorporate those amendments in my motion?
—Senator, I believe that cannot be done at this stage. Senator Faulkner will move his amendments by leave later.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1998-12-09,"—I must reject the notion that the parliamentary superannuation scheme is an absolute rort. I do not think making that sort of statement in this place does anything for the dignity or service of members of parliament, because we all know that those sorts of statements attract the eye of the press. It is those sorts of statements that cause discussions outside parliament.
Unfortunately, the complexities of the scheme are not widely understood or even accurately reported. Members contribute 11.5 per cent of their after tax salary, and this is very high when we compare it with community standards. Under some circumstances, the scheme does allow commutation up to 50 per cent. But, after a certain age, that commutation factor comes down quite considerably, so there is a discouragement to taking a lump sum and it is not as attractive for people to stay in the parliament long term.
But the scheme can be considered generous by certain community standards. It is unusual, but not unique, for some members to receive a pension benefit before age 55. However, it is relatively difficult nowadays to qualify for a pension benefit, and many parliamentarians in this volatile climate do not stay long enough to qualify. If one looks at the statistics in recent years, this is increasingly the case, particularly in the light of an increasingly volatile electorate when one looks at the turnover in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Members and senators who retire voluntarily are only entitled to a pension if they complete more than 12 years service or have ceased to be a member on four election occasions. If defeated at an election, they must have completed eight years of service or have, on three occasions, ceased to be a member on the dissolution of the House of which they were then a member to qualify for a pension.
Parliamentarians who do not qualify for a pension are only entitled to a lump sum which is equivalent to a refund of their own contributions without interest plus a taxpayer funded supplement of 21/3 times those contributions if defeated. If they retire voluntarily, the supplement is only 11/6. So that is not a 
 lot of attraction for people who want to make a contribution for a very short period of their life, and I am thinking of people who might have retired from high positions, who want to come into this place, serve a term and then move out. By any standards I would not say, Senator Allison, that that is a rort, because I do not think the scheme favours those sorts of people. These short-term serving MPs are the kind of people we should be trying to encourage into the parliament—people who have some experience and are prepared to stay four, five, six years and then perhaps retire. Certainly the parliament would be much richer for attracting such people.
Many of those benefits to which I have just referred are relatively modest when compared to the severance or involuntary retrenchment packages received in the private sector. Retrenchment benefit, holiday pay and termination benefits are not part of a parliamentarians remuneration. These costs are theoretically absorbed in the parliamentary scheme. So we really must look at the total package, not just the more generous aspects of superannuation. Unfortunately, the Democrats are looking at some of the more generous aspects only and certainly not the whole package.
In September 1997 the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation handed down its 25th report, entitled The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and the Judges Pension Scheme. Not surprisingly, Senator Lyn Allison of the Australian Democrats provided a dissenting report. While the Judges Pension Scheme encountered some limited criticism, it was the parliamentary scheme that attracted most attention from the wider public and naturally the press. While some critics pointed the finger at the generosity of the judges scheme, there was a general acknowledgment that judges receive from the Commonwealth much less than they would receive as barristers, particularly in the higher echelons of the court or in private practice. There was also the very important question of judicial independence. This question of generosity was not considered relevant by a lot of the witnesses in respect of politicians—except for a few politicians on both sides of 
 the parliament. They recognised that some of the leaders may be under-remunerated.
Many parliamentarians do not stay in the parliament long enough to enjoy the benefits which the media and the Democrats are so willing to highlight. When we handed down our report, Liberal senators acknowledged that the scheme was, in some areas, out of step with community standards. We differed on some minor aspects with our ALP colleagues in terms of the solution to the problem.
Unfortunately, much of the written material in the popular media is not always factually correct. On other occasions, calculations of entitlement for long-serving Prime Ministers and ministers were used by the popular media as if they were applicable to most members of parliament and, once the benefit is reported in the press, whether accurate or not a lot of people believe the press. Some of those calculations, of course, were also based on a pension assuming each individual lived until an age of about 80 years and the amount then converted as if it were a lump sum payment. In one release in the past six months, one journalist actually made five major errors in a headline article.
This motion should look at the remuneration package. When one considers the amount that is paid to Mark Taylor, the captain of the Australian cricket team, the Prime Minister's salary pales into insignificance. If we further look at the rest of the cabinet, they compare unfavourably with the rest of the better players in the first XI.
—Sheffield Shield wages.
—My colleague says that they are perhaps Sheffield Shield type wages. Thank you, Senator Ferguson. So we have to look at the total remuneration package.
Some provisions actually should be removed from the parliamentary scheme. I refer to the double jeopardy provisions. We had a situation not so long ago when a parliamentarian who may have been convicted of a road offence running the risk of losing the whole of his parliamentary superannuation. The penalty in that case, because of the double jeopardy provisions, may have been far in 
 excess of what the infringement might have warranted.
Obviously, I have to declare an interest in this issue because I am a member of the scheme and also a trustee. The scheme was designed at a time when the age expectancy of parliamentarians was much shorter and when people came into parliament at an older age.
While a lot of attention has been paid to the pension's so-called generosity, the anomalies are very slowly being removed. There indeed are anomalies—for example, in relation to orphan benefits on a pensioner's death and where a person remarries. There are anomalies in regard to the maximum total of reversionary benefits payable in respect of a member. There are features in regard to an MP with over 18 years service continuing to contribute, although at a much lesser rate, and having progressively smaller lump sum entitlements. So the longer you are here, the less the lump sum payment you are entitled to.
Then we have all the problems associated with the surcharge, particularly if the tax office is a bit slow in issuing assessments. So it is up to the tax office to get its act together to promptly issue surcharge statements to minimise these sorts of problems. People who are defeated at an election can find they have a heck of a tax bill to pay in relation to the surcharge plus the bank overdraft of financing an election.
The problem for some politicians is the uneven curve at which the employer contributes to the scheme. This can give rise to very high contribution rates at certain times, particularly around about the eight year mark where the contribution tax is high disproportionately. In such circumstances, a parliamentarian defeated at an election will get an abnormally high surcharge bill.
While there is no apparent difficulty in attracting people to stand for parliament, I feel the whole remuneration package is now in such a state that many talented people will not contemplate parliamentary service because of the relatively low remuneration compared with other options available to them, particularly those people who want to come for the short-term after a major career. The disrup 
 tions to established lifestyles and careers offer further disincentives. I am also concerned at the very narrow base from which a lot of our parliamentarians are coming. I wonder if this is also due to the parliamentary scheme.
In the interests of representative government, it is desirable that a wide a range of people undertake parliamentary service. That includes people from the most productive sector, in terms of their actually getting out productively in the workforce and getting their hands dirty and earning money in a mining, manufacturing or agricultural sense.
Success in business or the professions, with its resultant high remuneration, should not deter these people from standing for parliament. As such, the conditions of service in parliament should be appropriate to encourage high quality parliamentary candidates. At the same time it would be regrettable if people were attracted to parliament purely for their own financial gain.
In the wider community there is a resistance to raising the salary of parliamentarians, so the conditions tend to stay the same. Parliamentarians do not have the option of salary packaging that the general community has. Unfortunately, the motion before us, I believe, is a knee-jerk, populist motion which in the long term will not help the parliament at all. I believe that the 25th report has the right solution.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-09,"—I begin my contribution by asking why we are debating this as an urgency motion today. I think I can probably answer my own rhetorical question, which is that this is a pretty cheap publicity stunt from the Australian Democrats and from Senator Lees, who apparently hasn't even had the courage to come in and move her own urgency motion. I suspect it is an unnecessary debate for us to have today. But I am not willing on behalf of the opposition to take the approach of just simply signing off on this urgency motion that is before the Senate and the simplistic recommendations that are contained within it and calling on the government to bring forward legislation to give these simplistic proposals effect.
I use the word `simplistic' advisedly. Take, for example, the proposal of the Democrats that benefits not be accessed if a former member is found guilty of an offence against the Commonwealth. Let's have a look at this. Currently the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, section 22, operates to disqualify a member or senator from receiving any benefit under the act other than their own contributions if the member or senator is convicted of an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for a year or more. However, if the member or senator were to choose to resign his or her seat before being convicted, that act would not apply. Several recent cases have highlighted that deficiency.
The Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 provides for the imposition of a superannuation order in respect of a Commonwealth employee who has been convicted of a corruption offence and who has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months in respect of the offence. The effect of the order is to disentitle the employee to all employer funded superannuation benefits. So an authorisation from the Minister for Justice to the Director of Public Prosecutions is required for such an order to be sought.
A corruption offence is defined as an offence that constitutes an abuse of office or a perversion of the course of justice. A Commonwealth employee is defined so as to include members of parliament. The benefit of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 is that it applies to any offence and any sentence, subject only to the provision that the offence is punishable by imprisonment for a year or more.
The benefit of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act is that it applies to former as well as serving members of parliament. However, it requires an order by a minister which is subject to political discretion and can only apply in instances where an actual sentence of more than 12 months is imposed. A wholly suspended sentence falls outside the reach of the act. It also applies only to so-called corruption offences. Many very serious offences that would be regarded with justifiable revulsion by the community and carry 
 very serious sentences would not fall within the meaning of the definition of a corruption offence.
Let us be very clinical about the motion that is before the Senate. Senator Lees's motion suffers from a variety of deficiencies. Firstly, it applies only to Commonwealth offences. Many serious offences are covered only by state and territory legislation and criminal codes. A conviction for such an offence would fall outside the reach of the Democrats' motion. Secondly, it would create two classes of members—serving members who would be subject to the full provisions of the current requirements of the disqualification aspects of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act and former members who would be subject to a much narrower set of forfeiture provisions.
Thirdly, the motion makes no mention of the status of former parliamentarians' own contribution. Various High Court judgments in which the court held that forfeiture provisions contained within the Fisheries Act 1952 could apply to property without offending the `just terms' provisions of section 51 of the constitution indicate that the Commonwealth can validly make a law that provides for the forfeiture of a member's or former member's own contribution. Fourthly, parliamentarians would continue to be subject to two sets of potentially conflicting pieces of legislation in respect of the status of their employer funded superannuation. To what extent would the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act still operate? What would be the effect of the inconsistencies between the two acts?
In fairness to the Australian Democrats, they have genuine concern about fraud, corruption, bribery or other offences that have been committed. In that case, there obviously is a real issue as to whether a member or a senator should be entitled to receive his or her superannuation following their conviction. But there is also a very significant issue as to whether this rule should apply in the very broad manner as suggested by the urgency motion that is before the chair.
There is a whole plethora of minor offences against the Commonwealth which I think very few people would say should result in the 
 forfeiture of a member's or senator's superannuation entitlement. It might be failure to properly authorise an electoral advertisement. I would not want to lay a bet that there were not quite a lot of members and senators over the years who might have been involved in that sin of omission. It is pretty common in the political process in this country. Obviously, it is a criminal offence that attracts a fine of up to $1,000.
There are few prosecutions made under that provision of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, because the AEC and the Director of Public Prosecutions exercise their discretion not to prosecute in a range of cases. If you had a sweeping provision like this, not every MP or senator serving now could be entirely safe from potential prosecution and loss of benefit. It is even a criminal offence to fail to attend to vote. I am not suggesting anyone would be silly enough to do that. I acknowledge that we all have a bit of self-interest in this place in relation to voting, but that offence attracts a maximum penalty of $50. It is the same situation.
Even where the offence is a potentially serious one, and you have a situation where a member or a senator could lose their superannuation entitlement, you could argue that there is a case that no such deprivation of entitlement should automatically occur. Section 29 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 makes it an offence for a person to wilfully or unlawfully destroy Commonwealth property. That is punishable by a maximum term of 10 years imprisonment. You have circumstances where the commission of such an offence perhaps should warrant the forfeiture of a member's or senator's superannuation entitlements. But I am sure we can all envisage circumstances where that would not be the case. I bet Senator Brown can envisage such a circumstance. He nods his head.
I know during the election campaign we had what I would describe to the Senate as a comparatively passive protest, but there might be minor damage to Commonwealth property. You might have the aerial or some other part of a Commonwealth car damaged. Should a member or a senator lose their superannuation entitlement because of that? What about 
 during the Vietnam War if you burnt your draft card? Should you lose your superannuation entitlement because of that? These are the sorts of things that Senator Lees and the Democrats have not really thought through in this regard. It is serious enough for it to be thought through properly.
I do not want anyone to misunderstand what I am saying here, and I do not think anyone would. I am not condoning the destruction of Commonwealth property at all. I am not suggesting that that is appropriate behaviour but, in some minor circumstances, I do not think anyone could really argue that a member or a senator should lose their superannuation entitlement over that sort of offence. You have to get a sense of proportion into this debate. Section 44 of the constitution only deprives a member or a senator of office if the offence they have committed is subject to a penalty of a term of imprisonment of one year or more. As well intentioned as the motion before the Senate at the moment might be, it does not reflect that requirement.
In my view, this is an issue that really should not be addressed in this way. This is not a simplistic issue that can easily be dealt with in an urgency motion before the Senate in a debate that is really designed just to get a bit of publicity and a bit of media interest for the Australian Democrats. This sort of forum and this sort of debate being discussed by people like us do not allow a proper examination of what I think are complex and important issues.
What about the Democrats proposal that superannuation benefits not be accessed until a former member turns 55 years old. Are the Democrats aware of the complexity of the preservation age provisions in the current superannuation legislation? I wish I was fully aware of all those complexities. Are you aware that the legislation phases in an increase in the preservation age from 55 to 60 years? If you are, your motion does not reflect it at all. For those born before 1 July 1960, the preservation age does remain at 55 years. For those born between 1 July 1961 and 30 June 1962, it is 56 and so on and so forth up to the age of 60 for those born after 30 June 1964. If you are aware of it, why 
 doesn't your motion reflect some of these complexities?
According to this motion, the Democrats are proposing that the same preservation age provisions should apply to all parliamentarians, or are you proposing a permanent preservation age of 55 years? Would it be fair for the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, Senator MacGibbon, who, I understand, will be retiring soon, and Senator Watson, who has reached more mature years than some—I am not being personally critical here—to be able to collect their superannuation immediately upon retirement—or even Senator Lees herself? I have looked up her age. She was born in 1948. Therefore, she will be 56 at the end of this term. She will be able to collect her superannuation immediately upon retirement, and so will those other senators and members I mentioned, and many other names that you might care to add to that list.
But the Deputy Leader of the Democrats, Senator Stott Despoja, will have to wait 22 years after the end of her term in 2002 to collect her super. I do not know whether she has been consulted by Senator Lees who has not even moved her own motion relating to this proposal, but these are the sorts of issues that are important in this debate. There are issues of equity and ethics which we really do need to consider with regard to this matter. The further we push up the preservation age for politicians, the more we are encouraging them to pursue a second career outside politics. Is that what we want to encourage? Is that what you want to encourage? Do we want our elected representatives to be keeping an eye all the time they are—
—They can come in when they are older. That is the other thing.
—No. Do we want our parliamentarians when they are here to be keeping a weather eye on their post-political career opportunities while they are serving as parliamentarians? Isn't that compromising? Of course it can be compromising. You have to also recognise that it is not always easy for former members of parliament to find employment, no matter what their qualifications or whatever personal qualities they might have. The fact is that political partisanship is 
 not always a saleable commodity out there in the community for many employers. I know that some of our former colleagues have made it to the short list, but I know that a much smaller number have been able to land a job.
I believe that a turnover rate in parliament is a good thing. I actually happen to think it is desirable. I think new blood is welcome and necessary in this place. We should be very wary of making changes that encourage time serving. We should be very wary of that if we are being honest. Do the Democrats, or any of us for that matter, want to encourage people who simply sit around clocking up 23 years of miserable service in a place like this? Do we want to increase the temptation to venality in the Commonwealth parliament? Do we want to increase the temptation for the maximisation of entitlements in the Commonwealth parliament? Is that what we are on about? Do we want to increase the temptation for nepotism in the Commonwealth parliament? I do not think that is really the way we want to operate. Do we really want people to be in here time serving and spitting in the eye of their former colleagues and the like?
—That was a bit unnecessary. You were not bad until then.
—I am just saying that we do not want to encourage that sort of behaviour. We do not want to encourage people like Senator Colston and the like. You have to look at the logic of what the Democrats are asking of the Senate in this motion. They are basically saying that the current system is wrong. It is too generous but, if it is wrong now, it was wrong before. I have not noticed any former Democrats handing back their superannuation. I challenge you to tell me if any have. I do not believe any have. I challenge the Democrats to get up in the light of this urgency motion and indicate which ones will be putting their cheques voluntarily in the mail.
I really will be awaiting answers to those sorts of questions with interest. I think this is really nothing but a publicity stunt. But these are important issues, and I acknowledge that. They are important issues, but this is a simplistic, populist, low-grade publicity stunt at the end of the parliamentary year.
We in the opposition are interested in getting a proper analysis and a proper overview of this issue—and, certainly, a proper inquiry into it. We have indicated for a long time that we are keen to support an independent inquiry into the superannuation scheme to be carried out by the Remuneration Tribunal.
I do commend to the Senate the amendment to this urgency motion that I will move, which allows for an independent review of the parliamentary superannuation scheme and for a separate review to be conducted by an appropriate body with a view to applying disqualifications provisions, similar to section 44 of the constitution, to the superannuation benefits of former parliamentarians for offences committed during their period in office. I believe that this is a sensible way of proceeding, and I seek leave of the Senate to move this amendment so we can actually progress this issue in a proper way and can stop the grandstanding today.
Leave granted.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1998-12-09,"—From the government's point of view, this is a waste of time. It is an unnecessary debate, as Senator Faulkner said. Superannuation of members of parliament is not a new subject, as my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Faulkner have pointed out. It has indeed been the subject of considerable review by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which reported in September of last year. In that report, the coalition members of the select committee concluded that the issue of superannuation must be considered as part of parliamentary remuneration—in other words, total remuneration as determined by the 
 Remuneration Tribunal. That was the recommendation from coalition senators Ferguson and Watson. They have both done a lot of work in the superannuation area, and that was their recommendation in that report of last year.
The report has been passed on to the government, of course, and the government has already indicated that it will consider the committee's recommendations on that scheme after the legislation for the process of setting parliamentary remuneration has been passed. But what has happened there? What has happened with that process? Proposed changes to the method of setting the remuneration of members of parliament were included in the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill, which was rejected twice by the Democrats and the Labor Party, along with the new Public Service Act. So that proper process, which the government has put forward to change and to basically move along in the direction indicated by the Senate select committee, has indeed twice been rejected in this chamber by the Democrats and the Labor Party.
The government believes that once the new method of determining the remuneration of members of parliament—that is, members' and senators' remuneration—is resolved, then the government will give consideration to the arrangements for any further review, including the involvement of the Remuneration Tribunal. Legislation to implement the new process is scheduled to be introduced in the autumn session next year.
As the Prime Minister indicated in response to a question from Mr Andren in the other chamber just two weeks ago, the government does not have a closed mind in relation to a review of superannuation, be it parliamentary or otherwise. Having a common age for the commencement of benefits under the scheme is one of the changes that people have pressed from time to time upon the government. The government has given an undertaking to look at that option.
But why the urgency motion today? Undoubtedly, it is quite unnecessary. The motion by the Democrats shows an absolute knee-jerk reaction to recent events. They have put 
 forward, if you like, two propositions. But this issue of superannuation for members of parliament is a very complex one, as my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Faulkner, who spoke before me, have pointed out. It is an issue which needs due consideration. It cannot be addressed overnight in a knee-jerk way or by just looking at some particular aspects. It has got to be looked at as a whole and, as the Senate select committee recommended, it really must be looked at as part of total remuneration. The government has agreed to look at the total issue.
I have a personal view that looking at total remuneration—which is basically what happens in the private sector—is the way to go. If you look at total remuneration for members and senators, then, marrying with that, an accumulation superannuation scheme is the obvious way to go. Again, that is what has happened in the private sector. What has happened in the private sector over the last 10 to 15 years is just that change—the change from defined benefit schemes, which used to be very common 15 to 20 years ago, to accumulation schemes.
People are paid total remuneration, so, when they change jobs, they take their entitlements with them. The same thing basically should apply here. If that were done, if there were consideration of total remuneration in the accumulation schemes, then the problem of double jeopardy, of penalty, really does not arise. When people incurred the penalty of having to leave this place—Senator Faulkner went through the details of that before—they would not, if they had their superannuation paid into an accumulation scheme, get doubly penalised.
It also means that the incentives that are in the scheme right now between short term and long term would disappear. The current scheme is unfairly weighted towards long-term members and senators in the parliament. It is not very generous at all—in fact, it is quite ungenerous—to short-term members and senators. That is unfair and should be changed. The government has said it will look at this matter. If that were done so that we were looking at total remuneration, then the 
 problems which have arisen would not arise in the future.
I have a personal view on the matter of age 55. I agree that the remuneration from superannuation should not be available to members of parliament and senators before the age of 55. But, again, there are complications for a transition to that sort of scheme that have to be taken into account.
 This urgency motion brought forward by the Democrats really is unnecessary at this point in time. The government has given an undertaking it will follow through in looking at these extremely complex issues. It is very important they be looked at calmly and slowly so that the matter of superannuation is dealt with fairly for all concerned.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-09,"—I think that keeping this issue alive and flagging a response to public concern about it is a good thing. The worst thing that can happen is that it simply disappears off the agenda of this parliament when there is so much angst about it out there in the public arena. It is heightened in the wake of every election when the media is able to print stories of people going away with million dollar cheques.
—Nobody gets a million dollar cheque.
—The media prints stories of people going away with million dollar cheques—that is factual, Senator—so the whole place and the role of parliamentarians comes into disrepute.
 I am not concerned about our acting in a populist fashion on this matter. After all, that means responding to popular concern—the concern of the people themselves. Both the government and the opposition ought not be so dismissive about that concern by saying, `This is a populist move by the Democrats.' No doubt there is a flavour of that about it but, from my experience both in the Tasmanian state parliament and in the term I have had in this place, that is a means of trying to keep at bay anybody who would question the system, and in particular anybody who would question the unspoken agreement that there is between major parties to protect both the 
 salary system and the superannuation system of parliamentarians.
—Have you read the superannuation report?
—You will have your turn a little later, Senator. One of the consistent things about this debate is that we tend to hear parliamentarians measuring themselves against what happens in private enterprise on the boards of big business. I want to say that that is the wrong measure. We ought to be measuring ourselves against the salary or superannuation entitlements of average Australian citizens. We are members of parliament representing the average Australian person.
Those opposite might click their tongues about this, but that is how a democracy is supposed to work. You do not hear people getting to their feet in this place saying, `Let's measure ourselves against what a young pensioner or an unemployed person might be able to look forward to at the age of 55, at the other end of the spectrum.' You always hear them saying, `Look at the packages that they are getting in the boardrooms of big business.' In my view, the packages are obscene.
Let us take it to the far extreme. In the United States, there are now chief executive officers who, besides their superannuation packages, are taking home annually $200 million, $300 million or even $400 million. In Australia there are now dozens of chief executive officers taking home—they do not earn this; they are taking home—more than $1 million per annum. It is quite obscene (a) that that happens, and (b) that there could be any member of a representative parliament who says, `That is the measure against which we must place discussions on our own incomes or superannuation.' Of course it is not. The measure ought to be what the average citizen is getting. That would sober most of us into thinking how we as parliamentarians have an obligation to relate to the general community and to listen to what the general community has to say about the excessive payments that are being made through the superannuation scheme with the knowledge that the taxpayer is footing the bill. It does 
 not come out of the air, it does not come from some fund in the sky—it comes out of the pockets of taxpayers.
I do not think we ought to be living in penury. As all parliamentarians would know, you cannot effectively pursue your job without having the wherewithal to move from place to place to get good advice and without being able to contribute to the public debate through the experience of moving around the electorate and around the nation. But, that said, it is a wonderful privilege to be a representative of the people in this place. Parliamentarians go very close to—if not crossing—the line of usurping or abusing that privilege if they are seen to be dipping their hands deep into the public purse in a way which is not commensurate with the privileges that we have in discharging our duty.
 However, I am attracted to the idea that there ought to be an independent tribunal which would look at parliamentary superannuation and separately at the need to review whether parliamentarians who are disqualified because they have infringed on the laws ought to forgo their superannuation. Senator Faulkner referred obliquely to the fact that I stood in front of the Prime Minister's car during the election campaign.
Government senators interjecting—
—Senators opposite are saying that I should not qualify for superannuation because I happened to delay the Prime Minister on his way to breakfast. That is the way in which this could go if it were left in the hands of parliamentarians. A debate like that might end up with some sort of motion passed in this place that Independents, Democrats and Greens should get no salary or superannuation. But, being this close to Christmas, that is very unlikely. The generosity of spirit of government senators opposite would ensure that it did not happen. Therefore, I support the general tenor of the motion. I am also attracted to supporting the amendment, which would allow for the Remuneration Tribunal to conduct an independent review of the whole matter.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-12-09,"—I should put on the record that personally I hope Senator Brown never 
 collects superannuation, because I hope that he will not be here more than six years. He has to be here more than six years to collect it. This issue of parliamentarians' superannuation is one which I, as a member of the superannuation select committee, have looked into in detail. It was as a result of a reference from the then senator Cheryl Kernot that we looked into this matter. I notice that she has been very quiet on the issue of late.
This is a knee-jerk and populist motion. Senator Lees's motion, as moved by Senator Allison, really appears to result from a newspaper article by George Megalogenis, whom she quoted at length in her original contribution to this debate. The fact that it is a knee-jerk and populist motion means that it does not offer any long-term solutions to the issue of parliamentarians' superannuation. The government is continually looking at this and has this report, which it is acting on.
The Australian Democrats say that this government has done nothing about the issue of parliamentarians' superannuation. The 15 per cent surcharge, which was introduced by this government after 1996, will effectively reduce by 15 per cent the superannuation entitlements of parliamentarians who have come here recently. There is no mention by Senator Allison of action that has already been taken by the government.
Senator Allison mentioned a six per cent public contribution to MPs and a two per cent contribution for public servants, as though there were something wrong with that and as though you were comparing apples with apples. I ask Senator Allison to publicly state here today whether she will return two-thirds of her entitlements when she retires from this place because she feels that the government has been overgenerous with her retirement benefits? If she feels that way, we would be very happy for her to publicly commit today that she will return two-thirds of whatever she is entitled to on her retirement in this parliament because she feels that the public purse has contributed far too much to her retirement benefit.
A lot of people overlook the effect of the 15 per cent surcharge on MPs. I am quite aware of it because I received my surcharge 
 assessment the other day. We hear the media comments about how little we contribute for the benefits that we get. I do not know of any superannuation scheme for the public where someone is asked to contribute 20 per cent in after tax dollars on their gross income for their retirement. I have no other income except the income that I get from this place. In effect, I will have been asked to contribute over this past 12 months 20 per cent of after tax dollars to my superannuation. That is 20 per cent of my gross income. I ask Senator Allison whether she can find any scheme in private enterprise or in the Public Service where any member is asked to contribute that much towards their superannuation.
There are a number of other issues. The media will always talk about elements of the scheme which appear on the surface to be generous. But you must always take the superannuation entitlements as part of the total remuneration package. That is something Senator Allison failed to address in this motion when she talked to this group. If I were a young member of this parliament with a wife and young children, I would feel obliged to take out extra death and disability cover because the arrangements for the support of surviving children, if I and my young wife happened to be killed in a road or plane accident, are totally inadequate. Without extra personal death and disability cover, any surviving children would not be able to exist on the small amount left in the event of the death of both parents.
It is not the same if just the member were to survive. If you look closely at the scheme, you find that children would be disadvantaged to a great extent if both their parents were killed in an accident.
—That is not true of many.
—No. It is not. If you have a private scheme, you have a lump sum of death and disability cover which can be used. As someone who was formerly involved in the industry, I can tell you that I have spent a lot of my life protecting people and making sure that surviving children would be covered in an unfortunate event like that. This scheme does not do that.
These populist notions have been raised in the media. Let us face it that members of parliament are fair go for all these things. I repeat that one thing coalition senators recommended in this inquiry was that future members of parliament not receive any pension benefit until age 55. However, that needed to be taken in the context of the total remuneration package, not in isolation. While the remuneration package exists as it is, there are a number of current serving members of parliament who know that the whole package is not taken into consideration when you just pick out the under 55 age group that retires from parliament.
We will not be supporting the amendment of the ALP. We will not be supporting the urgency motion of Senator Allison because this is not an urgent matter. This is something that needs to be considered over a length of time and with the consultation of all parties.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-12-09,"—What an extraordinary debate. How amazing it is to see the immediate unity between the two major parties when it comes to the question of tampering with their entitlements. Obviously we have hit a very raw nerve. We will continue to do that. It has now been 15 months since the Australian Democrats first moved on an inquiry into parliamentary superannuation. We acknowledge that this is a complex issue; there is no doubt about that. However, 15 months is a long time in which to consider the complexities and in which to do something about the scheme's extraordinary generosity.
Let me turn quickly to Senator Watson. Senator Watson has a greater knowledge of this scheme than probably anybody else in this chamber. He does identify some of the problems with it. He says that it is very generous and high compared with community standards. He draws attention to those members who stay just long enough in order to qualify for it. He also draws attention to the fact that those who are here for a shorter time—whom he encourages, strangely enough—do not qualify.
I think that to talk about the fact that when this scheme was put together life expectancies 
 were shorter and terms in parliament were longer, and therefore things have changed, is an admission that we need to do something about it, and this is the reason we have this problem. We have different periods of time and different ages when members are retiring. That is one of the important reasons why we need to have proper reform.
Senator Faulkner's extraordinary attack on the Democrats, Senator Lees, me and everybody else he could think of and his calling this a publicity stunt is really amazing. He fails to address the substantive question, concentrating mostly on the question of the criminal provisions in the motion, and he fails to look at the question of the generosity of this scheme. He accuses the Democrats of putting forward a simplistic motion—
—But you agreed with my amendment earlier. You dope!
—We have already talked about the complexities. The report of the Senate committee does talk about the complexities. I urge Senator Faulkner to look at that report. (Time expired)
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner be agreed to.
—I acknowledge that the ALP has put forward an amendment to our motion and that it is a worthwhile amendment. I seek leave to incorporate that amendment into the motion.
—Senator Allison, we have the amendment before us. We will be putting the amendment to the first vote.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This report is an omnibus report which covers six references. It encompasses two joint committees, generating two references each, and two Senate references committees. The matters range from relatively minor unauthorised disclosures, in respect of which the Committee of Privileges has found that no contempt has been committed, through to generalised contempt findings and two major contempt findings against persons identified in the report.
Given this spate of references and widespread concerns expressed by a considerable number of senators and members in the course of the inquiries, the committee decided to make broad comment on the question of unauthorised disclosure of committee proceed 
 ings. Accordingly, the first chapter reiterates the principles governing unauthorised disclosure.
Having concluded that the existing prohibitions on unauthorised disclosure should remain, the committee has outlined the approach it expects other committees to take when examining the question as to whether matters of this nature should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. It has also set out its approach to dealing with matters when referred. The committee has made one minor recommendation relating to the handling of private documents.
What will be obvious from this unanimous report, and the committee's usual unanimous findings in respect of the matters referred, is the genuine concern about what the committee has called an epidemic of improper disclosures in recent times. The committee hopes that its declaration of intent about its treatment of possible contempts will be sufficient deterrent to persons who might consider improperly disclosing committee proceedings. It also intends to disseminate the report as widely as possible, in the hope that persons who have regular contact with parliament will become aware of their responsibilities in handling documents produced to and by the houses of parliament and their committees. Because of the nature of several findings, I seek leave to give a notice of motion.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-12-09,"—This evening I would like to speak about a matter that is of interest to my constituents in the Northern Territory and probably to many other Australians. That issue is the recent failed referendum relating to the proposal for statehood in the Northern Territory. This is an interesting and informative story that illustrates the attitude of the government in the Northern Territory. It was not that long ago that public opinion polls showed public support for Northern Territory statehood running at about 80 per cent. However, when the statehood referendum was held recently, nearly 53 per cent of Territorians voted against statehood. That is a remarkable and disturbing turnaround in public support over a relatively short time.
Today I want to put on the public record what happened with that push for statehood, identify where the push for statehood went wrong and look at who is to blame for this unexpected and unprecedented result. Since the Northern Territory was granted self-government in 1978, talk about statehood has never been far off the local political agenda. It has waxed and waned depending on how close the Territory was to either a federal or Territory election.
In 1985, a bipartisan committee of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was established to look at the issue of statehood for the Territory and how best to pursue it. Over the last decade or so, this committee, the Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development, has been active in consulting the wider community about what would be included in any new constitution if statehood were granted.
In 1986, a three-pronged process of constitution building was adopted by the Country Liberal Party, led by the then Chief Minister, Steve Hatton. This process included the development of a draft constitution by a bipartisan committee of the Legislative Assembly, the consideration of that document by a constitutional convention and ratification by the Legislative Assembly with its submission for 
 approval to a referendum. The committee presented its final report in November 1996.
It should be pointed out that the CLP member and former Chief Minister Steve Hatton, who has overseen the Territory's development towards statehood as head of the Sessional Committee on Constitutional Development, embraced the idea of an elected people's convention and an inclusive process. However, as we will see, these concepts were not in keeping with the desire of the current Chief Minister, Shane Stone, to push statehood through with what many people have described as almost indecent haste.
In April 1995, the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, agreed to the establishment of a joint Commonwealth-Northern  Territory working group to examine and report on the implications of statehood for the Northern Territory. It is fair to say that the push for statehood received further impetus when the federal parliament decided to overrule the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation. This reminded many Territorians that they did not enjoy the same level of rights as the states.
A constitutional convention was held in Darwin in late March this year to consider the final draft constitution which would give shape to any new state created by the granting of statehood. The convention got off to a controversial start. None of the 54 delegates for the constitutional convention were directly or popularly elected. Instead, the Northern Territory government hand-picked them. It is true to say that particular people representing particular community groups were elected, but those community groups were chosen by the Northern Territory government.
Aboriginal Territorians were also unhappy with the constitutional convention. The Northern and Central Land Councils boycotted the convention, angry at the lack of representation offered to them at the convention by the CLP government. They argued—quite correctly, I think—that as they represented over 65,000 people they deserved more than one place between two councils.
The CLP government managed to push through their preferred constitution, overlooking many of the recommendations arising from the Sessional Committee on Constitu 
 tional Development's lengthy process of community consultation. Another outcome was that the convention recommended three referendum questions. These questions were: whether people supported statehood, what the new name of the state should be and whether people supported the draft constitution. However, on 18 August this year, the Chief Minister, Shane Stone, rejected that proposal for three referendum questions, announcing that it had been decided that only one question should be submitted to voters in the referendum. That question, which was subsequently put to voters on 3 October, was:
Now that a constitution for a State of the Northern Territory has been recommended by the Statehood Convention and endorsed by the Northern Territory Parliament:- Do you agree that we should become a state? Yes/No.
In what was considered to be a shock result, nearly 53 per cent of Territorians voted against the statehood proposal. But statehood should have been assured. It had bipartisan support from both the CLP and the ALP in the Northern Territory. However, the ALP support was qualified. The Territory ALP was unhappy with the way the CLP had tried to hijack the statehood process for their own political objectives. Anyone who questioned any aspect of the statehood process was dismissed by the arrogant CLP as being anti-Territorian. The oldest trick in the book up in the Territory is that, if anyone questions the way you are doing something, you label them as being anti-Territorian—something akin to being accused of heresy.
In response to public concerns about the proposed draft constitution in the lead-up to the statehood referendum, Chief Minister Shane Stone, at his dismissive best, said that if people did not like the draft constitution then they should simply vote against statehood—the implication being that they would be committing a treasonable act. However, many people on both sides of the political fence took the Chief Minister at his word, announcing that they would be voting against statehood, not because they were opposed to statehood but because they were not happy about the contents of the draft constitution or because they were not sure what was contained in the constitution and what it meant.
Territorians were given the opportunity to closely examine the draft constitution only a few weeks before the referendum. Then, in what was a massive turnaround, the Chief Minister changed tack and said that if people did not like the draft constitution they should not vote against statehood. He said there would be plenty of opportunities for further consultation about the content of the constitution after the referendum on statehood. The referendum was no longer about the constitution; it was solely about statehood.
He did not really give people much choice. He said, `Trust me. Vote for statehood and I will take into account your concerns about the constitution after the referendum'—after Territorians had voted on statehood. He was hoping, I suspect, that Territorians would give their imprimatur to statehood while not supporting the draft constitution. However, as we have seen, the majority of Territorians—prompted, I think, by the experiences of many Territorians on both sides of the political fence—realised that trusting the Chief Minister was a precarious exercise and subsequently voted against statehood.
In short, a referendum on statehood, which should have breezed through, which should have collected up a celebration of people in the Northern Territory and which should have been a step in the history of the Northern Territory, was defeated—not because the overwhelming majority of Territorians were opposed to statehood but because they did not trust the process. They did not trust what they were being asked to do. And who can blame them? It should be pointed out that there was no constitutional necessity for a referendum on statehood and, under section 121 of the Australian Constitution, the federal parliament has the power to establish a new state.
In another classic display of bad faith, the Territory parliament refused to fund both the `yes' and `no' cases for the referendum. While it is perhaps true that they were not obliged to fund both sides, it showed a lack of goodwill in funding only the `yes' case. The amount spent on the `yes' case was substantial: $600,000 was spent on advertising and another $160,000 was spent by the Territory electoral commission on distributing 
 the official `yes' case. It was left to a coalition of concerned groups, under the auspices of Territorians for Democratic Statehood, to draw the attention of Territorians to the failings and inadequacies of the argument in favour of statehood. They did this with minimal resources. I think they spent around $7,000 and presented their arguments very well.
What lessons have we learned from the statehood debacle? I do not believe that the referendum result reflected people's actual feelings on statehood. People were clearly unhappy with the way the statehood process was undertaken, and they were not happy with the man attempting to crash statehood through.
Last week in Batchelor, over 120 indigenous delegates from the Territory were meeting to discuss what they wanted to include in any constitution to accompany statehood, and the conclusions from the Batchelor College conference are on the public record. I was disturbed to hear that the Chief Minister was invited to attend that constitutional convention and clearly did not bother to do so.
In concluding, the statehood process must be inclusive in the Territory. Territorians want an opportunity to have a constitutional convention with democratically elected representatives. They want a constitution which ensures accountable government in the Territory and they want a constitution which accurately reflects their inspirations and protects their interests. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Likewise, Aboriginal Territorians want a constitution which protects their cultural, political, religious and social rights.
When these things are addressed I am confident that Territorians will be overwhelmingly supportive of statehood and I would hope that the Australian parliament would then support the Northern Territory becoming the seventh state of Australia.
