Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (09:32):  by leave—Over recent years successive defence ministers have reported to the parliament on Australia's commitment in Afghanistan. It is proper that the parliament and the Australian people are informed about major military operations where our men and women are in harm's way. Today I will provide an update on the completion of the Australian mission in Uruzgan province and progress in the transition of security responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces in Afghanistan. I also intend to address Australia's strong ongoing commitment to Afghanistan throughout 2014.




Conclusion of operations in Uruzgan 
p
rovince



The Australian operations in Uruzgan province are drawing to a close. On Tuesday, 3 December 2013, the Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Regional Command South, Major General Paul LaCamera, announced that the Afghan National Security Forces have assumed responsibility for security in Uruzgan province. Over the coming weeks the Australian Defence Force will complete its mission in Uruzgan and the majority of our people will return to Australia.


On 28 October, I was privileged to travel to Afghanistan with our Prime Minister to be present at the recognition ceremony at Multinational Base—Tarin Kot in Uruzgan province. The ceremony was also attended by the Leader of the Opposition in a show of bipartisan support for the achievements of our men and women in Afghanistan. As is only right, both sides of parliament have been consistent in Australia's support to the mission in Afghanistan, and our long-term commitment to the people of Afghanistan.


The ceremony formally acknowledged the contribution and sacrifice of Australia and our coalition partners to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and particularly in Uruzgan province. What we have achieved in Uruzgan would not have been possible without the support of our international partners, including our traditional partner the United States and our NATO partners, particularly the Netherlands and Slovakia. We have also been assisted by our regional partner Singapore, which provided valuable support to the mission in Uruzgan.


Key to the success in that province, and Afghanistan more broadly, has been the role and support provided, of course, by the mighty United States. Australia and the United States forces have worked side by side and we have embedded ADF personnel in ISAF and United States based headquarters for some long time.


In addition to recognising the efforts of ISAF members, the ceremony in Tarin Kot was an opportunity to recognise the achievements of the Afghan National Security Forces since we have been in that province. Over the past 16 months, Afghan National Security Forces have taken the security lead in the province. During this period, insurgent efforts to undermine security in Uruzgan have been countered by well-led and increasingly proficient Afghan National Security Forces. Their continuing success is a direct result of the training and mentoring provided by the Australian Defence Force, and other coalition partners, which have helped the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade develop as a capable force.


Supporting this have been successive detachments of the Australian Special Operations Task Group, which have partnered with elements of the Afghan National Security Forces, to deny the influence of the insurgency and to protect the population, thus giving the Afghan government breathing space to progress its own development.


As the Prime Minister said during his address at the recognition ceremony in Tarin Kot: we have done very good work in Uruzgan. This work has been a whole-of-government effort carried out by the ADF and the Australian Federal Police as well as civilians from Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs who have come together on this difficult task. And they have attended to their work with an extraordinary degree of professionalism and dedication. We can look back on the last few years with some considerable and great pride.




A change in commitment, not an end



Whilst we are on track to draw down our forces from Uruzgan province by the end of this year, this does not mark the end of our commitment to Afghanistan. In 2014, around 400 ADF personnel will continue to be engaged in Afghanistan through training and advising the Afghan National Security Forces in Kabul and in Kandahar. Through to the end of 2014, Australia will provide instructors, advisers and support staff to the UK-led Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul, which will include a force protection platoon.


We will have advisor and support staff working with the Australian-led Afghan National Army 205 Corps Coalition Advisory Team in Kandahar. This commitment will continue to provide valuable advice within the Afghan National Army 205 Corps senior leadership.


We will also continue to support logistics training with the logistics training and advisory team in Kabul and we have committed a small number of Special Forces and other Army personnel to training and advising the General Directorate of Police Special Units up in Kabul.


In addition, the Royal Australian Air Force Heron remotely piloted aircraft deployment will be extended to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to enhance security in Regional Command—South during the lead-up to, and conduct of, the coming elections in Afghanistan.


Throughout 2014 Australia will also maintain its cadre of embedded personnel at ISAF Headquarters, ISAF Joint Command and Regional Command—South, a commitment that is valuable to, and praised by, the United States and our other coalition partners.


Our personnel in these roles will continue the important process of building the capability of the Afghan National Security Forces to take full security responsibility for their own country. In doing so, they will also continue to face personal danger and risks from the ongoing Taliban insurgency which will continue to seek to undermine Afghan security. The government is committed to continuing to provide our personnel with the protection and equipment they will need to do their jobs.




Australia will remain committed to Afghanistan post-2014



We should be very proud about what we and our ISAF partners have achieved in Afghanistan. In 2000, there were 1.2 million students enrolled in schools across Afghanistan; there are now over 10 million students enrolled in schools throughout Afghanistan. Nearly 40 per cent of school-age girls—that is roughly three million—are enrolled in school. Female voting participation rate is currently at 40 per cent. Over the last 10 years, Afghanistan has improved most out of all countries on the United Nations development index. So it is important to note that Afghanistan has come a very long way over the last decade.


Looking beyond 2014, the international community will remain committed to Afghanistan. At the Chicago NATO/ISAF summit in May 2012, the international community renewed a firm commitment to a sovereign, secure and democratic Afghanistan. Leaders acknowledged that beyond the end of the transition period, NATO and Afghanistan will work to establish a new NATO-led mission to train, advise, and assist the Afghan national defence and security forces.


Australia will also remain committed to Afghanistan beyond the end of 2014, when the current ISAF mission in Afghanistan comes to an end. In 2014, we will turn our attention to national-level support and we will remain committed to supporting security in Afghanistan. Australia has pledged to contribute to the post-2014 NATO-led 'train, advise, assist' mission, including at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul.


Beyond this coming year, a Status of Forces Agreement is required to provide the legal basis for the deployment of the NATO-led mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan National Security Forces.


NATO and partners have commenced planning for a Status of Forces Agreement with Afghanistan in order to provide the legal framework for the post-2014 mission. NATO has the lead for negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement with the Afghan government for its post-2014 NATO-led mission and any foreign forces operating in Afghanistan post next year would need to do so under appropriate legal arrangements. Obviously, indemnities and other things for our personnel are very important.


To consolidate and build on the security gains, the Afghan National Security Forces will need and require ongoing training support. Australia will stand with them to provide that.




Australian Battle Casualties



The efforts and sacrifice of our men and women in Afghanistan, whether it is the various elements of the ADF, the Australian Federal Police or civilians, will not be forgotten. As most of our troops return home, we will continue to work with them and care for them. And we will continue to work with their families.


We will make sure that their needs are met and that they are given every opportunity to address any potential mental health issues which may have arisen as a consequence of the environment in which they have been operating and in which they have been fighting.


We continue to work closely with Veterans' Affairs on this front and acknowledge the substantial progress which we have made over recent years to improve services and assistance for ADF members, including their families.


So I want to again echo the words of our Prime Minister during his address to our troops in Afghanistan: we have done good work. It has been a very difficult commitment. But still, to be able to help our allies, defend our national interests and uphold our values is just about the best thing that any Australian can do, particularly any Australian soldier.


The truth of the matter is that the Australian Defence Force's sacrifices and those of the Afghans, the United States and other ISAF partners have bought time for the Afghan security forces to build and field a force able to take full security responsibility for their own country. It is now up to the Afghans to take the lead, with the international community supporting them. The efforts of over 26,500 men and women of the ADF who have served in Afghanistan since 2002 have made this possible.


Our people have paid a high price for our achievements in that country—261 Australians have been wounded during our mission. We have lost 40 of our best. We mourn them. Their families and friends mourn them. We continue to work with their families to support them on their road to recovery. We are better positioned than we have ever been to assist them.


Together with Veterans' Affairs, we have built resilience programs and services to continue to assist families of our wounded and we continue to work with the families of our fallen soldiers to provide assistance to them where we can. I was with the families of our 40 fallen in Perth airport as they flew out to attend the closing ceremony at Tarin Kot. I thank CDF General Hurley for providing that opportunity to the families of our 40 fallen. It was a ceremony that was appreciated, solemn and well received by those family members.


We continue to honour our fallen soldiers and acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice they made for their country. We will never forget them. An inscription I saw during my recent visit to Tarin Kot summarised their sacrifice in a few words: All gave some, some gave all. I thank you and I seek leave to incorporate the complete statement in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The incorporated statement read as follows—





Introduction



Over recent years successive Defence Ministers have reported to the parliament on Australia's commitment in Afghanistan. 


It is proper that the parliament and the Australian people are informed about major military operations where our men and women are in harm's way.


So today I will provide an update on the completion of the Australian mission in Uruzgan and progress in the transition of security responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces in Afghanistan.


I also intend to address Australia's strong ongoing commitment to Afghanistan throughout 2014 and beyond.




Conclusion of operations in Uruzgan Province



Australian operations in Uruzgan province are drawing to a close.


On Tuesday 3 December 2013, the Commander of ISAF's Regional Command South, Major General Paul LaCamera announced the Afghan National Security Forces have assumed responsibility for security in Uruzgan province.


Over the coming weeks the Australian Defence Force will complete its mission in Uruzgan and the majority of our people will return to Australia


On 28 October, I was privileged to travel to Afghanistan with the Prime Minister to be present at the Recognition Ceremony at the Multi National Base - Tarin Kot in Uruzgan province.


The ceremony was also attended by the Leader of the Opposition in a show of bipartisan support for the achievements of our men and women in Afghanistan.


As is only right, both sides of parliament have been consistent in Australia's support to the mission in Afghanistan, and our long-term commitment to Afghanistan.


The ceremony formally acknowledged the contribution and sacrifice of Australia and our coalition partners to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan in Uruzgan province.


What we have achieved in Uruzgan would not have been possible without the support of our international partners, including our traditional partner the United States and our NATO partners the Netherlands and Slovakia.


We have also been assisted by our regional partner Singapore who provided valuable support to the mission.


Key to the success in Uruzgan, and Afghanistan more broadly, has been the role and support provided by the United States.


Australian and United States Forces have worked side by side and we have embedded ADF personnel in ISAF and United States-based Headquarters.


During my recent visit to Brussels at the NATO/ISAF Defence Ministers, I met with my United States counterpart, Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel and Commander ISAF, General Joe Dunford.


During these meetings I acknowledged our shared commitments in Afghanistan and highlighted our close practical ties.


I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the professionalism and dedication shown by United States military leaders in Afghanistan.


In addition to recognising the efforts of ISAF members, the ceremony in Tarin Kot was an opportunity to recognise the achievements of the Afghan National Security Forces since we have been in Uruzgan.


Over the past 16 months, the Afghan National Security Forces has taken the security lead in the province.


During this period, insurgent efforts to undermine security in Uruzgan have been countered by well-led and increasingly proficient Afghan National Security Forces.


Their continuing success is a direct result of the training and mentoring provided by the ADF, and other coalition partners, which has helped the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade develop as a capable force.


Throughout the 2013 fighting season, the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade has consistently demonstrated its determination to protect the Afghan population.


 With support from the Afghan National Police and the National Directorate of Security, the 4th Brigade has taken the fight to the insurgents through a successful series of well-planned and well-coordinated operations.


These operations have reduced the presence and influence of the insurgents in the most contested areas of the province.


 The Afghan National Army's 4th Brigade is operating and sustaining independent operations and proving to be effective against the insurgency.


These operations, which are widespread and ongoing, have provided an increased level of freedom and security for the Afghan population in the province, and have given the Afghan government the ability to expand its presence at the local level, enhancing public confidence both in the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government.


It is important to acknowledge that this success in Uruzgan and elsewhere in Afghanistan has been achieved through significant sacrifices by the Afghan National Security Forces.


They remain staunch and committed.


The ANSF's leadership is exemplified by the Afghan Minister for Defence Mohammadi Khan, who I had the opportunity to meet recently in Brussels and Kabul.


But let me be clear: the Afghan National Security Forces in Uruzgan, and across Afghanistan more broadly, will continue to face many challenges going forward.


To remain effective over the coming years, Afghan forces will require significant financial and institutional support and training from the international community.


They will need to build their capabilities in areas where ISAF currently provides support, including maintenance technicians and spare parts, and a logistics system to resupply units in the field.


Despite challenges, Afghan forces remain on-track to transition to full sovereign responsibility for security across the country by the end of 2014.


Uruzgan province, where the majority of our troops have been deployed during our mission in Afghanistan, was, and still is, one of the poorest provinces in Afghanistan.


But the Australian contribution in Uruzgan has helped to build hospitals, medical centres, schools, roads and bridges.


Hundreds of small infrastructure projects have been completed, including wells and reservoirs.


The Trade Training school in Uruzgan has also been a major success and has taught a large number of Afghans plumbing, carpentry, concreting and bricklaying skills.


We have seen the number of health facilities increase from nine in 2006 to 29 in 2013.


There are five times the number of students in school in Uruzgan than there were in 2006; 15 percent of these are girls.


And supporting this has been successive detachments of the Australian Special Operations Task Group, which have partnered with elements of the Afghan National Security Forces to deny the influence of the insurgency and protect the population, giving the Afghan government breathing space to progress development.


As the Prime Minister said during his address at the Recognition Ceremony in Tarin Kot: we have done very good work in Uruzgan.


This work has been a whole of government effort carried out by the ADF, the Australian Federal Police as well as civilians from Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs who have come together on this difficult task.


And they have attended to their work with an extraordinary degree of professionalism and dedication.


We can look back on the last few years with pride.


As our mission in Uruzgan province draws to an end, the redeployment and remediation of our equipment and the redeployment of Defence personnel in Tarin Kot continues apace.


ADF elements, including the Force Extraction Unit, the Force Support Unit, the Force Communication Unit and the Australian Air Component, which includes the Combat Support Unit are charged with carrying out this complex task.


These ADF elements have an enormous task:


2700 pieces of infrastructure and 3000 pieces of fixed plant and equipment must be dealt with;


1364 20ft containers have to be removed from site; 


5000 pieces of specialist, force protection, and general communications information systems equipment need to be repatriated or disposed of; and


more than 100 commercial contracts and international agreements need to be closed or resolved.


For all that, I am pleased to report that the drawdown of vehicles and materiel, and remediation of infrastructure at the Multi National Base in Tarin Kot remains on schedule for closure of the base at the end of this year.


In December 2012 there was approximately 336 tonnes of stores and equipment at the base in Tarin Kot. 


There is now less than 26 tonnes remaining.


Site remediation works, including deconstruction, environmental remediation and hand-back or gifting of infrastructure to the Afghan National Security Forces at the base is almost complete.


And as we prepare to leave Uruzgan, we will not forget to assist those locally engaged Afghan employees who have supported us during our mission Afghanistan.


These include the Afghan interpreters and support workers who have provided an invaluable contribution to our mission by breaking down language and cultural barriers.


We acknowledge that as we leave Afghanistan, locally engaged Afghan employees who have supported Australian government agencies in Afghanistan may come under risk of harm as a consequence of their work with Australian personnel.


We are proud, therefore, to offer those employees, including their immediate family, at the greatest risk of harm the opportunity to resettle to Australia.


While this policy is being implemented, I will not comment on details to protect the safety of those locally engaged Afghan employees who are currently working with us.


But as my predecessor said, it is likely that the total number of locally engaged employees who will be resettled to Australia will be in the hundreds.




A change in commitment, not an end



While we are on track to draw down our forces from Uruzgan province by the end of this year, this does not mark an end to our commitment to Afghanistan.


In 2014, around 400 ADF personnel will continue to be engaged in Afghanistan through training and advising the Afghan National Security Forces in Kabul and Kandahar.


Through to the end of 2014, Australia will provide instructors, advisors and support staff to the UK-led Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul, which will include a force protection platoon.


We will have advisor and support staff working with the Australian-led Afghan National Army 205 Corps Coalition Advisory Team in Kandahar. 


This commitment will continue to provide valuable advice within the Afghan National Army 205 Corps senior leadership.


We will also continue to support logistics training with the Logistics Training and Advisory Team in Kabul and we have committed a small number of Special Forces and other Army personnel to training and advising the General Directorate of Police Special Units.


In addition, the Royal Australian Air Force Heron Remotely Piloted Aircraft deployment will be extended to provide Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance support to enhance security in Regional Command—South during the lead-up to, and conduct of, the elections.


Throughout 2014 Australia will also maintain its cadre of embedded personnel at ISAF Headquarters, ISAF Joint Command and Regional Command—South, a commitment that is valuable to, and praised by, the United States and other coalition partners.


Our personnel in these roles will continue the important process of building the capability of the Afghan National Security Forces to take full security responsibility for their country.


In doing so, they will also continue to face personal danger and risks from the ongoing Taliban insurgency which will continue to seek to undermine Afghanistan's security.


The government is committed to continuing to provide our personnel with the protection and equipment they will need to do their jobs.




Detainee management



With our redeployment from Uruzgan and the change to a training and advisory mission, ADF detention operations are now also drawing to a close.


However, the ADF takes its responsibilities to treat detainees humanely very seriously, and we will continue to ensure we meet our responsibilities, consistent with Australia's international legal obligations and domestic undertakings.




Detainee Management Framework in light of redeployment from Uruzgan



In line with the wider transition of security responsibility in Uruzgan, it is appropriate that we support the Afghan National Security Forces to assume responsibility for detention operations.


ADF personnel will continue to work with the Afghan National Security Forces to develop their capacity to manage Afghan detainees appropriately.


In line with remediation timelines at Multi-National Base—Tarin Kot, Australia's detention facilities have been deconstructed.


The Initial Screening Area operated since 1 August 2010 and provided a safe and humane environment to screen detainees apprehended by the ADF.




International engagement



Our involvement in the mission in Afghanistan has been a shared experience amongst our key allies and other NATO partners.




Australia
—
United States alliance benefits



Through our respective contributions to the ISAF mission, and our work together in Uruzgan province, Australia has forged closer ties with our ally, the United States.


At the Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations in Washington DC last month, I had the opportunity to discuss progress in Afghanistan with United States Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel.


Secretary Hagel and I agreed that Australia and the United States will emerge from our shared commitment in Afghanistan with closer practical ties than ever before.


The ADF has worked side by side with United States forces in Afghanistan, leading to improvements in interoperability, people to people links and intelligence sharing.


These improvements are testament to the benefits of our unique Alliance and have enhanced the capability of the ADF.


Australia and the United States will continue to work together to build on the links forged in Afghanistan as we prepare for the post-2014 mission, enhancing and strengthening our enduring partnership as we work to bring security and stability to Afghanistan.




NATO relationship



Through our experience working together in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan, shared values and common objectives to promote peace and stability through cooperation, Australia and NATO have forged a strong and enduring relationship.


Australia remains committed to Afghanistan's long term security and stability and our contribution to the NATO-led post-2014 train, advise and assist mission will help build on the gains achieved over the last decade.


We are also committed to practical cooperation with NATO beyond transition in Afghanistan.


Australia is a nation with global interests, so it is natural that we should maintain links with the NATO Alliance.


The signing of an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program with NATO earlier this year and a Joint Political Declaration in 2012 underlines the commitment Australia has made to maintaining and building the partnership we have with NATO.


Through senior visits and strategic dialogue, continued collaboration in courses and seminars, participation in NATO exercises and through bilateral exchanges and embedded personnel, Australia will maintain these vital links with NATO.


But it will also be important for Australia to remain agile and equipped to operate with NATO when our interests align.


As a partner country to NATO, Australia brings a number of benefits to the Alliance. Far from home, we have proven to be a steadfast, capable and well regarded military partner.


As we witness a strategic shift to the Indo-Pacific region, particularly the shift of economic weight, Australia is well placed to understand and share insights into the strategic dynamics of our own rapidly developing region.




Australia will remain committed to Afghanistan post-2014



We should be proud about what we and our ISAF partners have achieved in Afghanistan.


In 2000, there were 1.2 million students enrolled in school across Afghanistan; there are now over 10 million.


Nearly 40 per cent of school-age girls – that is roughly three million – are enrolled in school.


Female voting participation rate is at 40 per cent.


Over the last ten years, Afghanistan has improved most out of all countries on the United Nations Development Index.


So it is important to note that Afghanistan has come a long way over the last decade. 


Looking beyond 2014, the international community will remain committed to Afghanistan.


At the Chicago NATO / ISAF Summit in May 2012, the international community renewed a firm commitment to a sovereign, secure and democratic Afghanistan.


Leaders acknowledged that beyond the end of the transition period, NATO and Afghanistan will work to establish a new NATO-led Mission to train, advise, and assist the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.


Australia will also remain committed to Afghanistan beyond end 2014, when the current ISAF missions in Afghanistan comes to an end.


In 2014, we will turn our attention to national-level support and will remain committed to supporting security in Afghanistan.


Australia has pledged to contribute to the post-2014 NATO-led 'train, advise, assist' mission, including at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy in Kabul.


Beyond 2014, a Status of Forces Agreement is required to provide the legal basis for the deployment of the NATO-led mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. 


NATO and partners, have commenced planning for a Status of Forces Agreement with Afghanistan in order to provide the legal framework for the post-2014 mission.


NATO has the lead for negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement with the Afghan Government for its post-2014 NATO-led mission and any foreign forces operating in Afghanistan post-2014 would need to do so under appropriate legal arrangements.


As I said earlier, to consolidate and build on the security gains, the Afghan National Security Forces will need ongoing training support.


Australia has a vital national interest in supporting Afghanistan's stability and security after transition.




Australian Battle Casualties



The efforts and sacrifice of our men and women in Afghanistan, whether it is the various elements of the ADF, the Australian Federal Police or civilians, will not be forgotten.


As most of our troops return home, we will continue to work with them and care for them.


And we will continue to work with their families.


We will make sure that their needs are met and that they are given every opportunity to address any potential mental health issues which may have arisen as a consequence of the environment in which they have been operating in.


We continue to work closely with Veterans' Affairs on this front and acknowledge the substantial progress which we have made over recent years to improve services and assistance for ADF members, including their families.


So I want to again echo the words of the Prime Minister during his address to our troops in Afghanistan, we have done good work.


It has been a very difficult commitment.


But still, to be able to help our allies, defend our national interests and uphold our values is just about the best thing that any Australian can do.

It is now up to the Afghans to take the lead, with the international community supporting them.


The efforts of over 26,500 men and women of the ADF who have served in Afghanistan since 2002 have made this possible.


Our people have paid a high price for our achievements in Afghanistan.


261 Australians have been wounded during our mission.


We have lost 40 of our best.


We mourn them. Their families and friends mourn them.


We continue to work with their families to support them on their road to recovery.


We are better positioned than we have ever been to assist them.


Together with Veterans' Affairs we have built resilience programs and services to continue assisting the families of our wounded and we continue to work with the families of our fallen soldiers to provide assistance to them where we can.


We honour our fallen soldiers and acknowledge the ultimate sacrifice which they made for their country.


We will never forget them.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (09:43):  I seek leave to make a short statement in response to the Minister for Defence's ministerial statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator FAULKNER:
  In the absence of the shadow minister for defence, who is attending a select committee as the Senate sits, I want to say on behalf of the opposition that, first of all, the continued practice of reporting on events in Afghanistan is appreciated. It is appropriate that the minister is doing so and doing so frankly. He is right to stress with the parliament that the welfare of our service men and women is uppermost in our minds, as the ISAF mission in Afghanistan evolves and changes in a very fundamental way.


He is right to identify that many challenges will remain for those returning from Afghanistan and, of course, for those families who have suffered the loss of a loved one. Forty Australian soldiers have made the supreme sacrifice in Afghanistan. Those sacrifices must never be forgotten. It remains and will remain a great responsibility of this parliament to ensure the welfare of those returning from Afghanistan, particularly the 261 Australians who have been wounded in the service of our nation. I suspect that in the future many others will bear the marks of their service in Afghanistan. We must always keep uppermost in our minds that we have a responsibility to those returning servicemen and -women and their families. I know that that sentiment is shared on both sides of the parliament. It is a responsibility that we must meet into the future.


Given that Senator Conroy is now able to speak on behalf of the opposition, I merely thank the Senate for the opportunity to make these brief remarks. I thank the Minister for Defence, as he at times thanked me when I held that office, for providing the Senate and the Australian parliament with an ongoing update of Australia's service in Afghanistan.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:47):  by leave—I firstly thank the chamber for granting leave for me to speak and I thank Senator Faulkner for filling in. I was chairing a committee upstairs. I start by thanking, as Senator Faulkner has done, Minister Johnston for providing the Senate with this update, his first update as a minister. I appreciate his commitment to keeping the Senate and the Australian public informed on the war in Afghanistan.


Minister Johnston is the seventh defence minister who has overseen our involvement in the war in Afghanistan. The role of Minister for Defence is one of the most solemn responsibilities which any member of our parliament can hold, and never more so than when Australian servicemen and -women are fighting in a war. The minister has inherited a strong legacy of bipartisan support for our deployment in Afghanistan, something which continues today.


Twenty-six thousand, five hundred Australian Defence Force personnel have conducted and supported operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. They have been wonderful ambassadors for our country and they have made a real and lasting difference to the lives of millions of people across the region. I would like to acknowledge the 40 Australian soldiers who have lost their lives in Afghanistan. Each and every one of them will be remembered by their nation, as they are by their family and friends. I acknowledge their service and their sacrifice. The professionalism and skill of our servicemen and -women across the services does us all proud.


I also want to thank our Defence families. They should never be overlooked when it comes to the ADF's achievements. The sacrifices they make are immense and I acknowledge them today. I was heartened to hear the minister express the government's commitment to looking after our returned troops and their families, including the 261 personnel injured in Afghanistan. As the minister acknowledged, we have made substantial progress in recent years but this important work is never finished. We must continually strive to improve the way we look after ADF members and their families. I am sure the minister knows that he enjoys universal support for this endeavour. 


For more than a decade, the ADF and our ISAF partners have been involved in the fight to remove the Taliban government, degrade the military capability of the Taliban and create a stable and secure environment to allow the Afghan government to establish itself. In recent years, the ADF has worked closely with the Afghan National Army to improve their capability so that they can take on the responsibility for protecting their people and their government. In both of these missions, we have been remarkably successful. The Afghans can now field effective combat forces and, while there will no doubt be setbacks in the future, I am confident that our troops have given the Afghans every chance to build a stable and prosperous country. 


While there is still much work to do, Afghanistan has improved significantly in recent years. Australian personnel have built or reconstructed schools, hospitals, medical centres and more than 200 kilometres of roads near Oruzgan province. This is part of a reconstruction effort across Afghanistan, which has transformed the country. As the minister mentioned, school enrolments have gone from 1.2 million to 10 million, including 40 per cent of school-aged girls. Life expectancy has gone from 37 in 2000 to 56 now. And much of the important infrastructure is improving, from airports and bridges to internet and mobile phone coverage. So, as announced by the Labor government in March, the time is right for us to transition into a new phase of our mission in Afghanistan. This decision is in line with an agreement in Lisbon in 2010 between ISAF countries and the Afghan government to adopt a conditioned based approach to transition. 


But our important work in Afghanistan is not complete. As agreed in Chicago in May 2012, Australia and other ISAF countries will continue to support the Afghan National Army with training and support after the transition period. To support this agreement, Australia will continue to base 400 ADF personnel in Afghanistan after the transition. Seventy of those troops will be based at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, where they will continue to pass on their professionalism, skill and anti-insurgency knowledge to our Afghan counterparts. This is an important contribution that we can make now and into the future. 


Strong and competent leadership of the ANA will ensure that they remain a vital link in the global effort to stamp out militant extremism around the world. It is also important that Australia and our allies continue to support the Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process. This process will be long and complex, but it will be a core component of a lasting peace in Afghanistan. 


As the ADF transitions out of Afghanistan, it gives us an opportunity to look to the future. I recently read comments made by General Hurley in his address to the 125th anniversary of the Royal United Services Institute of New South Wales held here, in Parliament House. He stressed the importance of training 'hard' and training 'excellently' when our personnel are not deployed. He noted that, despite not being deployed between 1975 and 1990, we had a defence force that could perform with the best of them when they were called upon to serve in Somalia and Rwanda in the nineties. It is now time for Defence to reset itself and remain vigilant for future challenges. We must always be ready for what is next. I have every faith that the Australian Defence Force has the people, the equipment, the know-how and the spirit to make that happen. 


Before I conclude, it is important to reflect on what our deployment in Afghanistan has meant for our alliance with the United States. I believe that our joint deployment in Afghanistan reflects our ongoing commitment to work closely with the United States, to further the interests of democracy, freedom and human rights around the globe. We must ensure that our shared values continue to shape our great friendship—a friendship which has underpinned the stability of our region for decades. The minister was absolutely right to highlight the support provided by the United States to our troops in Afghanistan and the key role that it played in our success. Working side by side with US troops in Afghanistan and across the region has had some very tangible benefits for our service men and women, and it is something I know the ADF is looking to build on in the future.


Again, I thank the minister for taking this opportunity to update the Senate.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-12-11,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:55)  by leave—I thank the Minister for Defence for his update on progress on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and pay tribute to the 40 service people from Australia who have lost their lives in Afghanistan. I want to extend our sympathy to their families and of course offer our support to the 261 who have been wounded in action and to all of the service men and women who have returned and are coming back from Afghanistan. The Australian Greens absolutely honour your contribution to our nation, and we commit to supporting you on your return. Mental health issues are very real and need to be addressed, and the Australian Greens will be here to support whatever efforts are needed to look after families, those who have been wounded and those who are suffering as a result of their engagement.


I need to point out that when you consider a war you need to think about what has been achieved, why we were there and who made the decision to go—because people lost their lives. The Greens did not oppose Australia joining military action under the auspices of the United Nations in Afghanistan in 2001 following the horrific September 11 2001 attacks. Like so many others, we hoped that swift military intervention under the auspices of the UN to capture and bring to justice the leaders of Al Qaeda could help make the world a safer place and prevent the loss of so many more lives. But we did not support the withdrawal in 2002 and the redeployment to Iraq and then the lost opportunities in Afghanistan, or the 2005-06 redeployment of the Special Forces to Afghanistan.


Over that period we have sent men and women to risk their lives, but the reason they were there was never clear after 2005 and 2006. Mission creep with no clear outcome was the result. Major General Cantwell says in his book Exit Wounds:


… we need to have a crystal clear understanding of why we're getting into the fight, how long for, what we hope to achieve, how we will leave, and what conditions might prompt us to change strategy—this has let us down in Afghanistan. Human beings die as a result of warfare.


The point he is clearly making is not that our troops have not done us proud—they absolutely have in Afghanistan and we thank them for it—but that responsibility lies with parliaments and with governments. From the beginning of the conflict in Afghanistan we in the Australian Greens were calling for a parliamentary debate on our deployment. It was nine years from when the government of John Howard first committed our forces in September 2001 until the parliament officially debated our deployment, in October 2010. That is not good enough. If we are to honour and truly respect the sacrifices that our troops make, we have to be very clear about why they are being deployed and we should have the support of the parliament, not just the government of the day, in committing those troops.


Major General Cantwell asked the hard question, 'Is it worth it?' He went on to talk about that in some depth:


But will our efforts, no matter how impressive locally, significantly influence the myriad problems afflicting the government and people of Afghanistan? Ten years from now, will anyone in Afghanistan remember that Australians shed blood for them? For a man like me, a lifetime soldier inculcated with a sense of duty and service, these are difficult questions to confront.


He went onto say that, in his view, it was not worth it. He said:


I cannot justify any one of the Australian lives lost in Afghanistan.


That indeed is a tragic statement but it goes to the heart of this mission creep and why we were there and the increasing view around the world that Australia was committed in Afghanistan more to its alliance with the United States than to have an outcome that was achievable. 


So at this point, out of respect for people who have served there, who have lost their lives or have come back injured physically and mentally, we need to now make sure that we do try to maintain the advances that have been made that were set out by the minister in his speech. This goes to the heart of Australia's deployment of aid in Afghanistan, to make sure that we continue to support the education of women and girls in particular, but it also means that we use our best efforts to make sure that the media remains interested in Afghanistan post the withdrawal of the troops so that the rest of the world comes to see what is actually going on there. There is a very real concern from NGOs in Afghanistan that they are not going to be able to continue to enable women to access medical facilities—for example, girls to access school—because, as one of their long-time activists and former parliamentarian Malalai Joya has said, history proves that these values cannot be imposed by foreign troops. She goes on to talk about the need for the countries that were engaged in the war in Afghanistan to now stand up to the administration in Afghanistan and insist that women's rights, that human rights, are upheld in Afghanistan. That is a critical issue for all of us in this parliament. 


In closing, I want to acknowledge not only our own troops who have died and been injured but also the cost to the people of Afghanistan. A large number of civilians have died in Afghanistan in that violence. This has been a human tragedy at every scale and the Australian Greens, in paying tribute to the service of our men and women, ask that the parliament thinks very carefully about changing the way we deploy our troops to war in the future. It should use a reflection on this period in Afghanistan to change the law in this country to make sure that it is parliament which actually backs deployment of troops and not just the government of the day.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-12-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:02):  by leave—I want to acknowledge the families of those who have fallen in Afghanistan. As you know, Mr Deputy President, I am based in Townsville, the home of Australia's largest Army base and a significant Air Force base, and many of the troops who have fought in Afghanistan left our shores from Townsville. The Townsville community is part of the military commitment wherever it is and certainly in relation to Afghanistan. 


I also want to mention in passing the Avenue of Honour which was established at Yungaburra on the banks of Lake Tinaroo, where 40 trees have been planted as a living memorial to the 40 soldiers who gave their lives in Australia's honour during the Afghanistan conflict. I want to quote from Mr Gordon Chuck, who initiated the Avenue of Honour at Yungaburra. It is a very moving area which was officially opened in June last year in the presence of the then Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, Mr Abbott and General Hurley. Mr Chuck, the father of one of those killed, Private Ben Chuck, and who initiated the memorial, said during the opening: 


Although dedicated to the fallen in Afghanistan, I guess it's a representation of the commitment and courage of the Australian digger over generations. It's here to remind people that the freedoms and liberties we seem to hold so dearly, and yet often tend to take for granted, come at a terrible price—we mustn't forget that. 


That memorial does, forever, commemorate the lives of soldiers who gave their lives in the defence of our country in the Afghan war.


The Roll of Honour at the opening ceremony was read by General Cantwell, and that in itself is a very difficult thing to do. It was a very moving ceremony and there would not have been a dry eye as General Cantwell read out the names of those who had given their lives in Afghanistan. I simply say to my colleagues that, if you ever have the chance, if you are ever in North Queensland on the Atherton Tableland behind Cairns, one of the things you must see is the Avenue of Honour. It is a magnificent living memorial to the efforts made by our soldiers in Afghanistan.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-12-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:06):  I was speaking to this motion when the Senate adjourned last night, and I was indicating that I will be one of the few government speakers on this debate. We are trying to get this bill to a vote. It is part of the election commitment made by the coalition. It was an election commitment which was warmly endorsed by a clear majority of all Australians. I cannot understand the Labor Party, in particular, opposing it. I can understand the Greens opposing it, because the Greens are rabid when it comes to anything to do with their favourite project of inflicting on Australia the carbon tax and all the paraphernalia around the Climate Change Authority that this bill seeks to abolish.


The Labor Party should understand the voice of the people. There can be no misunderstanding: as Tony Abbott said many, many a time, the last election was to be a referendum on the carbon tax. The people of Australia spoke very, very clearly on what they wanted to do with the carbon tax. They wanted it abolished. Why? Because they, like me, realised that having the world's largest carbon tax does not save the planet, it does nothing at all to reduce carbon emissions around the world. In fact I emphasised, when I spoke before, that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. If, with this carbon tax, we do reduce our emissions by five per cent, which is the goal, then five per cent of 1.4 per cent is not going to make any difference whatsoever, not one iota of difference, to the changing climate of the world if man's emission of carbon is the cause of that.


Before my opponents malign me and keep saying that I do not believe in climate change, I repeat, for probably the 500th time in this chamber, that I do acknowledge climate change; of course the climate is changing. We were once covered with ice. Once upon a time the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Of course the climate changes. But I get sick of hearing the Greens saying that all of the floods and the cyclones we have seen in recent times are because we did not have a carbon tax early enough. Every time the Greens say, 'Look at these awful floods. They are the worst floods we've ever seen in Australia, in South-East Queensland,' I keep pointing out to them that that is only since 1974. They are not the worst. They are only worse than anything since 1974. There were bigger ones in 1974. I am sure that was climate change that caused them in 1974.


Similarly, Cyclone Yasi up my way was the worst and biggest cyclone we have ever had in Australia—since 1917, when a bigger cyclone struck the coast of North Queensland. It is all relative. The climate does move in cycles and, as someone who lives in the north, I know that cyclones are cyclic. Perhaps that is why they are called 'cyclones'. Every 10 or so years we will get a very severe cyclone. I know in my town of Ayr we had three cyclones in two years back in the late 1960s, I think it was. Fortunately, touch wood, we have not had any since then. We have seen the cyclones come and I regret for the people of Cardwell and Mission Beach that it hit there, but I have to say I was glad that it did not hit my town. 


The point I make is that these things happen. They have always happened. Yet if you took any notice of the Greens—which, fortunately, very few Australians do these days—you would think that all of this was because we did not have a carbon tax early enough. They say, 'We're going to stop Australia's emissions by five per cent'—that is five per cent of the 1.4 per cent—and suddenly that is going to cure every cyclone and every flood in the world. I heard Senator Waters on the radio this morning and learned there is a new reason for climate change, and that is the fact that Mr Hunt has today, fortuitously, given approval for the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion. It is news that I was delighted to hear. At last common-sense has prevailed. Senator Waters even claimed that this decision is going to ruin the Barrier Reef—mind you, if Senator Waters had a look at a map she would see that Abbot Point is a long, long way from the Barrier Reef. According to her, it is going to destroy not only the Barrier Reef and the tourist industry but, from the way Senator Waters was going on, you would think it is going to destroy mankind. But it is also going to cause climate change, according to Senator Waters. These are the sorts of wild accusations you get from the radical environment movement. They have no interest in science and proper process. 


In the case of Abbot Point, the approval is given subject to the most stringent conditions—conditions that have been imposed by scientists and people who understand these issues. You will have the Greens and Greenpeace and everyone protesting. The Greens always love the standard of living that Australia's wealth brings, but they want to stop the process that brings the wealth to Australia. It brings wealth to Australia in a sustainable way that is environmentally conscious. The conditions that Mr Hunt has imposed are pretty stringent. I just hope they do not frighten away the proponents. I am hopeful that those developments will go ahead, because it will mean so much to the people in the small township of Bowen, just south of where I live. I recently attended a seminar in Bowen when the whole town was anxiously awaiting approval for this expansion. There were small business people and people wanting jobs in that area who were desperately keen for a decision to be made. I congratulate Mr Hunt on his decision to proceed with that, and with the Gladstone and Mackay proposals as well.


You will hear a lot from the Greens and the ABC over the next week or so on how this is really going to destroy mankind, but I ask those who might be interested to have a look at the conditions, to understand that these approvals are set with the interests of Australia and Australians in mind. You will hear the Greens saying, 'This will bring so many more ships through the Barrier Reef and that will destroy the Barrier Reef.' I am sorry, but ships have been coming through the Barrier Reef for over a hundred years and any problems that the Barrier Reef has have not been caused by ships sailing between the reef and the mainland or through one of the channels there. I am delighted that Mr Hunt has made that decision, and I will do everything in my power to support that decision and support the people of Bowen.


The workers and the miners who have been losing their jobs in the Queensland coalfields do not know where the Labor Party are when it comes to the loss of workers' jobs because of carbon taxes and mining taxes. You never seem to see them. They are only interested in the miners and the workers when they pay their union fees and can allow the union bosses to do whatever they do do these days with union fees. We only have to look at Mr Thomson to understand some of the things that are being done with union fees. But that seems to be the only time the Labor Party are interested in the jobs of workers. 


I am interested in the jobs of miners in Central Queensland. I am interested in small businesses in Bowen and Mackay. I am interested in those wanting work there. I am interested, more than any, I might say, in our tourist industry and our fishing industry and in making sure that our greatest national asset, the Great Barrier Reef, is protected. I am confident that the decision made today, with all its conditions, will continue to protect the Great Barrier Reef. I remind the Greens and the Labor Party that, if they look back through history, it has been the Liberal Party in government that have taken all the significant measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef, because we have always understood how significant it is. It is a win-win situation on Abbot Point. 


I have digressed, I have to say, a little bit from the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill, but it was important to bring things into perspective and to reject Senator Waters' claim, which I heard her make on radio, that the approval for Abbot Point will hasten climate change around the world. This just shows the stupidity of the comments. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Coal exports will.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  I remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I appreciate your protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would rather have the debate with Senator Whish-Wilson, because, as with so many things that the Greens say, it is all based on scaremongering and certainly not on science. You just have them saying anything on the basis that the end justifies the means. I know the Greenpeace attitude: tell any lie you like, as long as you get the result you want. Isn't it the Greenpeace motto: tell any lie you like, misrepresent any fact, as long as you get the end result you want? All lies and misrepresentations are in order. 


Getting back to the bill before us, it is essential that we are allowed to honour the commitment we made to the Australian people, and that the Australian Labor Party made to the Australian people as well. I re-emphasise to the Australian Labor Party and to people who might be listening to this debate: it was the Australian Labor Party, the ALP, the Gillard government, that solemnly promised before the 2010 election that they would not introduce a carbon tax. Yet, today we hear from Labor speakers that it is so good. If it is so good, can you tell me why your leader prior to the 2010 election promised not to bring it in? Because of that promise, she got herself elected. Before the 2013 election, the Senate spokesman for the Labor Party was handing round pamphlets in her campaign saying, 'We've already got rid of the carbon tax.' How is that? This is a pamphlet from the opposition spokesman in this chamber on the environment before the election saying, 'We've got rid of the carbon tax.' Well, they hadn't. But here is her chance now. She can retrospectively honour the promise that she was making then that they had gotten rid of it. 


The government will be well advised in relation to climate matters by the CSIRO, whose science and understanding we greatly respect. We will be advised by the Bureau of Meteorology—Australia's weather experts, who are world-renowned. We do not need a Climate Change Authority made up of Labor Party friends, with hundreds of public servants and huge costs, giving the previous government the sort of advice they wanted to hear. I have to say it was more political advice than it was climate change advice. 


We do not need that, and the Australian people do not need to have to pay for that. We have some of the pre-eminent scientific organisations in the world—the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO—there to advise us. We also have very expert people in the Department of the Environment to advise the minister. We have a minister who understands these things, unlike previous ministers, and who appreciates what is what and, more importantly, a minister who is determined to ensure that the promises we made to the Australian people before the last election are honoured.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:20):  I rise today to speak on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We are here today to discuss the Abbott government's continued attack on science and on the Public Service. We are here today to witness the continuation of the Abbott government's tactic of destroying agencies whose expertise does not match with the ideology of the new government. We are here today, yet again, to be dismayed by the Abbott government's continued attack on openness and transparency. And we are here today because those on the government benches do not wish for frank and fearless advice from the Public Service, just hollow echoes of their own thought bubbles. This is a disappointing development in Australian politics, and it is not in the interests of the nation.


This attempt to destroy the Climate Change Authority comes on top of the government's closure of the Climate Commission and AusAID, the abolition of the science portfolio, the loss of hundreds of jobs from CSIRO and the earlier attempt to destroy the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. While in this place we often disagree on policy, never have we disagreed upon the need for public debate to be informed by expert advice—that is, never before the election of this current Liberal-Nationals government. We may disagree on whose expert advice is best, but never before has a government in this country sought to destroy agencies simply because their expert advice is not to the liking of the government's blinkered, narrow-minded belief system. That is what we are witnessing today. The Liberal-Nationals government is seeking to destroy the Climate Change Authority because it does not like the advice it provides and it does not want any government authority at all to be able to measure how well or—more likely—how poorly its Direct Action policy is or is not working.


The Climate Change Authority, in a measured and sensible manner, provides expert knowledge about action to counter climate change both in Australia and internationally, the efficacy of those actions and the adequacy of those actions. The Climate Change Authority completed its first review of the Renewable Energy Target in December 2012, recommending keeping the renewable energy target at 41,000 gigawatt hours. The Climate Change Authority has commenced work on the first review of Australia's emissions reduction goals. The targets and progress review will recommend short-, medium- and long-term emission reduction goals and assess Australia's progress towards its medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets.


In its targets and progress review report to the government, due to be released in February 2014, the authority will review Australia's progress towards its medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets; recommend a 2020 emissions reduction target; recommend a national carbon budget and indicative national emissions trajectory; discuss how Australia might meet its trajectory, budget and target, including how different sectors of the economy could contribute and the role of international emissions reductions; and, as required by legislation, recommend caps on emissions under the carbon-pricing mechanism. In framing its recommendations, the authority draws upon existing and new analysis of a wide range of issues, including the accumulating body of science and underpinning concerns about climate change; the extent and nature of ongoing international arrangements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; how any global efforts to reduce emissions might be shared among nations; and the economic and social implications for Australia of different targets for reducing emissions.


The Liberal-Nationals government do not want to hear the outcome of this report because they know it will say things that their members in the 'climate change is crap' brigade do not want to hear. They do not want to discuss how Australia might meet its trajectory, budget and target because they have no intention to meet any of these.


Even in the draft report, which is publicly available on the climate change agency's website—and I am sure the Liberal-National government will try to hide or expunge it as they tried to expunge the Gonski report—there are a number of points they do not like because these points expose how dishonest they have been when debating climate change science and climate change economics. The draft report highlights that significant action is being taken on climate change by the international community. China has pilot emissions trading schemes planned for seven provinces and cities. The first began in 2013 and there are plans to design a national emissions trading scheme—that is right: China, the world's most populous nation, a Communist nation, is adopting a market based emissions trading scheme while the Australian Liberal-National government, the Abbott-Truss government, is introducing Marxist-style direct government intervention into the economy.


On this issue the Chinese Communist government are acting more liberal than the Australian Liberal Party itself. To put it another way: on this issue the action by the Australian Liberal Party is more Marxist than the actions of the Chinese Communist government are. I am surprised that Minister Abetz can keep from choking when trying to explain this direct action policy. China has renewable energy targets, feed-in tariff support for solar, wind and biomass power, a policy of closure of inefficient small- and medium-sized coal plants and industrial facilities, appliance and building standards, an energy efficiency target, industrial energy efficiency retrofits and vehicle fuel efficiency standards.


The United States of America has subnational emissions trading schemes in California and nine north-eastern states, subnational renewable energy targets, financial incentives supporting renewable energy, proposed national regulations limiting emissions from fossil fuel power plants, appliance and building standards, industrial energy efficiency assessments, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and vehicle emissions standards. The European Union has an emissions trading scheme amongst its 28 member states and Norway, a renewable energy target and support for cogeneration, feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, appliance and building standards, an energy efficiency target, vehicle emissions standards and renewable fuel production incentives.


India has a coal tax, an energy efficiency trading scheme for the power sector, renewable energy targets, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and vehicle emissions standards pending. Japan, Canada, South Korea, South Africa and New Zealand have taken substantive action to tackle climate change. There ends the furphy that no other nations are doing anything about climate change.


When you combine all those countries you can see that substantive action is being taken by countries representing an overwhelming majority of the world's population and carbon dioxide output. You can see why the government do not want an agency that explicitly collates and releases that data, because it is not in the Liberal-National government's interest for that information to be widely distributed amongst the Australian population. Mr Abbott and his friends are happy for there to be a widespread belief that there has been no international action on climate change. Indeed, they have dishonestly pushed that view strongly over the last six years. The Abbott-Truss government is not going to like the Climate Change Authority's targets and progress review report because it will recommend a higher target than five per cent on 2000 levels. That can be clearly seen in the draft report which is already released. The draft report says:


The Authority presents two options:


a 2020 emissions reduction target of 15 per cent below 2000 levels, with a 2030 trajectory range of 35-50 per cent; or


a 2020 target of 25 per cent with a 2030 trajectory range of 40-50 per cent.


The Authority will recommend a single 2020 target and a single 2030 trajectory range in its Final Report.


Either of these recommendations the Abbott-Truss government will find extremely embarrassing. That is because Tony Abbott has recently confirmed that his government has abandoned its longstanding policy to reduce Australia's emissions by between five and 25 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020, a crucial and internationally scrutinised goal that had retained bipartisan support since 2009, despite significant international action, as I outlined. It is no real surprise to see Tony Abbott walking away from his early support for Australia's commitment—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):    Order! I ask you to refer to the members in the other place by their proper titles.




Senator BILYK:
  Tony Abbott? That is his name.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Prime Minister?




Senator BILYK:
  I can refer to him as Tony Abbott.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Mr Abbott.




Senator BILYK:
  Okay, Mr Abbott.




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  You get worked up when I have a go, so do it properly this time.




Senator BILYK:
  Oh, a little bit precious over there.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I just ask you to adhere to the standing orders.




Senator BILYK:
  Anyway, it is no real surprise to see Mr Abbott walking away from his early support for Australia's commitment to reduce carbon pollution. He has made it clear on a number of occasions that he sees no particular problem with carbon pollution. But it is disappointing that, rather than listening to the expert advice given by the Climate Change Authority, he will close down the agency instead.


The explanatory memorandum for this bill gives an explanation of why the Climate Change Authority is being scrapped:


The Government has a long-standing commitment to abolish the Climate Change Authority (CCA) because it is not needed.


…   …   …


Abolishing the CCA will make a significant contribution to delivering a smaller climate change bureaucracy.


What a hollow attempt at an explanation. I would say the government do not think it is needed because they do not intend to achieve any tangible outcome from their Direct Action policy—not even the 5 per cent reduction on the year-2000-level target that they appear to be walking away from.


This bill also scraps the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board, although you would not know it from the short title of this bill. There is very little about the scrapping of the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board in the explanatory memorandum, which does not even give a fig leaf of an explanation as to why this board is to be scrapped. There is not one word. I find it utterly bizarre that the government, especially the National Party with their alleged concern for rural Australia, is scrapping this board.


This is not a tin-pot board that meets once a year to discuss something of no importance. This is a board that has administered tens of millions of dollars of grants, and yet the Liberal-National government do not give one word of an explanation in their explanatory memorandum of why they want it scrapped. It is utterly remarkable. Talk about lack of transparency! Were you all too busy backflipping on education to finish writing the explanatory memorandum?


For senators and those listening who may not be aware, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board was established under the Climate Change Authority Act 2011 to provide advice to the Australian government on the implementation of the Land Sector Package, which is part of the previous Labor government's Clean Energy Future plan. It has funded and supported a large number of projects since its inception.


From its 2011-12 annual report we can see some of the projects that the board has funded:


The first round of the Filling the Research Gap program has provided multi-year grants to 58 projects to the value of $47.3 million to support research into emerging abatement technologies, strategies and innovative management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the land sector, sequester carbon and enhance sustainable agricultural practices.


The first round of the Action on the Ground program has provided multi-year grants to 59 projects to the value of $25.2 million that are supporting more than 420 farmers from across the county to trial on-farm practices and technologies to demonstrate how farmers can reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions or increase the sequestration of carbon in soil on their properties. 


These round one Filling the Research Gap and Action on the Ground projects cover a broad range of farming practices and climatic and geographic conditions associated with the dairy, livestock (grazing and feedlot industries), horticulture and cropping industries and will help farmers become more sustainable and resilient. The funding for these projects is an investment in the future of Australia’s agricultural sector.


I am surprised—and pretty disappointed, quite frankly—that the Nationals are agreeing to the abolition of a board that is providing tens of millions of dollars of funding to projects in rural communities around the country. I am disappointed that the Nationals are agreeing to the abolition of a board that is making farming more sustainable and more environmentally friendly into the future. They really need to have a good hard look at themselves and have a think about what they really believe and who they really represent.


Can Senator Nigel Scullion explain to the farmers of the Northern Territory why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $548,303 to trial and demonstrate practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions associated with horticultural and cropping industries in Northern Australia? Can Senators Fiona Nash and John Williams explain to the farmers of New South Wales why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $394,000 to trial minimum tillage practices, including controlled traffic and use of mulches, to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and increase sequestration of soil carbon during the production of vegetable crops in New South Wales? Can Senator McKenzie explain to the farmers of Victoria and to my home state of Tasmania as well why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $540,909 for increased nitrogen use efficiency by cropping farmers in the high-rainfall zones of Victoria and Tasmania? Can Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Ian Macdonald explain to the farmers of Queensland why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $534,364 to improve cattle-grazing practices to reduce methane and benefit soil carbon?


I think the farmers of Australia should be extremely concerned and disappointed at the decision of the National Party to vote against the projects funded under the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board that are improving knowledge and farming practices across Australia. I think those that vote for the National Party as a separate entity from the Liberal Party need an explanation of why they continue to act against the interests of the people they claim to represent.


I am surprised that the Liberal-National government want to destroy a board that now has significant expertise in agricultural science, economics including environmental economics, conservation ecology, greenhouse gas emissions measurement and reporting, greenhouse gas abatement measures, public administration, business management and the management or care of Indigenous-held land. I am surprised that the Liberal-National government want to destroy an organisation that now has significant expertise in overseeing carbon sequestering, enhancing sustainable agricultural practices and planting trees when these are all parts of their own Direct Action policy. You are abolishing the board that has the expertise to push your own policy agenda. That is crazy. It is just remarkable.


The government have come into this place with this bill and the previous bill on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation without presenting a clear case for the abolition of either of these bodies. They have made no argument other than a hollow ideological fig leaf of reducing bureaucracy, while at the same time advocating for direct government action on climate change. How much bureaucracy will it take to administer their Direct Action policy? They have stated that they have a policy to 'cut bureaucracy' in the Climate Change Authority, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, yet will create a massive bureaucracy to administer their Direct Action policy. It is utterly ridiculous, honestly. Ironically, the expertise they will need to administer their Direct Action plan is already possessed by people in the Climate Change Authority, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board and—you guessed it—the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This Liberal-National government will make them redundant and pay their redundancies, only to find that they will need to rehire them through the Department of the Environment when they realise their Marxist Direct Action policy will need considerably more bureaucracy than those that they have sought to destroy over the last few weeks.


Senators in this place should be extremely disappointed with this bill and indeed many of the bills that have been brought to this place under the Liberal-National government. Proper debate in this place should be based on fact, not on ideology. The Australian people should be greatly concerned about the Liberal-National habit of destroying agencies and boards whose advice they are opposed to merely for ideological reasons. As I said, this attempt to destroy the Climate Change Authority comes on top of the government's closure of the Climate Commission and AusAID, the abolition of the science portfolio, the loss of hundreds of jobs from CSIRO and previous attempts to destroy the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


The Liberal-National government are seeking to destroy the Climate Change Authority because they do not like the advice it provides and they do not want any government authority at all to be able to measure how well or how poorly their Direct Action policy is or is not working. I just find it a bit of a joke. It is a joke, unfortunately, at the expense of the Australian people. I would urge all senators, but particularly those National Party senators who are voting to destroy a board that has granted tens of millions of dollars to Australian farmers, the people they claim to represent, to think again and to vote against this bill.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (10:40):  I rise also to speak against the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. One of the things I want to take up from Senator Bilyk is trying to encourage the National Party to have a separate view from the Liberal Party. That is a long bow, quite frankly. They are truly the doormats to the Liberal Party. We have not seen them spectacularly stand up for anything much at all, quite frankly.


Getting back to the point, though, not only is this bill, along with the proposed repeal of other clean energy acts, environmental vandalism at its very heart, but at best these bills will if passed ensure that Australia's reputation as a progressive economy will fail. The rest of the world will view us in a negative way if we remove not only the Climate Change Authority but also the other work that has been progressed for a very long time. Moreover, our ability to effect real change in the economy to deal with the negative effects of climate change will be lost.


Abolishing the Climate Change Authority shows the contempt that the Abbott government has for independent advice on climate science and how it views our society and the economy. If you look at the latest series of attacks by the Abbott government on the scientific community in Australia—the cuts to the CSIRO and the abolition of the Climate Commission—what really underpins that is this base view of a complete rejection of grounded scientific research—so much so that what they are going to do will take the work that is being done by an independent umpire and stick it in the department. Incorporating the functions of the CCA into the Department of the Environment will mean ultimately that the minister will control the message and will be able to influence the content. It will mean, given the current history of this Abbott government, less transparency. We will not be privy to the work that they do, which is the hallmark of this government to date. It has not been able to move away from a negative agenda masked in secrecy.


The course of action by the Liberals will mean that the work done so far to lower emissions and have a cleaner energy future and a stronger economy will not happen. The Liberals and the Nats—I much prefer just to use the word 'Liberals', because I think the Nats are as one with them—will argue that this action they are taking is designed to address the perception that electricity prices have risen as a direct result of the clean energy legislation of the Rudd-Gillard government. But nothing could be further from the truth. The Climate Institute correctly identifies that, one year on from the introduction of the legislation, the electricity sector emissions have fallen, the economy is growing and the cost of living has not ballooned as the Liberals argued it would. We can all remember what Mr Abbott said would happen: the sky would fall in. He then went to a python squeeze and ultimately bellyflopped with the rhetoric that he used to describe how the economy would be destroyed as a consequence of believing in climate change.


The good news is that the annual carbon emissions have fallen. The regulated carbon limits have fallen by at least 12 million tonnes. It is rubbish for the Liberals to continue to spread the lie that electricity prices have risen as a consequence of this legislation. But they will continue, I suspect, even in this debate to argue that electricity prices have risen. Consumers know it, households know it: they have risen as a consequence of network upgrades, replacing ageing infrastructure. Around 40 per cent of the contribution of the carbon price has accounted for only nine per cent of power bills in 2012-13 according to the Climate Change Institute. No wonder the Liberals want to get rid of an independent umpire that provides facts and figures about the economy and how we are addressing climate change. They do not want the consumer or households to be aware of it.


The economy has continued to remain relatively strong, unlike the doom and gloom the Liberals in opposition argued would happen. The impact of the carbon price has been barely discernible according to the ABS, again, an independent body. When you move the climate authority into the department, can you have the same confidence that it will be an independent voice of reason? I doubt it. The great majority of Australian consumers have not been impacted by the carbon price. For those households that have been impacted, it has been a very small effect and there has been an assistance package there to assist. Of course it has not stopped the extreme language of the Liberals in talking down the economy, exaggerating the effects of putting a price on carbon and ignoring the reasons for the need to address climate change using the best market based mechanisms available.


The Liberals demonstrated in the last 100 days or so that they have forgotten how the market works. It can be the only explanation for the Liberals to justify why they are moving from market based mechanisms to regulatory planned models that really hark back to the 1960s, which was the last time we saw them in this country. One wonders what did happen to the Liberals and free market? You only have to go back to the 2007 federal election under Mr John Howard, who effectively was supporting an emissions trading scheme as part of their platform. There has been an enormous transformation, it appears. Instead of progressing forward with market based economic solutions, we have gone back 20 years to the 1960s under the Liberals who support a planned economy. I guess next we will be hearing them champion Stalin.


What did the Liberal Party of Australia become? Now it looks like champions of a centrally planned economic policy. To give you some feel for that, the so-called Direct Action policy is widely discredited. Let me go to some of the black holes that it is. The government, I suspect, will be required to put significant funding into the Direct Action policy if it is ever to work. We will move from that question as to whether they want it to work or whether it is just a face saver for true climate deniers. It is, quite frankly, an odd policy when you look at the content of it—if we could. Of course they have not put that on the table.


We can assume what direct action means. They have made some statements about it. It does look to date, though, to be politically convenient but ideologically incongruous, financially expensive and probably irrelevant to the future. It certainly will not fit into the global action on climate change. But none of this has stopped the Liberals on their relentless march towards political expediency by effectively, I think, being captured by the climate change deniers within their own party, who are now seeking to tear down a market based solution and replace it with the regulatory model which effectively consists of a two-word slogan of 'direct action' with no details behind it, a call to arms perhaps by the Liberals to try and find a bit more meat on the bone.


Let us be honest: the real reason they want to repeal the clean energy bill including the Climate Change Authority and replace it with a policy with no details is, ultimately, the climate change deniers captured the Liberal Party. They do not believe in climate change. They do not want to effect change and they will continue to use Direct Action. Without a model to look at to see how it will work, it seems to be a system that will use taxpayers' money to fund big business in an attempt to reduce emissions—a very poor way to try to reduce emissions. Maybe those on the other side will be able to enlighten me in this debate how that Direct Action policy will work, how it will achieve the most efficient reduction of emissions through the use of taxpayers' money in the first place and why they would replace it with a market based mechanism. But we have not heard from them about that. There will be plenty of excuses later as to why Direct Action fails but let us not get ahead of the debate here.


The coalition have promised that their flawed clean energy policy rests on two things: the repeal of the carbon legislation and the implementation of Direct Action. What we have before parliament is only half the policy. It is true that they are attempting to do the repeal today, but I think that they, even in government and true to the Liberal's DNA, can only say no to sensible policy which will achieve a clean energy future and, through a market based operation, the reduction of carbon emissions while maintaining a strong economy.


While they say that they accept climate change, that it is real and that humans are contributing to it, I am not convinced that they are truly saying it with conviction. The Liberals have not told us how the other half of their Direct Action policy will achieve real and meaningful change. They promised to be a consultative government, a stable adult government and a government that would work with others, and I think this is where the public have been misled by the coalition while in opposition and when they came to government. The government's first actions have been to abolish what they can see, to abolish what they do not understand, to say no to things that they are unsure of and to continue to cut harshly into the Public Service and the economy. They explained none of that in the lead-up to the last election, and I think the public have a right to ask whether this is the government that they elected.


Any responsible government would have put their credentials on the table and indicated how they were going to achieve their reductions through direct action. The coalition said that the action plan would coincide with the introduction of their Direct Action Plan to tackle climate change. That is what they have said. Where is it? It is not on the table. Let us be clear about the coalition's position. They are now asking us to abolish the Climate Change Authority, an independent umpire that provides an independent voice. They want to remove the market mechanism to reduce emissions. They want to do all of the above, without putting their bona fides on the table and without indicating what will replace it, while continuing to be a negative and carping government.


The economic impact of this has not been modelled. One of the things that Senator Cormann became famous for, without verballing him too much, is asking for modelling. Where is the modelling to show that Direct Action will achieve the outcomes? Have they done the modelling? Have they provided the certainty that removing a market based mechanism such as the ETS will be less efficient than their Direct Action program? I am not going to embarrass Senator Cormann by asking for the modelling. Quite frankly, I think we all know that it does not exist.


It is more likely that a Direct Action program will simply be a transfer for dud harebrained schemes that big business dream up to suck money out of the Australian taxpayer to support their attempts of reducing emissions. I think any and all of that will be on the table for the Liberals.


The unstated problem with this Direct Action Plan is: where is the money going to come from? How are they going to fund it? Some of the critical elements of their Direct Action Plan are simply not there. More importantly, where is the modelling to show that they will be able to purchase sufficient domestic abatement to meet Australia's bipartisan 2020 emissions reduction target of five per cent compared with the 2000 levels, based on the work done by the Department of Climate Change? Will we achieve the targets or will we simply be provided with an excuse as to why there will be a shortfall? That is the crucial bit.


If we look at the evidence to date, the size of the suggested shortfall—that is, the difference between what the emissions trading scheme under Labor would achieve and what Direct Action could possibly achieve—will be the difference between the target of 159 million tonnes of CO2 abatement and about 40 million tonnes, which is the amount Direct Action will achieve on average by 2020 according to some of the best estimates. So there will be about 119 million tonnes missing. Where are they going to find it? One of their Direct Action proposals is to plant trees. They are going to be busy painting trees to achieve that.


The Liberals will say that greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes are not world's best practice. But, if you look at the evidence to date, there are schemes operational in several countries around the world. Schemes are operational in Switzerland, New Zealand and South Korea, and subnational schemes are legislated in the US, Canada and Japan. The Kyoto protocol also provides for emissions trading across nations. China has also moved with a network of seven pilot schemes planned to begin in 2013. You get the sense that the world is moving one way and Australia, under Tony Abbott, is moving the other way. It seems impossible to consider Direct Action as being a viable, workable and effective scheme in an international setting.


One of the most telling criticisms of Direct Action comes from someone who would have direct knowledge of the matter. Mr Turnbull offered this advice in February 2010 when he spoke of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010:


Until 1 December last year, there was a bipartisan commitment in Australia that this carbon price, this exercise in reducing emissions, should be imposed by means of a market based mechanism—this emissions trading scheme.


…


As we have seen in recent days, alternatives such as direct regulation or subsidies will be far more costly to the economy, no matter how hard their designers seek to argue the contrary.


I will leave it that I agree with his words.


Mr Turnbull went on to bell the cat. He recognised that the subsidy schemes, like the Direct Action proposal, will encourage government to pick projects for subsidies, which will be a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. This will result in more costly and less effective abatement of emissions.


In conclusion in this debate, and coming back to the main scope of this bill: again, it is simply a negative, retrograde step by a government that has no clear policy and that can only see its way to say 'no', to abolish things and to cut things. It has no positive plan for Australia's future, and this is but one example of where removing the independent umpire also gives it the ability to hide the truth and not allow it to be put into the public domain—to control the message.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (11:00):  I rise to oppose the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We have said it, they have heard it and former Prime Minister Rudd announced that we would abolish the carbon tax. Done and dusted.


But this government is playing political games with the carbon tax. The carbon tax is all it talks about. You would think that what is before the Australian parliament is one bill to abolish the carbon tax. But what this government is trying to do is much more than abolish the carbon tax, and they are trying to hide that fact from Australian voters. In fact, the only time we hear the coalition government talk about all of the other parts of its abolition bills is in response to Labor putting the success of our climate change policy on the public record.


The coalition government wants Labor to support much, much more than the abolition of the carbon tax. The coalition government would have us believe that it has a mandate, that the federal election was all about the carbon tax, when the facts are that the carbon tax did not rate as a top five issue. The coalition government thinks Labor should just fall into line with its wishes and its wants. Well, what the Labor opposition is doing is acting responsibly. We are siding with the Australian public, with Australian voters, because they want action on climate change.


Recently, the PM, Mr Abbott, invited Australians to let their elected representatives know loud and clear about their views on the carbon tax. And I thank Mr Abbott, because Australian voters are letting us know what they want—letting us know loud and clear that they do not support the abolition of the carbon tax without replacing it with an emissions trading scheme. This is exactly Labor's position, and despite Mr Abbott taking a gamble and inviting voters to email politicians with their views I have not had one—not one—email supporting the coalition government's position. Not one email supporting its Direct Action plan.


So I say to the coalition government: keep your heads buried in the sand, ignoring the views of Australian voters, ignoring the views of experts and abolishing authorities such as the Climate Change Authority because they produce reports based on science and rigorous analysis which lead to outcomes that do not support the government's rhetoric and do not support the government's instincts on climate change. And they do not support the views of the climate change deniers who now make up this coalition government.


This government does not want independent expert advice. It treats advice based on science or facts with hostility. It has nailed its colours to the mast of the rotten ship SS Direct Action and is not letting go, no matter what the science says and no matter what Australian voters think. This move by the coalition government to abolish the Climate Change Authority demonstrates this government's complete hostility—complete hostility—to independent expert advice.


There is no reason to abolish the Climate Change Authority. In fact, there is every reason to keep it. And again, Senator Abetz and the government showed their complete lack of understanding of the Climate Change Authority when Senator Abetz said in the Senate on 2 December in relation to the Climate Change Authority:


… in relation to the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill—why are we putting that forward? Because if you remove the carbon tax there is no real need for this authority, …


Again, the government demonstrates that it has not done its homework. It does not know what it is talking about when it comes to climate change, because the Climate Change Authority undertakes reviews and makes recommendations on a range of matters, including emissions reduction targets and carbon budgets.


The renewable energy target—how will we measure that without an independent authority? And there is the Carbon Farming Initiative—something that I would have thought the National Party would want to know about and receive advice on—and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System.


The Climate Change Authority board—I do not know if the coalition has had a look at who is on this board—are leading experts in industry, in economics and in science. They are an extremely well-qualified board that all Australians should be proud of and they are an experienced board. Why would any competent government ignore their advice and shut them down so their voice can no longer be heard? The Climate Change Authority has nothing to do with the carbon tax. The reason the government does not want to keep it and wants to abolish it is quite simple: it does not want to be held accountable on its Direct Action Plan. It does not have a single supporter for this policy, which has been around for three years—not a single supporter in the scientific or economic fields. When direct action does not work, the government will not be held accountable for its actions because it is stripping away any authority which might hold it to account. This government, despite its rhetoric, does not want to be held accountable.


This government just wants to lick its finger, stick it in the air and see which way the wind is blowing. That is the extent of its interest in science—relying on its instincts rather than on the overwhelming evidence from 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists. Dr Dennis Jensen, the federal member for Tangney, told interviewer Jonathan Swan that just because 97 per cent of research papers published in scientific journals agree that humans are causing climate change this does not necessarily mean they are right, because, he said:


… the argument of consensus … is a flawed argument.


So Dr Jensen does not accept the position of the world's science academies and Australia's CSIRO that climate change is caused mainly by humans burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees. Instincts are an absolute trait of the coalition government. Former Prime Minister Howard told a London audience that those of us who accept that climate change is real are a bunch of 'religious zealots' and that he will trust his instincts.


It has been a while since Mr Howard was the Prime Minister of this country so one would have hoped that the coalition might have updated its knowledge and might have looked at some science—but, no, that trust in instincts and gut feelings continues in the current coalition. Prime Minister Abbott, the person who wants us to scrap any policies which put a price on carbon and to scrap the job of experts such as those who work in and manage the Climate Change Authority, told us two years ago:


… whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.


Mr Abbott obviously has not availed himself of the work of 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists. The Australian public know it, Labor know it, the Greens know it, but it seems the coalition is living in some kind of climate sceptics vacuum. 


More recently and, quite frankly, more embarrassingly, Prime Minister Tony Abbott accused the United Nations climate chief of 'talking through her hat'. That quote has been repeated quite a lot in this house and elsewhere. It is embarrassing than our Prime Minister, the supposed leader of our country, accuses the United Nations climate chief of talking through her hat. It just shows that ignorance about climate science is alive and well within the coalition. The classic, of course, was a comment by Minister Greg Hunt, the Minister for the Environment, someone who is expected to know everything about his portfolio. I accept that as a minister there are some views you take and some views you do not. But when you are so in the public eye, when you have such an important portfolio as the Environment portfolio, you should be able to quote the science or the economics. Whether you agree with it or not, you should know what is out there. Yet what did Minister Hunt confess to using? Wikipedia. With all of the resources the minister has in his office, in the department, in the Climate Change Authority, he turns to Wikipedia to contradict the United Nations climate chief. And he contradicted her opinion in a BBC interview. Again, oh dear me, how embarrassing. First the Prime Minister of our country and then our environment minister—how embarrassing for Australia.


I have a message for Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt: it is proven. I have another message: there exists an authority, the Climate Change Authority, which is a group of independent, and ethical, experts in their fields. These people know that the science is proven. Why do they know it? Not because of their instincts, not because they stick their finger in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing, not because somebody told them; they know it through rigorous research , rigorous analysis, checking their facts, conferring with other scientists—that is how they know it. They provided the former ALP government, the 43th Parliament, with recommendations and guidance—and with evidence, Mr Abbott and the coalition government, not instincts, but real evidence—and provided expert advice to allow the Australian government to set up effective climate change mitigation initiatives, and not an unsupported direct action policy.


The coalition government is attempting to hoodwink the Australian public and shut down credible authorities, such as the Climate Change Authority. This government is more and more lining up with the climate change deniers, ignoring transparent and independent information that goes against their political wants and against the political outcomes that they want. Australia was such a leader of positive reforms in the past, and it was a leader with our current climate change legislation. But now under the Abbott government we are embarrassing ourselves internationally. Do we really want to line up with the likes of Monckton, who says:


Science should only be practised by people who adhere to a religion, preferably of the Christian variety.


Or there is this one from Monckton again, who says:


The world's climate scientists and advocates for action are just trying to ""stamp out democracy"".


Is that what the coalition is trying to do in lining up with the likes of Monckton—to 'stamp out democracy'?


Or what about this one from Monckton:


Young climate change campaigners are like the ""Hitler youth"".


Monckton goes on and has a go at one of our credible scientists, saying:


Professor Ross Garnaut's views on climate change are ""fascist"".


And there is last one, perhaps the best:


Climate change scientists should be prosecuted and locked up 


The sorts of instincts that the coalition government are lining up behind are the views of the likes of Monckton. This government must separate this bill from the wider carbon tax debate, just as Labor has done—and we got a lot of criticism from Senator Abetz as to why we would want to separate these bills. We want to separate them out because we want Australian voters to know that this government wants to shut down a credible organisation, a credible, factual, well-resourced organisation with an expert management board, the Climate Change Authority. Why? Because it might not always agree with what the government is saying.


But we want to assess the Climate Change Authority on its merits and we want to assess the merits of the abolition bill that is before us. Leave aside differences on the views of carbon pricing, forget about the 'carbon tax', as nobody campaigned to keep it, and tell us and the Australian people why you want to ignore the Climate Change Authority, an authority which provides bipartisan and transparent information to government.


The campaign by this coalition government of shutting down credible scientists and climate change organisations started with the firing of the former Secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Blair Comley, who dared to be more honest about the state of climate change than the coalition was willing to accept. They do not want frank advice; they tell us that they can get the advice elsewhere. But departments are not best placed to give free and fearless advice; independent bodies are best placed to do that. But this government does not want any expert to advise on Australia's international targets.


The Climate Change Authority said in their October draft report that Australia should aim for a 15 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. The CCA believe that leaving our emissions target at its current level will prove to be inadequate into the future. This is an example of the Climate Change Authority's frank and fearless advice. Repealing the legislation and abolishing the Climate Change Authority is a demonstration of the government completely disregarding this information. The establishment of an independent Climate Change Authority to advise on the operation of a carbon pricing scheme or a direct action scheme is critical but, again, this government wants to go backwards and turn back the clock with no assessment of whether the authority is good, bad or indifferent, and with no transparency. It is a case of: let us just get on and continue to try to hoodwink people, as this government continues to rely on instincts and not facts and not scientific evidence. I do not support the abolition of the Climate Change Authority.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:20):  It is a great shame that we have to speak to this matter today in the chamber, but there are many issues that seem to be confronting us with this new government that seek to undo the visionary work and to pull apart things that were established during the 43rd Parliament for the greater good of this community and, certainly in the long term, with a vision for all Australians, not just an expeditious view of the moment but a proper, mature and adult view of our responsibility to the future.


In 1990, an aspiring environmental lawyer by the name of Greg Hunt put the finishing touches to his honours thesis. It was titled A carbon tax to make the polluter pay and its conclusion was to propose the wide use of pollution taxes as a means of both raising revenue for environmental agencies and compelling polluters to decrease their emissions. Oh how the mighty ideals have fallen. 


While the coalition pretend their farce of a policy that is Direct Action is a 'no regrets' solution, we all know that they are kidding themselves. Deep down there is at least one of them who must regret it—the minister for Wikipedia himself. It is rumoured that on the particularly quiet nights in Canberra you can hear him crying, overcome by the shame of his complete about-face. Day in, day out he tries to sell a policy designed by a Prime Minister who is on the record as describing climate change as 'absolute crap'. It is enough to drive one to tears. The very fact that the minister put in charge of dismantling Labor's market-based solution wrote an honours thesis advocating for one exposes this government's climate change policy as a sham.


The government is deceiving the Australian people on climate change. It is deceiving this parliament and it is also clearly deceiving itself. Action on climate change requires a market-based solution, and Labor's emissions trading scheme is certainly the most effective means of delivering it. Business knows it, the public knows it and—though he is loath to admit it—the environment minister himself knows it.


So I call on the coalition: if you really want to stop the waste, stop wasting this parliament's time by moving to repeal the most effective means of reducing carbon emissions. The coalition would do well to work with Labor—the real adults in the room—to move from a fixed price to an ETS by 1 July 2014. Future generations will not look kindly on this coalition government for dismantling our nation's commitment to develop a sustainable economy through market-based solutions, especially when its alleged policy alternative is nothing more than a glint in the environment minister's eye. It is a 'trust me' stance from someone who cannot even be trusted to stand by his very own words.


We have already seen on display in this parliament the fact that the government does have a trust deficit. They promised to stop the boats and buy the boats, but all they have done is hide the boats. They promised to end the waste, but instead they have spent close to $1 billion extra each week since coming to office and have removed all parliamentary oversight of how much more they can spend. There is no limit on their credit card now—so much for a budget emergency. 


They promised that Australia was open for business, but instead they have blocked investment into the struggling GrainCorp and left Qantas and Holden flapping in the breeze. While I am sure that Qantas appreciates the airfares for Mr Abbott's flight to Johannesburg, it is not exactly going to cover the hundreds of millions of dollars shortfall in revenue or make up for the coalition's inaction.


For a government that promised to be the adults in the room, they are certainly acting like toddlers in the midst of a tantrum. The coalition's economic impotence has been on prominent display during its short time in office, and it is on display again here today in their efforts to replace Labor's comprehensive market-based solution with their own 'watch this space' command and control, white elephant Direct Action policy. It is laughable to think the coalition is demanding the repeal of Labor's solution to climate change with nothing more than a thought bubble as an alternative. No green paper, no white paper—nothing. Just, 'Trust us. We know what we're doing.' 


But here we are, nonetheless, at this point. Labor has separated the government's legislation to give the coalition a chance to recover at least a shred of credibility on climate change by retaining the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority. We do so because the nation demands action on climate change, and the initiatives of the CEFC and the CCA, though complementary to it, are not bound by the retention of a price on carbon.


I just want to put on the record some of the commentary that came out of the very short Senate hearing into the CEFC to make this point even more clearly. 'Rather than ''crowding out'' the private sector, the CEFC was ''crowding in'' banks that would not otherwise lend'. These were the words reported by Peter Hannam in his article 'Victim of a changed climate' in the Sydney Morning Heraldon 30 November. Jillian Broadbent, who is the chair of the CEFC, said to the committee, 'When you have a $10 billion fund, you can … have a discussion with the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank. If you did not have a $10 billion fund … you were just there to have a powwow.' That is the impact of having the CEFC. Similarly, to show how short-sighted this current Liberal government is, I want to put on the record John Hewson's view that the scrapping of the CEFC, along with the carbon price, was merely short-term politics. He says, 'It's not necessarily an economic or business position. It's a political position.' And it is a very bad political position. 


I do not think that Jillian Broadbent could be declared as a great friend of Labor. Her role is as a specialist consultant for the Anglo-South African investment bank, Investec, and she actually said, 'I think we probably all know more Liberal Party people than we do Labor people,' when she was speaking to the Senate inquiry. She also made this statement, which I think is absolutely telling: 'If the bipartisan mood existed, everyone would be very excited about what the CEFC was doing.'


The problem is not with the CEFC or with the CCA. The problem is with the bloody-mindedness, the ideological bent, the denial of fact and the absence of a care for the future that is on show, with shame, for all to see in the legislation that is being pushed through this parliament by this shameful government that we are having to call to account today. The CEFC was doing its job of providing low-cost capital to stimulate investment in emission reduction, and the CCA needs to continue to do its job of providing independent advice to the government on the best climate change mitigation initiatives. You would think these two issues alone would easily garner bipartisan support but, as is too often the case with the Abbott coalition, you would  be wrong. Put simply, this is not a government that sees climate change as a threat. It is not even a government that accepts the science of climate change, as my colleague in the Senate, Senator Lines, has just made so clearly evident in her speech. This government appears wilfully oblivious to the fact that consensus among climate scientists now is at 97 per cent. I do not know about you, Madam Acting Deputy President, but when I took home a test, having got 97 per cent on it, I used to be reasonably happy. I did get upset occasionally when I would get the reply, 'But what happened to the other three per cent?' There is a difference being on the 97 per cent side of the equation and deciding, as a government of a sovereign nation, to line up with the three per centers. There is something terribly wrong.


In 2009, the coalition walked away from climate change by electing a climate change sceptic leader, who is on the record saying he is 'hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change'. That was on the 7:30 Report on the ABC. Needless to say, it leaves little hope that this parliament can reach a bipartisan consensus when the coalition is led by someone who seems to have wandered far away from the truth and has perhaps just departed a flat earth society convention.


The Climate Change Authority's brief, to provide expert independent advice on climate change mitigation initiatives, is hardly revolutionary stuff. Labor set up the authority to ensure both the government of the day as well as the Australian public have the most comprehensive advice on how to expand Australia's renewable energy industry. It is chaired by a very reputable person, the former head of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, and it has a board of considerable expertise, consisting of highly qualified scientists—including Australia's Chief Scientist, Ian Chubb—economists, academics and professionals—just as the Australian people would expect: the most celebrated in the land gathered together to help us face the most significant challenges of our time. As a statutory body at arm's length from government, the CCA is able to provide an important independent voice to assist Australia's actions to mitigate the effects of climate change, without fear or favour.


But, perhaps, that is where the real problem lies for the Abbott coalition, because we have seen already this is a government addicted to secrecy and intrigue and seemingly obsessed with abolishing sources of independent advice which they cannot tamper with, distort or intimidate before they give their advice. Indeed, the government's first act in office was to sack senior public servants who had the temerity to do their job—that is, to provide frank and fearless advice for the government of the day. Sacking departmental heads Andrew Metcalfe, Don Russell and Blair Comley—as well as giving marching orders to Martin Parkinson from next year—clearly demonstrates the exact value the government places on frank and fearless advice. That is clearly none. What a dangerous stance to take—a government that refutes science, rails against fact and ignores or dismisses independent advice.


The Abbott coalition is trying to intimidate public servants and entire departments into submission. They do not want independent advice; they want an echo chamber. Greg Hunt is on the record stating his desired avenues for advice are from august bodies: the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and the environment department. But these are all bodies which are subject to government funding. Under the government's plan, they can censor, bury and distort findings from these departments at will. They have already gutted the funding for the CSIRO in a clumsy and very short-sighted effort to disrupt the work of some of our top scientists who are in the midst of producing critical research to benefit the nation. How can public servants at the environment department and the Bureau of Meteorology keep the public properly informed when their jobs are under constant threat from a government that seeks to remove anyone who dares to hold them to account?


The Abbott coalition has already dismantled the Climate Commission and is now going for the last body which still has the ability to publish independent advice, all because they do not like the headlines generated by its findings. This is the Abbott carbon con—dismantle the bodies that provide independent advice and smother all departmental advice before it sees the light of day. And it is not just departments. We have seen recently on display the coalition, in conjunction with sections of the press, running a campaign of intimidation against the independent national broadcaster, the ABC, for daring to publish reports that Australia spied on Indonesia. From the Prime Minister down, the coalition has criticised the ABC, with government ministers calling for its privatisation, break-up or funding to be cut—all for fulfilling its public duty of informing the public. Clearly they are not content with censoring the Public Service; they want to censor the press as well.


But, of course, when we take more than a moment to assess what passes as climate change policy in today's coalition, you can almost pity the government for wanting to hide its shame. A Fairfax Media survey of 35 economists found that only two economists supported the coalition's Direct Action plan—that is a fail on anybody's watch—and one of those was a self-declared climate change sceptic. Australian economist Professor Justin Wolfers, of the Brookings Institution in Washington and the University of Michigan, said:


Direct Action would involve more economic disruption and have less environmental payoff than a trading scheme—


BT Financial's Chris Caton added:


Any economist who did not opt for emissions trading should hand their degree back—


so clear is his message about how wrong the Direct Action policy is! The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found:


Emissions trading systems provided the lowest cost for reducing carbon pollution among the different approaches available—


But what would the OECD know by comparison to this government, who know everything, are the font of all wisdom and are not in need of independent frank or fearless advice as they have got it all figured out so we should just trust them! Somehow that does not ring true. Another claim from the OECD saw it dismissing Direct Action as a policy that 'entails higher costs to society per tonne of carbon dioxide abated—in many cases, substantially higher'.


The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group have also both questioned the viability of the direct action scheme. It is getting to the point where you have to think that they are very brave to even speak up and say anything at all in opposition to this new rule of government that we are seeing. The Ai Group bravely states that the direct action policy is 'unlikely to produce any meaningful reduction in carbon emissions'. And I suppose that is okay if you are not here to do meaningful things. If you are here to play the game of being in power, that perhaps is an explanation of why you might follow the path of direct action. The Business Council of Australia says that 'direct action is likely to put a very high impost on Australian taxpayers'. That is very concerning. That is intolerable—that is, not only pulling apart well-informed policy, agreed policy by experts, but to also put a burden on Australian taxpayers.


In the muddy mess that is the coalition's Direct Action Plan there is only one thing that is clear: it clearly fails even the most cursory of inquiries. By the government's own admission, direct action is a command-and-control scheme that places the government front and centre. Greg Hunt is on the record stating:


The Government will simply buy back the lowest cost abatement instead of having to tax the whole economy.


And Tony Abbott claims direct action will operate as:


… a fund enabling the government to buy the most cost effective means of reducing emissions through a tender process.


The Liberal Party, the self-proclaimed party of capital, has lost the economic plot.


When one considers the coalition's direct action absurdity, comments made by Malcolm Turnbull come to mind.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! I remind you to address members in the other place by their correct titles.




Senator O'NEILL:
  The member for Wentworth comes to mind:


… we know that picking winners is hard enough for the private sector, and well nigh impossible for the public sector. We know that when tax revenues are handed out to one firm or industry they come at the expense of all the other firms and families that paid that tax.


With direct action, the Abbott coalition is going to attempt to pick winners. It is paying a subsidy to its most preferred polluters at the taxpayers' expense, all at an extravagant cost for no meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. It is game-playing of the most dangerous kind—that is, with the future of this country. In so doing, the Liberal Party is abandoning any credible claim as the party of capital; it is now, very clearly, the party of economic vandalism.


Stewardship of our great nation requires governments to have the vision to deliver policies that ensure our way of life is sustainable. From my home on the Central Coast, I can see the ocean as I look up towards Newcastle and down the coast to North Head. I cannot help but take in the sheer beauty of my surrounds. In this, I am sure I am joined by hundreds of thousands of residents who also call these places home, places that are at risk from climate change. Increased temperatures will alter our landscape and our natural environment and impact on our flora and fauna.


Considering the Abbott coalition's approach to climate change, it is little wonder it has systematically moved to close down, censor or intimidate independent sources of advice and information. This is at the heart of its decision to abolish the Climate Commission and to shut down the Climate Change Authority. Labor will vote against this shambolic policy, and we will not allow the coalition to silence expert advice— (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:41):  I indicate my opposition to the government policy in relation to the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. What you have to understand, when you look at this little part of the coalition's anti-climate-change policy, is that this is about government secrecy. This is about ensuring that there is no independent authority having a look at the shambles of a policy called direct action—the policy that would require twice the area of Victoria to be planted out with trees to gain some of the climate CO2 reduction that they claim they will achieve. It is about ensuring that that short-term policy, which has been roundly criticised from within the coalition as well as externally both by scientists and by economists, hides the incompetent development of this policy and the incompetence of the policy itself. It is about trying to shut down critiques. It is about saying on the one hand, 'We are about small government, we are about ensuring that the country gets value for money, we want a smaller bureaucracy', but on the other hand, because they were in trouble with the climate change policies, having to then establish a bureaucracy to hand out grants to polluters in this country.


The reason for this bill is the ongoing secrecy that just completely envelopes this poor, incompetent government. It is saying: 'We do not want the public to know how incompetent we are in delivering this policy, how incompetent the policy is itself. Therefore, we will not have any analysis; we will not have any independent critique. We will have public servants out there arguing the government's position, and we will then describe them as the experts in this area.'


We all know how that works in Canada, where the scientists have been closed down. The scientists have not been allowed by conservative governments in Canada to make any critiques of the Canadian government's position on climate change policy. They must clear every public statement through the Canadian minister. And who was one of the first governments that the Abbott coalition cosied up to? The Canadian government. You can just imagine the two conservative leaders sitting around a table, exchanging views on how you close down economic and scientific critiques of government policy; and the Canadian government telling the Liberal coalition here that you shut them down by making sure that a public servant cannot speak out on the environment, cannot speak out on science and cannot speak out for the public good.


So that is what the alternative is. There is no alternative to the Climate Change Authority being an independent authority and actually analysing what is going on. The alternative is the Canadian model, and that is the model that the coalition government will try to implement—a model that is about secrecy and closing down analysis, closing down scientific critiques and closing down any advice to the public that does not match what this incompetent government wants to put out to the public.


We have had only a short period of this government. I have to say that, if ever a honeymoon period came to a shuddering halt, it was with this coalition government. The public know they cannot trust the coalition: they cannot trust the coalition to look after them when they are in trouble; they cannot trust the coalition to look after the public good when they are facing bushfires in the Blue Mountains; and they cannot trust this government to provide proper support to communities in trouble. That is the short-term approach of the government.


In the longer term, dealing with climate change and carbon pollution, this government cannot be trusted either, because this government is prepared to push the science aside, push the economics aside, come up with some stunt labelled 'direct action' and try to perpetrate a con job on the Australian public. The Australian public are onto this government. They have never been onto a government so quick as they have been onto this government. They understand that the government is incompetent. They understand that the government is untrustworthy. They understand that the government has got no policies in a whole range of areas. They now know that it has to set up 50 inquiries to try to develop some semblance of a government program moving forward, because there were no government programs in place other than three-line slogans on issues that are really about short-term political advantage and not the national interest.


You see it writ large by this government day in and day out. Abolishing the Climate Change Authority so they can maintain their secrecy and antiscientific approach is just one of the ways that they deal with this. Let us look at them on education. How incompetent has any government been in this country? Talk about a double backflip with a pike. The coalition government have invented a new high-diving manoeuvre. I do not think anyone has ever seen contortions like the contortions of the coalition on this issue.


It is no wonder that the Australian public are going: 'We've been conned. We've been absolutely conned by this conservative government. They told us they would do all these things and, after they came to power, the issues that are important for the Australian nation are ignored and the issues that are pushed are part of the ideological agenda of the extreme right wing of the coalition, who don't believe in climate change, who don't believe in scientific endeavour, who don't believe in proper economics and who at one stage were talking about the market being the way forward.' The market is only the way forward for the coalition when it suits big business, but the market is not the way forward when it comes to trying to deal with climate change. 


In fact, what the coalition want to do is put their hand in every person's pocket in this country—they want to take money out of your pockets—and hand it over to their big business mates, who are busily polluting this country with CO2. That is what direct action is about: them putting their hand in your pocket, handing the money over to big business and pretending that that is what is going to deal with the climate change challenges for this country.


We know that every economist of any standing—other than the pet economists, the tame economists, of the coalition—says that you need to put a price on carbon to deal with CO2 pollution not only here but around the world. That is why there are states in the United States that are picking up carbon pollution programs that deal with it through a market based system. They are putting a price on carbon. There is a price on carbon going in China. There is a price on carbon in the UK. There is a price on carbon in Europe. Why do they do that? They do that because they understand that, if you want to leave your economy dragging behind the rest of the world, you will not deal with carbon pollution, you will not have your industries adjust to a low-carbon economy and you will not create the new jobs that are demanded by a low-carbon economy. That is the problem we have with this coalition. They are not looking forward. It is about short-term political advantage pitted against the long-term economic reality of what is needed for a strong economy for the future. They deny the economics and the environmental science. 


So we have a situation here where the government are untrustworthy and incompetent. They would rather see this economy stay in the past. They would rather see this economy not move forward while other economies are developing the technology and the jobs of the future, based on a low-carbon-footprint economy. And what are we going to have? We are going to have this nonsense called Direct Action that even the coalition members with any honesty recognise will never deliver for this country. The coalition are prepared to sacrifice future generations for their short-term political gain. They are prepared to sacrifice future generations to make sure that their electoral funds keep coming in from the mining companies and the power companies around this country—because that is what is driving it: their short-term political gain, the money that is pouring into them from the big business end of town, who do not want to have to address climate change. It is all about them. It is nothing about this nation. It is nothing about the economy.


You can see that clearly when you look at the position that the government have adopted on a range of major challenges, not just climate change and not just making sure that we are an economy for the future. In the car industry, it is their ideological bent that is driving their position. They do not like unionised, high-paid workers. So what do they do? They actually dare Holden, GMH, to leave the country. Day in, day out, they are goading one of the biggest employers in the country to pack up and go home. I do not know how that is in the national interest. I do not know how that can be seen to be a competent approach. It is simply being driven by the ideology of the coalition. They do not like unions. They do not believe in climate change. They do not want working people to get a fair go. They really would like to go back to Work Choices in industrial relations. We know that. They have reintroduced the ABCC, with draconian powers against workers. This is a government that is driven by ideological hatred. It is not driven by what is good for the country; it is driven by ideology.


When people have recognised that, they have turned off very quickly, because you cannot trust the coalition. They are secretive, they do not want any accountability and they are prepared to do whatever they can to make sure that short-term politics drives their agenda. You see it every day in here. It is about short termism. It has got nothing to do with the future of this country. You see weak, sycophantic coalition members not prepared to stand up for their communities if there is a bushfire, not prepared to stand up for their communities when jobs are going to be destroyed. They are the weakest, most sycophantic backbench I have ever seen in this place. They will not stand up for their communities, they will not stand up for jobs, they will not stand up for the environment and they will not stand up for future generations. They are really a weird mob. They have got no values and no principles and they are prepared to drag this economy down if it means that they can go on some talkback show and get a pat on the back from Alan Jones or Andrew Bolt. That is what they are all about. They are going for a view that we should simply be a backward economy, with a backward government. This is the most backward government we have ever seen.


Governments fight hard to make changes. We say we want a fair go for the public school system in this country. What do the government do? Apart from setting about to destroy our environmental agenda, an agenda that is important for the long term, they say that, if you are a child of a rich person in this country then you will get looked after, you can go to a rich school and they will keep pouring money in there, but, if you go to a school in Penrith or you go to a school in the Blue Mountains or you go to a public school in Windsor, where I live—




Senator Bushby:
  What about Queensland? 




Senator CAMERON:
  I can understand why the Tasmanians are getting a bit agitated about this, because the Tasmanians are the ones that have got probably the weakest backbench in here. They will not stand up for Tasmania, will not stand up to get a fair go from the federal government. They capitulate—from the leader in here to Senator Bushby. They are vacillating, weak backbenchers, with absolutely no interest in what is here for the future. So what they are prepared to do, if, for example, it is a bushfire in the Blue Mountains, is to say, effectively, 'Never mind getting the same rights for the community in the Blue Mountains; we will give you government spin. We will put the government before the community.' It does not matter if it is jobs in the car industry: 'We will put the government before car industry workers.'




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Cameron, I remind you that, under standing order 193, imputation of improper motives to members is inappropriate.




Senator CAMERON:
  What are the improper motives? What does that mean?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  About the motives for their actions. Continue, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Well, I think you need to read it carefully, Chair. The actions are clear from the coalition. They do not care about their local communities. They do not care about the education system. They do not care about the climate. They do not care about anything else other than themselves. As long as the money is pouring in from Gina Rinehart and Twiggy Forrest to make sure that their election coffers are kept well and truly balanced, then they do not care about anyone else. It does not matter if you have leaky roofs in the schools in Penrith. It does not matter if you do not have decent conditions in schools in Penrith; as long as the money goes to the private school system, they are happy. So we know what they are all about: they are all about looking after the big end of town, not anyone else.


That is why they want to get rid of the Climate Change Authority. That would be a check and balance on this terrible government the community has already said is no good, on a government that is one of the poorest ever to start off in this country. The public are onto them and onto them early. All these policies they said they would deliver are not going to be delivered unless it means crashing jobs for unionised workers in the car industry, unless it means destroying the environment for their short-term political gain. That is what they are about. They are the most hopeless government that has ever come in here. They have had the shortest honeymoon period of any government in the history of this country. They want to destroy the environment for the sake of their mates in big business. They have no capacity to stand up for the local communities. They have no capacity to stand up to big business. They will continue to run a position here that is economically illiterate and environmental vandalism. So I take the view that, the sooner we get to the next election and the sooner you lot are gone, the better, because that is in the interests of this country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:01):  I rise to contribute to this Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013 debate. Like my colleague Senator Cameron, I do so with a sense of frustration and anger at the thought that, through no other reason than an ideological obsession and political point-making exercise of the coalition, the Abbott government is attempting to undo the architecture that has been put in place around climate change and carbon pricing in this country. That ideology is not based on science or economics and, further, is damaging our reputation as an international player on climate change policy in the world.


It is that issue that I would like to first draw upon. The Climate Change Authority has provided high-quality, independent advice since its establishment in 2012 using expert scientists and economists in the domestic and international arenas. The Climate Change Authority has been referred to as similar to the Committee on Climate Change in the UK—something which is an independent statutory body established by the UK and had its stated purpose, similarly, to advise the UK government and its devolved administrations on emissions targets and report to parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. That is very similar to the role that the Climate Change Authority has been carrying out. It has been providing vitally important information for tackling climate change and accelerating the roll-out of clean-energy jobs and clean energy itself in Australia.


But already we know that the coalition has abolished the climate commission. It has already, as we know, attempted to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Now it is attempting to abolish the Climate Change Authority.


As I said, like the UK, this organisation is set up independently to provide expert advice about emissions reductions targets and the scope for ongoing emissions reductions in Australia. We know the international community is watching Australia, and has been watching very closely since 7 September, because of this fixation of the new government on repealing all the climate change architecture that was put in place by the former Labor government under the stewardship of the then minister, Greg Combet. They are watching because Australia will soon take over the leadership of the G20 and, when it does that, it has the ability to have strong and effective action in its leadership role against the issues of ongoing emissions, global issues of climate change and the like. So countries are recognising that Australia is going to take over that leadership role and are concerned that their hopes of any kind of strong and effective action on climate change will not be there under Australia's leadership, will be incredibly diminished under Australia's leadership as opposed to the position Australia took to the various international fora on climate change it participated in during the last government.


Despite that, of course, Prime Minister Tony Abbott apparently does accept that climate change is happening. I think he said as much in a recent press conference in November. He said he accepts climate change is happening and humans are contributing to it. So, if the Prime Minister can say clearly now that he has been converted into this space that says climate change is happening—and I have to say I am pleased he has—then surely he needs to recognise that, in being the leader at the G20, he needs to take strong and effective action on climate change. If the coalition and the Prime Minister think Direct Action policy—which is the only thing they still have lingering somewhere on the table; it might be under a few documents and books, but I think it is still there as a coalition policy—is strong and effective action to take to the G20 table when we take over that leadership role, I think that the Prime Minister would be laughed out of the room, quite frankly.


There are already scientists, economists and a lot of independent think tank contributors in this space, who probably know a hell of a lot more than many of us here, coming out very clearly and saying that the coalition's Direct Action policy is simply not going to do anything near being effective or providing strong action on climate change. Many economists and scientists for some time now have been telling the coalition that their Direct Action policy is not good enough. They have been telling the coalition that an emissions trading scheme is the most efficient and effective way to tackle climate change, and in fact we know that there are members of the coalition government who think so themselves. Yet the coalition will continue to believe that Direct Action will be the best way forward, despite those economists and those scientists saying that Direct Action will not work.


The other very disappointing part of where we find ourselves with this bill before us is that it also shows that the coalition not only want to repeal the various parts of the architecture of climate change policy that we have in this country but also are now turning away from any kind of participation in international forums on this issue. I want to raise one particular one which has occurred recently, and that is of course the United Nations climate change talks in Warsaw in Poland. The Australian government was unable to send a ministerial representative to those talks. With negotiations from all over the world taking place in Warsaw, what kind of message does it send to the international community when Australia cannot even send a minister or a parliamentary secretary to those climate change talks? It is snubbing the international community on this issue. We all know that climate change is an international issue. That is why we were playing our part in introducing a climate change policy that included carbon pricing, moving to an emissions trading scheme: so that it would be part of an international economic framework for tackling climate change. Yet here Australia is, not even at the negotiating table. So it is not even that we are repealing the architecture we have; we are even turning our backs on the rest of the international community.


It is simply embarrassing, yet here we will be next year, at the G20, taking over that leadership, with all of those countries being very aware that since this government has come to power we have not participated on the international stage on this issue of climate change. I think that is absolutely appalling and shows how far backwards we have come from where we were prior to 7 September this year. I can only think of what the EU would be thinking of Australia right now. I know that it would not be in a very favourable light on the issue of climate change.


Of course, it is not just economists and scientists who have come out very strongly about Direct Action not working and about an emissions trading scheme being the best way forward for tackling climate change. The chairman of the Climate Change Authority, to the abolition of which this bill pertains, has clearly come out calling on government to retain this independent body and not to abolish the Climate Change Authority. He has challenged some of the arguments put by government—I think by Environment Minister Greg Hunt—on the issue of closing this authority being about reducing bureaucracy and moving climate change advice into either the federal environment department, the CSIRO or the Bureau of Meteorology. He has challenged that, because this was about frank, fearless, good and independent advice coming from an independent body. That is what this authority is still able to provide, and that is what the Australian government will be giving up if they abolish it. I quote from the Chairman, Mr Bernie Fraser, who says:


On a subject as complex as climate change, I would have thought every government—whatever its complexion—would want to get good independent advice … I find it a bit frustrating this opportunity … seems to be foreclosing a bit with the present government. I think that's a disappointment.


That is very much a disappointment and it is very similar to what we heard from the chairwoman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who similarly made an appeal to government to not axe the CEFC. So you have very respected, intelligent, well-known people in this climate change space in very important roles as chairpersons both pleading to government not to undo some of this architecture of climate change policy.


The comments by Minister Greg Hunt in relation to abolishing the Climate Change Authority and having the ability to get that same advice from inside bureaucracy from the CSIRO is quite bizarre because it was not long ago that this government was announcing cuts to the CSIRO. Not only is it expecting public servants to give independent advice but it is also asking for that advice from a body of the public service that has recently had an announcement of job cuts. That shows again that this government has certainly still got its training wheels on. I do not think those training wheels are going to come off for a very long time. In fact, I think more training wheels will need to be added.


When we talk about climate change policy, this government is all over the place. It is stuck and hell-bent on this ideology that it is against carbon pricing, that it is not going to have anything to do with being an effective leader on climate change policy. It is stuck on that approach. Despite the economists, despite the scientists it continues to trot out this mantra. Yet we know very well that there are key members of this government, some of whom are around that cabinet table, that were once very much for an emissions trading scheme, just like their then leader, Prime Minister John Howard.


It was actually the Howard government—the only thing I would give credit to the Howard government for—that had the foresight to look ahead and think, 'We need to be a part of this international fray. We need to act on climate change and the best way to do that is through the introduction of an emissions trading scheme.' Key members of this government were part of that belief with then Prime Minister John Howard. They are still there now yet they are continuing day after day to trot out this mantra that they are against pricing carbon, they are against an emissions trading scheme. They want put their heads in the sand into some direct action hole, which leads to nowhere. We have been told it leads to nowhere by the economists and by the scientists. All it does is leave Australia as a laughing stock in the international community. We came so far. We created the architecture for tackling climate change and for doing our bit in the international community. We were ready to start trading permits with the EU and were ready to have an emissions trading scheme, like so many parts of the world have introduced or are introducing. Now we have gone tenfold backwards and it is an embarrassment.


As I said at the outset, when we do take that leadership position at the G20 next year, it will all come to the fore that Australia's leadership will be lacking on climate change. This very serious issue has overwhelming evidence and the global issue of climate change needs to be taken seriously by our generation for the next generation and so on. That leadership will be lacking at the head of the G20 table by Australia and that is a sheer embarrassment.


There is time for this government to reflect upon what it has done, to move from its fixated ideology and recognise it needs to play a role in effective and strong leadership action on climate change. That action of course is not Direct Action. Direct Action is going nowhere and it is not just me saying this. So many independent thinkers in the community are saying this.


The Climate Change Authority acts very similarly to the UK's committee on climate change, which has also been providing independent advice on the issue of emissions reduction. To abolish this authority would be another step backwards, just as it was a step backwards to abolish the Climate Change Commission and just as it was a step backwards to attempt to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We need the architecture that we have in place on climate change so that we can play our part in the international community and, ultimately, reduce carbon emissions in this country.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-12-11,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:21):  As you are aware, Acting Deputy President Fawcett, you were on the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee which held an inquiry into this very piece of legislation, the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. Senator Singh said, 'Yes we need international action.' That is exactly right. I wonder if Senator Singh can recall a former Prime Minister, Mr Kevin Rudd, just before the election, saying the carbon tax is costing people, is adding to the cost of living and is adding to the cost of doing business. He was correct.


You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, that during the inquiry the National Farmers Federation said that the carbon tax was costing the average farm in Australia about $10,000, yet farmers have to compete in international markets where many—even most—have nowhere near that cost put on them for any climate change action. The dairy industry, which is competing in a domestic dollar-a-litre-for-milk war, is hurting financially and trying to survive. The truckies—the very people who literally carry our nation and transport everything from exports to the waterfront to supplies to our country towns around our nation—were going to be hit with another $515 million diesel tax on their diesel fuel under the former government's proposal. This was to occur just as the trucking industry introduced the Euro 4 and Euro 5 motors, which are far cleaner than, for example, the older Detroit diesels and the 14-litre Cummins I used to drive many years ago. 


Then there is the refrigeration gas. This is amazing! An IGA owner in Central West New South Wales had a gas leak in his large refrigerator. He had to put 65 kilos of refrigerant gas back into it. Instead of costing him $26 a kilo, it cost him $150 a kilo. Instead of costing him around $1,650, it cost him $9,750. It cost him $8,000 more to top up the refrigerant gas after fixing the leak in his refrigeration system. I wonder who pays that $8,000? Of course it goes onto the price of the foods and groceries he sells, and the consumers pay for it.


The cement industry is another industry that was hit very hard. We run the risk of shutting down our industries in Australia and see them moving to places like China where they emit more CO2 when they process cement. The current scheme is not working.


I was not amazed to read the column by Samantha Maiden in Sunday's paper, which said that we have virtually had no reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in Australia. In fact, the committee heard that the forecast of around 580 million tonnes of CO2 a year will rise to in excess of 620 million tonnes by the year 2020. There is no reduction. It will just go into the world scheme of emission trading where we will buy about $3.5 billion worth of permits from overseas, from countries who may well defraud and commit fraud in setting up their so-called carbon credits.


We have the Department of Environment and, of course, it will remain. We have the CSIRO and we have the Bureau of Meteorology. We do not need this organisation, which is simply another cost to the taxpayers of Australia, especially businesses. I go back to Samantha Maiden's comments on Sunday that since the carbon tax was introduced—the tax that we were never going to have according to the commitment by former Prime Minister Ms Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Mr Wayne Swan—it has cost $24,000 per tonne of CO2 abatement. That is what it has cost the people of Australia and the industries of Australia.


We now have all of these troubles with the motor vehicle industry. The cost to them and to industry everywhere is unfair. It is currently at $24.15 a tonne, which is the most expensive carbon tax in the world. As I said, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd admitted that in run-up to the 7 September election. He said, 'The carbon tax has got to go. Let's have a cheaper emissions trading scheme for a little while until it goes up to a projected $38 a tonne by the year 2020.' Since the previous government, under pressure from the Greens and Independents Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor, introduced a scheme that is not working, it has cost Australian business and the Australian people $24,000 a tonne. It is not getting rid of CO2 emissions; it is getting rid of jobs. That is all that it is doing.


As I said thousands of times, the Australian people were quite clear about how they voted on 7 September and what our policies were. One policy was to abolish the carbon tax, and another was to abolish the mining tax. That is exactly what will happen. We will go back to the people if it does not. So come to accept that the carbon tax is not working, is a cost on our nation and our businesses, is transferring business and jobs overseas, is having no effect in Australia and is hugely expensive. That is why this bill that we are debating now is part of the carbon tax abolition policies that we went to the people with and that they clearly voted for. This was in a case where the Australian Labor Party had its lowest primary vote for 110 years, dating back to 1903. If they are going to stand in the road, the people will decide.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (12:27):  Having listened to the recent contributions of Senator Singh and Senator Williams, I too have decided to make a short contribution to this debate on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. I am very concerned, and I think all senators should be very concerned, that if this bill is passed and if the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill becomes law, it would significantly weaken Australia's ability to understand and tackle climate change.


Of course we need to acknowledge that climate change is a complex issue for all governments. Not just the Australian government, but for the entire international community. It is complex in relation to its environmental aspects. It is complex in relation to its economic aspects, and it is complex in relation to its social aspects. As the scientific case for climate change grows stronger and stronger, so does the importance of taking responsible and effective action to minimise its impacts.


The truth is that the facts are that dealing with climate change is assisted by an agency like the Climate Change Authority, so that all the elements, all the key strands of environmental, planning, economic and social research can be brought together and so that quality, expert advice can be provided to government. The Climate Change Authority should remain to provide the highest quality advice on climate policy, to take into account expert scientific and economic advice and to take into account developments in the international arena. I say that expert advice should be treasured, not junked; climate change policy should be directed by evidence and facts rather than by fear and prejudice and political opportunism.


The Climate Change Authority was designed to take all the short-term, mindless and silly politics out of the climate change debate. In this regard, of course, the Climate Change Authority in Australia has many similarities to the United Kingdom's Committee on Climate Change. I think it is worth the Senate noting that successive British governments, governments of differing political persuasions, have benefited from such advice. Australians, in my view, deserve an approach to tackling climate change that respects the scientific and economic consensus, where facts, not fear, set and drive public policy. Of course, the Climate Change Authority here in Australia is already providing this advice—providing strong advice based on scientific and economic evidence.


Of course, we can acknowledge that it is for government and for the parliament to decide how they might respond to the advice they receive. We all accept that. However, I fear that, without such advice, government strategy and government decision making about climate change will be less than adequate—will be ad hoc and will be uninformed. Of course, I suppose to some extent the risk is that it will be informed, but by focus groups and the ignorant, not by experts. Abolishing the Climate Change Authority is a short-term political gesture that is simply not in the national interest.


It is true, I think, and fair to say, that the Climate Change Authority has a strong record in providing independent, frank and fearless advice to government on a range of critical matters: matters such as Australia's emissions reduction targets and caps for carbon pricing; matters such as progress towards meeting our medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets; matters such as the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System; matters such as carbon farming; and matters such as the renewable energy target. The advice that is provided on these critically important aspects of climate change policy must be based on scientific and economic research and it must be independent, and that is the advice received from the Climate Change Authority. That is the advice; that is its nature. I say that independence is essential.


The Climate Change Authority's board has an excellent scientific, economic, industry and also academic pedigree, making the authority well placed to deliver considered and expert advice to government. We must acknowledge in this debate that the Climate Change Authority uses evidence based policy. The Climate Change Authority is an important tool in the battle to avoid dangerous climate change. It is an important tool for any federal government, whatever its political persuasion, so the government can be assisted in developing and reviewing climate change policies. I say that the Climate Change Authority is the right body to do this job.


I note that the opposition whip in the Senate has a close interest in this, so much so that she is waving her hands. Were you waving them at me? It is rare in the chamber, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, to have such a level of support that the opposition whip would enter the chamber and wave her hands in support of a speaker. I suspect even Senator Williams and Senator McKenzie have never seen such extraordinary support provided by the whip of any major political party to a mere humble backbencher on his feet in a debate like this. I am really knocked over by that level of support.




Senator Williams:
  Flattery is the word.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I am flattered. Flattery, as you know, Senator Williams, will get you everywhere in politics. 


Getting rid of the Climate Change Authority would mean that Australia would no longer be taking the battle against climate change seriously. It is as simple as that. Despite the scepticism of some, the reason temperatures are rising is not an issue of serious debate. As I have on so many occasions now over many years, I want to stress the issue of climate change science, because the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that human activity is the principal cause of climate change. The evidence is in: humans are responsible for climate change. The evidence is compelling, it is unequivocal and it is growing. 


I know that there are some who wish to argue a different position. I accept that opponents of the scientific basis of climate change are entitled to their view, but I do not expect such views to be taken seriously, because global warming is not a giant conspiracy. It is not an abstract theory, but part of a new reality that we all face—that Australia faces; that every nation in the world faces. As I say, I have spoken for many years now on many occasions about the science of climate change. It should be a guide to what we do because the science of climate change is becoming surer, not less certain.


I would refer interested senators to the International Panel on Climate Change and its most recent report. I do not want to traverse the ground that I covered in a recent speech in the Senate about that report. Suffice to say the IPCC predicts that if carbon dioxide emissions only increase at the minimal rate, then global average temperature could rise by 0.9 degrees to 2.3 degrees Centigrade by the end of the century. But, if the worst-case scenario is met, this could be as much as 3.2 to 5.4 degrees Centigrade. 


Let's look at our most recent experiences in Australia—not what might happen, but what actually has happened. Australia has just experienced its warmest September ever; its hottest summer day on record, 7 January 2013; its warmest winter day on record, 31 August 2013. And this year, 2013, is on track to be the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization, all the warmest years across the planet have occurred since 1998. Even the coldest years are warmer than anything before 1998. This means we are committed to a warmer future—so you better get used to it. These numbers cannot be fudged, they cannot be spun, and nor should anybody try to do so. Increasing average temperatures is affecting human health; it affects animals, it affects plants, it affects agriculture, it affects industry—it affects so many parts of our lives. It is also having knock-on effects on the weather, as we know, with a warming ocean increasing the intensity of storms and melting the polar icecaps.


Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. So I say yet again: it is crucial that we focus on the science of climate change and that we consider the most efficient methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To do this Australia needs long-term bipartisan strategies in place, based on expert advice, so it is so short-sighted to abolish the Climate Change Authority. That is why the opposition opposes the legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-12-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:06):  I was speaking to this motion when the Senate adjourned last night, and I was indicating that I will be one of the few government speakers on this debate. We are trying to get this bill to a vote. It is part of the election commitment made by the coalition. It was an election commitment which was warmly endorsed by a clear majority of all Australians. I cannot understand the Labor Party, in particular, opposing it. I can understand the Greens opposing it, because the Greens are rabid when it comes to anything to do with their favourite project of inflicting on Australia the carbon tax and all the paraphernalia around the Climate Change Authority that this bill seeks to abolish.


The Labor Party should understand the voice of the people. There can be no misunderstanding: as Tony Abbott said many, many a time, the last election was to be a referendum on the carbon tax. The people of Australia spoke very, very clearly on what they wanted to do with the carbon tax. They wanted it abolished. Why? Because they, like me, realised that having the world's largest carbon tax does not save the planet, it does nothing at all to reduce carbon emissions around the world. In fact I emphasised, when I spoke before, that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. If, with this carbon tax, we do reduce our emissions by five per cent, which is the goal, then five per cent of 1.4 per cent is not going to make any difference whatsoever, not one iota of difference, to the changing climate of the world if man's emission of carbon is the cause of that.


Before my opponents malign me and keep saying that I do not believe in climate change, I repeat, for probably the 500th time in this chamber, that I do acknowledge climate change; of course the climate is changing. We were once covered with ice. Once upon a time the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Of course the climate changes. But I get sick of hearing the Greens saying that all of the floods and the cyclones we have seen in recent times are because we did not have a carbon tax early enough. Every time the Greens say, 'Look at these awful floods. They are the worst floods we've ever seen in Australia, in South-East Queensland,' I keep pointing out to them that that is only since 1974. They are not the worst. They are only worse than anything since 1974. There were bigger ones in 1974. I am sure that was climate change that caused them in 1974.


Similarly, Cyclone Yasi up my way was the worst and biggest cyclone we have ever had in Australia—since 1917, when a bigger cyclone struck the coast of North Queensland. It is all relative. The climate does move in cycles and, as someone who lives in the north, I know that cyclones are cyclic. Perhaps that is why they are called 'cyclones'. Every 10 or so years we will get a very severe cyclone. I know in my town of Ayr we had three cyclones in two years back in the late 1960s, I think it was. Fortunately, touch wood, we have not had any since then. We have seen the cyclones come and I regret for the people of Cardwell and Mission Beach that it hit there, but I have to say I was glad that it did not hit my town. 


The point I make is that these things happen. They have always happened. Yet if you took any notice of the Greens—which, fortunately, very few Australians do these days—you would think that all of this was because we did not have a carbon tax early enough. They say, 'We're going to stop Australia's emissions by five per cent'—that is five per cent of the 1.4 per cent—and suddenly that is going to cure every cyclone and every flood in the world. I heard Senator Waters on the radio this morning and learned there is a new reason for climate change, and that is the fact that Mr Hunt has today, fortuitously, given approval for the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion. It is news that I was delighted to hear. At last common-sense has prevailed. Senator Waters even claimed that this decision is going to ruin the Barrier Reef—mind you, if Senator Waters had a look at a map she would see that Abbot Point is a long, long way from the Barrier Reef. According to her, it is going to destroy not only the Barrier Reef and the tourist industry but, from the way Senator Waters was going on, you would think it is going to destroy mankind. But it is also going to cause climate change, according to Senator Waters. These are the sorts of wild accusations you get from the radical environment movement. They have no interest in science and proper process. 


In the case of Abbot Point, the approval is given subject to the most stringent conditions—conditions that have been imposed by scientists and people who understand these issues. You will have the Greens and Greenpeace and everyone protesting. The Greens always love the standard of living that Australia's wealth brings, but they want to stop the process that brings the wealth to Australia. It brings wealth to Australia in a sustainable way that is environmentally conscious. The conditions that Mr Hunt has imposed are pretty stringent. I just hope they do not frighten away the proponents. I am hopeful that those developments will go ahead, because it will mean so much to the people in the small township of Bowen, just south of where I live. I recently attended a seminar in Bowen when the whole town was anxiously awaiting approval for this expansion. There were small business people and people wanting jobs in that area who were desperately keen for a decision to be made. I congratulate Mr Hunt on his decision to proceed with that, and with the Gladstone and Mackay proposals as well.


You will hear a lot from the Greens and the ABC over the next week or so on how this is really going to destroy mankind, but I ask those who might be interested to have a look at the conditions, to understand that these approvals are set with the interests of Australia and Australians in mind. You will hear the Greens saying, 'This will bring so many more ships through the Barrier Reef and that will destroy the Barrier Reef.' I am sorry, but ships have been coming through the Barrier Reef for over a hundred years and any problems that the Barrier Reef has have not been caused by ships sailing between the reef and the mainland or through one of the channels there. I am delighted that Mr Hunt has made that decision, and I will do everything in my power to support that decision and support the people of Bowen.


The workers and the miners who have been losing their jobs in the Queensland coalfields do not know where the Labor Party are when it comes to the loss of workers' jobs because of carbon taxes and mining taxes. You never seem to see them. They are only interested in the miners and the workers when they pay their union fees and can allow the union bosses to do whatever they do do these days with union fees. We only have to look at Mr Thomson to understand some of the things that are being done with union fees. But that seems to be the only time the Labor Party are interested in the jobs of workers. 


I am interested in the jobs of miners in Central Queensland. I am interested in small businesses in Bowen and Mackay. I am interested in those wanting work there. I am interested, more than any, I might say, in our tourist industry and our fishing industry and in making sure that our greatest national asset, the Great Barrier Reef, is protected. I am confident that the decision made today, with all its conditions, will continue to protect the Great Barrier Reef. I remind the Greens and the Labor Party that, if they look back through history, it has been the Liberal Party in government that have taken all the significant measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef, because we have always understood how significant it is. It is a win-win situation on Abbot Point. 


I have digressed, I have to say, a little bit from the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill, but it was important to bring things into perspective and to reject Senator Waters' claim, which I heard her make on radio, that the approval for Abbot Point will hasten climate change around the world. This just shows the stupidity of the comments. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Coal exports will.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  I remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I appreciate your protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would rather have the debate with Senator Whish-Wilson, because, as with so many things that the Greens say, it is all based on scaremongering and certainly not on science. You just have them saying anything on the basis that the end justifies the means. I know the Greenpeace attitude: tell any lie you like, as long as you get the result you want. Isn't it the Greenpeace motto: tell any lie you like, misrepresent any fact, as long as you get the end result you want? All lies and misrepresentations are in order. 


Getting back to the bill before us, it is essential that we are allowed to honour the commitment we made to the Australian people, and that the Australian Labor Party made to the Australian people as well. I re-emphasise to the Australian Labor Party and to people who might be listening to this debate: it was the Australian Labor Party, the ALP, the Gillard government, that solemnly promised before the 2010 election that they would not introduce a carbon tax. Yet, today we hear from Labor speakers that it is so good. If it is so good, can you tell me why your leader prior to the 2010 election promised not to bring it in? Because of that promise, she got herself elected. Before the 2013 election, the Senate spokesman for the Labor Party was handing round pamphlets in her campaign saying, 'We've already got rid of the carbon tax.' How is that? This is a pamphlet from the opposition spokesman in this chamber on the environment before the election saying, 'We've got rid of the carbon tax.' Well, they hadn't. But here is her chance now. She can retrospectively honour the promise that she was making then that they had gotten rid of it. 


The government will be well advised in relation to climate matters by the CSIRO, whose science and understanding we greatly respect. We will be advised by the Bureau of Meteorology—Australia's weather experts, who are world-renowned. We do not need a Climate Change Authority made up of Labor Party friends, with hundreds of public servants and huge costs, giving the previous government the sort of advice they wanted to hear. I have to say it was more political advice than it was climate change advice. 


We do not need that, and the Australian people do not need to have to pay for that. We have some of the pre-eminent scientific organisations in the world—the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO—there to advise us. We also have very expert people in the Department of the Environment to advise the minister. We have a minister who understands these things, unlike previous ministers, and who appreciates what is what and, more importantly, a minister who is determined to ensure that the promises we made to the Australian people before the last election are honoured.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:20):  I rise today to speak on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We are here today to discuss the Abbott government's continued attack on science and on the Public Service. We are here today to witness the continuation of the Abbott government's tactic of destroying agencies whose expertise does not match with the ideology of the new government. We are here today, yet again, to be dismayed by the Abbott government's continued attack on openness and transparency. And we are here today because those on the government benches do not wish for frank and fearless advice from the Public Service, just hollow echoes of their own thought bubbles. This is a disappointing development in Australian politics, and it is not in the interests of the nation.


This attempt to destroy the Climate Change Authority comes on top of the government's closure of the Climate Commission and AusAID, the abolition of the science portfolio, the loss of hundreds of jobs from CSIRO and the earlier attempt to destroy the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. While in this place we often disagree on policy, never have we disagreed upon the need for public debate to be informed by expert advice—that is, never before the election of this current Liberal-Nationals government. We may disagree on whose expert advice is best, but never before has a government in this country sought to destroy agencies simply because their expert advice is not to the liking of the government's blinkered, narrow-minded belief system. That is what we are witnessing today. The Liberal-Nationals government is seeking to destroy the Climate Change Authority because it does not like the advice it provides and it does not want any government authority at all to be able to measure how well or—more likely—how poorly its Direct Action policy is or is not working.


The Climate Change Authority, in a measured and sensible manner, provides expert knowledge about action to counter climate change both in Australia and internationally, the efficacy of those actions and the adequacy of those actions. The Climate Change Authority completed its first review of the Renewable Energy Target in December 2012, recommending keeping the renewable energy target at 41,000 gigawatt hours. The Climate Change Authority has commenced work on the first review of Australia's emissions reduction goals. The targets and progress review will recommend short-, medium- and long-term emission reduction goals and assess Australia's progress towards its medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets.


In its targets and progress review report to the government, due to be released in February 2014, the authority will review Australia's progress towards its medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets; recommend a 2020 emissions reduction target; recommend a national carbon budget and indicative national emissions trajectory; discuss how Australia might meet its trajectory, budget and target, including how different sectors of the economy could contribute and the role of international emissions reductions; and, as required by legislation, recommend caps on emissions under the carbon-pricing mechanism. In framing its recommendations, the authority draws upon existing and new analysis of a wide range of issues, including the accumulating body of science and underpinning concerns about climate change; the extent and nature of ongoing international arrangements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; how any global efforts to reduce emissions might be shared among nations; and the economic and social implications for Australia of different targets for reducing emissions.


The Liberal-Nationals government do not want to hear the outcome of this report because they know it will say things that their members in the 'climate change is crap' brigade do not want to hear. They do not want to discuss how Australia might meet its trajectory, budget and target because they have no intention to meet any of these.


Even in the draft report, which is publicly available on the climate change agency's website—and I am sure the Liberal-National government will try to hide or expunge it as they tried to expunge the Gonski report—there are a number of points they do not like because these points expose how dishonest they have been when debating climate change science and climate change economics. The draft report highlights that significant action is being taken on climate change by the international community. China has pilot emissions trading schemes planned for seven provinces and cities. The first began in 2013 and there are plans to design a national emissions trading scheme—that is right: China, the world's most populous nation, a Communist nation, is adopting a market based emissions trading scheme while the Australian Liberal-National government, the Abbott-Truss government, is introducing Marxist-style direct government intervention into the economy.


On this issue the Chinese Communist government are acting more liberal than the Australian Liberal Party itself. To put it another way: on this issue the action by the Australian Liberal Party is more Marxist than the actions of the Chinese Communist government are. I am surprised that Minister Abetz can keep from choking when trying to explain this direct action policy. China has renewable energy targets, feed-in tariff support for solar, wind and biomass power, a policy of closure of inefficient small- and medium-sized coal plants and industrial facilities, appliance and building standards, an energy efficiency target, industrial energy efficiency retrofits and vehicle fuel efficiency standards.


The United States of America has subnational emissions trading schemes in California and nine north-eastern states, subnational renewable energy targets, financial incentives supporting renewable energy, proposed national regulations limiting emissions from fossil fuel power plants, appliance and building standards, industrial energy efficiency assessments, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and vehicle emissions standards. The European Union has an emissions trading scheme amongst its 28 member states and Norway, a renewable energy target and support for cogeneration, feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, appliance and building standards, an energy efficiency target, vehicle emissions standards and renewable fuel production incentives.


India has a coal tax, an energy efficiency trading scheme for the power sector, renewable energy targets, vehicle fuel efficiency standards and vehicle emissions standards pending. Japan, Canada, South Korea, South Africa and New Zealand have taken substantive action to tackle climate change. There ends the furphy that no other nations are doing anything about climate change.


When you combine all those countries you can see that substantive action is being taken by countries representing an overwhelming majority of the world's population and carbon dioxide output. You can see why the government do not want an agency that explicitly collates and releases that data, because it is not in the Liberal-National government's interest for that information to be widely distributed amongst the Australian population. Mr Abbott and his friends are happy for there to be a widespread belief that there has been no international action on climate change. Indeed, they have dishonestly pushed that view strongly over the last six years. The Abbott-Truss government is not going to like the Climate Change Authority's targets and progress review report because it will recommend a higher target than five per cent on 2000 levels. That can be clearly seen in the draft report which is already released. The draft report says:


The Authority presents two options:


a 2020 emissions reduction target of 15 per cent below 2000 levels, with a 2030 trajectory range of 35-50 per cent; or


a 2020 target of 25 per cent with a 2030 trajectory range of 40-50 per cent.


The Authority will recommend a single 2020 target and a single 2030 trajectory range in its Final Report.


Either of these recommendations the Abbott-Truss government will find extremely embarrassing. That is because Tony Abbott has recently confirmed that his government has abandoned its longstanding policy to reduce Australia's emissions by between five and 25 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020, a crucial and internationally scrutinised goal that had retained bipartisan support since 2009, despite significant international action, as I outlined. It is no real surprise to see Tony Abbott walking away from his early support for Australia's commitment—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):    Order! I ask you to refer to the members in the other place by their proper titles.




Senator BILYK:
  Tony Abbott? That is his name.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Prime Minister?




Senator BILYK:
  I can refer to him as Tony Abbott.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Mr Abbott.




Senator BILYK:
  Okay, Mr Abbott.




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  You get worked up when I have a go, so do it properly this time.




Senator BILYK:
  Oh, a little bit precious over there.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I just ask you to adhere to the standing orders.




Senator BILYK:
  Anyway, it is no real surprise to see Mr Abbott walking away from his early support for Australia's commitment to reduce carbon pollution. He has made it clear on a number of occasions that he sees no particular problem with carbon pollution. But it is disappointing that, rather than listening to the expert advice given by the Climate Change Authority, he will close down the agency instead.


The explanatory memorandum for this bill gives an explanation of why the Climate Change Authority is being scrapped:


The Government has a long-standing commitment to abolish the Climate Change Authority (CCA) because it is not needed.


…   …   …


Abolishing the CCA will make a significant contribution to delivering a smaller climate change bureaucracy.


What a hollow attempt at an explanation. I would say the government do not think it is needed because they do not intend to achieve any tangible outcome from their Direct Action policy—not even the 5 per cent reduction on the year-2000-level target that they appear to be walking away from.


This bill also scraps the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board, although you would not know it from the short title of this bill. There is very little about the scrapping of the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board in the explanatory memorandum, which does not even give a fig leaf of an explanation as to why this board is to be scrapped. There is not one word. I find it utterly bizarre that the government, especially the National Party with their alleged concern for rural Australia, is scrapping this board.


This is not a tin-pot board that meets once a year to discuss something of no importance. This is a board that has administered tens of millions of dollars of grants, and yet the Liberal-National government do not give one word of an explanation in their explanatory memorandum of why they want it scrapped. It is utterly remarkable. Talk about lack of transparency! Were you all too busy backflipping on education to finish writing the explanatory memorandum?


For senators and those listening who may not be aware, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board was established under the Climate Change Authority Act 2011 to provide advice to the Australian government on the implementation of the Land Sector Package, which is part of the previous Labor government's Clean Energy Future plan. It has funded and supported a large number of projects since its inception.


From its 2011-12 annual report we can see some of the projects that the board has funded:


The first round of the Filling the Research Gap program has provided multi-year grants to 58 projects to the value of $47.3 million to support research into emerging abatement technologies, strategies and innovative management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the land sector, sequester carbon and enhance sustainable agricultural practices.


The first round of the Action on the Ground program has provided multi-year grants to 59 projects to the value of $25.2 million that are supporting more than 420 farmers from across the county to trial on-farm practices and technologies to demonstrate how farmers can reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions or increase the sequestration of carbon in soil on their properties. 


These round one Filling the Research Gap and Action on the Ground projects cover a broad range of farming practices and climatic and geographic conditions associated with the dairy, livestock (grazing and feedlot industries), horticulture and cropping industries and will help farmers become more sustainable and resilient. The funding for these projects is an investment in the future of Australia’s agricultural sector.


I am surprised—and pretty disappointed, quite frankly—that the Nationals are agreeing to the abolition of a board that is providing tens of millions of dollars of funding to projects in rural communities around the country. I am disappointed that the Nationals are agreeing to the abolition of a board that is making farming more sustainable and more environmentally friendly into the future. They really need to have a good hard look at themselves and have a think about what they really believe and who they really represent.


Can Senator Nigel Scullion explain to the farmers of the Northern Territory why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $548,303 to trial and demonstrate practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions associated with horticultural and cropping industries in Northern Australia? Can Senators Fiona Nash and John Williams explain to the farmers of New South Wales why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $394,000 to trial minimum tillage practices, including controlled traffic and use of mulches, to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and increase sequestration of soil carbon during the production of vegetable crops in New South Wales? Can Senator McKenzie explain to the farmers of Victoria and to my home state of Tasmania as well why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $540,909 for increased nitrogen use efficiency by cropping farmers in the high-rainfall zones of Victoria and Tasmania? Can Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Ian Macdonald explain to the farmers of Queensland why the Nationals are agreeing to abolish the organisation that, through the Action on the Ground grant program, provided funding of up to $534,364 to improve cattle-grazing practices to reduce methane and benefit soil carbon?


I think the farmers of Australia should be extremely concerned and disappointed at the decision of the National Party to vote against the projects funded under the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board that are improving knowledge and farming practices across Australia. I think those that vote for the National Party as a separate entity from the Liberal Party need an explanation of why they continue to act against the interests of the people they claim to represent.


I am surprised that the Liberal-National government want to destroy a board that now has significant expertise in agricultural science, economics including environmental economics, conservation ecology, greenhouse gas emissions measurement and reporting, greenhouse gas abatement measures, public administration, business management and the management or care of Indigenous-held land. I am surprised that the Liberal-National government want to destroy an organisation that now has significant expertise in overseeing carbon sequestering, enhancing sustainable agricultural practices and planting trees when these are all parts of their own Direct Action policy. You are abolishing the board that has the expertise to push your own policy agenda. That is crazy. It is just remarkable.


The government have come into this place with this bill and the previous bill on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation without presenting a clear case for the abolition of either of these bodies. They have made no argument other than a hollow ideological fig leaf of reducing bureaucracy, while at the same time advocating for direct government action on climate change. How much bureaucracy will it take to administer their Direct Action policy? They have stated that they have a policy to 'cut bureaucracy' in the Climate Change Authority, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, yet will create a massive bureaucracy to administer their Direct Action policy. It is utterly ridiculous, honestly. Ironically, the expertise they will need to administer their Direct Action plan is already possessed by people in the Climate Change Authority, the Land Sector Carbon and Biodiversity Board and—you guessed it—the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This Liberal-National government will make them redundant and pay their redundancies, only to find that they will need to rehire them through the Department of the Environment when they realise their Marxist Direct Action policy will need considerably more bureaucracy than those that they have sought to destroy over the last few weeks.


Senators in this place should be extremely disappointed with this bill and indeed many of the bills that have been brought to this place under the Liberal-National government. Proper debate in this place should be based on fact, not on ideology. The Australian people should be greatly concerned about the Liberal-National habit of destroying agencies and boards whose advice they are opposed to merely for ideological reasons. As I said, this attempt to destroy the Climate Change Authority comes on top of the government's closure of the Climate Commission and AusAID, the abolition of the science portfolio, the loss of hundreds of jobs from CSIRO and previous attempts to destroy the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


The Liberal-National government are seeking to destroy the Climate Change Authority because they do not like the advice it provides and they do not want any government authority at all to be able to measure how well or how poorly their Direct Action policy is or is not working. I just find it a bit of a joke. It is a joke, unfortunately, at the expense of the Australian people. I would urge all senators, but particularly those National Party senators who are voting to destroy a board that has granted tens of millions of dollars to Australian farmers, the people they claim to represent, to think again and to vote against this bill.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (10:40):  I rise also to speak against the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. One of the things I want to take up from Senator Bilyk is trying to encourage the National Party to have a separate view from the Liberal Party. That is a long bow, quite frankly. They are truly the doormats to the Liberal Party. We have not seen them spectacularly stand up for anything much at all, quite frankly.


Getting back to the point, though, not only is this bill, along with the proposed repeal of other clean energy acts, environmental vandalism at its very heart, but at best these bills will if passed ensure that Australia's reputation as a progressive economy will fail. The rest of the world will view us in a negative way if we remove not only the Climate Change Authority but also the other work that has been progressed for a very long time. Moreover, our ability to effect real change in the economy to deal with the negative effects of climate change will be lost.


Abolishing the Climate Change Authority shows the contempt that the Abbott government has for independent advice on climate science and how it views our society and the economy. If you look at the latest series of attacks by the Abbott government on the scientific community in Australia—the cuts to the CSIRO and the abolition of the Climate Commission—what really underpins that is this base view of a complete rejection of grounded scientific research—so much so that what they are going to do will take the work that is being done by an independent umpire and stick it in the department. Incorporating the functions of the CCA into the Department of the Environment will mean ultimately that the minister will control the message and will be able to influence the content. It will mean, given the current history of this Abbott government, less transparency. We will not be privy to the work that they do, which is the hallmark of this government to date. It has not been able to move away from a negative agenda masked in secrecy.


The course of action by the Liberals will mean that the work done so far to lower emissions and have a cleaner energy future and a stronger economy will not happen. The Liberals and the Nats—I much prefer just to use the word 'Liberals', because I think the Nats are as one with them—will argue that this action they are taking is designed to address the perception that electricity prices have risen as a direct result of the clean energy legislation of the Rudd-Gillard government. But nothing could be further from the truth. The Climate Institute correctly identifies that, one year on from the introduction of the legislation, the electricity sector emissions have fallen, the economy is growing and the cost of living has not ballooned as the Liberals argued it would. We can all remember what Mr Abbott said would happen: the sky would fall in. He then went to a python squeeze and ultimately bellyflopped with the rhetoric that he used to describe how the economy would be destroyed as a consequence of believing in climate change.


The good news is that the annual carbon emissions have fallen. The regulated carbon limits have fallen by at least 12 million tonnes. It is rubbish for the Liberals to continue to spread the lie that electricity prices have risen as a consequence of this legislation. But they will continue, I suspect, even in this debate to argue that electricity prices have risen. Consumers know it, households know it: they have risen as a consequence of network upgrades, replacing ageing infrastructure. Around 40 per cent of the contribution of the carbon price has accounted for only nine per cent of power bills in 2012-13 according to the Climate Change Institute. No wonder the Liberals want to get rid of an independent umpire that provides facts and figures about the economy and how we are addressing climate change. They do not want the consumer or households to be aware of it.


The economy has continued to remain relatively strong, unlike the doom and gloom the Liberals in opposition argued would happen. The impact of the carbon price has been barely discernible according to the ABS, again, an independent body. When you move the climate authority into the department, can you have the same confidence that it will be an independent voice of reason? I doubt it. The great majority of Australian consumers have not been impacted by the carbon price. For those households that have been impacted, it has been a very small effect and there has been an assistance package there to assist. Of course it has not stopped the extreme language of the Liberals in talking down the economy, exaggerating the effects of putting a price on carbon and ignoring the reasons for the need to address climate change using the best market based mechanisms available.


The Liberals demonstrated in the last 100 days or so that they have forgotten how the market works. It can be the only explanation for the Liberals to justify why they are moving from market based mechanisms to regulatory planned models that really hark back to the 1960s, which was the last time we saw them in this country. One wonders what did happen to the Liberals and free market? You only have to go back to the 2007 federal election under Mr John Howard, who effectively was supporting an emissions trading scheme as part of their platform. There has been an enormous transformation, it appears. Instead of progressing forward with market based economic solutions, we have gone back 20 years to the 1960s under the Liberals who support a planned economy. I guess next we will be hearing them champion Stalin.


What did the Liberal Party of Australia become? Now it looks like champions of a centrally planned economic policy. To give you some feel for that, the so-called Direct Action policy is widely discredited. Let me go to some of the black holes that it is. The government, I suspect, will be required to put significant funding into the Direct Action policy if it is ever to work. We will move from that question as to whether they want it to work or whether it is just a face saver for true climate deniers. It is, quite frankly, an odd policy when you look at the content of it—if we could. Of course they have not put that on the table.


We can assume what direct action means. They have made some statements about it. It does look to date, though, to be politically convenient but ideologically incongruous, financially expensive and probably irrelevant to the future. It certainly will not fit into the global action on climate change. But none of this has stopped the Liberals on their relentless march towards political expediency by effectively, I think, being captured by the climate change deniers within their own party, who are now seeking to tear down a market based solution and replace it with the regulatory model which effectively consists of a two-word slogan of 'direct action' with no details behind it, a call to arms perhaps by the Liberals to try and find a bit more meat on the bone.


Let us be honest: the real reason they want to repeal the clean energy bill including the Climate Change Authority and replace it with a policy with no details is, ultimately, the climate change deniers captured the Liberal Party. They do not believe in climate change. They do not want to effect change and they will continue to use Direct Action. Without a model to look at to see how it will work, it seems to be a system that will use taxpayers' money to fund big business in an attempt to reduce emissions—a very poor way to try to reduce emissions. Maybe those on the other side will be able to enlighten me in this debate how that Direct Action policy will work, how it will achieve the most efficient reduction of emissions through the use of taxpayers' money in the first place and why they would replace it with a market based mechanism. But we have not heard from them about that. There will be plenty of excuses later as to why Direct Action fails but let us not get ahead of the debate here.


The coalition have promised that their flawed clean energy policy rests on two things: the repeal of the carbon legislation and the implementation of Direct Action. What we have before parliament is only half the policy. It is true that they are attempting to do the repeal today, but I think that they, even in government and true to the Liberal's DNA, can only say no to sensible policy which will achieve a clean energy future and, through a market based operation, the reduction of carbon emissions while maintaining a strong economy.


While they say that they accept climate change, that it is real and that humans are contributing to it, I am not convinced that they are truly saying it with conviction. The Liberals have not told us how the other half of their Direct Action policy will achieve real and meaningful change. They promised to be a consultative government, a stable adult government and a government that would work with others, and I think this is where the public have been misled by the coalition while in opposition and when they came to government. The government's first actions have been to abolish what they can see, to abolish what they do not understand, to say no to things that they are unsure of and to continue to cut harshly into the Public Service and the economy. They explained none of that in the lead-up to the last election, and I think the public have a right to ask whether this is the government that they elected.


Any responsible government would have put their credentials on the table and indicated how they were going to achieve their reductions through direct action. The coalition said that the action plan would coincide with the introduction of their Direct Action Plan to tackle climate change. That is what they have said. Where is it? It is not on the table. Let us be clear about the coalition's position. They are now asking us to abolish the Climate Change Authority, an independent umpire that provides an independent voice. They want to remove the market mechanism to reduce emissions. They want to do all of the above, without putting their bona fides on the table and without indicating what will replace it, while continuing to be a negative and carping government.


The economic impact of this has not been modelled. One of the things that Senator Cormann became famous for, without verballing him too much, is asking for modelling. Where is the modelling to show that Direct Action will achieve the outcomes? Have they done the modelling? Have they provided the certainty that removing a market based mechanism such as the ETS will be less efficient than their Direct Action program? I am not going to embarrass Senator Cormann by asking for the modelling. Quite frankly, I think we all know that it does not exist.


It is more likely that a Direct Action program will simply be a transfer for dud harebrained schemes that big business dream up to suck money out of the Australian taxpayer to support their attempts of reducing emissions. I think any and all of that will be on the table for the Liberals.


The unstated problem with this Direct Action Plan is: where is the money going to come from? How are they going to fund it? Some of the critical elements of their Direct Action Plan are simply not there. More importantly, where is the modelling to show that they will be able to purchase sufficient domestic abatement to meet Australia's bipartisan 2020 emissions reduction target of five per cent compared with the 2000 levels, based on the work done by the Department of Climate Change? Will we achieve the targets or will we simply be provided with an excuse as to why there will be a shortfall? That is the crucial bit.


If we look at the evidence to date, the size of the suggested shortfall—that is, the difference between what the emissions trading scheme under Labor would achieve and what Direct Action could possibly achieve—will be the difference between the target of 159 million tonnes of CO2 abatement and about 40 million tonnes, which is the amount Direct Action will achieve on average by 2020 according to some of the best estimates. So there will be about 119 million tonnes missing. Where are they going to find it? One of their Direct Action proposals is to plant trees. They are going to be busy painting trees to achieve that.


The Liberals will say that greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes are not world's best practice. But, if you look at the evidence to date, there are schemes operational in several countries around the world. Schemes are operational in Switzerland, New Zealand and South Korea, and subnational schemes are legislated in the US, Canada and Japan. The Kyoto protocol also provides for emissions trading across nations. China has also moved with a network of seven pilot schemes planned to begin in 2013. You get the sense that the world is moving one way and Australia, under Tony Abbott, is moving the other way. It seems impossible to consider Direct Action as being a viable, workable and effective scheme in an international setting.


One of the most telling criticisms of Direct Action comes from someone who would have direct knowledge of the matter. Mr Turnbull offered this advice in February 2010 when he spoke of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010:


Until 1 December last year, there was a bipartisan commitment in Australia that this carbon price, this exercise in reducing emissions, should be imposed by means of a market based mechanism—this emissions trading scheme.


…


As we have seen in recent days, alternatives such as direct regulation or subsidies will be far more costly to the economy, no matter how hard their designers seek to argue the contrary.


I will leave it that I agree with his words.


Mr Turnbull went on to bell the cat. He recognised that the subsidy schemes, like the Direct Action proposal, will encourage government to pick projects for subsidies, which will be a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. This will result in more costly and less effective abatement of emissions.


In conclusion in this debate, and coming back to the main scope of this bill: again, it is simply a negative, retrograde step by a government that has no clear policy and that can only see its way to say 'no', to abolish things and to cut things. It has no positive plan for Australia's future, and this is but one example of where removing the independent umpire also gives it the ability to hide the truth and not allow it to be put into the public domain—to control the message.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (11:00):  I rise to oppose the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. We have said it, they have heard it and former Prime Minister Rudd announced that we would abolish the carbon tax. Done and dusted.


But this government is playing political games with the carbon tax. The carbon tax is all it talks about. You would think that what is before the Australian parliament is one bill to abolish the carbon tax. But what this government is trying to do is much more than abolish the carbon tax, and they are trying to hide that fact from Australian voters. In fact, the only time we hear the coalition government talk about all of the other parts of its abolition bills is in response to Labor putting the success of our climate change policy on the public record.


The coalition government wants Labor to support much, much more than the abolition of the carbon tax. The coalition government would have us believe that it has a mandate, that the federal election was all about the carbon tax, when the facts are that the carbon tax did not rate as a top five issue. The coalition government thinks Labor should just fall into line with its wishes and its wants. Well, what the Labor opposition is doing is acting responsibly. We are siding with the Australian public, with Australian voters, because they want action on climate change.


Recently, the PM, Mr Abbott, invited Australians to let their elected representatives know loud and clear about their views on the carbon tax. And I thank Mr Abbott, because Australian voters are letting us know what they want—letting us know loud and clear that they do not support the abolition of the carbon tax without replacing it with an emissions trading scheme. This is exactly Labor's position, and despite Mr Abbott taking a gamble and inviting voters to email politicians with their views I have not had one—not one—email supporting the coalition government's position. Not one email supporting its Direct Action plan.


So I say to the coalition government: keep your heads buried in the sand, ignoring the views of Australian voters, ignoring the views of experts and abolishing authorities such as the Climate Change Authority because they produce reports based on science and rigorous analysis which lead to outcomes that do not support the government's rhetoric and do not support the government's instincts on climate change. And they do not support the views of the climate change deniers who now make up this coalition government.


This government does not want independent expert advice. It treats advice based on science or facts with hostility. It has nailed its colours to the mast of the rotten ship SS Direct Action and is not letting go, no matter what the science says and no matter what Australian voters think. This move by the coalition government to abolish the Climate Change Authority demonstrates this government's complete hostility—complete hostility—to independent expert advice.


There is no reason to abolish the Climate Change Authority. In fact, there is every reason to keep it. And again, Senator Abetz and the government showed their complete lack of understanding of the Climate Change Authority when Senator Abetz said in the Senate on 2 December in relation to the Climate Change Authority:


… in relation to the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill—why are we putting that forward? Because if you remove the carbon tax there is no real need for this authority, …


Again, the government demonstrates that it has not done its homework. It does not know what it is talking about when it comes to climate change, because the Climate Change Authority undertakes reviews and makes recommendations on a range of matters, including emissions reduction targets and carbon budgets.


The renewable energy target—how will we measure that without an independent authority? And there is the Carbon Farming Initiative—something that I would have thought the National Party would want to know about and receive advice on—and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System.


The Climate Change Authority board—I do not know if the coalition has had a look at who is on this board—are leading experts in industry, in economics and in science. They are an extremely well-qualified board that all Australians should be proud of and they are an experienced board. Why would any competent government ignore their advice and shut them down so their voice can no longer be heard? The Climate Change Authority has nothing to do with the carbon tax. The reason the government does not want to keep it and wants to abolish it is quite simple: it does not want to be held accountable on its Direct Action Plan. It does not have a single supporter for this policy, which has been around for three years—not a single supporter in the scientific or economic fields. When direct action does not work, the government will not be held accountable for its actions because it is stripping away any authority which might hold it to account. This government, despite its rhetoric, does not want to be held accountable.


This government just wants to lick its finger, stick it in the air and see which way the wind is blowing. That is the extent of its interest in science—relying on its instincts rather than on the overwhelming evidence from 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists. Dr Dennis Jensen, the federal member for Tangney, told interviewer Jonathan Swan that just because 97 per cent of research papers published in scientific journals agree that humans are causing climate change this does not necessarily mean they are right, because, he said:


… the argument of consensus … is a flawed argument.


So Dr Jensen does not accept the position of the world's science academies and Australia's CSIRO that climate change is caused mainly by humans burning fossil fuels and chopping down trees. Instincts are an absolute trait of the coalition government. Former Prime Minister Howard told a London audience that those of us who accept that climate change is real are a bunch of 'religious zealots' and that he will trust his instincts.


It has been a while since Mr Howard was the Prime Minister of this country so one would have hoped that the coalition might have updated its knowledge and might have looked at some science—but, no, that trust in instincts and gut feelings continues in the current coalition. Prime Minister Abbott, the person who wants us to scrap any policies which put a price on carbon and to scrap the job of experts such as those who work in and manage the Climate Change Authority, told us two years ago:


… whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.


Mr Abbott obviously has not availed himself of the work of 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists. The Australian public know it, Labor know it, the Greens know it, but it seems the coalition is living in some kind of climate sceptics vacuum. 


More recently and, quite frankly, more embarrassingly, Prime Minister Tony Abbott accused the United Nations climate chief of 'talking through her hat'. That quote has been repeated quite a lot in this house and elsewhere. It is embarrassing than our Prime Minister, the supposed leader of our country, accuses the United Nations climate chief of talking through her hat. It just shows that ignorance about climate science is alive and well within the coalition. The classic, of course, was a comment by Minister Greg Hunt, the Minister for the Environment, someone who is expected to know everything about his portfolio. I accept that as a minister there are some views you take and some views you do not. But when you are so in the public eye, when you have such an important portfolio as the Environment portfolio, you should be able to quote the science or the economics. Whether you agree with it or not, you should know what is out there. Yet what did Minister Hunt confess to using? Wikipedia. With all of the resources the minister has in his office, in the department, in the Climate Change Authority, he turns to Wikipedia to contradict the United Nations climate chief. And he contradicted her opinion in a BBC interview. Again, oh dear me, how embarrassing. First the Prime Minister of our country and then our environment minister—how embarrassing for Australia.


I have a message for Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt: it is proven. I have another message: there exists an authority, the Climate Change Authority, which is a group of independent, and ethical, experts in their fields. These people know that the science is proven. Why do they know it? Not because of their instincts, not because they stick their finger in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing, not because somebody told them; they know it through rigorous research , rigorous analysis, checking their facts, conferring with other scientists—that is how they know it. They provided the former ALP government, the 43th Parliament, with recommendations and guidance—and with evidence, Mr Abbott and the coalition government, not instincts, but real evidence—and provided expert advice to allow the Australian government to set up effective climate change mitigation initiatives, and not an unsupported direct action policy.


The coalition government is attempting to hoodwink the Australian public and shut down credible authorities, such as the Climate Change Authority. This government is more and more lining up with the climate change deniers, ignoring transparent and independent information that goes against their political wants and against the political outcomes that they want. Australia was such a leader of positive reforms in the past, and it was a leader with our current climate change legislation. But now under the Abbott government we are embarrassing ourselves internationally. Do we really want to line up with the likes of Monckton, who says:


Science should only be practised by people who adhere to a religion, preferably of the Christian variety.


Or there is this one from Monckton again, who says:


The world's climate scientists and advocates for action are just trying to ""stamp out democracy"".


Is that what the coalition is trying to do in lining up with the likes of Monckton—to 'stamp out democracy'?


Or what about this one from Monckton:


Young climate change campaigners are like the ""Hitler youth"".


Monckton goes on and has a go at one of our credible scientists, saying:


Professor Ross Garnaut's views on climate change are ""fascist"".


And there is last one, perhaps the best:


Climate change scientists should be prosecuted and locked up 


The sorts of instincts that the coalition government are lining up behind are the views of the likes of Monckton. This government must separate this bill from the wider carbon tax debate, just as Labor has done—and we got a lot of criticism from Senator Abetz as to why we would want to separate these bills. We want to separate them out because we want Australian voters to know that this government wants to shut down a credible organisation, a credible, factual, well-resourced organisation with an expert management board, the Climate Change Authority. Why? Because it might not always agree with what the government is saying.


But we want to assess the Climate Change Authority on its merits and we want to assess the merits of the abolition bill that is before us. Leave aside differences on the views of carbon pricing, forget about the 'carbon tax', as nobody campaigned to keep it, and tell us and the Australian people why you want to ignore the Climate Change Authority, an authority which provides bipartisan and transparent information to government.


The campaign by this coalition government of shutting down credible scientists and climate change organisations started with the firing of the former Secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Blair Comley, who dared to be more honest about the state of climate change than the coalition was willing to accept. They do not want frank advice; they tell us that they can get the advice elsewhere. But departments are not best placed to give free and fearless advice; independent bodies are best placed to do that. But this government does not want any expert to advise on Australia's international targets.


The Climate Change Authority said in their October draft report that Australia should aim for a 15 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. The CCA believe that leaving our emissions target at its current level will prove to be inadequate into the future. This is an example of the Climate Change Authority's frank and fearless advice. Repealing the legislation and abolishing the Climate Change Authority is a demonstration of the government completely disregarding this information. The establishment of an independent Climate Change Authority to advise on the operation of a carbon pricing scheme or a direct action scheme is critical but, again, this government wants to go backwards and turn back the clock with no assessment of whether the authority is good, bad or indifferent, and with no transparency. It is a case of: let us just get on and continue to try to hoodwink people, as this government continues to rely on instincts and not facts and not scientific evidence. I do not support the abolition of the Climate Change Authority.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (11:20):  It is a great shame that we have to speak to this matter today in the chamber, but there are many issues that seem to be confronting us with this new government that seek to undo the visionary work and to pull apart things that were established during the 43rd Parliament for the greater good of this community and, certainly in the long term, with a vision for all Australians, not just an expeditious view of the moment but a proper, mature and adult view of our responsibility to the future.


In 1990, an aspiring environmental lawyer by the name of Greg Hunt put the finishing touches to his honours thesis. It was titled A carbon tax to make the polluter pay and its conclusion was to propose the wide use of pollution taxes as a means of both raising revenue for environmental agencies and compelling polluters to decrease their emissions. Oh how the mighty ideals have fallen. 


While the coalition pretend their farce of a policy that is Direct Action is a 'no regrets' solution, we all know that they are kidding themselves. Deep down there is at least one of them who must regret it—the minister for Wikipedia himself. It is rumoured that on the particularly quiet nights in Canberra you can hear him crying, overcome by the shame of his complete about-face. Day in, day out he tries to sell a policy designed by a Prime Minister who is on the record as describing climate change as 'absolute crap'. It is enough to drive one to tears. The very fact that the minister put in charge of dismantling Labor's market-based solution wrote an honours thesis advocating for one exposes this government's climate change policy as a sham.


The government is deceiving the Australian people on climate change. It is deceiving this parliament and it is also clearly deceiving itself. Action on climate change requires a market-based solution, and Labor's emissions trading scheme is certainly the most effective means of delivering it. Business knows it, the public knows it and—though he is loath to admit it—the environment minister himself knows it.


So I call on the coalition: if you really want to stop the waste, stop wasting this parliament's time by moving to repeal the most effective means of reducing carbon emissions. The coalition would do well to work with Labor—the real adults in the room—to move from a fixed price to an ETS by 1 July 2014. Future generations will not look kindly on this coalition government for dismantling our nation's commitment to develop a sustainable economy through market-based solutions, especially when its alleged policy alternative is nothing more than a glint in the environment minister's eye. It is a 'trust me' stance from someone who cannot even be trusted to stand by his very own words.


We have already seen on display in this parliament the fact that the government does have a trust deficit. They promised to stop the boats and buy the boats, but all they have done is hide the boats. They promised to end the waste, but instead they have spent close to $1 billion extra each week since coming to office and have removed all parliamentary oversight of how much more they can spend. There is no limit on their credit card now—so much for a budget emergency. 


They promised that Australia was open for business, but instead they have blocked investment into the struggling GrainCorp and left Qantas and Holden flapping in the breeze. While I am sure that Qantas appreciates the airfares for Mr Abbott's flight to Johannesburg, it is not exactly going to cover the hundreds of millions of dollars shortfall in revenue or make up for the coalition's inaction.


For a government that promised to be the adults in the room, they are certainly acting like toddlers in the midst of a tantrum. The coalition's economic impotence has been on prominent display during its short time in office, and it is on display again here today in their efforts to replace Labor's comprehensive market-based solution with their own 'watch this space' command and control, white elephant Direct Action policy. It is laughable to think the coalition is demanding the repeal of Labor's solution to climate change with nothing more than a thought bubble as an alternative. No green paper, no white paper—nothing. Just, 'Trust us. We know what we're doing.' 


But here we are, nonetheless, at this point. Labor has separated the government's legislation to give the coalition a chance to recover at least a shred of credibility on climate change by retaining the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority. We do so because the nation demands action on climate change, and the initiatives of the CEFC and the CCA, though complementary to it, are not bound by the retention of a price on carbon.


I just want to put on the record some of the commentary that came out of the very short Senate hearing into the CEFC to make this point even more clearly. 'Rather than ''crowding out'' the private sector, the CEFC was ''crowding in'' banks that would not otherwise lend'. These were the words reported by Peter Hannam in his article 'Victim of a changed climate' in the Sydney Morning Heraldon 30 November. Jillian Broadbent, who is the chair of the CEFC, said to the committee, 'When you have a $10 billion fund, you can … have a discussion with the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank. If you did not have a $10 billion fund … you were just there to have a powwow.' That is the impact of having the CEFC. Similarly, to show how short-sighted this current Liberal government is, I want to put on the record John Hewson's view that the scrapping of the CEFC, along with the carbon price, was merely short-term politics. He says, 'It's not necessarily an economic or business position. It's a political position.' And it is a very bad political position. 


I do not think that Jillian Broadbent could be declared as a great friend of Labor. Her role is as a specialist consultant for the Anglo-South African investment bank, Investec, and she actually said, 'I think we probably all know more Liberal Party people than we do Labor people,' when she was speaking to the Senate inquiry. She also made this statement, which I think is absolutely telling: 'If the bipartisan mood existed, everyone would be very excited about what the CEFC was doing.'


The problem is not with the CEFC or with the CCA. The problem is with the bloody-mindedness, the ideological bent, the denial of fact and the absence of a care for the future that is on show, with shame, for all to see in the legislation that is being pushed through this parliament by this shameful government that we are having to call to account today. The CEFC was doing its job of providing low-cost capital to stimulate investment in emission reduction, and the CCA needs to continue to do its job of providing independent advice to the government on the best climate change mitigation initiatives. You would think these two issues alone would easily garner bipartisan support but, as is too often the case with the Abbott coalition, you would  be wrong. Put simply, this is not a government that sees climate change as a threat. It is not even a government that accepts the science of climate change, as my colleague in the Senate, Senator Lines, has just made so clearly evident in her speech. This government appears wilfully oblivious to the fact that consensus among climate scientists now is at 97 per cent. I do not know about you, Madam Acting Deputy President, but when I took home a test, having got 97 per cent on it, I used to be reasonably happy. I did get upset occasionally when I would get the reply, 'But what happened to the other three per cent?' There is a difference being on the 97 per cent side of the equation and deciding, as a government of a sovereign nation, to line up with the three per centers. There is something terribly wrong.


In 2009, the coalition walked away from climate change by electing a climate change sceptic leader, who is on the record saying he is 'hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change'. That was on the 7:30 Report on the ABC. Needless to say, it leaves little hope that this parliament can reach a bipartisan consensus when the coalition is led by someone who seems to have wandered far away from the truth and has perhaps just departed a flat earth society convention.


The Climate Change Authority's brief, to provide expert independent advice on climate change mitigation initiatives, is hardly revolutionary stuff. Labor set up the authority to ensure both the government of the day as well as the Australian public have the most comprehensive advice on how to expand Australia's renewable energy industry. It is chaired by a very reputable person, the former head of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, and it has a board of considerable expertise, consisting of highly qualified scientists—including Australia's Chief Scientist, Ian Chubb—economists, academics and professionals—just as the Australian people would expect: the most celebrated in the land gathered together to help us face the most significant challenges of our time. As a statutory body at arm's length from government, the CCA is able to provide an important independent voice to assist Australia's actions to mitigate the effects of climate change, without fear or favour.


But, perhaps, that is where the real problem lies for the Abbott coalition, because we have seen already this is a government addicted to secrecy and intrigue and seemingly obsessed with abolishing sources of independent advice which they cannot tamper with, distort or intimidate before they give their advice. Indeed, the government's first act in office was to sack senior public servants who had the temerity to do their job—that is, to provide frank and fearless advice for the government of the day. Sacking departmental heads Andrew Metcalfe, Don Russell and Blair Comley—as well as giving marching orders to Martin Parkinson from next year—clearly demonstrates the exact value the government places on frank and fearless advice. That is clearly none. What a dangerous stance to take—a government that refutes science, rails against fact and ignores or dismisses independent advice.


The Abbott coalition is trying to intimidate public servants and entire departments into submission. They do not want independent advice; they want an echo chamber. Greg Hunt is on the record stating his desired avenues for advice are from august bodies: the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and the environment department. But these are all bodies which are subject to government funding. Under the government's plan, they can censor, bury and distort findings from these departments at will. They have already gutted the funding for the CSIRO in a clumsy and very short-sighted effort to disrupt the work of some of our top scientists who are in the midst of producing critical research to benefit the nation. How can public servants at the environment department and the Bureau of Meteorology keep the public properly informed when their jobs are under constant threat from a government that seeks to remove anyone who dares to hold them to account?


The Abbott coalition has already dismantled the Climate Commission and is now going for the last body which still has the ability to publish independent advice, all because they do not like the headlines generated by its findings. This is the Abbott carbon con—dismantle the bodies that provide independent advice and smother all departmental advice before it sees the light of day. And it is not just departments. We have seen recently on display the coalition, in conjunction with sections of the press, running a campaign of intimidation against the independent national broadcaster, the ABC, for daring to publish reports that Australia spied on Indonesia. From the Prime Minister down, the coalition has criticised the ABC, with government ministers calling for its privatisation, break-up or funding to be cut—all for fulfilling its public duty of informing the public. Clearly they are not content with censoring the Public Service; they want to censor the press as well.


But, of course, when we take more than a moment to assess what passes as climate change policy in today's coalition, you can almost pity the government for wanting to hide its shame. A Fairfax Media survey of 35 economists found that only two economists supported the coalition's Direct Action plan—that is a fail on anybody's watch—and one of those was a self-declared climate change sceptic. Australian economist Professor Justin Wolfers, of the Brookings Institution in Washington and the University of Michigan, said:


Direct Action would involve more economic disruption and have less environmental payoff than a trading scheme—


BT Financial's Chris Caton added:


Any economist who did not opt for emissions trading should hand their degree back—


so clear is his message about how wrong the Direct Action policy is! The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found:


Emissions trading systems provided the lowest cost for reducing carbon pollution among the different approaches available—


But what would the OECD know by comparison to this government, who know everything, are the font of all wisdom and are not in need of independent frank or fearless advice as they have got it all figured out so we should just trust them! Somehow that does not ring true. Another claim from the OECD saw it dismissing Direct Action as a policy that 'entails higher costs to society per tonne of carbon dioxide abated—in many cases, substantially higher'.


The Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group have also both questioned the viability of the direct action scheme. It is getting to the point where you have to think that they are very brave to even speak up and say anything at all in opposition to this new rule of government that we are seeing. The Ai Group bravely states that the direct action policy is 'unlikely to produce any meaningful reduction in carbon emissions'. And I suppose that is okay if you are not here to do meaningful things. If you are here to play the game of being in power, that perhaps is an explanation of why you might follow the path of direct action. The Business Council of Australia says that 'direct action is likely to put a very high impost on Australian taxpayers'. That is very concerning. That is intolerable—that is, not only pulling apart well-informed policy, agreed policy by experts, but to also put a burden on Australian taxpayers.


In the muddy mess that is the coalition's Direct Action Plan there is only one thing that is clear: it clearly fails even the most cursory of inquiries. By the government's own admission, direct action is a command-and-control scheme that places the government front and centre. Greg Hunt is on the record stating:


The Government will simply buy back the lowest cost abatement instead of having to tax the whole economy.


And Tony Abbott claims direct action will operate as:


… a fund enabling the government to buy the most cost effective means of reducing emissions through a tender process.


The Liberal Party, the self-proclaimed party of capital, has lost the economic plot.


When one considers the coalition's direct action absurdity, comments made by Malcolm Turnbull come to mind.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! I remind you to address members in the other place by their correct titles.




Senator O'NEILL:
  The member for Wentworth comes to mind:


… we know that picking winners is hard enough for the private sector, and well nigh impossible for the public sector. We know that when tax revenues are handed out to one firm or industry they come at the expense of all the other firms and families that paid that tax.


With direct action, the Abbott coalition is going to attempt to pick winners. It is paying a subsidy to its most preferred polluters at the taxpayers' expense, all at an extravagant cost for no meaningful reduction in carbon emissions. It is game-playing of the most dangerous kind—that is, with the future of this country. In so doing, the Liberal Party is abandoning any credible claim as the party of capital; it is now, very clearly, the party of economic vandalism.


Stewardship of our great nation requires governments to have the vision to deliver policies that ensure our way of life is sustainable. From my home on the Central Coast, I can see the ocean as I look up towards Newcastle and down the coast to North Head. I cannot help but take in the sheer beauty of my surrounds. In this, I am sure I am joined by hundreds of thousands of residents who also call these places home, places that are at risk from climate change. Increased temperatures will alter our landscape and our natural environment and impact on our flora and fauna.


Considering the Abbott coalition's approach to climate change, it is little wonder it has systematically moved to close down, censor or intimidate independent sources of advice and information. This is at the heart of its decision to abolish the Climate Commission and to shut down the Climate Change Authority. Labor will vote against this shambolic policy, and we will not allow the coalition to silence expert advice— (Time expired)

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:41):  I indicate my opposition to the government policy in relation to the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. What you have to understand, when you look at this little part of the coalition's anti-climate-change policy, is that this is about government secrecy. This is about ensuring that there is no independent authority having a look at the shambles of a policy called direct action—the policy that would require twice the area of Victoria to be planted out with trees to gain some of the climate CO2 reduction that they claim they will achieve. It is about ensuring that that short-term policy, which has been roundly criticised from within the coalition as well as externally both by scientists and by economists, hides the incompetent development of this policy and the incompetence of the policy itself. It is about trying to shut down critiques. It is about saying on the one hand, 'We are about small government, we are about ensuring that the country gets value for money, we want a smaller bureaucracy', but on the other hand, because they were in trouble with the climate change policies, having to then establish a bureaucracy to hand out grants to polluters in this country.


The reason for this bill is the ongoing secrecy that just completely envelopes this poor, incompetent government. It is saying: 'We do not want the public to know how incompetent we are in delivering this policy, how incompetent the policy is itself. Therefore, we will not have any analysis; we will not have any independent critique. We will have public servants out there arguing the government's position, and we will then describe them as the experts in this area.'


We all know how that works in Canada, where the scientists have been closed down. The scientists have not been allowed by conservative governments in Canada to make any critiques of the Canadian government's position on climate change policy. They must clear every public statement through the Canadian minister. And who was one of the first governments that the Abbott coalition cosied up to? The Canadian government. You can just imagine the two conservative leaders sitting around a table, exchanging views on how you close down economic and scientific critiques of government policy; and the Canadian government telling the Liberal coalition here that you shut them down by making sure that a public servant cannot speak out on the environment, cannot speak out on science and cannot speak out for the public good.


So that is what the alternative is. There is no alternative to the Climate Change Authority being an independent authority and actually analysing what is going on. The alternative is the Canadian model, and that is the model that the coalition government will try to implement—a model that is about secrecy and closing down analysis, closing down scientific critiques and closing down any advice to the public that does not match what this incompetent government wants to put out to the public.


We have had only a short period of this government. I have to say that, if ever a honeymoon period came to a shuddering halt, it was with this coalition government. The public know they cannot trust the coalition: they cannot trust the coalition to look after them when they are in trouble; they cannot trust the coalition to look after the public good when they are facing bushfires in the Blue Mountains; and they cannot trust this government to provide proper support to communities in trouble. That is the short-term approach of the government.


In the longer term, dealing with climate change and carbon pollution, this government cannot be trusted either, because this government is prepared to push the science aside, push the economics aside, come up with some stunt labelled 'direct action' and try to perpetrate a con job on the Australian public. The Australian public are onto this government. They have never been onto a government so quick as they have been onto this government. They understand that the government is incompetent. They understand that the government is untrustworthy. They understand that the government has got no policies in a whole range of areas. They now know that it has to set up 50 inquiries to try to develop some semblance of a government program moving forward, because there were no government programs in place other than three-line slogans on issues that are really about short-term political advantage and not the national interest.


You see it writ large by this government day in and day out. Abolishing the Climate Change Authority so they can maintain their secrecy and antiscientific approach is just one of the ways that they deal with this. Let us look at them on education. How incompetent has any government been in this country? Talk about a double backflip with a pike. The coalition government have invented a new high-diving manoeuvre. I do not think anyone has ever seen contortions like the contortions of the coalition on this issue.


It is no wonder that the Australian public are going: 'We've been conned. We've been absolutely conned by this conservative government. They told us they would do all these things and, after they came to power, the issues that are important for the Australian nation are ignored and the issues that are pushed are part of the ideological agenda of the extreme right wing of the coalition, who don't believe in climate change, who don't believe in scientific endeavour, who don't believe in proper economics and who at one stage were talking about the market being the way forward.' The market is only the way forward for the coalition when it suits big business, but the market is not the way forward when it comes to trying to deal with climate change. 


In fact, what the coalition want to do is put their hand in every person's pocket in this country—they want to take money out of your pockets—and hand it over to their big business mates, who are busily polluting this country with CO2. That is what direct action is about: them putting their hand in your pocket, handing the money over to big business and pretending that that is what is going to deal with the climate change challenges for this country.


We know that every economist of any standing—other than the pet economists, the tame economists, of the coalition—says that you need to put a price on carbon to deal with CO2 pollution not only here but around the world. That is why there are states in the United States that are picking up carbon pollution programs that deal with it through a market based system. They are putting a price on carbon. There is a price on carbon going in China. There is a price on carbon in the UK. There is a price on carbon in Europe. Why do they do that? They do that because they understand that, if you want to leave your economy dragging behind the rest of the world, you will not deal with carbon pollution, you will not have your industries adjust to a low-carbon economy and you will not create the new jobs that are demanded by a low-carbon economy. That is the problem we have with this coalition. They are not looking forward. It is about short-term political advantage pitted against the long-term economic reality of what is needed for a strong economy for the future. They deny the economics and the environmental science. 


So we have a situation here where the government are untrustworthy and incompetent. They would rather see this economy stay in the past. They would rather see this economy not move forward while other economies are developing the technology and the jobs of the future, based on a low-carbon-footprint economy. And what are we going to have? We are going to have this nonsense called Direct Action that even the coalition members with any honesty recognise will never deliver for this country. The coalition are prepared to sacrifice future generations for their short-term political gain. They are prepared to sacrifice future generations to make sure that their electoral funds keep coming in from the mining companies and the power companies around this country—because that is what is driving it: their short-term political gain, the money that is pouring into them from the big business end of town, who do not want to have to address climate change. It is all about them. It is nothing about this nation. It is nothing about the economy.


You can see that clearly when you look at the position that the government have adopted on a range of major challenges, not just climate change and not just making sure that we are an economy for the future. In the car industry, it is their ideological bent that is driving their position. They do not like unionised, high-paid workers. So what do they do? They actually dare Holden, GMH, to leave the country. Day in, day out, they are goading one of the biggest employers in the country to pack up and go home. I do not know how that is in the national interest. I do not know how that can be seen to be a competent approach. It is simply being driven by the ideology of the coalition. They do not like unions. They do not believe in climate change. They do not want working people to get a fair go. They really would like to go back to Work Choices in industrial relations. We know that. They have reintroduced the ABCC, with draconian powers against workers. This is a government that is driven by ideological hatred. It is not driven by what is good for the country; it is driven by ideology.


When people have recognised that, they have turned off very quickly, because you cannot trust the coalition. They are secretive, they do not want any accountability and they are prepared to do whatever they can to make sure that short-term politics drives their agenda. You see it every day in here. It is about short termism. It has got nothing to do with the future of this country. You see weak, sycophantic coalition members not prepared to stand up for their communities if there is a bushfire, not prepared to stand up for their communities when jobs are going to be destroyed. They are the weakest, most sycophantic backbench I have ever seen in this place. They will not stand up for their communities, they will not stand up for jobs, they will not stand up for the environment and they will not stand up for future generations. They are really a weird mob. They have got no values and no principles and they are prepared to drag this economy down if it means that they can go on some talkback show and get a pat on the back from Alan Jones or Andrew Bolt. That is what they are all about. They are going for a view that we should simply be a backward economy, with a backward government. This is the most backward government we have ever seen.


Governments fight hard to make changes. We say we want a fair go for the public school system in this country. What do the government do? Apart from setting about to destroy our environmental agenda, an agenda that is important for the long term, they say that, if you are a child of a rich person in this country then you will get looked after, you can go to a rich school and they will keep pouring money in there, but, if you go to a school in Penrith or you go to a school in the Blue Mountains or you go to a public school in Windsor, where I live—




Senator Bushby:
  What about Queensland? 




Senator CAMERON:
  I can understand why the Tasmanians are getting a bit agitated about this, because the Tasmanians are the ones that have got probably the weakest backbench in here. They will not stand up for Tasmania, will not stand up to get a fair go from the federal government. They capitulate—from the leader in here to Senator Bushby. They are vacillating, weak backbenchers, with absolutely no interest in what is here for the future. So what they are prepared to do, if, for example, it is a bushfire in the Blue Mountains, is to say, effectively, 'Never mind getting the same rights for the community in the Blue Mountains; we will give you government spin. We will put the government before the community.' It does not matter if it is jobs in the car industry: 'We will put the government before car industry workers.'




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Cameron, I remind you that, under standing order 193, imputation of improper motives to members is inappropriate.




Senator CAMERON:
  What are the improper motives? What does that mean?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  About the motives for their actions. Continue, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  Well, I think you need to read it carefully, Chair. The actions are clear from the coalition. They do not care about their local communities. They do not care about the education system. They do not care about the climate. They do not care about anything else other than themselves. As long as the money is pouring in from Gina Rinehart and Twiggy Forrest to make sure that their election coffers are kept well and truly balanced, then they do not care about anyone else. It does not matter if you have leaky roofs in the schools in Penrith. It does not matter if you do not have decent conditions in schools in Penrith; as long as the money goes to the private school system, they are happy. So we know what they are all about: they are all about looking after the big end of town, not anyone else.


That is why they want to get rid of the Climate Change Authority. That would be a check and balance on this terrible government the community has already said is no good, on a government that is one of the poorest ever to start off in this country. The public are onto them and onto them early. All these policies they said they would deliver are not going to be delivered unless it means crashing jobs for unionised workers in the car industry, unless it means destroying the environment for their short-term political gain. That is what they are about. They are the most hopeless government that has ever come in here. They have had the shortest honeymoon period of any government in the history of this country. They want to destroy the environment for the sake of their mates in big business. They have no capacity to stand up for the local communities. They have no capacity to stand up to big business. They will continue to run a position here that is economically illiterate and environmental vandalism. So I take the view that, the sooner we get to the next election and the sooner you lot are gone, the better, because that is in the interests of this country.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:01):  I rise to contribute to this Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013 debate. Like my colleague Senator Cameron, I do so with a sense of frustration and anger at the thought that, through no other reason than an ideological obsession and political point-making exercise of the coalition, the Abbott government is attempting to undo the architecture that has been put in place around climate change and carbon pricing in this country. That ideology is not based on science or economics and, further, is damaging our reputation as an international player on climate change policy in the world.


It is that issue that I would like to first draw upon. The Climate Change Authority has provided high-quality, independent advice since its establishment in 2012 using expert scientists and economists in the domestic and international arenas. The Climate Change Authority has been referred to as similar to the Committee on Climate Change in the UK—something which is an independent statutory body established by the UK and had its stated purpose, similarly, to advise the UK government and its devolved administrations on emissions targets and report to parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. That is very similar to the role that the Climate Change Authority has been carrying out. It has been providing vitally important information for tackling climate change and accelerating the roll-out of clean-energy jobs and clean energy itself in Australia.


But already we know that the coalition has abolished the climate commission. It has already, as we know, attempted to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Now it is attempting to abolish the Climate Change Authority.


As I said, like the UK, this organisation is set up independently to provide expert advice about emissions reductions targets and the scope for ongoing emissions reductions in Australia. We know the international community is watching Australia, and has been watching very closely since 7 September, because of this fixation of the new government on repealing all the climate change architecture that was put in place by the former Labor government under the stewardship of the then minister, Greg Combet. They are watching because Australia will soon take over the leadership of the G20 and, when it does that, it has the ability to have strong and effective action in its leadership role against the issues of ongoing emissions, global issues of climate change and the like. So countries are recognising that Australia is going to take over that leadership role and are concerned that their hopes of any kind of strong and effective action on climate change will not be there under Australia's leadership, will be incredibly diminished under Australia's leadership as opposed to the position Australia took to the various international fora on climate change it participated in during the last government.


Despite that, of course, Prime Minister Tony Abbott apparently does accept that climate change is happening. I think he said as much in a recent press conference in November. He said he accepts climate change is happening and humans are contributing to it. So, if the Prime Minister can say clearly now that he has been converted into this space that says climate change is happening—and I have to say I am pleased he has—then surely he needs to recognise that, in being the leader at the G20, he needs to take strong and effective action on climate change. If the coalition and the Prime Minister think Direct Action policy—which is the only thing they still have lingering somewhere on the table; it might be under a few documents and books, but I think it is still there as a coalition policy—is strong and effective action to take to the G20 table when we take over that leadership role, I think that the Prime Minister would be laughed out of the room, quite frankly.


There are already scientists, economists and a lot of independent think tank contributors in this space, who probably know a hell of a lot more than many of us here, coming out very clearly and saying that the coalition's Direct Action policy is simply not going to do anything near being effective or providing strong action on climate change. Many economists and scientists for some time now have been telling the coalition that their Direct Action policy is not good enough. They have been telling the coalition that an emissions trading scheme is the most efficient and effective way to tackle climate change, and in fact we know that there are members of the coalition government who think so themselves. Yet the coalition will continue to believe that Direct Action will be the best way forward, despite those economists and those scientists saying that Direct Action will not work.


The other very disappointing part of where we find ourselves with this bill before us is that it also shows that the coalition not only want to repeal the various parts of the architecture of climate change policy that we have in this country but also are now turning away from any kind of participation in international forums on this issue. I want to raise one particular one which has occurred recently, and that is of course the United Nations climate change talks in Warsaw in Poland. The Australian government was unable to send a ministerial representative to those talks. With negotiations from all over the world taking place in Warsaw, what kind of message does it send to the international community when Australia cannot even send a minister or a parliamentary secretary to those climate change talks? It is snubbing the international community on this issue. We all know that climate change is an international issue. That is why we were playing our part in introducing a climate change policy that included carbon pricing, moving to an emissions trading scheme: so that it would be part of an international economic framework for tackling climate change. Yet here Australia is, not even at the negotiating table. So it is not even that we are repealing the architecture we have; we are even turning our backs on the rest of the international community.


It is simply embarrassing, yet here we will be next year, at the G20, taking over that leadership, with all of those countries being very aware that since this government has come to power we have not participated on the international stage on this issue of climate change. I think that is absolutely appalling and shows how far backwards we have come from where we were prior to 7 September this year. I can only think of what the EU would be thinking of Australia right now. I know that it would not be in a very favourable light on the issue of climate change.


Of course, it is not just economists and scientists who have come out very strongly about Direct Action not working and about an emissions trading scheme being the best way forward for tackling climate change. The chairman of the Climate Change Authority, to the abolition of which this bill pertains, has clearly come out calling on government to retain this independent body and not to abolish the Climate Change Authority. He has challenged some of the arguments put by government—I think by Environment Minister Greg Hunt—on the issue of closing this authority being about reducing bureaucracy and moving climate change advice into either the federal environment department, the CSIRO or the Bureau of Meteorology. He has challenged that, because this was about frank, fearless, good and independent advice coming from an independent body. That is what this authority is still able to provide, and that is what the Australian government will be giving up if they abolish it. I quote from the Chairman, Mr Bernie Fraser, who says:


On a subject as complex as climate change, I would have thought every government—whatever its complexion—would want to get good independent advice … I find it a bit frustrating this opportunity … seems to be foreclosing a bit with the present government. I think that's a disappointment.


That is very much a disappointment and it is very similar to what we heard from the chairwoman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who similarly made an appeal to government to not axe the CEFC. So you have very respected, intelligent, well-known people in this climate change space in very important roles as chairpersons both pleading to government not to undo some of this architecture of climate change policy.


The comments by Minister Greg Hunt in relation to abolishing the Climate Change Authority and having the ability to get that same advice from inside bureaucracy from the CSIRO is quite bizarre because it was not long ago that this government was announcing cuts to the CSIRO. Not only is it expecting public servants to give independent advice but it is also asking for that advice from a body of the public service that has recently had an announcement of job cuts. That shows again that this government has certainly still got its training wheels on. I do not think those training wheels are going to come off for a very long time. In fact, I think more training wheels will need to be added.


When we talk about climate change policy, this government is all over the place. It is stuck and hell-bent on this ideology that it is against carbon pricing, that it is not going to have anything to do with being an effective leader on climate change policy. It is stuck on that approach. Despite the economists, despite the scientists it continues to trot out this mantra. Yet we know very well that there are key members of this government, some of whom are around that cabinet table, that were once very much for an emissions trading scheme, just like their then leader, Prime Minister John Howard.


It was actually the Howard government—the only thing I would give credit to the Howard government for—that had the foresight to look ahead and think, 'We need to be a part of this international fray. We need to act on climate change and the best way to do that is through the introduction of an emissions trading scheme.' Key members of this government were part of that belief with then Prime Minister John Howard. They are still there now yet they are continuing day after day to trot out this mantra that they are against pricing carbon, they are against an emissions trading scheme. They want put their heads in the sand into some direct action hole, which leads to nowhere. We have been told it leads to nowhere by the economists and by the scientists. All it does is leave Australia as a laughing stock in the international community. We came so far. We created the architecture for tackling climate change and for doing our bit in the international community. We were ready to start trading permits with the EU and were ready to have an emissions trading scheme, like so many parts of the world have introduced or are introducing. Now we have gone tenfold backwards and it is an embarrassment.


As I said at the outset, when we do take that leadership position at the G20 next year, it will all come to the fore that Australia's leadership will be lacking on climate change. This very serious issue has overwhelming evidence and the global issue of climate change needs to be taken seriously by our generation for the next generation and so on. That leadership will be lacking at the head of the G20 table by Australia and that is a sheer embarrassment.


There is time for this government to reflect upon what it has done, to move from its fixated ideology and recognise it needs to play a role in effective and strong leadership action on climate change. That action of course is not Direct Action. Direct Action is going nowhere and it is not just me saying this. So many independent thinkers in the community are saying this.


The Climate Change Authority acts very similarly to the UK's committee on climate change, which has also been providing independent advice on the issue of emissions reduction. To abolish this authority would be another step backwards, just as it was a step backwards to abolish the Climate Change Commission and just as it was a step backwards to attempt to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We need the architecture that we have in place on climate change so that we can play our part in the international community and, ultimately, reduce carbon emissions in this country.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-12-11,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:21):  As you are aware, Acting Deputy President Fawcett, you were on the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee which held an inquiry into this very piece of legislation, the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. Senator Singh said, 'Yes we need international action.' That is exactly right. I wonder if Senator Singh can recall a former Prime Minister, Mr Kevin Rudd, just before the election, saying the carbon tax is costing people, is adding to the cost of living and is adding to the cost of doing business. He was correct.


You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, that during the inquiry the National Farmers Federation said that the carbon tax was costing the average farm in Australia about $10,000, yet farmers have to compete in international markets where many—even most—have nowhere near that cost put on them for any climate change action. The dairy industry, which is competing in a domestic dollar-a-litre-for-milk war, is hurting financially and trying to survive. The truckies—the very people who literally carry our nation and transport everything from exports to the waterfront to supplies to our country towns around our nation—were going to be hit with another $515 million diesel tax on their diesel fuel under the former government's proposal. This was to occur just as the trucking industry introduced the Euro 4 and Euro 5 motors, which are far cleaner than, for example, the older Detroit diesels and the 14-litre Cummins I used to drive many years ago. 


Then there is the refrigeration gas. This is amazing! An IGA owner in Central West New South Wales had a gas leak in his large refrigerator. He had to put 65 kilos of refrigerant gas back into it. Instead of costing him $26 a kilo, it cost him $150 a kilo. Instead of costing him around $1,650, it cost him $9,750. It cost him $8,000 more to top up the refrigerant gas after fixing the leak in his refrigeration system. I wonder who pays that $8,000? Of course it goes onto the price of the foods and groceries he sells, and the consumers pay for it.


The cement industry is another industry that was hit very hard. We run the risk of shutting down our industries in Australia and see them moving to places like China where they emit more CO2 when they process cement. The current scheme is not working.


I was not amazed to read the column by Samantha Maiden in Sunday's paper, which said that we have virtually had no reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in Australia. In fact, the committee heard that the forecast of around 580 million tonnes of CO2 a year will rise to in excess of 620 million tonnes by the year 2020. There is no reduction. It will just go into the world scheme of emission trading where we will buy about $3.5 billion worth of permits from overseas, from countries who may well defraud and commit fraud in setting up their so-called carbon credits.


We have the Department of Environment and, of course, it will remain. We have the CSIRO and we have the Bureau of Meteorology. We do not need this organisation, which is simply another cost to the taxpayers of Australia, especially businesses. I go back to Samantha Maiden's comments on Sunday that since the carbon tax was introduced—the tax that we were never going to have according to the commitment by former Prime Minister Ms Julia Gillard and former Treasurer Mr Wayne Swan—it has cost $24,000 per tonne of CO2 abatement. That is what it has cost the people of Australia and the industries of Australia.


We now have all of these troubles with the motor vehicle industry. The cost to them and to industry everywhere is unfair. It is currently at $24.15 a tonne, which is the most expensive carbon tax in the world. As I said, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd admitted that in run-up to the 7 September election. He said, 'The carbon tax has got to go. Let's have a cheaper emissions trading scheme for a little while until it goes up to a projected $38 a tonne by the year 2020.' Since the previous government, under pressure from the Greens and Independents Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor, introduced a scheme that is not working, it has cost Australian business and the Australian people $24,000 a tonne. It is not getting rid of CO2 emissions; it is getting rid of jobs. That is all that it is doing.


As I said thousands of times, the Australian people were quite clear about how they voted on 7 September and what our policies were. One policy was to abolish the carbon tax, and another was to abolish the mining tax. That is exactly what will happen. We will go back to the people if it does not. So come to accept that the carbon tax is not working, is a cost on our nation and our businesses, is transferring business and jobs overseas, is having no effect in Australia and is hugely expensive. That is why this bill that we are debating now is part of the carbon tax abolition policies that we went to the people with and that they clearly voted for. This was in a case where the Australian Labor Party had its lowest primary vote for 110 years, dating back to 1903. If they are going to stand in the road, the people will decide.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (12:27):  Having listened to the recent contributions of Senator Singh and Senator Williams, I too have decided to make a short contribution to this debate on the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill 2013. I am very concerned, and I think all senators should be very concerned, that if this bill is passed and if the Climate Change Authority (Abolition) Bill becomes law, it would significantly weaken Australia's ability to understand and tackle climate change.


Of course we need to acknowledge that climate change is a complex issue for all governments. Not just the Australian government, but for the entire international community. It is complex in relation to its environmental aspects. It is complex in relation to its economic aspects, and it is complex in relation to its social aspects. As the scientific case for climate change grows stronger and stronger, so does the importance of taking responsible and effective action to minimise its impacts.


The truth is that the facts are that dealing with climate change is assisted by an agency like the Climate Change Authority, so that all the elements, all the key strands of environmental, planning, economic and social research can be brought together and so that quality, expert advice can be provided to government. The Climate Change Authority should remain to provide the highest quality advice on climate policy, to take into account expert scientific and economic advice and to take into account developments in the international arena. I say that expert advice should be treasured, not junked; climate change policy should be directed by evidence and facts rather than by fear and prejudice and political opportunism.


The Climate Change Authority was designed to take all the short-term, mindless and silly politics out of the climate change debate. In this regard, of course, the Climate Change Authority in Australia has many similarities to the United Kingdom's Committee on Climate Change. I think it is worth the Senate noting that successive British governments, governments of differing political persuasions, have benefited from such advice. Australians, in my view, deserve an approach to tackling climate change that respects the scientific and economic consensus, where facts, not fear, set and drive public policy. Of course, the Climate Change Authority here in Australia is already providing this advice—providing strong advice based on scientific and economic evidence.


Of course, we can acknowledge that it is for government and for the parliament to decide how they might respond to the advice they receive. We all accept that. However, I fear that, without such advice, government strategy and government decision making about climate change will be less than adequate—will be ad hoc and will be uninformed. Of course, I suppose to some extent the risk is that it will be informed, but by focus groups and the ignorant, not by experts. Abolishing the Climate Change Authority is a short-term political gesture that is simply not in the national interest.


It is true, I think, and fair to say, that the Climate Change Authority has a strong record in providing independent, frank and fearless advice to government on a range of critical matters: matters such as Australia's emissions reduction targets and caps for carbon pricing; matters such as progress towards meeting our medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets; matters such as the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System; matters such as carbon farming; and matters such as the renewable energy target. The advice that is provided on these critically important aspects of climate change policy must be based on scientific and economic research and it must be independent, and that is the advice received from the Climate Change Authority. That is the advice; that is its nature. I say that independence is essential.


The Climate Change Authority's board has an excellent scientific, economic, industry and also academic pedigree, making the authority well placed to deliver considered and expert advice to government. We must acknowledge in this debate that the Climate Change Authority uses evidence based policy. The Climate Change Authority is an important tool in the battle to avoid dangerous climate change. It is an important tool for any federal government, whatever its political persuasion, so the government can be assisted in developing and reviewing climate change policies. I say that the Climate Change Authority is the right body to do this job.


I note that the opposition whip in the Senate has a close interest in this, so much so that she is waving her hands. Were you waving them at me? It is rare in the chamber, as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, to have such a level of support that the opposition whip would enter the chamber and wave her hands in support of a speaker. I suspect even Senator Williams and Senator McKenzie have never seen such extraordinary support provided by the whip of any major political party to a mere humble backbencher on his feet in a debate like this. I am really knocked over by that level of support.




Senator Williams:
  Flattery is the word.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I am flattered. Flattery, as you know, Senator Williams, will get you everywhere in politics. 


Getting rid of the Climate Change Authority would mean that Australia would no longer be taking the battle against climate change seriously. It is as simple as that. Despite the scepticism of some, the reason temperatures are rising is not an issue of serious debate. As I have on so many occasions now over many years, I want to stress the issue of climate change science, because the overwhelming majority of scientists agree that human activity is the principal cause of climate change. The evidence is in: humans are responsible for climate change. The evidence is compelling, it is unequivocal and it is growing. 


I know that there are some who wish to argue a different position. I accept that opponents of the scientific basis of climate change are entitled to their view, but I do not expect such views to be taken seriously, because global warming is not a giant conspiracy. It is not an abstract theory, but part of a new reality that we all face—that Australia faces; that every nation in the world faces. As I say, I have spoken for many years now on many occasions about the science of climate change. It should be a guide to what we do because the science of climate change is becoming surer, not less certain.


I would refer interested senators to the International Panel on Climate Change and its most recent report. I do not want to traverse the ground that I covered in a recent speech in the Senate about that report. Suffice to say the IPCC predicts that if carbon dioxide emissions only increase at the minimal rate, then global average temperature could rise by 0.9 degrees to 2.3 degrees Centigrade by the end of the century. But, if the worst-case scenario is met, this could be as much as 3.2 to 5.4 degrees Centigrade. 


Let's look at our most recent experiences in Australia—not what might happen, but what actually has happened. Australia has just experienced its warmest September ever; its hottest summer day on record, 7 January 2013; its warmest winter day on record, 31 August 2013. And this year, 2013, is on track to be the warmest year on record. According to the World Meteorological Organization, all the warmest years across the planet have occurred since 1998. Even the coldest years are warmer than anything before 1998. This means we are committed to a warmer future—so you better get used to it. These numbers cannot be fudged, they cannot be spun, and nor should anybody try to do so. Increasing average temperatures is affecting human health; it affects animals, it affects plants, it affects agriculture, it affects industry—it affects so many parts of our lives. It is also having knock-on effects on the weather, as we know, with a warming ocean increasing the intensity of storms and melting the polar icecaps.


Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. So I say yet again: it is crucial that we focus on the science of climate change and that we consider the most efficient methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To do this Australia needs long-term bipartisan strategies in place, based on expert advice, so it is so short-sighted to abolish the Climate Change Authority. That is why the opposition opposes the legislation.


Debate interrupted.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-12-11,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I rise today to speak about the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal and the role it plays in the safety of our truckies. The mission statement of the tribunal is listed as: firstly, making road safety remuneration orders; secondly, approving and assisting with negotiations for road transport collective agreements; thirdly, dealing with certain disputes related to road transport drivers, their employers or hirers and participants in the supply chain; and, fourthly, conducting research into pay, conditions and related matters that could affect safety in the road transport industry.


I want to take you back to March 2012 when this legislation was before the Senate—and I respect those who are now opposite, people like Senator Sterle, about needing more safety in the transport industry. The last thing we want to see is our truckies—or anyone for that matter—killed on our roads. I made the comment then that I had no major problems with the legislation, but I queried whether it would be the silver bullet to prevent deaths. I warned at the time that the tribunal should not be stacked with members of the Transport Workers Union. In fact, I said:


Have people on the tribunal from the transport industry—people who know the industry and who are in the industry—not just those who are representing the workers. Then, and only then, will you see fairness in the tribunal. 


Recently I sat down with the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association. This is a group that represents hardworking road transport companies and workers, many of them based in small communities of regional and rural Australia, who provide the first and last link of the supply chain for Australia's agriculture industry. I see them every day of the week when I am home in Inverell. There are truckies bringing the cattle into the Inverell abattoirs and truckies then taking the containers off to the waterfront at Brisbane, providing a vital service to industry to survive and providing food not only to Australians but also to thousands, perhaps millions, of people around the world. The Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association supports the review of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal—and I will get to that review in more detail later. It said to me that there are problems in the industry that need addressing such as payment time frames and payment for all work time including waiting and washing. 


Let us look at their particular concerns. The association has grave concerns about two aspects of the draft Road Safety Remuneration Order. These are the requirements for mandatory written contracts and for safe-driving plans. What I am getting to is red tape and paperwork that will not achieve anything. It will not provide safety and will be of no benefit. When you put this extra red tape and costs onto our truckies, who pays for it? I am talking livestock transport here. They have to do out a plan and a contract, which means more time for the grazier or the farmer, as we know, who is running the sheep and cattle or perhaps even goats. So it is more cost to the grazier, the landowner—our food-providers, if you want to call them that—and who pays more to the farmer? No-one does. They are the price-takers. They will cop the burden, as always. It makes a very good case for special circumstances requiring the ongoing use of verbal contracts in the rural and remote transport sector—not a written contract, not a written driving plan, a plan of the route the truckie is going to take, but a verbal plan, and I will get to that more in a minute as well. 


Hardly any work carried out by livestock transporters or grain carriers is done under an ongoing written contract. It is seasonal work. The wheat harvest is now coming to a conclusion in many areas. It has finished up in the north of the state in Queensland, though, sadly, not with very good crops this year because of the dry winter. Down south in New South Wales and into Victoria, there are very good crops but late frosts have caused damage. There are the truckies out there carrying the wheat to the silos and perhaps even storing in sheds on the farm. Some obviously have made it to parts of consumption.


If it is seasonal work, jobs are allocated here and there. It is very random. Certainly, some carriers could be on a retainer with regular work, such as feedlot to abattoirs, consistent business contracts, or carting grain to feedlots for the fattening of steers for market. But because of the very nature of the work, the truckie could be a subcontractor one day and prime contractor the next, so it is changeable and there should be flexibility. The truck cab becomes their office and their work regime is vastly different from that of someone running up and down the east coast of Australia on an interstate trip. Quite simply, mandatory written contracts are not always possible or feasible, and oral contracting must be allowed to continue. The Fair Work Act does say that a contract may be written or oral.


Now to the other worry, mandatory safe-driving plans. The Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association point out to me that it is just not practical for a safe-driving plan to be agreed to between the hirer and the contractor for short-notice, long-distance work—let alone require others in the supply chain to witness the arrangements. 


I will give an example. A very good friend of mine is someone I became very good friends with very early in 1960 when we walked into school as five-year-olds. He runs a double-deck sheep and a single-deck cattle truck in South Australia in Jamestown where I grew up. He may get a call today asking if he can come up to Umberatana Station tomorrow to take a load of sheep out, about 220 wethers. What paperwork has he got to go through? He has been up to the Flinders Ranges a hundred times. He knows the road. He might have to take them down to the Adelaide saleyards. When he gets there they might say, 'Look, 100 of the wethers were a bit light-on in weight. We are now going to put these 100 dry ewes on. They are weighing better.' So once again his load has changed. This is paperwork. There is nothing wrong with oral contracts, and the fair work legislation says that. What I am saying is we need flexibility, not more paperwork to achieve nothing. 


As I said when I started, Senator Sterle is a passionate supporter of the truckies and the transport industry, and I am the same—we have both changed plenty of gears in our life. We want to see people safe, but we do not want to see the industry swamped with paperwork without flexibility. The Australian Livestock and Rural Transport Association pointed out to me that it is just not practical for a safe driving plan to be agreed between the hiring contractor for short-notice, long-distance work, let alone to require others in the supply chain to witness the arrangements. If I am on a property in northern South Australia and I ring up a truckie and say, 'Could you do a load of sheep for me?' it is a minute's notice. It might be urgent. They might say, 'There is rain coming in two days' time. You've got to get up this dirt track, in through the station track and get out.' Who is going to witness the arrangements?


What I am saying is that there are laws in place governing fatigue, and we need to see that those laws remain, but do not add another layer of complex regulation and costs. I could take you back to the seventies when I was driving trucks, and really it was a farce. It was dangerous. We would go to places like Coober Pedy through 500 kilometres of terrible road, corrugations and bulldust holes. The trailer brakes were full of dust—just red sand like sandpaper—and often they were too far worn out or out of adjustment. They were dangerous days. 


Perhaps what kept us safe is that we could not go fast. We used to work on an average of 50 kilometres an hour when we went on a trip. We had little horsepower, the trucks were not powerful like today. We had 200 horsepower carting three decks of sheep, two decks of cattle, and if you were not going up the gearbox, you were going down it all day. We could only go along slowly, and that is probably what saved a lot of us from having accidents. Today it is different. A 600-horsepower truck can go along at 100 kilometres up and down. 




Senator Sterle:
  That is more dangerous. You know that.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  What I am saying is that those days were extremely dangerous because we did not have the regulations. We would go into Adelaide after being up a rough track for 500 kilometres and half the lights on the side of our trailers would not be working because the globes had fallen out. We would just clean up and put the globes back in—we just wanted to get there and get the stock unloaded. There was a case where you did not have to abide by your logbook while carting livestock—you were excluded. We drove too long, we got too tired—they were crazy days.


I make the point that Labor and their partners, the Greens, have already done enough damage to the Australian transport industry. The carbon tax was due to start in July next year with the fuel tax credits to be cut by 6.8c per litre. Thankfully the Australian people threw them out in September. Putting another $500 million cost on our truckies and our diesel will achieve what? I will tell you what. The best comment that came out of the Senate inquiry was that of Mr Tony Sheldon, the Transport Workers Union boss. He said two words: death tax. That is how he described an extra $500 million tax on our truckies—a death tax that would sweat the trucks and sweat the drivers. Thankfully it is not going ahead.




Senator Sterle:
  I rise on a point of order. That is a blatant lie from Senator Williams. Tony Sheldon is the only one sticking up for truck drivers in this country, apart from the good supporters of Labor on this side of the chamber. Not one of those on the other side of the chamber are standing up for Australia's truck drivers, and that should be withdrawn. It is an absolute lie and it is a disparagement of Tony Sheldon's character.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Stephens
):  There is no point of order.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  What I will do is get the Hansard from the inquiry. I will gladly send Mr Sheldon's evidence to Senator Sterle's office and state the point where he described it, because I was in the inquiry in Sydney when he quoted it—and that is a fact. You have even got your union calling your proposed carbon tax on the truckies a death tax.




Senator Sterle:
  He is the only one standing up for Australia's truckies. Your lot do not. You do not give a damn—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  The truth does hurt some, doesn't it? What about the live export ban Senator Ludwig implemented in 2001? Talk about being led by the nose. What did that do to the truckies in the Top End? They were put out of work. The trucks were standing idle while we lost the 750,000 head of live exports to Indonesia because of your Prime Minister at the time, Ms Julia Gillard. That is who not knocked that off.


The point I make about this is: do not swamp our regional truckies—who are carting their livestock to the abattoirs, to the market and feeding Australia—with paperwork. The oral contracts are part of the fair work legislation, and if you are going to put paperwork on them, who is going to pay for it? They will pass it down the line to the primary producer. Who does the primary producer pass the cost on to? They have no-one to pass it on to—and we wonder why the average age of a farmer is 58 years of age. Why are the young ones not going on to the farm? It is because the profit is not there, and I salute the new agriculture minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce, for his white paper into the farm-gate price.




Senator Sterle:
  You are a gumby for Coles. You are two faced, Senator Williams. You talk about Coles and yet you have not got the guts to stand up for the average Australian.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take the interjection from Senator Sterle. As I said, I did not have a problem with this legislation when it came out, because I do not want to see truckies done over by the big end of town; but I do not want to see our livestock truckies done over with paperwork and regulation and a tribunal where one person has the power. That is why I welcome the inquiry into this. I am all for support for the survival of our truckies. 


Martin's livestock transport of Scone are good carriers. You see their cattle trucks everywhere. One million dollars it will cost, they told me—that extra tax from your plan in the carbon tax would cost Martin's transport $1 million a year. And to achieve what? No reduction in emissions whatsoever. Are we going to burn less fuel? No, their trucks will still burn eight billion litres of fuel a year. That is the case. Do not swamp our stock drivers and carriers with paperwork to achieve nothing. They are at call, as I said. A typical example is that they get a call from a station owner: 'Can we get this stock out before the rain comes?' What are they supposed to do, sit down for hours and go through paperwork? Who is going to agree to it all? It is outrageous. The Fair Work Act says that an oral contract is binding and that should be stuck to exactly. So that is the situation.



Senator Sterle interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Sterle, Senator Williams has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I agree with you, Madam Acting Deputy President; thank you very much. So that is the point I make. I support safety on the road and I support safety for our truckies by whatever we can do. We have got the national road safety plan coming into place and the national regulations, and the sooner they get here the better so we do not have different weights in different states and all the red tape. But I do not want to see the paperwork swamping them and just being thrown around. We have already got too much paperwork when small businesses, especially owner-drivers, are trying to survive; it is more time and more cost to them, and all so they can do the paperwork. So you are trying to run a small business and the paperwork is swimming all around you and you are drowning in it, and I do not want to see more paperwork. So, regardless of what Senator Sterle says, let us see that people can actually run their business in this country without being swamped by red tape and regulation.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Carr today relating to the announcement by GM Holden of its decision to cease its manufacture of cars in Australia by 2017.


Today is a sad day. It is a sad day for workers employed by General Motors Holden. It is a sad day for their families and for the communities in which they live. It is a sad day for suppliers, including component manufacturers, and it is a particularly sad day for my home state of South Australia and the state of Victoria where these operations exist.


I want to say something today, in this taking note of answers, about the way in which this government has approached these serious issues—which was exemplified again today by the contempt with which the Leader of the Government in the Senate treated serious questions about the plight of workers and their families and the importance of supporting workers and their families. The reality is that in their short time in office this government has spent most of its recent time working to drive Holden out of Australia and championing closure. Well, they have got what they were working for.


Let us go through the facts. Before the election and after, this government said, 'We will take $500 million out of the co-investment for the auto industry that the previous government had put on the table.' This was assistance that was about leveraging investment and jobs here in Australia, with returns not only to workers but also to our economy because of the importance of the manufacturing skills that the car industry contains. What did they promise after that half a billion dollars of cuts? Uncertainty. They said to a company that is competing in a global market that they were going to take half a billion dollars off the table for the industry and were not guaranteeing anything after 2015. That is the uncertainty they placed on General Motors Holden. 


What they did afterwards was say, 'We are going to have a Productivity Commission review. We will have an interim report before Christmas and a final report next year.' In fact, Mr Macfarlane is on the public record as asking Holden to defer any decision as to whether or not it would continue operations until after the Productivity Commission had reported. That was the government's position. Then, all of a sudden, prodded into action because of the Treasurer's folding to the National Party on GrainCorp, the economic drys in the cabinet and the ministry decided that it was a good idea to try and start pushing Holden to make a decision before Christmas. 


And what did they do? I have never seen a government have senior economic ministers backgrounding against a company, day after day, in the way that we have had the misfortune to observe in this last week. Who would have thought that we would see coalition senior ministers backgrounding the media and essentially championing the closure of General Motors Holden. But that is what we have seen from this government—a week of leaking and a week of putting pressure on Holden to make a decision. I again remind the chamber that this was all in the context of them having said to Holden, 'Don't make a decision until after the PC review.' 


All of a sudden, they decided it was in their political interests to try and force Holden to a decision before the PC review. They started with backgrounding last week, and it broke on the ABC, was reported widely in the prints and clearly continued. Senator Abetz keeps saying, 'I am not going to respond. You don't believe everything that is written in the papers.' Well, I do not believe that journalists who are reputable would be making things up about coalition senior ministers backgrounding about the closure of Holden. We then had the Acting Prime Minister writing to the company to demand that they tell people whether or not they have made a decision to close. So on the one hand you have said to defer a decision, and then on the other you champion the closure and put pressure on them. I hope you are happy now, because they have made a decision. The contempt with which this government appears to hold this company and these workers was demonstrated today when I asked a serious question of the man who is supposed to be the Leader of the Government in the Senate—and what does he play politics with? The carbon tax.




Senator Abetz:
  It is very important.




Senator WONG:
  What a complete disgrace you are! A straight question about workers and that is what you come back with. (Time expired)

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:14):  Senator Wong, if we are going to talk about a disgrace, the disgrace is your former government, the Labor government, and the disgrace of the mess that they left this government and the disgrace that we in this government now have to face it. Interestingly enough, we had two or three questions on the car industry and then it was dropped to go on to the other great strength of those opposite, border protection. Senator Kim Carr, can I remind you that when you were the minister one job was lost in the car industry every 19 minutes—that is, three jobs every hour that you were the minister and 72 jobs a day when you were the minister. So don't you come into this place and tell us. You are the hypocrite, Senator Carr, when you come into this place and now try to blame the coalition for a decision that was six years in the making. Don't you come into this place and tell us that story.


Yes, of course, today's announcement that Holden is closing down is a very disappointing one. Holden is an iconic Australian company. It has a very rich Australian history. This decision is disappointing not just for its workers and its suppliers but for all Australians. I remind the Senate that the government was working in a measured and methodical way to assist Holden with their significant challenges as they were adjusting to the high value of the Australian dollar and a highly competitive and fragmented market.


The government has done its very best to support Holden and the automotive industry more generally in this difficult period. The government stands by its position that the Productivity Commission was the best placed body to independently assess all the information and details and to provide a final report by 31 March next year. It was the former Labor government that created the significant sovereign risk in relation to the car industry by continually flip-flopping and chopping and changing policy settings affecting the industry. Yes, it is very disappointing news today but this government has always and will always follow due process and, unlike those opposite, keep our commitments to the people of Australia. As the Treasurer said recently, the future of the car industry is in the hands of the car industry itself.


I take you to the announcement that GM made today. I will quote it again just in case, former Minister Carr, you were not listening when Senator Abetz quoted it. So I am going to quote it to you again. It says:


We are completely dedicated to strengthening our global operations while meeting the needs of our customers … The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production—


I repeat that for you, 'high cost of production'—


small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world.


So what would those high costs of production be? Try the carbon tax, which Holden estimates is about $45 per locally made vehicle; the rates of company tax; the fringe benefits tax. Let us go back to Labor's record on cars. You have absolutely no plan whatsoever. You have no plan, you have no vision and you belted the car industry around. In the last two years, you broke $1.4 billion of your promised funding commitments as you chopped and changed, and that is on top of the carbon tax, which slugged the sector with a further $460 million bill at the worst possible time. Julia Gillard promised $34 million for Ford, which she said would create 300 jobs—another broken promise. In eight months 330 jobs were gone. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:20):  After the Acting Prime Minister's letter to General Motors of yesterday, there was a decision taken in Detroit. So the letter was received yesterday afternoon and a decision was taken in response to that letter, that reckless, cavalier correspondence from the Acting Prime Minister. While the Prime Minister is out of the country, the Acting Prime Minister manages to blow up General Motors Holden. Well, what an achievement is this dishonest and cowardly attack that has occurred on this company, replicated day after day after day by senior members of the coalition and demonstrated on the ABC last Thursday night whereby they said that they had already made a decision. Of course, their aim was to force a decision by General Motors before Christmas.


We all know the truth of this matter. As the minister, I was able to be privy to a series of negotiations with General Motors about their situation in Australia and I know the opposition—that is, the coalition—was fully briefed on the situation at General Motors and they have known for some time what the actual situation has been with General Motors, given what the company's letter of today indicates. The increase in the value of the Australian dollar has increased the costs of production in Australia by as much as 65 per cent, as they have referred to in this letter. The company had said to the Labor government, 'We need to look at the arrangements which occur around the world and we need to look at the business case in Australia,' and this government was provided with the same information when they came into office. As for the government, at the Elizabeth plant in Adelaide, Minister Macfarlane said he wanted the company to defer any decision until such time as the Productivity Commission had reported. But yesterday the Acting Prime Minister wrote a letter to General Motors and demanded an immediate answer. And of course they have now got their immediate answer.


They have got their immediate answer, and the actions in the House of Representatives yesterday—following, as I say, seven days of abuse of this company by senior members—meant that the industry insider said that the company felt 'bullied and hectored'. What a hell of a way to run a foreign investment strategy in this country, to bully and hector a major manufacturing company—probably the biggest manufacturing company in Australia; probably the most important company in Australia because it stands at the centre of ensuring the terms of our industrial R&D in this country. It is a company which has, in fact, contributed, according to its advice, in return for $1.8 billion in Commonwealth assistance, $1.4 billion in tax revenue, and it has paid $21 billion to other businesses over the past 10 years. It is a company that has made a huge contribution to this country. The situation now is we have a government which has sought, because of its ideological obsessions, to destroy this company's manufacturing capabilities in this country. We have a situation in which General Motors notes, in the statement that was issued at two o'clock today:


GM remains committed to the automotive industry in Australia and New Zealand. We recognize the need for change and understand the government’s point of view.


What is the government's point of view? First point: we take $500 million out of the industry. Second point: we attempt to establish a Productivity Commission inquiry, but demand immediate decisions. Third point: we heap abuse upon abuse upon abuse of this company's executives and this company's contribution to Australia.


What do you expect? What do you expect when you get the answer that you have asked for? You get the answer you have been demanding. You have pursued a vendetta against this company, and you have now got what you have asked for. You established a Productivity Commission inquiry—I have said for some time I was very, very concerned that what you were actually doing was establishing a coroner's inquiry, a post-mortem process. The only difference here is the coroner was actually pleased about the death. That is the situation with this government. They have been seeking this result. They have been pursuing a campaign against manufacturing in this country, particularly automotive manufacturing. They have campaigned against the international automotive industry; they have been playing chicken with this company, and we now have the result. The consequences are going to be a social and economic catastrophe for this country, and you, Minister, and your government are directly responsible.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2013-12-11,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:25):  I follow Senator Carr's hysterical and rather incoherent rant, and share with Senator Wong, quite frankly, that this is a very sad day. As a South Australian, it is a sad day to see 1,600 jobs at the Holden car plant disappear by 2017, and to see the flow-on effects that will no doubt impact on the South Australian economy.


But I have to say we were warned about this some time ago. Seven years ago in this place I stood up and I said that if Mr Kim Carr ever became industry minister, there would be no car industry in this country. And what followed was the full Chairman Mao outburst and rhetoric and 20 minutes of abuse about how I did not know what I was talking about. But Senator Carr himself has overseen for the past six years the closure of Mitsubishi and the announcement that Ford is going, and the legacy of his mismanagement, and the Labor Party's mismanagement, of the manufacturing industry in this country is the announcement by Holden today.


The tragedy of Senator Carr is that he suffers from veritaphobia. Veritaphobia is a fear of telling the truth, and this is what we have got on that side of the chamber. He will not acknowledge that his motivation and his interest in the motor vehicle industry were driven more by his factional powerbroking and his attempt to stifle the short cons in Victoria and by his desire to boost his faction ranks by unionising the workforce, giving them whatever they wanted to amass more union muscle for him. That was his interest. He was not interested in sustaining the industry as a whole; he was more interested in sustaining his union base. That is the power—the misuse and abuse of power—that we see from the other side of the chamber.


It is worth reflecting that after six years of Labor, we have $300 billion worth of debt in this country and nothing to show for it. No motor vehicle manufacturing industry.




Senator McEwen:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The motion before the chair today is in relation to the automotive industry and the closure of Holden. I would ask you to bring the senator to the topic.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order, Senator McEwen.




Senator BERNARDI:
  It is amazing: Senator McEwen is following in Senator Moore's footsteps of baseless and useless points of order. Couldn't you hear, Senator McEwen, the fact that you squandered $300 billion—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  To the chair.




Senator BERNARDI:
  of borrowed money and we have no motor vehicle manufacturing industry to show for it. You might be proud of that legacy, but I certainly am not. Shame on you. You remained silent and forgotten through the entire years of the Labor government, and now you stand up here giving us pious rhetoric.


This is an opposition that is absolutely flawed, and it is so embarrassed by its own track record it is trying to blame others for its mismanagement. I have to say that I thought Senator Carr, with his fear of the truth, his veritaphobia, actually let something slip; he blurted out something during his question today. In one of the questions he asked he said the exit of Holden was 'tragic and unavoidable'. A true word is often spoken by a slip of the tongue, because Senator Carr presided over and saw all the inside nitty-gritty about the industry when he was industry minister and he put it in the too-hard basket. He said: 'No, I don't want to deal with this. I've borrowed $300 million on behalf of the Australian people, but I don't want to save their manufacturing industry.'


I am sick of the hypocrisy on the other side. We inherited a basket case of a budget. There is no doubt about that. We were elected to fix up the mess that Labor created; the legacy of Labor's six years, their torrent of abuse of office, is going to be with us for some time yet. Holden, unfortunately, is a casualty of that. There are 1,600 jobs going in my state of South Australia, and the flow-on effects are going to be felt for years and years to come. But the blame, fairly and squarely, lies with poor government management by the Labor Party over the last six years.


Senator Carr would have the people of Australia believe that somehow General Motors in Detroit last night just said: 'Let's shut down our South Australian and Victorian manufacturing facilities. Let's do that at a cost of some $600 million.' Unfortunately, we know the Labor Party is cavalier about $600 million, $1 billion and $100 billion, but General Motors are not. They would have been looking at and examining for many years the consequences and the potential costs. We know there are unavoidable issues attached to manufacturing in this country—the high dollar, the tyranny of distance, the relatively small market and so on—but Senator Carr and his cohorts in the Labor Party need to come clean and start telling the truth.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (15:30):  I too would like to take note of answers given by Senator Abetz and others today.




Senator Abetz:
  Just me.




Senator FARRELL:
  Just Senator Abetz. Well, that is sufficient.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  And that is what the motion says, Senator Farrell.




Senator FARRELL:
  I would like to approach this issue from a slightly different angle than the other two speakers from our side. I would like to start by complimenting Mr Abbott on what a terrific Leader of the Opposition he was. His relentless, destructive negativity as Leader of the Opposition worked a treat. The only problem is he did not stay as the Leader of the Opposition.




Senator Abetz:
  Pity the people got it wrong! What arrogance!




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Abetz, we have now seen in this country the consequences of electing somebody like Tony Abbott as leader of this country, as Prime Minister.




Senator Abetz:
  'Mr Abbott' to you. 




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister. We have now seen the consequences of letting this man become Prime Minister. On 7 September, Mr Abbott said to the Australian people, 'Australia is open for business.' Tell that to the thousands of Holden workers who today found out that their company is going to close in this country. Tell that to the extra thousands of suppliers who are going to lose supply contracts. This is not just about South Australia and Victoria, where of course these factories are located. Holden is an Australian icon. It is a tragic day when we hear that this company is going to close.


Yesterday it was very clear that there was an emergency on our hands and we had to do something to try to save this company. We know Minister Macfarlane was keen to do it and wanted to do it. What did the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Truss, do? He wrote a letter to the company. Given what we know about the circumstances and what we know about the urgency of the issue, why didn't he ring Mr Devereux? He had just left the Productivity Commission hearing. Why didn't he get on to him and say, 'What do we need to do urgently to save this company?'


The government quoted Senator Kim Carr exhaustively during question time. We know from what Senator Carr has said that it was not going to take very much money to save this company—$150 million or thereabouts was going to keep the company in Australia, keep the company manufacturing cars and keep all of those people in South Australia and Victoria in jobs. Why didn't the government do it? Minister Macfarlane wanted to do it. Where was Minister Pyne? Minister Pyne comes from South Australia—




Senator McEwen:
  Sadly.




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, very sadly. He is the only South Australian minister in the Abbott cabinet. Where was he? Why wasn't he standing up for South Australia?


We know that the workers themselves understood the severity of this problem. They made concessions. John Camillo, who is a tremendous trade union leader, ensured that the workers at the Holden factory in South Australia made some concessions. They were prepared to make concessions. Minister Macfarlane was prepared to make concessions. The opposition were prepared to back the government on this. There could have been a bipartisan position, but the government dropped the ball. It has been under their watch that that great Australian icon has announced it is closing down. I think it is a tragedy that this has occurred. It was avoidable. We could have saved this company. We could have continued to manufacture in this country. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-12-11,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill, and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



After the deaths of 202 people, 88 of whom were Australians, in the Bali terrorist attacks of 2002, the then Howard Government introduced legislation to make it a crime to harm Australians overseas. The definition of harm includes murder, manslaughter, and intentionally or recklessly causing harm.


At the time, the legislation to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 was made retrospective to cover occurrences dating from 1 October 2002. This covered the so-called ‘Bali Bombings’ but not cases prior to that date.


I have been approached by a family who have been directly impacted by the limited time period that applies to the provisions under Division 115 of the Act. Their family member was brutally murdered before the 1 October 2002 date, and the case has never been resolved.


The amendments in this bill remove the commencement date for these provisions, and therefore allow them to apply to any case before 1 October 2002 that meets the criteria under Division 115. The aim of this bill is to ensure all Australians can receive justice under these provisions, not just those who were affected after a certain date.


The Act itself already contains safeguards to prevent unmeritorious claims. Section 115.6 contains provisions relating to bringing proceedings under this division, and requires that proceedings must not commence without the written consent of the Attorney-General. This measure will ensure that only cases with evidence that would likely lead to a successful prosecution would be pursued.


Further, in response to concerns regarding the retrospectivity of criminal law, it is important to note that the original bill that established these provisions, the Criminal Code Amendment (Offences Against Australians) Bill 2002, was in itself retrospective. The Bill itself was assented to on 14 November 2002, but the provisions came into effect from 1 October 2002. Presumably this was to ensure the Bali Bombings, which occurred on 12 October 2002, were covered by the provisions.


As such, in response to criticisms of retrospectivity and changing the law to suit a particular case, the bill that established Division 115 in 2002 forms the precedent for the measures in this bill.


Equally, this bill deals with crimes of murder, manslaughter and causing serious harm, which already exist in all other jurisdictions. As such, this bill does not establish a crime retrospectively, but instead extends the capacity for involvement of Australian law enforcement that this Division already provides.


Ultimately, this question is one of support for Australian families who have lost loved ones overseas or who have suffered serious injury as a result of a criminal act. It provides a further avenue for investigation when local authorities do not have the ability or will to pursue a case, and provides an avenue of justice where there would otherwise be no resolution.



It makes no sense to limit a person’s access to justice when the crimes concerned include murder and manslaughter. These are rightly considered inexcusable acts, and the right to seek justice in these cases should not be limited. As Martin Luther King said: “Law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice, and when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress.”

  The government will not be supporting this motion. As previously stated, Operation Sovereign Borders is a military-led border security operation. It has clear, established and communicated protocols designed by the joint-agency taskforce led by Lieutenant General Campbell to support the effectiveness of the operation. These procedures ensure that people smugglers do not use official information to sell and promote their product and to create false perceptions amongst potential illegal entrants to Australia. Information regarding the incident to which the motion refers has been released in the form of two media releases from the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on 5 December, in addition to comments by both the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Lieutenant General Campbell in the Operation Sovereign Borders briefing on Friday, 6 December.

Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  There are two parts to this motion. The first part relates to whaling; the second part relates to illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean. The exact wording for both sections came directly from the coalition's policy. The part relating to whaling was taken word-for-word from Minister Hunt's website. The second section on illegal fishing and patrolling illegal fishing was taken from the coalition's election plan on fishing. I highlight the words:


… ensure that the resources devoted to patrolling illegal foreign fishing are not diverted to other activities.


The problem we have at the moment is that our custom-built boat for the Southern Ocean, the Ocean Protector, is off Christmas Island acting as an expensive water taxi. It is needed in the Southern Ocean and it should be off Macquarie Island. I expect the coalition to support today's motion given that these exact words are word-for-word from their policy documents.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CASH:
  Australia's views on whaling are well known. The Australian government strongly opposes all commercial whaling, including Japan's so-called scientific whaling. We hope that the International Court of Justice makes a positive decision shortly and that there is no attempt at whaling. If, however, the fleet set sail, as it appears they may have started to, a commitment to monitoring and observing remains undiminished. Beyond that, we will obviously not pre-empt or discuss operational activities. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is working with other government agencies on how it can best support the government's commitment in the Southern Ocean, including the deployment of a border protection asset for this purpose.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT
 (16:15):  The President has received a letter from Senator Siewert:


Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


'The Abbott Government's sacrificing of the climate and our Great Barrier Reef with its approval of the world's largest coal port at Abbot Point and the Arrow LNG plant in the Reef.'

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2013-12-11,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (16:16):  I rise with great sadness to talk about the fate of the Great Barrier Reef after the so-called Minister for the Environment last night approved the world's biggest coal port at Abbot Point in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area.


Mr Deputy President, you might think that coal ports do not really belong in a World Heritage area, and you would be right. But that did not stop their approval last night which, sadly, also included the fourth coal seam gas liquefaction plant on Curtis Island in Gladstone Harbour, which is now infamous for the terrible environmental destruction that it has faced following the biggest-ever dredging program in Gladstone Harbour that the reef had ever seen—of course, all for coal seam gas export. We know that coal seam gas is terrible news for our farmland and for our water, as well as for our reef, pockmarking our best food-producing land and contaminating and potentially reducing the groundwater levels of our aquifers in Queensland and right across the country.


Certainly, Mr Hunt's approval last night of these mega-fossil-fuel projects within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area came as a shock to many. I think the testament to that is information that Australians last night were calling the minister's office until about midnight, protesting against his decision. It is clear that people actually want the reef protected. They acknowledge that it is one of the seven natural wonders of the world, that it is the biggest living organism that can be seen from space and that it is a biodiversity icon that the world has charged us with protecting. We should be proud of that and do everything we can to protect it.


I was very pleased when Australians last night told the Minister for the Environment that they do not want the reef sacrificed for the private profits of overseas mining companies—because that is who will benefit from these approval decisions. There will be spurious job claims made, as they often are and, naturally, they will not stack up in the numbers promised. That is just how it goes, sadly. But what we will see in terms of jobs is a real threat to the 63,000 people who need a healthy Great Barrier Reef for their jobs and for their livelihoods—be they fisher folk, tourism operators or small business folk up and down the coast.


I think it is a crime to prioritise the private profits of offshore mining companies ahead of the beauty of the reef and ahead of those 63,000 Australians who need that reef for their livelihoods and for their families' livelihoods. For all of the talk we hear about the economy and jobs, we have seen the true colours of this government—the Abbott government—that actually they care more about big mining companies than they do about Australian jobs, let alone the environment. Sadly, the latter was no news to anyone; but perhaps the former does come as news to people who might have thought about supporting the Abbott government.


Minister Hunt has been on the airwaves today trying to justify his decision. In fact, I thought it was quite amusing to hear Senator Cormann say that this world's biggest coal port is going to be good news for the reef, because it is going to fix water quality! I all but laughed. One of the conditions that Minister Hunt has imposed would require the dredging company to save 4½ million tonnes of sediment from entering the reef catchment. That is a noble aim, in fact an aim that has occupied the Commonwealth, the Queensland government and many hard-working Queensland farmers for the last five years, whereupon with all of that resourcing—200 million bucks—they have been able to save 200,000 cubic metres of sediment.


So now, miraculously and magically, Minister Hunt thinks that the dredging company can do better than the Commonwealth, better than the Queensland government and better than those farmers are already doing and save 20 times that amount of sediment just so it can have permission to dump that sludge offshore. It is not going to work; we all know it is not going to work. Sadly, we also know that nobody is going to be watching to make sure those conditions are complied with. I wish they were, but they have been sacked! The Campbell Newman government in Queensland has already sacked 220 workers from the environment department and we know that there have been unfortunate retrenchments already from the federal environment department, and we are expecting more under this government's pre-election promises and the Commission of Audit—headed of course by none other than the Business Council of Australia head, Tony Shepherd.


So where are those people who will actually enforce those conditions? They have lost their jobs, much like the tourism operators and the fishers on the reef who will lose their jobs when the reef gets put on the World Heritage endangered list because this government would rather see profits flow offshore to big mining companies than to actually act in the interests of the reef. It is a criminal shame. I have no confidence that the conditions can even be complied with, nor will anyone be paying any attention as to whether they are in terms of the regulators, because they have been sacked.


We had the World Heritage Committee come out and visit the reef the year before last and express extreme concern at the future of the reef. It warned the Australian government and the Queensland government about the effects of mass industrialisation of the reef. It gave the Australian government a very clear warning: if you do not stop this trajectory of destruction we will put the reef on that international list of shame—the list of World Heritage in danger—and downgrade its World Heritage status. Not many other developed countries—in fact, only one other—has a site on that list. That would be a huge blow to our tourism industry. We already know the employment figure, 63,000 people, and much of that is from tourism. People do not come to see World Heritage in danger. They do not come to see coal ports and they do not come to see coal ships. They do not come to see coral that has been smothered with sludge that has been dug up from World Heritage waters and dumped further out into World Heritage waters because it is cheaper for the big mining companies to do that than it is to treat that spoil and dispose of it safely on land. We know what a blow a World Heritage in danger listing would be to our tourism sector and we know it would recognise the peril that the reef is in. Why is this government courting that outcome? Why is it daring the UN to downgrade the reef's status to World Heritage in danger? That is what last night's approval really did. It was like a red carpet invitation to downgrade the reef's status—reckless in the extreme.


Sadly, it has come off the back of a pretty tough week for Australia's environment. On Monday in the House of Representatives this government sought to weaken threatened species protection under those same environmental laws by saying that it was all right for the Minister for the Environment to ignore expert advice on threatened species and the effects a particular project might have on those species—it was okay to ignore expert advice because it is science and they don't really like science that much. They don't need a minister for science and it is kind of inconvenient when science tells you that you shouldn't do the things you want to do, so let's just ignore it! They sought to change the law to allow the environment minister to ignore expert conservation advice. It passed the House of Representatives. I hope it does not pass the Senate.


They did not stop there. I have already spoken of last night's coal port and CSG liquefaction plant approvals, but also yesterday this government sought to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, that wonderfully successful renewable energy bank that is not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions but making money for the taxpayer. This is a profitable investment. They are making a profit. Why on earth, when we are in such a confected budget crisis, would you want to slash a body that is actually making money as well as saving the climate? I do not understand the rationale, but I suspect logic simply does not come into it with this government.


That was yesterday. Today they are moving to abolish protection for the Murray-Darling. The listing of those endangered ecological communities earlier this year has now been disallowed by the House. They do not actually want to protect the wetlands and the Macquarie Marshes that feed and sustain the Murray-Darling Basin. And this Friday, at the Council of Australian Governments meeting, the COAG meeting, the Prime Minister is seeking to sign up yet more states to take over Greg Hunt's job. Minister Greg Hunt does not want his job anymore. He has decided he cannot be bothered giving approvals to big mines anymore. He is happy to let Campbell Newman do that and Barry O'Farrell do that. This plan unwinds the 30 years of history where the Commonwealth has been able to step in and protect icons and species places that are nationally significant. The Prime Minister wants to get rid of that on Friday.


This has been an atrocious week for the environment. It has been a terribly sad week for the Great Barrier Reef and for all of those who love it. We know that it is not just Australians who love our reef. It is hugely popular with international tourists and, in fact, it is sacred in the hearts of many people across the world. We can and should be doing so much better. I will be reintroducing a bill in this place shortly to adopt those World Heritage Committee recommendations to save our reef. It is not that hard. We just have to start putting the reef and the people who rely on it ahead of the interests of the big mining companies. We can do that. It is not that hard. Will this government do it? They have not yet and I remain hopeful, for the sake of those 63,000 Queenslanders and for everyone who loves the reef, that they will soon change their tune.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2013-12-11,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (16:26):  Senator Waters raises her concerns about the Great Barrier Reef. I share her concerns about the Barrier Reef, but under no circumstances do I believe the reef is under threat. Last night the Minister for the Environment put forward plans so that some mining and natural gas facilities could go ahead. They were put forward under the most stringent conditions, where there is going to have to be a net benefit for water quality, $89 million will be contributed to support the health of the Barrier Reef through programs such as Reef Trust and there are 95 environmental conditions at Abbot Point and 53 at Curtis Island.


The problem with Senator Waters is that she lives with rose-tinted glasses. She does not recognise that jobs are created. We have just faced one of the most difficult situations in Australia, with the biggest icon in Australia announcing its closure today, affecting many thousands of jobs and the jobs hanging off it. I do not want to debate the rights and wrongs, who said what and who did this. The main point of my argument is that those jobs have to be replaced somewhere or people will not have the standard of living that they have been able to afford over the last 20 years.


The Arrow liquefied natural gas plant proposal is owned by Shell and PetroChina, it is going to cost $17.46 billion and there will be 3,715 construction jobs and 600 operational jobs. That is vast. That is so many jobs created. When we turn to the Adani project, we are looking at thousands more jobs that are going to open up in Bowen. Senator Waters says there are many people who have been opposing it and ringing up the minister's office complaining about the decision. Well, I can tell Senator Waters that the town of Bowen is absolutely rejoicing. They have had many failures in Bowen. When the abattoirs went, 1,500 jobs went. 


Interestingly, I understand that the town's resident Green is complaining, while her husband and son work at Abbot Point.



Senator Waters interjecting—




Senator BOSWELL:
  That is the information I have, that one of the greenies in Bowen is out there spruiking—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Boswell, please resume your seat.




Senator Waters:
  Thanks, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have a point of order. Senator Boswell has reflected incorrectly and has made an assertion that I know is not correct. I ask him to withdraw that false allegation.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Waters, I regret I did not hear what Senator Boswell said, but I will ask Senator Boswell to consider his remarks and explain them, or reflect on his remarks and perhaps advise the Senate accordingly.




Senator BOSWELL:
  What I said is factually true, as I understand it and as it has been related to me. There is a person in Bowen spruiking the Green agenda who, as explained to me, is a resident Green in Bowen, while her husband and son work at Abbot Point. I am not saying that there is anything wrong. I am not casting any aspersions against anyone. I am merely making a statement that has been related to me by residents of Bowen.


The $10 billion that GVK and Adani are going to proceed with is a railway line. Already they have said that they will put their facilities in Bowen and the people in Bowen are rejoicing about this. So not everyone, Senator Waters, is ringing the minister complaining. 


In the last 12 months the town of Bowen has taken major hits with local businesses closing. The Bank of Queensland has shut its doors, two legal offices and three restaurants have closed, and newsagents have also shut their doors. In July, Bowen residents turned up in the town square to support the Abbot project.


What has happened of course is that the Labor Party dodged this. They would not make the decision. Tony Burke delayed the decision before the last election. Mark Butler also delayed the decision, and this has held up all these jobs that were going to be created. They were afraid of offending the Greens and the latte set in Melbourne and Sydney. But they do not stand up for the blue-collar workers that would get these jobs in Bowen and Collinsville and Abbot Point, and they are the people that the Labor Party are going to need to get them back into government. As long as they dodge the decisions and side with the Greens, then the blue-collar workers who have already made a decision are not going to support a government that cannot take a decision.


Of course these decisions are hard, and I congratulate Mr Hunt for making them. They are hard decisions and he is an environmentalist at heart, but he has made a decision that looks after both sections—the environment, putting on the most stringent conditions, and then recognising that Australia has to have jobs. There has never been a time in Australia's history that I can report, certainly in my time, when the need for creating jobs has been so predominant. As for these changed new conditions, they are not saying that the companies will put these growth-promoting jobs into the community, but that it is possible to do it. They have got to go through a lot further process. But the decision by Adani and by GVK is going to open up thousands of jobs—and I do not want to be accused of going over the top by saying hundreds of thousands of jobs, but certainly thousands of jobs. The Galilee Basin will be open and jobs will flow into the little towns of Jericho and places out there. 


You cannot have wealth in this nation without earnings. Senator Waters believes in the Magic Pudding—you can have everything. I am sorry, Senator Waters, the world is not like that. Your party has, at every opportunity, attacked the coal-mining industry and this, I believe, is another attack. In March 2012 a document called Stopping the coal export boom: funding proposal for the Australian anti-coal mining movement became public. It was a prospectus for large-scale funding to shut down the Australian coal industry. The preparation of the document was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in the USA and endorsed by Greenpeace and a number of national environmental activists. 


One of their prime strategies is to:



… ‘disrupt and delay’ key projects and infrastructure the while gradually eroding public and political support for the industry and continually building the power of the movement to win more. 



That is exactly what you are doing today, and then you are claiming that this has great support. 


I do acknowledge that it has some problems attached to it in professional fishing and amateur fishing. I do believe that there will need to be some offsets for those people. Maybe boat ramps and fishing tables and cleaning tables will have to be offered, and, if significant fishing grounds are going to be lost, then I think there will have to be offsets. Fishermen want to continue to fish. But if they cannot, they are realists. They recognise that they cannot stand in the way of $17 billion or hundreds of billions of dollars of projects that will provide many thousands of jobs. They understand that. But if they are to be removed or if their fishing grounds are to be removed or taken away from them or put out of limits, then there have to be more fishing grounds given to them to compensate for the loss. If that cannot be done, then they have to be compensated to get out of the industry. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2013-12-11,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:37):  I too rise to speak on the matter of public importance. I wanted to take up some of the points Senator Boswell has made, in that we all support the creation of jobs and opportunity in Queensland. I think everyone supports the opportunities that will be presented by the expansion of the terminal at Abbot Point, the Adani project at Abbot Point, the Arrow LNG facility on Curtis Island and the Arrow gas pipeline to Curtis Island. I think even the Greens support the opportunities that jobs will bring.


Let me put forward a note of caution which Senator Boswell did not instil into the debate: it is not only the caveats that Minister Hunt would put on the project to ensure that it meets environmental conditions, it is also the implementation of that to ensure that those conditions are met. It will create opportunity, but it will also create concerns in respect of the environment. 


We have a world-class environment. We have the Great Barrier Reef, which is world recognised. GBRMPA itself—that is the body that looks after the Great Barrier Reef—also has a policy which deals with how to manage the dredging and dredging disposal. This is an issue that has continued for some time and has been dealt with through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, where they provide for how dredging and dredging material disposal will be dealt with, but what is really important here is not only how you manage the issues of dredging through the GBRMPA. With ports within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, you also have to deal with how you are going to manage the terminals, the storage and waste facilities, the cargo, the loading and unloading facilities—all of these things which are part and parcel of the development of operations such as the expansion at Abbot Point.


Let us come back to what the coalition are doing. Before the election, the Abbott government announced in their environmental policy:


We will streamline the environmental approval process for all users—resulting in less duplication across federal and state jurisdictions and delivering a real boost to the nation’s productivity. We will establish a one-stop shop environmental approvals process covering both Commonwealth and state legislation, that maintains high environmental standards, delivers certainty for all users and importantly makes swift decisions.


If you take out the broad motherhood statement that it is seeking to achieve, streamlining—as they call it—is a positive sounding proposition. However, offloading powers to the states without proper oversight and without proper conditions put in place may have a detrimental effect on the environment.


What we are talking about is the devolution of the powers from the federal government not to another state—let us look at the specifics. Let us look at what the Newman government has been doing, because they will be part and parcel of the management of the expansion at Abbot Point to make sure not only that jobs and the economy get a boost but also that the environment is not detrimentally impacted as a consequence. In other words, there is a balance to be struck. I think Senator Boswell was going with the balance towards jobs and opportunity, forsaking the environment. If that was not what he was saying then it certainly sounded very much like it. 


The Newman government cut funding to the environmental defenders office, which provides legal advice to individuals and community groups where they are resisting inappropriate developments—where you want an alternative voice to be heard, where you want a different argument to be put; they shut that down. In their second week in office the Newman government axed the entire Office of Climate Change. They then abolished the waste levy, making Queensland the only mainland state without one. Subsequently, waste from New South Wales is being transported to Queensland to be dumped. That is their response.


Then there are the dirty mine water releases. The Newman government passed legislation, the Economic Development Bill, to allow for the release of excess mine water into the river systems. Subsequently, they announced a pilot mine water release program. They might call it, euphemistically, 'streamlining' the environmental process, but what it ultimately meant was that there would be a reduction in the environmental regulations and controls that are put in place in Queensland. They want to open up national parks to development with the nature conservation amendment bill—another euphemistic sounding name with a completely different result. Currently before the house in Queensland, this bill allows development in national parks. The Newman government initially stopped enforcing vegetation management penalties and has subsequently announced a review into the penalties.


You can start to feel, from the Queensland perspective, that you can start off with a very good program and position. But, in the case of the Newman government, it has chipped away at every environmental control and measure to reduce the burden in these areas to meet appropriate environmental standards. The concern is that in Queensland, in some of these regions—one of them could be Abbot Point—the Newman government might take the same approach 


So you might have a federal government effectively washing its hands of the environmental issue by passing it to the states and the states doing what the Newman government in this instance is doing, backsliding on environmental measures. That would certainly be a concern to this side. It clearly was not a concern to Senator Boswell. Of course, the Newman government reduced the solar feed-in tariff from 44c to 8c—another area where they do not want to assist the environment and what they do want to do is slide away from many of the environmental issues that have been fought and won over the last 10 to 15 years. That leads us to this: on the face of it, when you turn to the developments that are being proposed, the community has a right to be concerned about the potential environmental impacts of the project at Abbot Point.


We expect the government to manage the project's progress and ensure the proponents meet their obligations under the agreement. The government has the responsibility to manage the Great Barrier Reef for everyone, for Australians from the tip of Cape York all the way down to Tasmania, and the onus then is clearly on this government to ensure that the project is managed properly and its decisions do not have a long-term detrimental effect in that region, particularly as to the environment.


On this issue the world is watching. It is the Great Barrier Reef and the world will hold us to account if we do not ensure proper environmental management is put in place. The world will not accept the excuse that we passed it to Queensland and Queensland dropped the ball on the issue. The world will not accept that. It will only look to us, from a Commonwealth perspective, to ensure that we get it right. In this instance, given all of the conditions, we say we will continue to hold this government to account.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-12-11,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:47):  I rise this afternoon to speak to this matter of the future of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is dying and this decision by the Abbott government to allow this massive port expansion development at Abbot Point, as a way of facilitating expansion of coalmining out of the Galilee Basin, will hasten the death of the reef. There is such a thing as being too late. For a very long time scientists have warned about the impacts of global warming on the Great Barrier Reef from coral bleaching, ocean acidification and extreme weather events bashing against the corals, which are already weakened by acidification.


The Great Barrier Reef was listed as World Heritage in 1981. It is the largest coral reef ecosystem on Earth. It was regarded and listed as World Heritage because its values are of outstanding universal value to humankind. All Australians are proud of the Great Barrier Reef. But not all Australians are prepared to accept that it is dying. It is dying and we have to do everything we can to save what we can and build resilience, and you cannot pretend that allowing this massive coal port expansion, with the dumping of three million cubic metres of seafloor dredgings into the reef's waters, is going to do anything other than help to destroy it.


If you think about the reef, there are something like 1,500 species of fish, 360 species of hard corals and 1,500 species of sponges. There is the seagrass, which supports dugong populations and loggerhead, green, hawksbill and flatback turtles. There are 215 bird species. All these are sustained by the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem and what we now know, about that three million cubic metres to be dumped into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park waters, is that that sludge and those silts can travel for 80 kilometres. Please, do not expect anybody here to take seriously the notion of offsets—so we will dump all of this sludge into the Great Barrier Reef and then, however, we will say to the farmers, 'Don't you dump 4½ million cubic metres of sediment onto the reef,' and therefore we will have the farmers stop dumping theirs so we will dump from the coal port and that will be all right. Well, on the basic facts it is not all right. One basic fact is this. In its first five-year phase the reef rescue program, which was well resourced and had huge efforts from farmers backing it, only reduced the sediments entering the reef's waters by one-twentieth of the amount of sludge planned to be dumped offshore from Abbot Point, so 20 times more than has been able to be stopped in the last five years is being planned. So let us abandon this notion of enforcement and compliance—it will not happen.


This is a death sentence for the reef. Not only that, it will accelerate global warming because it is going to facilitate the Galilee Basin coalmines. That coal should stay in the ground. There is no way we should be opening up the Bowen Basin or the Galilee Basin to coalmining, because those two basins alone, if they were a separate country, would be the seventh largest emitter on Earth. So when we hear the coalition go on about what a small emitter Australia is in the global context of climate change, let us note that the seventh largest emitter on Earth would be the two basins in Queensland if you let this go ahead. So not only is this being done for the sake of the coalminers but it is going to kill the reef and accelerate global warming and a feedback loop also goes on towards killing the reef. This is a crime against humanity. That is what it is, and it has got the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott's, and the Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt's, names all over it.


Last year, at the World Heritage Committee meeting in Cambodia, the World Heritage Committee was asked to consider the Great Barrier Reef for inscription on the list of World Heritage in danger, for it to be recommended and to be thought about for the 38th session in 2014. I would suggest that the result of the Abbott government's decision to go ahead with this massive industrialisation of the reef is going to lead to the Great Barrier Reef being listed as World Heritage in danger. That is a major blow to jobs and tourism in Queensland. I can tell you that tourists, divers, people interested in the marine environment are not going to come to Australia, to the Great Barrier Reef, if it is listed as in danger. That is a signal that Australia does not care about it, is letting it go, that it is in bad condition, and they will go to other coral reefs around the world. New Caledonia, for example, has the world's second largest barrier reef. That will become a preferred destination, as will other coral reefs elsewhere in the world.


Up to 63,000 jobs depend on the Great Barrier Reef, and that has a major flow-on for Queensland. I was up there during the federal election campaign and, make no mistake, businesses along the reef are very worried about it. They are also worried that the tourism bodies along the Great Barrier Reef should be shouting from the rooftops about this but are not doing so. The reason they are not doing so is that they have been taken over and they are being financially supported by the mining industry. So when Premier Newman said Queensland is open for the coal business, he meant it! He meant that Queensland was prepared to sell out, and now the Abbott government is going to be complicit with him in destroying the Great Barrier Reef in order to massively expand Queensland's appalling coalmining when, in fact, it should be left in the ground.


The same goes for coal-seam gas, which is facilitating loss of water and loss of farmland; it is climate destroying. In fact, the latest greenhouse gas inventory shows the greatest increase in emissions is in fugitive emissions from coalmines and coal-seam gas. So we are not only going to see a shocking contribution to global warming, we are also going to see a loss of jobs, a loss of tourism and the listing of the reef as in danger. But the overwhelming issue here is the loss of the reef itself. I do not think Australians can actually take in the fact that there will come a day when the Great Barrier Reef is dead. That is something that people refuse to accept. You hear people say—quietly—when they go to Queensland and have a look at it that it is in a worse state than the last time they saw it. We are also seeing the impacts: when you have deteriorating water quality, you have also the expansion of the crown-of-thorns starfish. What we are seeing is a disaster for the reef and a disaster for the planet, and the world is not going to stand by and watch Australia do this. We are going to have a major issue to contend with in terms of where this goes.


What will happen to the Queensland economy? We know the Great Barrier Reef is a major economy from the tourism and from the small businesses that will be impacted. The dredging will also impact on fisheries, not to mention what it will do to us, as a nation, to be a rich nation that is prepared to destroy outstanding universal values for humankind. This contempt that the Abbott government is showing for the environment is something that you would not even have been believed a few years ago—that you could see in one week a government taking away the powers to look after threatened species, taking away the critical listing for the Murray-Darling Basin, attacking the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area and threatening to pull down and change the boundaries to open up the old-growth forests for logging. And now today we have this decision by the government to proactively turn the Great Barrier Reef into a coal ship highway, and to allow the dumping of three million cubic metres of sludge into the reef to smother corals and to smother seagrasses on which dugongs and turtles are reliant.


This is a disgrace and people will be held accountable for this, not just now but by future generations. They will look back and say, 'This was environmental vandalism, and never let it be said that they did not know what they were doing'. You know exactly what you are doing. Scientists around the world have condemned you for what you are doing to the Great Barrier Reef. They have pleaded with you not to proceed with this industrialisation of the Great Barrier Reef, and yet you are going on to do it in the interests of the supporters of the coalition. The big coalminers of Australia have now pulled the strings of the Abbott government to the detriment of the Great Barrier Reef. (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2013-12-11,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (16:57):  I am not sure if I am speaking on the right motion here. I thought we were celebrating a decision finally being made, after more than five years, to drag Queensland's economy out of the dumps. Apparently we are not.


I was a little surprised earlier to hear Senator Boswell correct himself. He pointed out that there would be thousands of jobs come out of these projects that were approved yesterday by Minister Hunt. Senator Boswell went on to talk about hundreds of thousands of jobs and then corrected himself for being a little overblown in the language he had used. I think he can hold his head up high; I do not think he needs to worry about exaggeration when he is followed by a speaker who wants to talk about developing a coalmining port in Queensland as a crime against humanity. What has been a crime—an economic crime—in Queensland for more than five years is the way the state Labor Bligh government and the federal Labor government conspired to stop development, conspired to simply build up the debts of Queensland and not to go ahead with perfectly reasonable, perfectly adequate provisions.


The four projects that were approved yesterday by Minister Hunt will generate 3½ thousand jobs in their doing. And, as Senator Boswell pointed out earlier, the people of Mackay, of Gladstone and of Bowen are pleased to see these jobs happening. As the Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Infrastructure and Planning in Queensland, Jeff Seeney, has pointed out, these jobs will give a desperately needed boost to Queensland's coal and coal-seam gas industries. Mr Seeney has described the decision by Mr Hunt yesterday as a common-sense decision by the Commonwealth government that will encourage growth in Queensland's resource sector and underpin future jobs in the coal and coal-seam gas sector.


He goes on to point out that this is after Australia's longest and most comprehensive assessment process that has produced the strictest environmental conditions ever seen in Australia's history. If you look at the actual conditions that have been put on the projects, you will find 95 environmental conditions for the Abbot Point development and 53 for the Curtis Island LNG project. These are the environmental conditions that have been put in place. There are measures to protect marine species, the habitat, the ecological communities, and the flora and fauna.


I am often a little bemused by the way the Greens pull the reef out of their pocket every time they want to convince people that they are right, that they are not overblown and that they are not criticising simply for the sake of criticising. It is a bit like the people who find a cute puppy to have their photo taken with. 'Let's criticise the work on the Great Barrier Reef. Let's not worry about development in Queensland'—I am sorry, but I am more interested in development in Queensland than I am in listening to ridiculous claims made by the Greens about what is going to happen to the Great Barrier Reef.


I am hoping that Senator Milne's 63,000 figure for the number of jobs involved in tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is accurate. How dare the Greens tell the Queensland government in particular that the tourism associated with the Great Barrier Reef and the environmental health of the Great Barrier Reef are something they should try to notice. Tourism is a major industry in Queensland. The Queensland state government is very aware that tourism is a major industry. It is also aware that the Great Barrier Reef is a critical part of this. I can assure you that there will be nothing done by the Queensland government that would damage the Great Barrier Reef.


This point has been noted by Deputy Premier Seeney. He made the point that the conditions that have been put in place by the federal government under Minister Hunt will protect the reef but allow development to happen. They will allow development to happen in a more environmentally responsible way than had been intended under the Labor government and they will put in place a very well accepted and developed policy of expanding existing ports rather than building more ports so that one concentrates the economic activity in areas where it can be well monitored, surveyed and researched.


There is no suggestion whatsoever that the reef is threatened in any of the material put out following the decisions announced yesterday by Minister Hunt. That is not true. It is an untruth that is as overblown as the suggestion that the decisions made yesterday by Minister Hunt are a 'crime against humanity'. 


The government has imposed some of the strictest conditions in Australia's history. Among the things that will happen is that the water quality will be 1½ times better than it currently is. That is one of the requirements of the work. That will mean a long-term net reduction in fine sediments entering the marine park from land based sources. That will go on for years and years, well after the life of the project. Up to $89 million will be put into a reef trust to ensure the health of the Great Barrier Reef. As I mentioned earlier, there are 95 environmental conditions for Abbot Point and 53 for Curtis Island. Let us not forget that these projects that will not harm the reef but will grow jobs and the coal industry, which is the real bete noir that the Greens are out to stop—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Greenhouse gases.




Senator BOYCE:
  'Greenhouse gases' is the interjection. These projects will generate between $1.4 billion and $2.8 billion per year in gross regional product for Queensland. They will boost employment, with 3,500 jobs during the construction phase and an operational force of about 600 in the end. These are projects that Queensland needs. These are projects that can be managed both economically and environmentally.


We do not need the Greens patronising the Queensland state government by suggesting that the government that relies, firstly, on mining and, secondly, on tourism for its income is not interested in what will happen to the Great Barrier Reef. I find the Greens comments in this area immoral. If they are going to talk about actions by Minister Hunt as 'crimes against humanity' then their exaggerated and overblown comments in this area constitute immorality. I congratulate the federal government, the Minister for the Environment and the state government for the work they have done to finally bring these projects to fruition for the benefit of all Queenslanders, particularly those in the regions and those who live along the coast that is bordered by the Great Barrier Reef.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (17:58): I find it a privilege to be able to speak on this matter of public importance today about the decision on Abbot Point. As a Queenslander, it gives me great pride to be in a position to make some contribution to this debate. It was not that long ago that Senator Boyce and I, on many occasions in the lead-up to the election, were bumping into one another up the coast of Queensland, no doubt speaking to constituents about particular issues.


One particular area that I found a matter of importance and concern for people in the area around Bowen and the Great Barrier Reef was what would happen in the circumstances of the advancement of the expansion of the Abbot Point wharf. I went to the Bowen markets on a Sunday morning. Like any markets, you walk around and talk to many locals. I found that people had a diverse range of opinions on whether the wharf expansion should proceed or be stopped because of the likelihood of effects on the reef. So I think it is important that we consider the government's position in managing the progress of the project to ensure that proponents meet the obligations set out in the agreement that has been reached and was announced yesterday.


The government really has a responsibility in this area to the Great Barrier Reef. There is a great expectation within the community and internationally for them to do it properly. I had a look at the agreement today to see what the requirements are of this government in proceeding with this project, and I must admit there are a number of listed requirements that are put on the federal government to make sure these matters are reached. There are things like pile driving operations and listing the species of turtle, dolphin, dugong, humpback whale and so on. But I am concerned about who is going to be entrusted with the responsibility to make sure those requirements are met. Is it going to be a situation where the Queensland Liberal National Party government is going to be bestowed with the opportunity to ensure that checklists are crossed off? We know that in Queensland there have been over 14,000 jobs—primarily in the public service—cut with regard to the decision the premier up there made when he came to power.


In the particular area of public servants that I assume would be responsible for the reporting of these operations—the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection—there were 220 jobs cut. One of the casualties I know personally; Sandra Flanagan, who resides up in Rockhampton and is a very good friend of mine, was distraught that a long-term, engaged public servant lost her job as a result of those severe cuts the Queensland Liberal National Party government made.


So that is my question: who is going to be protecting and ensuring these requirements are met, to ensure the reef is not going to be put at risk and the companies that are going to be doing all this extension are conforming with the requirements the federal government has put upon them? When you look back in time, the then opposition—I will use an example I am very familiar with—does not have a very good track record. I use the example of a private members' bill. Mr Abbott sought to have a piece of legislation in this chamber overturned with regard to a piece of state legislation concerning wild rivers in the northern part of my home state.


One wild river that I am very familiar with as a result of my great relationship with the Irwins up on the Sunshine Coast is the Wenlock River. I have been fortunate enough to have visited that area on several occasions through work and other things. I have been fortunate to have been welcomed onto the Indigenous lands up in that area and to actually jump a crocodile on the banks of the Wenlock River, to do the research and examination of a reptile that was about 10½ feet long. To see those sorts of pristine areas and the environment we have in our great state of Queensland makes me concerned that these sorts of measures will not be a check when it comes time to make sure these issues are met.


I advocate to anyone if they get the opportunity: get up to North Queensland. I am talking right up around the cape. See those beautiful rivers and the environment we have around that area. They are the types of areas where we should not go in full steam ahead, particularly when we have lost public servants in Queensland and are not able to make sure these checks and balances are met.


Equally, we need to ensure that reasonable commitment is given by the federal government to make sure these matters are checked and reasonable safeguards are put in place. We heard today during question time, from questions by the Greens, that there are claims the government have provisions and procedures well in advance of what we had as a government, but I will believe it when I see it. There are something like 63,000 jobs that have some input from the area of the Great Barrier Reef. It ranges from tourism to recreational fishers and all sorts of walks of life. We know that, if this particular matter is not managed appropriately, we will lose up to $6 billion in tourism, a significant contribution to tourism in the state of Queensland and also the Commonwealth.


So I would like to ensure that these matters are dealt with appropriately and with competence. Also, as I have indicated, I have some concerns about the degree of commitment that this federal government has to the environment on some of the issues that I have raised—for example, the private member's bill by Mr Abbott dealing with the wild rivers legislation.


There have been other advocates out there expressing concerns as well. I can refer to one piece of media. I note claims that the dredging being proposed by three coal terminals will dump three million cubic metres of spoil onto the Great Barrier Reef. That has been raised as an issue by Richard Leck of the World Wildlife Fund, who has claimed that the spoil dumped on the World Heritage area would be equivalent to 150,000 dump trucks. He says, 'It can smother whatever it lands on whether that be seagrass or coral'—or turtles, dugongs or dolphins, or anything in that area of the ocean. Surely that would raise concerns for anyone who has a genuine issue with the management of the expansion of the Abbot Point facility. We are not in a position as the opposition to oppose or—

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  I seek leave to move business of the Senate notices of motions 4 and 5 together.


Leave granted.




Senator POLLEY:
  I move:


That the Residential Care Subsidy Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Principle 2013, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


That theAged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination 2013 made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


This evening I would like to address both the Aged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination and the Residential Care Subsidy Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Principle. The principle and determination of course need to be moved separately, but we have agreed to move them together. But really they are both a result of the same trend—that is, the coalition's lack of focus and commitment in the area of aged care.


These instruments, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, will unwind key reforms instituted by Labor to ensure that the nation's aged care workers receive a welcome and overdue boost in pay and conditions. The Gillard government introduced the Aged Care Workforce Subsidy part of the Living Longer Living Better aged care package in order to address workforce pay and conditions. It is important to remember that aged care workers are some of our lowest paid workers in the country yet they are charged with the immense responsibility of caring for the increasing number of older Australians.


We often speak of Australia's ageing population and the challenges that lie ahead as though it were something yet to happen. Those challenges are already here. For the first time in our nation's history there are more people turning pension age each year, than there are turning working age. Yet the aged-care sector has a high turnover of staff, and workers are paid less than colleagues in other sectors such as hospitals. I recognise that many workers in this sector are motivated by compassion and a sense of vocation but they still deserve to be given fairer pay, better conditions and access to training, education and a career path.


The sector faces pressure not only from an increase in the demand for their services, but also from a population that expects more. This workforce needs assistance and now is not the time to be turning our backs on those workers who give so much for so little. Federal Labor understands these pressures, which is why we allocated $1.2 billion dollars across the forward estimates to address significant workforce issues. The workforce supplement is the mechanism through which the wages of aged-care workers caring for older Australians will be improved.


It is extremely disappointing that the coalition does not share our concern. In fact, one of the first acts of the Minister for Social Services was to make a determination through these two instruments to remove the department secretary's power to accept applications for the workforce supplement. This is despite the fact that some 18 providers have already successfully applied for the supplement since 1 July 2013. So what is the coalition planning to do with the remaining $1.1 billion?


All we have from those opposite are platitudes followed by cuts. All we have heard is that the government will reallocate to a:


… general pool of aged care funding.


Not that we know what this means, how they will guarantee that workers will not be worse off or how they will address the demands on this sector. The timing could not be worse. At this time, we need to be doing everything possible to boost the working conditions of aged-care staff and encourage younger people to take up work in this sector.


The Productivity Commission has pointed out that increasing numbers of residents with higher and more complex care needs have added to the workloads of care staff in residential care settings. As we speak, some 50 per cent of the aged-care workforce is within 10 years of retiring, and it is proving particularly challenging to attract young capable people to undertake this line of work.


Labor remains committed to building a new aged-care system built on the principles of respect, dignity and choice. We want to make sure that every single facility can provide quality, affordable, accessible and appropriate care to a rapidly growing population of older Australians. If only the coalition shared our dream. Instead, they want to scrap the supplement and, on top of this, the government has not indicated how the funds will be allocated to providers.


My aim in moving to disallow these instruments is to give workers more time to negotiate better outcomes with their employers and to provide the minister and his assistant minister with more time to provide details on how they will address workforce issues. This regrettable decision by the minister has only added greater uncertainty to a workforce that is already lowly paid while working with some of the most vulnerable and demanding Australians.


During question time this week, the minister who is at least nominally responsible for ageing, Senator Fifield, said that it was a government priority to:


… allow those who work in aged care to focus on doing what they do best, and that is delivering high-quality care for older Australians.


Well, Minister Fifield—it is good that you are here in the chamber—you certainly are not acting like it. Words are cheap. Older Australians and the people who work diligently every day to care for them want a real commitment. I trust the government will take the time to address the pay and working conditions of this vulnerable sector. My honourable colleagues may want to consider who they would want caring for them in their twilight years. Given the choice, would we really want a lowly paid, overworked person caring for us or even for our parents?


The manner in which the minister has moved to turn back progress for aged-care workers is shameful, and you should feel ashamed. Today, Labor is removing the prohibition on workers seeking better pay and conditions. We are clearing the way for providers and workers to sit down and continue negotiating.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (18:27):  If you look at the Notice Paper—which I know you do constantly, all-day-every-day, Mr Deputy President—you would see the two motions for disallowance that Senator Polley has before us today. The titles of the disallowance motions make them appear fairly innocuous. They read:


That the Residential Care Subsidy Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Principle 2013, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


…


That the Aged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination 2013, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


They sound fairly innocuous when you read them, but what these two disallowance motions actually represent is an act of unmitigated—I will choose my words carefully here—mischief. There is a stronger phrase I was tempted to use, but I am always keen to observe the decorum of the chamber.


The coalition was very clear before the election that we had some significant issues with the Aged Care Workforce Supplement. It sounded good in theory. Who could be against better wages for people who work in the aged-care sector? But there were some significant qualifications on—




Senator Polley:
  You obviously are. Give us a commitment.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy President, but if the interjections continue, I may be forced to make reference to a Tasmanian publication of record. I would not want to be tempted to do that. But I will continue.


There were some significant qualifications in the previous government's Aged Care Workforce Supplement, and they included a requirement for certain aged-care providers to be part of an enterprise bargaining agreement with unions in order to access funds. That clearly was a cover for the Australian Labor Party in government yet again trying to use a sector in order to entrench further union membership. We on this side of the chamber are not at all against union membership. We recognise the important role that unions play in Australia, and that employees have an entitlement to be represented in the manner of their choosing. Our issue is that we do not believe that individuals should in any way be compelled, nor do we believe, for that matter, that employers should be placed in a position where they will be penalised or coerced through financial incentives to have a workplace that may do other than represent the free will of employees as expressed.




Senator Polley:
  What are you going to do with the $1.1 billion?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator FIFIELD:
  So we had some difficulty with the Aged Care Workforce Supplement. We made clear before the election that if elected we would seek to suspend the workforce supplement. That is what we did when we came into government—Minister Andrews created a legislative instrument that would suspend further applications for that supplement. There were some 18 providers who had already been approved for the supplement, and we undertook that we would continue to ensure that those providers received that supplement, that payments to those people who had applied and reached agreement in good faith would continue.


So we suspended further applications for the supplement, but we did indicate that we were committed to seeing the money that had been allocated to the workforce supplement returned to the general pool in aged care. We thought it was important to take a very different approach to that of the previous government in determining how best to deploy those resources. There was originally, I think, about $1.2 billion in the supplement. When you take into account the money that has already been allocated it is about $1.1 billion that is left.


Rather than seeking to use that money to pursue particular industrial ends, as the previous government did, we want to take—and indicated that we would—a consultative approach with the sector. So we will sit down with the sector and work through how best to deploy that money. It is important to remember that we are talking about a very significant amount of money here: $1.1 billion. It is always important to remember that these are taxpayer dollars. We need to think very carefully about how best to deploy that money and so we will work in a cooperative way with the sector to determine how best to do that.


For the record, I should just read into the Hansard what the coalition said before the election in relation to this funding. We said:


As a first priority, the Coalition will take the necessary steps to put back into the general pool of aged care funding the $1.2 billion allocated to the Workforce Compact and work with providers to ensure that these funds are distributed in a way that is more flexible and better targeted, without jeopardising the viability of aged care facilities.


And that is exactly what we will do.


I should also share with you, Mr Deputy President, the release which explains the rationale for what we are doing. I will just briefly share it with you, because I know you take a close interest in this sector. This release was issued by me and Minister Andrews, and is headed 'Investing in the aged care workforce':


The Coalition Government today announced the first step in delivering on the Government’s Healthy Life, Better Ageing commitments.


The Government recognises that increased pay and improved conditions are essential to attract and retain skilled workers to the sector, while being affordable and sustainable. Recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of skilled, dedicated workers to the aged care sector is crucial for Australia’s aged care system to meet the community’s increasing need for aged care services.


The Aged Care Workforce Supplement introduced by the former government did not guarantee improved pay and conditions for all aged care workers and many providers could not justify applying because the Supplement would not have covered their additional costs.


I think that is an important point. It continued:


For many providers the funding was also conditional upon the signing of a union-dictated EBA.


This goes to the point I was making before, that the government does not believe that we should use particular sectors, and funding in particular sectors, to seek to achieve particular industrial outcomes that may be important to the Labor Party. The statement continues:


The Government is committed to working with the sector to develop a policy which will ensure that available funding is distributed in a way that is flexible, targeted and ensures the viability of aged care providers.


For this reason, the Government has taken the responsible step of suspending applications for the Workforce Supplement introduced by the former government while it consults with the sector on alternative policy options.


I know that is an unfamiliar concept to those opposite—to actually consult with the sector rather than having a predetermined agenda to achieve an industrial outcome. The statement continues:


Aged care providers that are eligible for the Supplement will have their funding honoured and the Department of Social Services will continue to process applications that have already been received. The Government will consider transitional arrangements for these providers as it develops alternative policy options.


That was the statement of 26 September which was seeking to explain and give effect to our pre-election commitment. And on that day Minister Andrews created the legislative instrument which the opposition are today seeking to disallow. It is yet another example of the opposition not accepting the result of the election.


It is bad enough that the opposition do not accept the fact that the Australian people voted for a change of government. It is bad enough that the opposition do not accept that the Australian people voted to abolish the carbon tax. This is yet another instance where the opposition do not accept that there was change of government, do not accept that the incoming government had a clear policy and do not accept the right of the government to give effect to that policy. What we are seeing here with these disallowance motions is the Australian Labor Party seeking to govern from the political grave. One would have thought they would have heeded the message from the last election and allowed the government to get on with its agenda. So it is disappointing that the opposition have moved these disallowance motions, which will only create unnecessary uncertainty in the aged-care sector. That is extremely unfortunate.


While I am on my feet I think it is important to draw the chamber's attention to Senator Polley's approach when we were in Senate estimates and aged care was before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Senator Polley seemed to be of the view that aged-care quality equals red tape, and red tape equals aged-care quality, because whenever this government has stated that it intends to seek to reduce red tape in the aged-care sector the opposition have said, 'What the government really wants to do is to reduce quality, to reduce standards.' I for one do not think we have yet reached some sort of regulatory nirvana in aged care. I think it is prudent for the government of the day, whoever they may be, to always look to see how red tape can be reduced in the aged-care sector. If aged-care workers, who those opposite profess have such an interest in, are spending time on paperwork that does not add to quality and does not add to care, that is time that those aged-care workers cannot be spending doing what they do best, and that is providing care to older Australians. So I take this opportunity to encourage those opposite, in particular Senator Polley, to take a fresh look at the issue of red tape and compliance—




Senator Sinodinos:
  Have an open mind.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Yes, have an open mind. In a previous incarnation, in opposition, Senator Sinodinos has done some absolutely sterling work across a range of portfolios on proposals to reduce red tape and compliance. That role has now been assumed by the member for Kooyong, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Frydenberg, who is doing that, as he does all things, with great enthusiasm. I have been keeping Mr Frydenberg updated on the work this government has undertaken to further reduce red tape.


There was an important instance recently where some pricing guidelines drafted by the previous government would have required providers of aged-care services to provide, in excruciating and unnecessary detail in their product offerings, things like the number of lights in a roof, the number of lights in a facility, whether there was carpet or vinyl. There were some important out clauses: they were not actually going to insist that they specify the colour of the carpet. That is what those opposite considered to be taking a light-handed approach to regulatory issues. We determined that, yes, it is important that there be appropriate information for consumers, because it is very important that we have informed consumers in aged care, but we did not want to have such an excruciatingly unnecessary level of detail and to be requiring providers to document at every step how they had reached that point of the information they were disclosing. We decided we are going to have much more simplified guidelines. That is the sort of approach that we will take.


I know I have digressed a little from the disallowance motions that are before us, Mr Deputy President. What we want to do is to work with the sector. We want to seek their views as to how this significant funding can best be deployed. I touched earlier on some of our concerns about the structure of the workforce supplement, the workforce compact. I want to go a little further into our pre-election policy. We said in our policy:


Labor's Workforce Compact appears to be more about boosting union membership than improving aged care and adds to the regulatory quagmire without guaranteeing improved conditions for all workers.


The Coalition believes that Labor's Workforce Compact is discriminatory as it does not apply to all workers. Under Labor, providers with 50 or more beds will need to enter into an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) and comply with the conditions of the Workforce Supplement to access funding. Providers with less than 50 beds need not enter into an EBA, but must however comply with the conditions of the Workforce Supplement to access funding.


There is always a little hook, always a little catch. The policy went on:


This aspect of the legislation was the key issue of contention at the … Senate inquiry into the Living Longer, Living Better package of Bills. The evidence was clear that many providers could not justify accessing the supplement as it fell far short of the actual cost of the proposed wage increases with providers having to meet on-costs.


It also went on to say:


Had Labor been serious about improving conditions in the sector, they could have worked through existing frameworks …


and the policy then mentioned some of those.


So we want to take a fresh look at this funding. As I said, it is quite a significant amount. We will look at this in the context of the significant consultation which we are going to undertake with the sector and a big part of that consultation is going to be looking for further ways to reduce red tape.


Aged care and the ageing portfolio is an extremely exciting place to be working on. We do have an ageing population. The number of centenarians that we have in Australia is going to dramatically increase over the next 10 or 15 years. That represents a huge untapped resource in the nation, and not just centenarians but also those older Australians beyond the age of 65. We need to look for ways to harness that great national resource.


But there are Australians who, as they age, obviously need a little more help and that is where the aged-care part of the ageing portfolio comes into play. I am pleased that certainly in the last parliament there was a large degree of bipartisanship when it came to aged-care policy and aged-care reform. Yes, we do disagree with the Labor Party on the aged-care supplement, but I hope that it is possible to have a civil disagreement about one area of policy and that, more broadly in aged care, we perhaps can follow the model that there has been in disability where the various parties in parliament come together to work for a common outcome. I hope that is the case, because just as Australians with disability have little time for petty partisan point-scoring, I think that ageing Australians and particularly those in aged care and their families do not have much time for petty partisan point-scoring in this area either. They just want us to get on with the job, making sure that those who face some extra challenges as a result of ageing get the additional support they need. As I have indicated, Mr Deputy President, we will not be supporting this disallowance motion. (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:47):  I rise to indicate that the Greens will be supporting this disallowance motion. We entered into a lot of discussion and negotiation over the Living Longer Living Better package and I do think that we helped to make it a better package. This issue of better wages for aged-care workers has been very high on the agenda for a significant period of time and, although promises have been made in the past to address the poor wages of workers that work very hard in this sector, they have not been effectively delivered. 


What has happened is that in the past when there has been additional funding put into aged care, it has not actually been delivered to those that are doing the hard work at the coalface, and they are the aged-care workers. They are some of the lowest paid in the sector. In the previous aged-care inquiries in Perth and the subsequent one about the Living Longer Living Better legislation, we heard some horrendous stories about the low wages and the things that people had to do. We consulted a lot during that process. We will be supporting this disallowance motion because we believe that the Living Longer Living Better package was amended to address the issues of concern and this is the best way to ensure that increased wages are delivered to aged-care workers.

That theAged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination 2013 made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


This evening I would like to address both the Aged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination and the Residential Care Subsidy Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Principle. The principle and determination of course need to be moved separately, but we have agreed to move them together. But really they are both a result of the same trend—that is, the coalition's lack of focus and commitment in the area of aged care.


These instruments, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, will unwind key reforms instituted by Labor to ensure that the nation's aged care workers receive a welcome and overdue boost in pay and conditions.

It is extremely disappointing that the coalition does not share our concern.

My honourable colleagues may want to consider who they would want caring for them in their twilight years. Given the choice, would we really want a lowly paid, overworked person caring for us or even for our parents?


The manner in which the minister has moved to turn back progress for aged-care workers is shameful, and you should feel ashamed. Today, Labor is removing the prohibition on workers seeking better pay and conditions. We are clearing the way for providers and workers to sit down and continue negotiating.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (18:27):  If you look at the Notice Paper—which I know you do constantly, all-day-every-day, Mr Deputy President—you would see the two motions for disallowance that Senator Polley has before us today. The titles of the disallowance motions make them appear fairly innocuous. They read:


That the Residential Care Subsidy Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Principle 2013, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


…


That the Aged Care Subsidies Amendment (Workforce Supplement) Determination 2013, made under the Aged Care Act 1997, be disallowed.


They sound fairly innocuous when you read them, but what these two disallowance motions actually represent is an act of unmitigated—I will choose my words carefully here—mischief. There is a stronger phrase I was tempted to use, but I am always keen to observe the decorum of the chamber.


The coalition was very clear before the election that we had some significant issues with the Aged Care Workforce Supplement. It sounded good in theory. Who could be against better wages for people who work in the aged-care sector? But there were some significant qualifications on—




Senator Polley:
  You obviously are. Give us a commitment.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy President, but if the interjections continue, I may be forced to make reference to a Tasmanian publication of record. I would not want to be tempted to do that. But I will continue.


There were some significant qualifications in the previous government's Aged Care Workforce Supplement, and they included a requirement for certain aged-care providers to be part of an enterprise bargaining agreement with unions in order to access funds. That clearly was a cover for the Australian Labor Party in government yet again trying to use a sector in order to entrench further union membership. We on this side of the chamber are not at all against union membership. We recognise the important role that unions play in Australia, and that employees have an entitlement to be represented in the manner of their choosing. Our issue is that we do not believe that individuals should in any way be compelled, nor do we believe, for that matter, that employers should be placed in a position where they will be penalised or coerced through financial incentives to have a workplace that may do other than represent the free will of employees as expressed.




Senator Polley:
  What are you going to do with the $1.1 billion?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator FIFIELD:
  So we had some difficulty with the Aged Care Workforce Supplement. We made clear before the election that if elected we would seek to suspend the workforce supplement. That is what we did when we came into government—Minister Andrews created a legislative instrument that would suspend further applications for that supplement. There were some 18 providers who had already been approved for the supplement, and we undertook that we would continue to ensure that those providers received that supplement, that payments to those people who had applied and reached agreement in good faith would continue.


So we suspended further applications for the supplement, but we did indicate that we were committed to seeing the money that had been allocated to the workforce supplement returned to the general pool in aged care. We thought it was important to take a very different approach to that of the previous government in determining how best to deploy those resources. There was originally, I think, about $1.2 billion in the supplement. When you take into account the money that has already been allocated it is about $1.1 billion that is left.


Rather than seeking to use that money to pursue particular industrial ends, as the previous government did, we want to take—and indicated that we would—a consultative approach with the sector. So we will sit down with the sector and work through how best to deploy that money. It is important to remember that we are talking about a very significant amount of money here: $1.1 billion. It is always important to remember that these are taxpayer dollars. We need to think very carefully about how best to deploy that money and so we will work in a cooperative way with the sector to determine how best to do that.


For the record, I should just read into the Hansard what the coalition said before the election in relation to this funding. We said:


As a first priority, the Coalition will take the necessary steps to put back into the general pool of aged care funding the $1.2 billion allocated to the Workforce Compact and work with providers to ensure that these funds are distributed in a way that is more flexible and better targeted, without jeopardising the viability of aged care facilities.


And that is exactly what we will do.


I should also share with you, Mr Deputy President, the release which explains the rationale for what we are doing. I will just briefly share it with you, because I know you take a close interest in this sector. This release was issued by me and Minister Andrews, and is headed 'Investing in the aged care workforce':


The Coalition Government today announced the first step in delivering on the Government’s Healthy Life, Better Ageing commitments.


The Government recognises that increased pay and improved conditions are essential to attract and retain skilled workers to the sector, while being affordable and sustainable. Recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of skilled, dedicated workers to the aged care sector is crucial for Australia’s aged care system to meet the community’s increasing need for aged care services.


The Aged Care Workforce Supplement introduced by the former government did not guarantee improved pay and conditions for all aged care workers and many providers could not justify applying because the Supplement would not have covered their additional costs.


I think that is an important point. It continued:


For many providers the funding was also conditional upon the signing of a union-dictated EBA.


This goes to the point I was making before, that the government does not believe that we should use particular sectors, and funding in particular sectors, to seek to achieve particular industrial outcomes that may be important to the Labor Party. The statement continues:


The Government is committed to working with the sector to develop a policy which will ensure that available funding is distributed in a way that is flexible, targeted and ensures the viability of aged care providers.


For this reason, the Government has taken the responsible step of suspending applications for the Workforce Supplement introduced by the former government while it consults with the sector on alternative policy options.


I know that is an unfamiliar concept to those opposite—to actually consult with the sector rather than having a predetermined agenda to achieve an industrial outcome. The statement continues:


Aged care providers that are eligible for the Supplement will have their funding honoured and the Department of Social Services will continue to process applications that have already been received. The Government will consider transitional arrangements for these providers as it develops alternative policy options.


That was the statement of 26 September which was seeking to explain and give effect to our pre-election commitment. And on that day Minister Andrews created the legislative instrument which the opposition are today seeking to disallow. It is yet another example of the opposition not accepting the result of the election.


It is bad enough that the opposition do not accept the fact that the Australian people voted for a change of government. It is bad enough that the opposition do not accept that the Australian people voted to abolish the carbon tax. This is yet another instance where the opposition do not accept that there was change of government, do not accept that the incoming government had a clear policy and do not accept the right of the government to give effect to that policy. What we are seeing here with these disallowance motions is the Australian Labor Party seeking to govern from the political grave. One would have thought they would have heeded the message from the last election and allowed the government to get on with its agenda. So it is disappointing that the opposition have moved these disallowance motions, which will only create unnecessary uncertainty in the aged-care sector. That is extremely unfortunate.


While I am on my feet I think it is important to draw the chamber's attention to Senator Polley's approach when we were in Senate estimates and aged care was before the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Senator Polley seemed to be of the view that aged-care quality equals red tape, and red tape equals aged-care quality, because whenever this government has stated that it intends to seek to reduce red tape in the aged-care sector the opposition have said, 'What the government really wants to do is to reduce quality, to reduce standards.' I for one do not think we have yet reached some sort of regulatory nirvana in aged care. I think it is prudent for the government of the day, whoever they may be, to always look to see how red tape can be reduced in the aged-care sector. If aged-care workers, who those opposite profess have such an interest in, are spending time on paperwork that does not add to quality and does not add to care, that is time that those aged-care workers cannot be spending doing what they do best, and that is providing care to older Australians. So I take this opportunity to encourage those opposite, in particular Senator Polley, to take a fresh look at the issue of red tape and compliance—




Senator Sinodinos:
  Have an open mind.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Yes, have an open mind. In a previous incarnation, in opposition, Senator Sinodinos has done some absolutely sterling work across a range of portfolios on proposals to reduce red tape and compliance. That role has now been assumed by the member for Kooyong, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Frydenberg, who is doing that, as he does all things, with great enthusiasm. I have been keeping Mr Frydenberg updated on the work this government has undertaken to further reduce red tape.


There was an important instance recently where some pricing guidelines drafted by the previous government would have required providers of aged-care services to provide, in excruciating and unnecessary detail in their product offerings, things like the number of lights in a roof, the number of lights in a facility, whether there was carpet or vinyl. There were some important out clauses: they were not actually going to insist that they specify the colour of the carpet. That is what those opposite considered to be taking a light-handed approach to regulatory issues. We determined that, yes, it is important that there be appropriate information for consumers, because it is very important that we have informed consumers in aged care, but we did not want to have such an excruciatingly unnecessary level of detail and to be requiring providers to document at every step how they had reached that point of the information they were disclosing. We decided we are going to have much more simplified guidelines. That is the sort of approach that we will take.


I know I have digressed a little from the disallowance motions that are before us, Mr Deputy President. What we want to do is to work with the sector. We want to seek their views as to how this significant funding can best be deployed. I touched earlier on some of our concerns about the structure of the workforce supplement, the workforce compact. I want to go a little further into our pre-election policy. We said in our policy:


Labor's Workforce Compact appears to be more about boosting union membership than improving aged care and adds to the regulatory quagmire without guaranteeing improved conditions for all workers.


The Coalition believes that Labor's Workforce Compact is discriminatory as it does not apply to all workers. Under Labor, providers with 50 or more beds will need to enter into an Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA) and comply with the conditions of the Workforce Supplement to access funding. Providers with less than 50 beds need not enter into an EBA, but must however comply with the conditions of the Workforce Supplement to access funding.


There is always a little hook, always a little catch. The policy went on:


This aspect of the legislation was the key issue of contention at the … Senate inquiry into the Living Longer, Living Better package of Bills. The evidence was clear that many providers could not justify accessing the supplement as it fell far short of the actual cost of the proposed wage increases with providers having to meet on-costs.


It also went on to say:


Had Labor been serious about improving conditions in the sector, they could have worked through existing frameworks …


and the policy then mentioned some of those.


So we want to take a fresh look at this funding. As I said, it is quite a significant amount. We will look at this in the context of the significant consultation which we are going to undertake with the sector and a big part of that consultation is going to be looking for further ways to reduce red tape.


Aged care and the ageing portfolio is an extremely exciting place to be working on. We do have an ageing population. The number of centenarians that we have in Australia is going to dramatically increase over the next 10 or 15 years. That represents a huge untapped resource in the nation, and not just centenarians but also those older Australians beyond the age of 65. We need to look for ways to harness that great national resource.


But there are Australians who, as they age, obviously need a little more help and that is where the aged-care part of the ageing portfolio comes into play. I am pleased that certainly in the last parliament there was a large degree of bipartisanship when it came to aged-care policy and aged-care reform. Yes, we do disagree with the Labor Party on the aged-care supplement, but I hope that it is possible to have a civil disagreement about one area of policy and that, more broadly in aged care, we perhaps can follow the model that there has been in disability where the various parties in parliament come together to work for a common outcome. I hope that is the case, because just as Australians with disability have little time for petty partisan point-scoring, I think that ageing Australians and particularly those in aged care and their families do not have much time for petty partisan point-scoring in this area either. They just want us to get on with the job, making sure that those who face some extra challenges as a result of ageing get the additional support they need. As I have indicated, Mr Deputy President, we will not be supporting this disallowance motion. (Time expired)

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:47):  I rise to indicate that the Greens will be supporting this disallowance motion. We entered into a lot of discussion and negotiation over the Living Longer Living Better package and I do think that we helped to make it a better package. This issue of better wages for aged-care workers has been very high on the agenda for a significant period of time and, although promises have been made in the past to address the poor wages of workers that work very hard in this sector, they have not been effectively delivered. 


What has happened is that in the past when there has been additional funding put into aged care, it has not actually been delivered to those that are doing the hard work at the coalface, and they are the aged-care workers. They are some of the lowest paid in the sector. In the previous aged-care inquiries in Perth and the subsequent one about the Living Longer Living Better legislation, we heard some horrendous stories about the low wages and the things that people had to do. We consulted a lot during that process. We will be supporting this disallowance motion because we believe that the Living Longer Living Better package was amended to address the issues of concern and this is the best way to ensure that increased wages are delivered to aged-care workers.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:52):  I would like to take a few minutes tonight to talk about a very important ceremony that I attended a couple of weeks ago for a very dear friend of mine. I have actually spoken in the Senate about this ceremony, but I did want to take another couple of minutes to remind the Senate of the good works of my dear friend and life member of the Labor Party, Joan Fitz-Nead. She was honoured on an initiative by the Goulburn Street Primary School students of 5/6 Harrison—a group of children who have come, in a way, to adopt her as an elder statesman. She is a woman who has fought all her life for those less fortunate and those who were vulnerable to exiting education—she is a former teacher. She is a woman who I have held in great esteem and who has mentored me through my time in the Labor Party.


I will end it there, but I will come back and inform the Senate of more of the good works of Joan Fitz-Nead.
