Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (12:01):  I move:


That Senate amendments (1) to (4), (6) to (40) and (42) to (48) be agreed to.


These amendments have the effect of omitting from the bill measures to delay the commencement of the Charities Act, measures providing for a general interest charge on student loans, measures to change student start-up scholarships into income-contingent loans and measures to pause the indexation of the childcare rebate. Other amendments make minor changes to language in schedule 1 as well as amending the schedule commencement dates in the bill as a consequence of it not passing the parliament last year.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (12:02):  I move:



That Senate amendments (5) and (41) be disagreed to and the following two government amendments be made in place of them:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 5), omit the table item, substitute:





5. Schedule 8

(2) Schedule 7, page 103 (line 1) to page 110 (line 24), omit the Schedule.



These amendments would omit schedule 7 of the bill relating to paid parental leave and make a consequential amendment to the commencement provision in the bill. The original schedule 7 was intended to remove the requirement for all employers to act as the pay clerk for the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. The Senate's revised schedule 7 would remove that requirement only for employers with fewer than 20 employees.


In passing the original schedule 7, the House demonstrated its commitment to removing this administrative burden for all businesses from 1 July 2014. Accordingly, the government is moving amendments to repeal this component of the bill with a view to reintroducing it in a separate bill at a later date. I commend the amendments to the House.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (12:04):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 137: treaty referred on 15 January 2014.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




WYATT ROY:
  by leave—Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties's Report 137: treaty referred on 15 January 2014, the committee's first report of the 44th Parliament. The report contains the committee's view on the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. This proposed treaty was first referred to the committee in the 43rd Parliament, but that lapsed following the proroguing of the parliament. During that inquiry the committee held two public hearings and received nine submissions. The proposed treaty was referred to the current committee on 15 January 2014. As all the relevant issues had been aired in the 43rd Parliament, the committee resolved to report without taking further evidence.


The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Arab Emirates on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy will enable Australian uranium miners to export uranium to the United Arab Emirates, the first country to implement a civilian nuclear power program in 27 years. The agreement will ensure that Australian uranium, uranium products and related materials are subject to the highest standards of safety and security. For example, the agreement will prohibit the use of Australian nuclear materials in weapons and will enable Australia to impose penalties on the UAE, including stopping the supply of Australian nuclear materials if the UAE fails to comply with the highest international safety standards.


The committee was pleased to note that the UAE's approach to developing a civilian nuclear program is a model of openness and transparency. The UAE is making considerable use of international expertise to construct its reactors to ensure that international standards are met. Further, the UAE accepted an International Atomic Energy Agency regulatory review mission in 2011 which found a number of good practices in the UAE regulatory system while also recommending a number of improvements.


Finally, the UAE has appointed an international advisory board to oversee the regulation of its civilian nuclear program. The board includes a number of eminent international experts in nuclear power and its report will be made public.


The committee is aware of the dangers posed by nuclear power and has made some recommendations to ensure that the safety and security standards applying to exported Australian nuclear material remain the highest in the world. The recommendations are, firstly, that prior to the ratification of the proposed treaty the IAEA undertake physical inspections of the UAE facilities that will handle Australian obligated nuclear materials; secondly, that the government report to the parliament on what actions it has taken to implement the recommendations in the report United Nations system-wide study on the implications of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant; and, finally, that the government explore and report to the parliament on the mechanisms to strengthen the resourcing of the IAEA.


The committee is of the view that the highest international standards for transparency demonstrated by the UAE in developing its civilian nuclear program ought to be encouraged and replicated elsewhere. The committee considers that, subject to the above recommendations, binding treaty action should be taken. On behalf of the committee I commend the report to the House. I move:


That the House take note of the report.



The SPEAKER:  The debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:11):  The Farm Household Support Bill 2014 introduces a new safety payment for struggling farmers in this country. It comes from the intergovernmental agreement secured by the former Labor government, and on that basis I can report that the opposition will be supporting this bill. I note that the bill has a cost to the budget of $99.4 million over four years and further note that something like $37.6 million of that is allocated as administrative costs to the budget. I invite the minister, when he closes this debate, to provide further detail if he can on that administrative charge. I know some of it relates to ICT resourcing and new systems being put in place to administer this particular program, but it is an extraordinary amount of money as a percentage of the total allocation. I invite him to share the reasons for that with the House.


This is definitely a supportable initiative flowing from the intergovernmental agreement. It is the latest iteration of the safety net we have in place for farming businesses and farming families when they run into financial difficulty, whether it be because of drought or for other reasons. I note that this is not just a drought initiative; it is an initiative that will be available to all farming families, regardless of the cause of the circumstances in which they find themselves. The key to this particular initiative is the means testing of that payment, which would of course be far more generous than the means testing for Newstart allowance, or as some would call it the dole, for other potential recipients. That is of course due to the fact that farmers typically have substantial capital assets on their properties which in most cases would deny them the capacity to be eligible for Newstart allowance—and similarly with income testing. The situation for farmers can be quite different.


Last night, I participated in a discussion at the National Farmers Federation—the topic was drought and the challenges ahead. Senator Richard Colbeck, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, also participated in the debate. Professor Linda Botterill, from the ANU, made the point, as I often have, that farmers in Australia are held in very high regard by the broader community. I see you, Madam Speaker, nodding your head in agreement. As I said to her last night: as I usually put it, farmers are up there with ambos, firemen, policemen and members of the military—unlike politicians, who typically are down there with used car salesmen. And you do not need to do any empirical research to know that, although Professor Botterill was able to back it with some research on this subject last night. So I have no doubt that all Australians will be pleased to hear us debating this particular bill, and to see we are reaching out in acknowledgement of the severity of the current drought and the assistance farming families find themselves in need of. Again, this is not a drought initiative per se, although certainly it has its genesis in the discussion with the states on future drought policy.


As many members of this place would know, we have been struggling with drought policy in this country since Federation, really. Certainly since 1990 there has been a raft of reports on drought policy, each of them voluminous. If you read the latest Productivity Commission report—I think it was from 2008—half of the report reflects on earlier reports on drought. It is a complex and difficult area. I think there is a settled consensus in this country that some sort of safety net is appropriate; I have never seen the matter that is before the House today contested. But there have been many challenges to the various forms of drought policy we have had in the past—whether they are efficient and whether the objectives of drought policy or the programs under that drought policy are consistent with the objectives of the particular drought policy of the day.


Again, this was a matter for debate last night, and I made the point then—and this is always the big challenge with drought policy—that in 2007-08, for example, only 27 per cent of our farmers accessed the old 'exceptional circumstances' regime. That is still a large number, 27 per cent, but it indicates that 'farms ain't farms'. Some farms are more sophisticated than others and bigger than others, and some have made a much greater effort to ready themselves for drought—to drought-proof themselves, if that term is appropriate—and to be well prepared for drought. Others possibly—and often through no fault of their own—have not had the resources to do that and find themselves on marginal land and therefore subject to the vagaries of the weather and certainly more vulnerable to drought than others.


Last night I also made the point that it is quite possibly true that drought policy beyond the safety net will always face that dilemma—that if you assist those who are continually vulnerable to drought you are somehow disadvantaging those who have invested heavily and have innovated and better protected themselves against drought in the future. Those are not my thoughts; they are the thoughts of many who have made submissions to drought policy consideration over many decades. They asked the question, 'Why is it that Joe next door is getting a taxpayer subsidy when I am not getting the subsidy because I have made the effort to drought-proof my farm business?' And it is hard to see any time in the near future when that dilemma will not still be with us. It is a dilemma we should be grappling with in this place on a bipartisan basis, because we cannot be in any way playing politics with this issue, and we need to find innovative ways to help farmers in times of drought. Of course, we cannot necessarily prepare ourselves adequately for some droughts—like one-in-50-year events. In the past we have placed a greater and growing emphasis on drought-proofing rather than on in-drought events, and that is what initiatives like the farm management deposits scheme are all about—providing tax incentives for farmers to put money away in the good times to be used in the bad times, and I suspect that is where much of the focus will be in the future.


There are some academics and others out there who will say that we should not go beyond the farm household support package—that the welfare payment, if I can call it that, is sufficient. I reject that at the same time as I reject some of the old schemes like interest rate subsidies, which I think more often than not encouraged poor behaviour and did nothing to encourage further drought-proofing within farm enterprises. There will be more to be done, and we must do more. But in this place and in the place over the other side we should be working on a bipartisan basis to make sure that we get the right policy—and good policy, not policy that is a compromise between competing political parties seeking to win the hearts and minds of the farming communities, and of course those people in the broader community who are so supportive of farming families.


I hope she will not mind me saying so, but last night Professor Botterill said that politics does play a role here, and sometimes you just cannot secure the best policy—you have to accept the second-best policy because of the nature in which politics does creep into these public policy issues. I rejected that, because she had also mentioned the need to have evidence based policy, and I said, 'I am far more attracted to evidence based policy than I am to second-best policy'. We should never accept second-best policy, and together in this place we should strive to ensure that we have the very best policy, and one that is fiscally responsible but takes into account the special place farmers have in our economy. They are the people who provide our food security; they are the people who put food on our table. They are the people who export two-thirds of everything they grow and therefore make an enormous contribution to our export earning. But, more particularly than all of that, they are people who are exposed to the vagaries of the weather like no other industry in our broad and very diverse economy.


But it is not just about that. It is about how we have a sustainable farming future, and how this country makes the most of the opportunities presented by the growing demand for food in Asia. We often talk about the Asian food bowl, but it is not a phrase I use. I think it is a misnomer. It implies that somehow Australia will play a substantial role in feeding the growing middle classes of Asia. Of course, that can never be the case. We can never produce the volumes necessary to feed a substantial part of that growing Asian middle class. To provide a mere five per cent of the additional food demand predicted by 2050, Australia would have to double its agricultural output by value.


That is still a lot of food though, which is why I prefer to refer to it as the dining boom. As we move on from the mining boom, we enter the dining boom, because a doubling in our output would still be a boom. A doubling of output would be a welcome achievement in this country, but a tripling of output would be even better, and it is not beyond our capability if we are smart about it. However, a tripling of the output will still not equate to a substantial share of the food demand in Asia. We will still be a small player there, but we would experience a boom here. A tripling in our output would be very nice.


The question then becomes: how do we get there? It is going to be hard. I have acknowledged in here before that I think the member for Hume, in an earlier life, was the key author of a report by ANZ bank and Port Jackson Partners, in which they suggested that to achieve our ambitions out to 2050 we will need something like $500 billion of infrastructure investment in this country. It is axiomatic, and clear to all of us here, that if we are going to get anywhere near that level of investment in this country we will need a great deal of foreign investment. That is why I am so disappointed that the government, so early in its life, has sent all the wrong signals to potential foreign investors by rejecting the ADM takeover of GrainCorp.


The former Labor government was investing heavily in one of the key infrastructure issues in this country, and that is the challenge we face getting our grains to export markets—through our rail lines in particular, and then through our ports. We were investing heavily in some of that rail infrastructure back in New South Wales and Western Australia—the key export state, because Western Australia exports about 90 per cent or more of the grains it grows—and that is something we are not seeing any more under this government.


It is true that fiscal rectitude in government is important. Keeping the budget in balance over the cycle is important. But those opposite, as they sneer, seem to constantly forget that only a few years ago we had the biggest global economic downturn since the great depression. We used that cycle responsibly and appropriately. It is all right putting money away in the cookie jar, but if you are under-investing in your critical infrastructure there is no net gain—there is a balance, and I fear this government does not propose to get that balance right. But, we shall see. I may be proven wrong.




Mr Briggs:
  You will be proven wrong.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Well, I will bet 20 cents I am right. I am not a gambler, so 20 cents will do the job. There is a much bigger issue at hand. The question becomes one of how we can produce twice as much food, or three times as much food, with the same water, land and human resources. How do you do that? Before I attempt to answer that, I will correct what I just asked, and add that it is also a question of how you do it with the same natural resources, when those resources are depleting. There is no doubt that we do face very large challenges in terms of our natural resources, whether it be in relation to salinity, land degradation, or a rapidly changing climate.


This is where it gets very interesting for me, because when I read all of the literature climate change is taken as a given. There does not seem to be any contest out there. There might be arguments about what causes climate change and there might be arguments about what we do about it—whether we should use mitigation or adaptation. But there is no argument that the climate is changing. I told a little story in this place recently about Bruce Tyrrell. I will not repeat it at length, but he pointed out to me that the bees are on his vines much later than usual, and he attributes that to climate change.


So, let us put to one side the debate about whether climate change is induced by human activity, or what we should do to mitigate it. The climate is changing and it is going to continue to change. The science on that is settled, and it is going to be bad news for our agriculture sector. Things are going to get tougher and drier, droughts are going to be more prolonged and will hit us more often. On the other side of the equation we are going to have rain events, and other cyclonic events, that are also going to make life difficult for those who live on our land and produce from it.


This is a serious issue. You cannot run around the country promoting the Asian food bowl concept if you are not serious about action on land resource sustainability. That is why it shocks me that the current government is progressing an agricultural white paper, whose terms of reference make no mention of natural resource sustainability or climate change. They did not have to call it climate change; they could have found another name. I know they do not like admitting that climate change is a problem in this country, but you cannot plan for the countries agricultural future without having a look at the impact of climate change in the future. You cannot plan our output and you cannot even plan infrastructure investment until you know what are the other impacts from changing weather patterns in this country. As I said at the NFF last night—and I know it is not music to the ears of every farmer in this country or every farming representative body—having not been the most enthusiastic supporter of mitigation on this side of the House over my 18 years here, and having not been the most enthusiastic supporter of every initiative taken in the area of climate change, I have always been a signatory to the precautionary principle—that is, if you are in doubt do something about it. Do not wait until it is too late. But that is on the economy more generally.


In this sector it is even more important. It is so clear to me that we will not double output by volume. We will not, certainly, triple output by volume with depleting natural resources—and depleting they are. Again, I have not seen any literature anywhere that contests that idea, and I look forward to hearing members in the other place make a contribution on this bill, because they might like to respond to that and share their thoughts with me.


I am inviting a bipartisan approach to this. Climate change, however you want to interpret it, is a challenge for all of us. I think it is time, like I suggest with the drought policy, we put the weapons down and work out as a parliament how we are going to deal with these challenges. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that those who sit opposite have the same greenhouse gas emissions reduction target as the Labor Party, the official opposition. It seems that we only have an argument about how we get there on the mitigation front—but, again, mitigation will only be one issue. Adaptation is going to be of critical importance. There were so many adaptation programs, broadly speaking, that were attached to the former, Labor government's response to climate change which now no longer have a funding source. I challenge, in the friendliest of ways, those sitting opposite to tell me how we are going to take up those opportunities that increasing global food demand is presenting for our country, without dealing with some of those climate issues and some of those adaptation issues that will be necessary.


Likewise, I challenge those opposite to tell me and to tell the House how we are going to get additional wheat to market without a significant initiative taken on the supply chain to our export markets. People talk about our proximity to Asia, and we certainly do have an advantage in terms of our proximity to Asia. But in transport cost terms it is an advantage that can be very quickly eroded and, indeed, is being eroded by our inability to compete on the supply chain to the port rather than after our goods leave port. These are issues that will have to be tackled, not just by this government but, again, by people who are looking for some bipartisanship on these issues by this parliament more generally. We will not agree all of the time and, I am sure, we will often disagree, but Australia has a wonderful opportunity here and we should be grabbing hold of it and doing something about it. An agricultural white paper without any reference to climate change will not get us there; a lack of references to sustaining natural resources will not get us there; and a lazy, myopic approach to what we need in terms of infrastructure in this country will not get us there either.


We have the worst of both worlds here on that front—the government is not going to spend any money on infrastructure and it is not going to let foreign investors in to spend their money on infrastructure. That is very disappointing from my perspective, and I am sure it is disappointing from the perspective of many who live off the land and supply us and our export markets with food.


I want to go back to where I began, and that is on the specifics of drought policy. This is a very important safety net again borne out of the intergovernmental agreement when the Labor Party was in government. But I note it was supported by those who sit opposite and, of course, supported by all states of the day. It was a big thing to get rid of the old exceptional circumstances policies. So many farmers had come to rely on them for such a long time. They were very popular amongst many farmers, but all the literature said they should go. All the states agreed that they should go. But we should not, and cannot, stop here. The safety net is important, but we need to find new and innovative ways, not so much to respond during drought but to ensure all those who run farm businesses have access to incentives that ensure that they are better prepared for drought. The alternative to that, of course, will be to say, 'If you are on marginal land, just get off.' Again, going back to our ambitions in Asia, we cannot afford for anyone to get off. We need all the farmers we can get. We need to do all the farming that we can do. But we will need investment. We will need more policies on adaptation in addition to mitigation. Of course, we will also need more on research and development. No matter what we do on adaptation—and they are the one and the same, really—and no matter what we do on infrastructure investment, it just will not be possible to very substantially increase output without more innovation.


Australia farmers and the RDCs and others who support them—our universities and our learning institutions—have been at world's best in these initiatives. But we will have to do much better. We have kept our productivity up in the past and we have increased output in the past through both the use of new fertilisers and the use of additional land, but that is plateauing and we need a new phase, a new round, of innovation. There will not be more land; there might be less land. We will rely very, very heavily on innovation. I welcome the government's commitment on that front to its pre-election promise for an additional $100 million in research and development. I understand that promise will be kept. I will be disappointed and the farming community will be disappointed if it is not, but I am confident it will be. I understand it is to be split amongst the RDCs; so, instead of a dollar-for-dollar basis, the government might pay $1.05 or $1.10 to the RDCs. That is a good thing. Dare I say, at the risk of making a commitment in addition to that—I am certainly not doing that this stage of the political cycle—we will, sadly, need more to produce the sort of innovation we will need to make the most of those opportunities.


Of course, along the way we will have a debate about genetically modified crops. It is a debate we have to have because, I suspect, we will not realise our ambitions without proper management and taking up of opportunities GM crops present for many reasons, whether it be crop protection, our capacity to lift our output et cetera.


Finally, on that point, the dining boom will come best for us if we do not just chase volumes but, more importantly, chase value. Our limited resources will need to be concentrated on those commodities and agricultural interests which produce the greatest possible return for our country. Our farmers do not need that lecture from me; they know that, as do their peak bodies. In working together in this place I believe that, while not building a capacity to substantially feed Asia, we can position ourselves as a country which produces a lot more food than we do now and which sees a much greater return on our produce than we do now.


But we will have to be very smart about it. We are going to have to be more open to foreign investment. We are going to have to be more willing to invest in infrastructure. We are going to have to be more willing to invest in R&D. And of course we are going to have to be more willing to ensure that those who are on marginal land—those people we want to stay in the sector—have the protection they need when severe drought comes, and that in my view means making sure the appropriate incentives are in place that give them the opportunity to do what so many in the industry are doing: preparing themselves as best they can for future drought events. The opposition supports this bill.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:40):  I stand in this place today as the daughter of a farmer and in strong support of the Farm Household Support Bill 2014. I understand the trials and tribulations that go with depending on the land for your living. In fact, I remember when growing up they introduced a board game called Squatter, and my father could never bring himself to play it, because he said it was too realistic. Every round of the board you were faced with a drought, a famine, a fire and a flood; and, if you survived that, usually your stud ram died in the last few squares of the game.


As the drought takes hold, farmers have to watch as their cattle slowly starve and their crops turn to dust. You cannot do anything to help them; there is no water to make the grass grow, and buying food for cattle becomes increasingly expensive. There are many who speak up about the isolated incidents of animal cruelty that happen overseas, yet I question where their voices are now when hundreds of thousands of animals are dying slow, painful deaths in our own country.


Assistance to farmers in times of need is a serious matter. I am proud today to stand on this side of the chamber bringing in legislation that will establish the farm household allowance and give some small hope and assistance to Australia farmers. It is the determination of this government to stand by these Australians in the hard times. We cannot work miracles—there are no magic wands—but we do what we need to offer some small support. This new package will assist drought affected farm businesses and farm families in dealing with the immediate financial pressures and improve their capacity to recover when the current drought breaks. The coalition government is introducing measures that will assist farmers and their families with managing during drought and being in a stronger financial and emotional position to effectively recover when the drought ends.


This package includes measures that offer financial, social and mental health support to our farming communities. The drought assistance package will provide $280 million to hundreds of farmers to access five-year concessional loans at a rate of four per cent up to the value of $1 million. It enables farmers to access a fortnightly farm household allowance which is equivalent to the Newstart allowance even if they have total net farm assets of up to $2.5 million on paper. This package will also provide additional money to the Queensland and New South Wales state governments for water related infrastructure rebates as well as $10 million to help reduce the impacts of wild pigs and other pest animals. Another $10.7 million will be provided to help with the delivery of social support services, including access to mental health support in drought affected areas.


As the Prime Minister has stated, the measures in this bill are largely building on existing programs, but the coalition government is making them more responsive to the particular needs of farmers who are hit by drought. The interim farm household allowance will replace the current transitional farm family payment, and payments to new applicants under the interim farm household allowance started back on 3 March 2014. The coalition recognises that most farmers cannot easily access other forms of assistance compared to others in financial hardship. Having a farmer-specific income support payment ensures that these farmers in hardship can access support when they need it most to put food on the table and pay the bills. The new payment provides a more generous asset test than the previous transitional farm family payment, ensuring more families and farmers can receive support in difficult times. Under the new payment farmers will automatically receive a Health Care Card, and these changes are an interim measure until the farm household allowance commences on 1 July 2014. Funding for this measure is uncapped, meaning it will be available to anyone meeting the eligibility criteria.


We often hear in the media about drought affecting farmers, but rarely do we understand what it actually means. The most immediate consequence of drought is a fall in crop production, due to inadequate and poorly distributed rainfall, and the subsequent loss of income. Farmers are then faced with harvests that are too small to both feed their families and fulfil their other commitments. Livestock sales act as a buffer in times of hardship, with farmers divesting of these assets to buy food. The first animals to be sold are usually those which make the least contribution to farm production, such as sheep and goats. However, as the period of drought-induced flood deficit lengthens farmers will have to start selling transport and draft animals as well as breeding stock, which constitutes the basis of the household's wealth.


Farming is a very significant part of our economy and will continue to play a crucial role in our economic future, which is why the coalition government is offering this $324 million dollar drought lifeline to our struggling farmers. The future of farming is vital to the future of Australia. I am proud to support these measures and I commend the bill to the House.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (12:45):  Very few times in this House do we see a level of bipartisanship, but this is one issue—standing by people in drought and making sure that they know that the Australian government is listening to them and they are being heard—where this is the case. I thank the member for Hunter for his kind words and also, before me, the member for Ryan for her kind words.


As a farmer myself, one of the things that I used to wonder about was whether anyone in this green chamber in this place called Canberra had an appreciation of what it was to live through a drought. I want to reflect for a little bit as we talk about this issue today about just what it is like. My journey has involved farming through many of the millennium drought years. You think you can make the right choices, and you think you can make wise choices. I know what it is like to have a $90,000 interest bill and to have a wife who is earning $40,000, and because she was earning $40,000 it precluded us from being eligible for drought assistance.


It is pleasing that in this package we have learnt something: we have learnt that you can actually have $80,000 of off-farm income and still receive access to some drought assistance. That is a welcome initiative. It needs to be stated that there are a lot of hardworking partners of farmers who are really battling to put food on the table, and we are really pleased to see that in this initiative they are not precluding themselves from being eligible for farm support.


In a drought, there are times that you always remember. One of those times for us was toward what we thought was going to be the end of a drought. We made a decision that we were going to buy some young stock. It is important at the end of a drought that the stock you have is young because you want to have the best recovery phase. We did; we bought this stock from Tasmania and we brought them over—two days to bring them over on the ship. We had mortgaged ourselves more to afford this. We put the stock on some water—they were quite thirsty; it was hot and it was dry. I went back to my house that night.


That night the stock agent rang up and said, 'I hope that stock arrived safely?' I said, 'Yes, they did'. He said, 'Now you didn't put them on water did you?' And I said, 'Well, they were thirsty, of course I did'. He said, 'No, you know that is the last thing you should do!' As I now know, when they have an empty belly and you put them on some water, they drink the water, they blow up and they die. So here were we at the end of a drought, taking a financial risk only to find out that we may have just blown another $40,000 on stock.


We drove down there that night and there was one dead sheep there and another dead sheep over there. I have to tell you, if you want to see pressure on mental health for a young farmer with a big mortgage who has just taken a risk and it has blown up in his face, that was one of them. I called up my father to bring over some bales of hay. I called my wife on the UHF to come down and they tried to move those stock around the paddock in order to get them to pass that water by moving. We tried our best and, as irony would have it, a dust storm—I know is sounds like the movies, but it is very real in my mind—rolled in. My wife was at one end of the paddock and I could not physically see her. I had dead sheep. We were trying to move sheep, and we were trying to do the right thing. If you want to see something that brings a person to breaking point, that is drought.


What I want to say to the green chamber is that we have people in this place now who have lived it, and in living it you understand it. We have to have that experience right across the Australian spectrum. We must stand by people through drought. It is easy to have the philosophical argument about whether they are on unviable land? Should we be farming there anyway? Is this corporate welfare? Now is not the time for that argument. The time for that discussion is when we are not in drought, when we can sit back with emotion out of the way and discuss how we create a drought-preparedness model. Something that the Australian parliament, in my opinion, has not done effectively yet, and which is the challenge for us. But the times when people are looking at dry dams, trying to make tough decisions about their own future and looking at their children, knowing that they want to pass on that farm to them—knowing that their father or their mother has worked hard to pass it on—those are the times when we should say, 'We stand by you, we believe in what you do, we recognise your contribution to the Australian economy and we are prepared to release some community funds—some tax payer funds—to ensure you have a viable future.'


This drought package is really about that. We have concessional loans; this is not a gift, this is a loan. It is to buy you time to restructure your business; to buy you time, because we know that this is the land of droughts and flooding rains. As sure as it is dry, it will be wet again. Whenever it is wet, it will be dry again. This is to buy them time for when the good times return—and they will return. They did for me, they will for you.


The one thing that is important when you are talking to people who are in drought is to remind them that it will rain again, you will make money again and there is a future for the Australian agricultural industry. Never, never rob people of hope. When people are going through crisis, the one thing they hold onto is hope. You never rob them of that. This is why we can have the discussion about climate change, but the discussion about drought is recognition of seasonal viability. There is a long-term future for you involved in agriculture; there is a long-term future for the northern cattle industry that is getting hit very hard at the moment. This government understands that there is a long-term future, and we will stand by you.


One of the great things in this package is a recognition of mental health. In a previous life I was president of the Victorian Farmers Federation. I used to say to blokes, 'When was the last time you changed the oil in your tractor?' And they would be able to say, 'Well, actually, it has been three months; it has done 470 hours, it is a 500 hours oil change—it is time to do that'. I then used to ask them when their wedding anniversary was, and they usually did not know that. I also used to ask them when the last time was they went and had a health check-up. Farmers are notorious for not getting health check-ups.


Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. I say to the farmers who are doing it tough: 'Please get up early one morning. Get the jobs done you have to do then go see a doctor. Get your physical health and your mental health checked. You are the most important asset on your farm. You need to look after yourself. The best thing you can do for your family is look after your health. Be a little selfish for a change and look after your mental health.'


When I was talking to farmers in those very lean years I would find that the wives would be carrying the burden. The farmer would be full of bravado but the wife would realise that her husband was under pressure. I do not care what they say; they are under more pressure than they think. It is pleasing to see that we have recognised that as a community now. There is no stigma attached to saying you are under pressure and seeking some help. The $10.7 million in this support package for mental health is a very good thing.


Another great thing I see in this package is some water infrastructure. One of the great revolutions of agriculture that no-one talks about is the poly pipe. Being able to take water to stock enables you to drive productivity through different stocking ratios. It is pleasing that in this package there is continued infrastructure investment in water and some small, on-farm packages to help farmers put poly pipes and tanks in.


Whilst I talked about the young stock on my own farm that I try to get at the end of the drought, I have always had a passion in agriculture to ensure that we have young farmers at the end of the drought because young famers drive the greatest productivity. Those under 35 are the best productivity drivers for the country. They are the people we do not want to lose. They usually are the ones who are most in debt. They have taken the financial risk. They have gone out and have grown and endeavoured. They are the ones who lease additional pieces of ground and try something new. We have to make sure we look after them. I hope in this drought package we hit the mark to make sure that young farmers stay there because it is not just for their benefit; this is actually for the country's benefit.


Before the member for Hunter left the chamber he pointed out the dining boom. There are great opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region for the agricultural industry, particularly in mechanised starch products and protein products. When I was in China a number of years ago I talked to a guy who was 30th in charge of China. When you have 1.3 billion people, that is fairly high on the pecking order—Mr Deputy Speaker, even higher than you, relative to the population. I had a discussion with him about the merits of democracy—and I am digressing here—and he told me that if they had democracy they might do what is popular instead of what is right. Maybe he did win the argument in that instance.


In the discussions he made it clear to me that the current consumption of dairy products was 56 grams per child per day. It was the Chinese government's ambition to increase that to 500 grams of dairy product per child per day. In this chamber here people generally have good health. We probably do not have a full appreciation of just what protein in the diet does for the health of children and people. I want to hark back to a little bit of history here. When the Massachusetts colony settled in America, the people who left Britain and first settled in America, within three generations, because they had access to red meat and dairy products, their life expectancy jumped by 20 years. The Chinese know this. They want to give their children protein. We are actually well placed for that. One-third of the world's export milk comes out of Victoria and New Zealand. We are well placed to really hit the Asia-Pacific region and for a change we actually have a freight advantage over our competitors because of our proximity to the markets.


What I want to drive home is that when we go through a drought we must make sure out the other side we have young farmers, who will drive productivity. That productivity is going to drive our export markets. Even in my small, humble electorate we produce $5.3 billion worth of exports every year. If you multiply that right across Australia, the contribution of the agricultural sector is significant. It is also significant for the secondary workforce in marketing, transport, refining and research and development. We have a good industry to be proud of. I think the $320 million drought package is simply an investment in our future. It is saying to the people in drought: 'We stand by you. We understand what it is like to go through drought. We value you. Your contribution is needed as we continue to grow this great economy.'

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (12:58):  It is a real privilege to speak today on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. We have heard from a lot of members of parliament today who represent rural electorates—and of course they have a special interest in this legislation. But I think it is really important that members of parliament who represent in this place big parts of our cities—and I represent an electorate in Melbourne—come forward and say how supportive we are on behalf of our constituents of putting in place this necessary and important support for farmers who are genuinely struggling in a once-in-a-generation drought in this country.


I want to echo the very good words I heard earlier from our shadow spokesperson on agriculture, Joel Fitzgibbon. He indicated that this is an area where we see strong potential for bipartisanship. Labor has done a lot of good work in the area of drought policy, which I will talk a little bit about. Importantly, today Labor is standing here in partnership with those on the other side to say it is important that we support our farmers, and that is what this legislation is trying to do.


I want to talk to some of the specifics of the legislation. This legislation provides a mechanism to implement the farm household allowance. That is up to three years of income support payments or ancillary benefits for farmers and their partners who can demonstrate financial hardship. The FHA is to commence on 1 July 2014. It is set to replace the exceptional circumstances relief payment, which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, was available only to regions declared to be in extreme drought. Importantly, the bill acknowledges that the government has implemented the interim farm household allowance and allows for the transfer of existing support scheme recipients. It makes some other changes to various pieces of legislation that essentially bring those things together. 


I will speak in a little more detail on the specifics of this legislation, but I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about why this issue is so important for Labor. It speaks to our genuine commitment to supporting Australia's farmers and farming communities, especially in an hour of need such as we have before us today. The member for Hunter talked about the high regard in which farmers are held in the broader community. Speaking from the city perspective, I can echo that. What I hear from many constituents talking to me about economic changes in Australia is that they want to live in a country that continues to make things. That speaks to some of the importance of our manufacturing industry, but it also talks about primary industries and agriculture. People talk to me about a feeling that comes through of the honesty and integrity of actual production. 


We have a very proud history of agriculture in our country. When we look back on our history, we see that this is the foundation stone of Australia's economy. It was where we started to see this exciting spirit of innovation that we have carried right through our economic history in Australia. You can look back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the development of the stump-jump plough, the combine harvester and irrigation. These are all things that have spread and reformed agriculture all over the world. They are things that happened right here in Australia. When people like the member for Chifley and I put our heads together and think about Australia's economic future, what we try to think about is how we can harness that incredible spirit of innovation and bring that to newer sectors on which we will rely more on the future. Innovation has been the watchword. 


We have seen an incredible transformation happen to agriculture in this country. Today, farms that would have required hundreds of employees can be run with just a handful of employees. That is great for efficiency, although it does create issues in some of those farming communities. We are well aware of those. The critical point to acknowledge today is that Australia's agricultural industry is one of the most efficient in the entire world, one of the least protected agricultural communities in the entire world. It is really important that Australians understand that this sector has worked through a very difficult transition over the last 20 or 30 years to get to this point. When I talk to the Victorian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers' Federation about reforms like the one that is before us today, what I hear is them saying, 'We have done the hard yards'. They have done the hard yards. The farmers of this country have made some incredibly tough decisions. They have come out the other end with an agriculture sector that we can be incredibly proud of here in our country. 


I think there is a consensus that, having done those hard yards, when something really catastrophic happens, particularly like what we see happening in Queensland, city people are happy to support their country cousins with a safety net. The legislation that we are talking about today is putting that into place. When we think about the economic future of our country, it really has yet to seep into the mindset of Australians that agriculture is not an industry of yesterday for us; it is actually an industry of the future. The member for Hunter talked about what he likes to call the 'dining boom'. We know that demand for food in our world is going to double over the next 15 or so years. We cannot double the amount of agricultural land; it is going to mean more efficiency and more productivity on existing agricultural land. Our Australian farmers can really benefit from this. As I said, we have a long history of innovation. We are poised to take this big opportunity in hand. 


But what we will need to do is see farmers through some difficult times such as what we are seeing right now, hence the importance of this legislation. We can be part of this very exciting boom that many in this chamber talk about frequently. But we do need to support our farmers to get there, hence this legislation and, of course, Labor's support for it. 


I wish to speak a little bit more about the context. I do not know if any the listeners at home or people in the chamber have taken the time to look at the map of Queensland and see the drought affected areas, but it is genuinely terrifying to see, because almost the whole of Queensland has been declared a drought zone. I think what we are seeing now in Queensland is the largest portion of land ever to be declared drought affected. There is just a little thin strip across the eastern coast of Queensland which is declared not drought affected. Scores of shires have been added to the list of drought affected areas of Queensland. I think this is a very specific incident and definitely justifies the legislation before us. 


Let me go back to some specifics of the legislation I wanted to touch on. One of the reasons Labor is so supportive of this is that the bill delivers on what was Labor's commitment under the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform. This was to provide a new nationally agreed approach to drought programs this included time-limited income support payment for farmers and their partners, based on individual need. We are very happy to see that come into the legislation. If we were to quibble at the margins on this one, there is a question here about the timing of the legislation. We have known about drought conditions in parts of Australia for some months now. There is a little disappointment that it took so long to get to this point when it was obvious some months ago what was needed. We would have liked to have seen this bill be introduced much sooner to enable more timely assistance to struggling farm families who really have been in limbo for quite some time. 


A second point I would make on this one is that it is focused on the short term. What Labor wants to see is a real, genuine conversation about long-term drought preparations between this parliament and the farming community in Australia and the bodies that represent them. One of the things that has been disappointing is to see that in December 2013, the Abbott government decided to abolish the key COAG vehicle, the Standing Committee on Primary Industries. That body was established just to consider this question of long-term drought management. It is something that both sides of the House should be keen to work on. Last year, the Commonwealth government and the states agreed through that committee to transition away from the exceptional circumstances program and towards a policy that promoted greater drought planning and preparedness. Unfortunately, despite some rhetoric about interest in long-term drought reform from the other side of the House, we have seen a government that has run for six months now with no real progress on that front. I know the National Farmers' Federation are talking about things we can do to help our farmers in the longer term and we are very committed on this side to see that work progress. So we will continue to hold the government to account and to speak to the other side about how we can progress long-term drought policy.


I might close with a bit more of a sense of the personal on this one. I am very fortunate to have married into a family of dairy farmers in northern Victoria. They are a part of a wonderful dairy community in our little town called Gunbower. Having a city background and then being exposed to this set of small communities in northern Victoria, I know it is really hard to understand, unless you experience it day to day, how tough things can be for farmers in a period of drought.  What a lot of Australians who live in our cities do not realise is that, when a community falls on tough times, it affects not just farming families; everyone is affected. All small businesses are affected and everyone just goes into a deep struggle. 


Something else we probably do not realise, aside from the widespread effect of things like serious drought, is just how tough things really get for our farmers. Being a part of this big farming family, I know people genuinely struggle to put food on the table. That is not hyperbole; it is real. I know that the people of Hotham do not want to live in a country where we have significant portions of our population who are working doing backbreaking labour day in, day out and still cannot feed their families. I see this package of legislation as my community standing beside fellow Australians, both in good times and in bad. I am very pleased to join the voices in the parliament who are supporting this package.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (13:09):  May I at the outset commend the member for Hotham for her generous and heartfelt words and for her support for this very important legislation, the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. I might add that her predecessor, Simon Crean, was also very interested in regional Australia. I had a lot of time for Simon Crean, as the member for Hotham, for the role he played in regional Australia. I hope that his successor follows in his footsteps by also playing a good productive role in regional Australia. We certainly welcome the points the member for Hotham just made. 


However, I must take issue with some of the things said by her colleague Mr Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter and shadow agriculture minister. He downplayed the ability of Australian farmers to support the Asian century by being a food bowl for the Pacific rim, supplying the growing and burgeoning markets in Asia. By 2050, the world's population will reach nine billion, if not more. Certainly Joel Fitzgibbon mentioned that, but he said he thought that the Asian food bowl was a misnomer. He thought that we would not be able to produce the volume and, in his words, 'double the output' to support the growing protein need of the Asian middle class, but we would if we had the right policy settings. 


The coalition are doing everything we can to provide those policy settings. We went to the last election with a plan to develop a strong five-pillar economy of which agriculture was very much one of the most prominent parts. In the last parliament, the 43rd Parliament, we saw an attack on agriculture, an attack on our farmers by the Labor government. We saw the live cattle export fiasco and the slowness to react to the Asian bee incursion, but the very worst was what Labor did, in cahoots with the Greens, with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. 


I probably spoke on water more than anyone else in the last parliament. Perhaps I harped on it but it is important. As Samuel McCaughey, the founder of Australian irrigation, certainly the founder of Riverina irrigation, stated, 'Water is a more important and valuable resource than gold.' He recognised the need for water and he pioneered the irrigation channels which now flow throughout the Riverina providing wonderful fresh food and fibre for the growing Asian market and feeding and clothing our own nation. Sir Samuel McCaughey's words should never be forgotten, certainly not in this place where we set policy hopefully to help our farmers and our irrigators. That is what these bills seek to do. 


At an international food summit speech, former Prime Minister Julia Gillard raised the question: could Australia become the new food bowl of Asia? She certainly thought the answer was yes. She revealed to the crowd her vision for the country to become a global superpower, to meet the needs of a rapidly emerging Asian population. It would involve building our food processing industries so that they can supply Asia's growing consumer markets and developing research technologies and logistics to strengthen irrigation. I repeat: the former Prime Minister said strengthen irrigation, grow higher yielding crops and improve food safety. Her remarks angered leaders in the agriculture and the food-processing sectors who argued that the federal government's policies did not align with that idea—and they were certainly right. 


Victorian Farmers Federation President Peter Tuohey said that the looming carbon tax and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority were expected to have disastrous effects on agricultural people—growers and farmers in Australia—and he was certainly right. He said that the current MDBA plan will remove 30 per cent to 35 per cent of water from irrigators who produce more than 40 per cent of Australia's food. We know that the carbon tax continues to be a huge impost on our farmers, on the people who grow the food to feed our nation. It certainly rings true today. Julia Gillard was right and her own party should have put in the policy settings to enable what she then perceived to become a reality. 


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was a disaster. Fortunately, New South Wales has just come on board. They held out for a better deal, wisely so, so that they could get the sorts of policy settings from a government that actually cares about irrigation farmers—that is, the coalition—to make sure that New South Wales got the very best deal. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Simon Birmingham, whose portfolio area includes water, came out and allocated an additional 10 gigalitres of environmental flows to the Gwydir Valley for productive use. If there had been bipartisan support—as there is with the Farm Household Support Bill—for irrigation, as Labor claims there now is, why did Senator Birmingham's idea get attacked in January when he allocated that additional 10 gigalitres of water? It is because Labor says one thing but then does another. 


I am very pleased to support this bill today. The Farm Household Support Bill 2014, in conjunction with the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014, serves to repeal the existing Farm Support Act 1992. It provides a farm household allowance and transitional farm support payments—the interim FHA—from 3 March 2014 to farming families in need, and there are many of them. The government recognises that the Farm Support Act 1992, which this bill repeals, has been an important mechanism by which successive governments have delivered much-needed assistance to Australian farming families for more than two decades. However, we equally acknowledge that we need to reform the way assistance is delivered to the farming sector if we want farmers to have a viable future. That is what this bill does and that is what Australia needs.


Governments of all persuasions have historically valued Australia's agricultural sector highly. We accept that the assistance that we give to our farmers is a special type of assistance and is given in recognition of the very unique circumstances in which they live and work. As the famous slogan goes, every family needs a farmer. It is true. Every family, every community and every nation needs a farmer. The agricultural sector delivers significant economic benefits to communities in many parts—I would say all parts—of our country and indeed to the country as a whole. As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, Australian agricultural exports reached $38 billion last year. That equated to 13.8 per cent of all Australian exports. The gross value add of agricultural production was some $47 billion. In my electorate of Riverina the gross value of agricultural production came to $1.8 billion in 2010, which equated to 16 per cent of the New South Wales total. It is no wonder that people call the Riverina the food bowl of the state. I would say that it is the best food bowl of Australia. Agriculture is our single largest industry, providing 7,900 jobs or 12 per cent of the total employment, which is the highest of all sectors. There are 4.4 million hectares of productive farming in the Riverina region—2.5 million hectares of grazing land, a further 1.5 used for cropping and the rest either in forestry or set aside for conservation. The Riverina has a diverse variety of agricultural products from wheat to beef, rice, barley, dairy and cotton. The Riverina produces the largest output of potatoes, almonds, oranges and apples of any region in New South Wales. We are also the largest producer of wine grapes and wine in New South Wales. Agriculture is therefore a strategically vital industry not just for the state and for the nation but also for my own electorate. I know that the member for Parkes, who is sitting in the chamber, would certainly agree with the role that the Riverina plays. I know the role that his electorate also plays—it is the biggest electorate in the state and certainly a key player in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is a critical industry in the Riverina and I am committed to supporting it. I know that the member for Parkes is also an avid supporter of everything agriculture based, in both good times and bad.


While we are fortunate that the drought has not yet had the impact in the Riverina that it certainly has had in Mark Coulton's electorate, there are certainly areas within my electorate that are beginning to feel the effects of drought. Places in the north-west of my electorate—in the Bland Shire, in the Carrathool Shire and in places such as West Wyalong, Ungarie and Rankins Springs—are experiencing drought-like conditions. It is very dry. I am proud to be able to support measures such as this which will directly benefit those in my electorate who need assistance now and may well need it into the future. As the Prime Minister highlighted recently on his national drought tour, Australia is currently in the midst of a severe and prolonged drought—a once-in-a-century drought for some areas. Last year alone, more than 150 temperature records were broken across the country. It was the hottest year on record according to the Bureau of Meteorology's recent report, State of the climate 2014. Projections from both the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the weather bureau suggest we will continue to experience higher temperatures into the future. It would be prudent, given those projections, that we prepare ourselves for a future where we are at higher risk of drought. To that end, I would say we need to be prepared for this—we need to build more dams. I said it in my inaugural speech, I will say it again and I will say it in my valedictory speech—hopefully by then we will have built a few more dams—we certainly need more water storage. 


The income support this bill will introduce is part of a comprehensive package of drought assistance measures the Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture announced on 28 February. This bill, and indeed the entire drought assistance package, is the result of significant work by this government to deliver a credible and sustainable support mechanism for farming households and farm businesses facing the impacts of drought. The government's full suite of policies is appropriately and unashamedly focused on building community resilience and drought preparedness as we move away from the sometimes ad-hoc and crisis-response nature of successive drought policies in years gone by, particularly over the past six years.


The Farm Household Support Bill 2014 provides for up to three years of income support to farmers and their partners affected by drought anywhere in Australia subject to eligibility criteria. Importantly, the income support provided for in this bill is not contingent on a climatic trigger, such as an Exceptional Circumstances drought declaration, which is required to access an Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment under the existing act. To be eligible for the FHA, applicants must meet a revised means test which provides for a higher asset threshold than normal, taking into account the value of property and other capital which farm businesses hold but which is not sufficiently illiquid or productive due to the drought. This brings the FHA in line with other forms of social security assistance so that we are supporting individuals and families who are facing similar hardships in earning an income. 


Subject to eligibility criteria, and in line with other social security payments, receipt of the FHA confers a range of further ancillary benefits to recipient families including a health care card, a telephone allowance, a remote area allowance, a clean energy supplement—the carbon tax compo—and rent assistance. Receipt of FHA will in some instances also qualify young people, most importantly, to meet the parental means test for youth allowance, which is vital for many of our regional youth who are forced to relocate to pursue higher education and vocational training opportunities. This is a sector of people who were forgotten under Labor. Importantly, it is now a requirement that people undertake a financial improvement agreement and have a farm finance assessment carried out in order to qualify for the FHA. Neither of these processes is intended to be one size fits all, and both are equally important in assisting recipients to determine their own futures. 


Implicit in this policy is an acknowledgment that not all farm households will stay involved in farming either during or following periods of drought—that is a reality—but the best thing government can do is to support these households to make the best decision for them in their circumstances. There is provision for a $3,000 payment, known as an activity supplement, to assist people to retrain, seek advice or engage in another approved activity consistent with their financial improvement agreement. Under this approach, there are still obligations placed on allowance recipients. However, more significantly, as a government we want to support recipients in meaningful and practical ways as they transition through this period of uncertainty in their lives.


While the FHA will be demand driven, the cost of this income support measure is expected to be in the order of $99.4 million over three years in both administered and program expenses. Certainly, the farm household allowance is an important component of the government's drought assistance package, but every part of the government's additional $320 million commitment is necessary in assisting communities through periods of drought. Income support alone, no matter how well designed, is not enough to get our communities through the drought. That is why the other measures are so important. These include the $280 million in concessional loans, $12 million for water infrastructure, $10 million for pest management and $10.7 million for social and mental health services. As the member for Mallee pointed out, social and mental health services are so crucial. 


I digress for a moment to point out that this Saturday at the Coolamon Sport and Recreation Club there is a family fun day for those people who are suffering the effects of mental pressure. Its purpose is to ease the burden on those people through getting together and talking about all things rural related and having a good time. I certainly would recommend anybody in the vicinity of Coolamon to attend and avail themselves of the opportunities there. In conclusion, I support this bill.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (13:24):  I rise today to speak on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. This bill is very close to my heart and it is very important to the people I represent. Indeed, the Parkes electorate has been the epicentre of this current drought. In particular, the three shires along the Queensland border—Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett—and the western end of the Moree Shire and the northern end of the Coonamble Shire have been dry for a very long time. To put it into context, in a normal season the Walgett Shire produces a million tonnes of wheat. Last year, they produced none. The sad reality is that this drought is not over. Indeed, with no subsoil moisture and the window for planting winter crops only a matter of months away, circumstances look incredibly dire for the next 12 months.


I acknowledge the Prime Minister's support for this bill. I also acknowledge the very good work by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce. While this drought affects a large area, in the overall scheme of things it does not affect a large number of people. However, through the work of Barnaby Joyce, this drought became known right across the nation. I acknowledge the work that he did in bringing the plight of the people I represent onto the national stage. The Prime Minister visited Bourke, stood in a paddock completely denuded of grass and recognised that we were actually witnessing a natural disaster, and I believe that was very beneficial. The fact that he ended up getting 70 millimetres of rain on top of him before he left was an added benefit. While that was a wonderful start for the area around Bourke, I was out there last week and it is still very dry elsewhere—particularly in the Walgett-Collarenebri area, but right across into the slopes back towards Moree and Warialda. So we are in the middle of a very dry time and we have not seen the end of it yet. 


This package has several components. Indeed, the interim farm household allowance will give people who are in very desperate circumstances access to funds to pay immediate household bills and put food on the table. So, regardless of whatever else they are battling in their daily lives, they will know that they have money to feed their families and pay essential bills. I also acknowledge that some of the guidelines for receiving that support have been changed in this bill. I very much welcome that. This will allow more people to access these funds, as some of the people who were excluded under the previous system will now be included.


Another component of the package is the concessional loans, with $280 million available to people at a reduced interest rate. That will give farmers access to funds to continue buying fodder for their stock and to pay immediate farm bills. This is not going to cure the ills of the drought and it is certainly not going to completely take the pressure off farmers. As they look forward, with mounting debts and no end in sight, it is, and will remain, a very stressful time. These concessional loans will act as a circuit breaker, allowing farmers to access some funds and maybe offset some of the long-term debt they have with the banks. These concessional loans may allow them to get some interest relief and free up a bit of cash for farm expenditure.


The water related infrastructure fund is also a very crucial part of that. I am rapidly coming to the end of my time to speak now but, hopefully, when I am able to conclude this presentation I will be able to expand on the need for the water infrastructure fund and the fact that water is—

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:11):  The Farm Household Support Bill 2014 introduces a new safety payment for struggling farmers in this country. It comes from the intergovernmental agreement secured by the former Labor government, and on that basis I can report that the opposition will be supporting this bill. I note that the bill has a cost to the budget of $99.4 million over four years and further note that something like $37.6 million of that is allocated as administrative costs to the budget. I invite the minister, when he closes this debate, to provide further detail if he can on that administrative charge. I know some of it relates to ICT resourcing and new systems being put in place to administer this particular program, but it is an extraordinary amount of money as a percentage of the total allocation. I invite him to share the reasons for that with the House.


This is definitely a supportable initiative flowing from the intergovernmental agreement. It is the latest iteration of the safety net we have in place for farming businesses and farming families when they run into financial difficulty, whether it be because of drought or for other reasons. I note that this is not just a drought initiative; it is an initiative that will be available to all farming families, regardless of the cause of the circumstances in which they find themselves. The key to this particular initiative is the means testing of that payment, which would of course be far more generous than the means testing for Newstart allowance, or as some would call it the dole, for other potential recipients. That is of course due to the fact that farmers typically have substantial capital assets on their properties which in most cases would deny them the capacity to be eligible for Newstart allowance—and similarly with income testing. The situation for farmers can be quite different.


Last night, I participated in a discussion at the National Farmers Federation—the topic was drought and the challenges ahead. Senator Richard Colbeck, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, also participated in the debate. Professor Linda Botterill, from the ANU, made the point, as I often have, that farmers in Australia are held in very high regard by the broader community. I see you, Madam Speaker, nodding your head in agreement. As I said to her last night: as I usually put it, farmers are up there with ambos, firemen, policemen and members of the military—unlike politicians, who typically are down there with used car salesmen. And you do not need to do any empirical research to know that, although Professor Botterill was able to back it with some research on this subject last night. So I have no doubt that all Australians will be pleased to hear us debating this particular bill, and to see we are reaching out in acknowledgement of the severity of the current drought and the assistance farming families find themselves in need of. Again, this is not a drought initiative per se, although certainly it has its genesis in the discussion with the states on future drought policy.


As many members of this place would know, we have been struggling with drought policy in this country since Federation, really. Certainly since 1990 there has been a raft of reports on drought policy, each of them voluminous. If you read the latest Productivity Commission report—I think it was from 2008—half of the report reflects on earlier reports on drought. It is a complex and difficult area. I think there is a settled consensus in this country that some sort of safety net is appropriate; I have never seen the matter that is before the House today contested. But there have been many challenges to the various forms of drought policy we have had in the past—whether they are efficient and whether the objectives of drought policy or the programs under that drought policy are consistent with the objectives of the particular drought policy of the day.


Again, this was a matter for debate last night, and I made the point then—and this is always the big challenge with drought policy—that in 2007-08, for example, only 27 per cent of our farmers accessed the old 'exceptional circumstances' regime. That is still a large number, 27 per cent, but it indicates that 'farms ain't farms'. Some farms are more sophisticated than others and bigger than others, and some have made a much greater effort to ready themselves for drought—to drought-proof themselves, if that term is appropriate—and to be well prepared for drought. Others possibly—and often through no fault of their own—have not had the resources to do that and find themselves on marginal land and therefore subject to the vagaries of the weather and certainly more vulnerable to drought than others.


Last night I also made the point that it is quite possibly true that drought policy beyond the safety net will always face that dilemma—that if you assist those who are continually vulnerable to drought you are somehow disadvantaging those who have invested heavily and have innovated and better protected themselves against drought in the future. Those are not my thoughts; they are the thoughts of many who have made submissions to drought policy consideration over many decades. They asked the question, 'Why is it that Joe next door is getting a taxpayer subsidy when I am not getting the subsidy because I have made the effort to drought-proof my farm business?' And it is hard to see any time in the near future when that dilemma will not still be with us. It is a dilemma we should be grappling with in this place on a bipartisan basis, because we cannot be in any way playing politics with this issue, and we need to find innovative ways to help farmers in times of drought. Of course, we cannot necessarily prepare ourselves adequately for some droughts—like one-in-50-year events. In the past we have placed a greater and growing emphasis on drought-proofing rather than on in-drought events, and that is what initiatives like the farm management deposits scheme are all about—providing tax incentives for farmers to put money away in the good times to be used in the bad times, and I suspect that is where much of the focus will be in the future.


There are some academics and others out there who will say that we should not go beyond the farm household support package—that the welfare payment, if I can call it that, is sufficient. I reject that at the same time as I reject some of the old schemes like interest rate subsidies, which I think more often than not encouraged poor behaviour and did nothing to encourage further drought-proofing within farm enterprises. There will be more to be done, and we must do more. But in this place and in the place over the other side we should be working on a bipartisan basis to make sure that we get the right policy—and good policy, not policy that is a compromise between competing political parties seeking to win the hearts and minds of the farming communities, and of course those people in the broader community who are so supportive of farming families.


I hope she will not mind me saying so, but last night Professor Botterill said that politics does play a role here, and sometimes you just cannot secure the best policy—you have to accept the second-best policy because of the nature in which politics does creep into these public policy issues. I rejected that, because she had also mentioned the need to have evidence based policy, and I said, 'I am far more attracted to evidence based policy than I am to second-best policy'. We should never accept second-best policy, and together in this place we should strive to ensure that we have the very best policy, and one that is fiscally responsible but takes into account the special place farmers have in our economy. They are the people who provide our food security; they are the people who put food on our table. They are the people who export two-thirds of everything they grow and therefore make an enormous contribution to our export earning. But, more particularly than all of that, they are people who are exposed to the vagaries of the weather like no other industry in our broad and very diverse economy.


But it is not just about that. It is about how we have a sustainable farming future, and how this country makes the most of the opportunities presented by the growing demand for food in Asia. We often talk about the Asian food bowl, but it is not a phrase I use. I think it is a misnomer. It implies that somehow Australia will play a substantial role in feeding the growing middle classes of Asia. Of course, that can never be the case. We can never produce the volumes necessary to feed a substantial part of that growing Asian middle class. To provide a mere five per cent of the additional food demand predicted by 2050, Australia would have to double its agricultural output by value.


That is still a lot of food though, which is why I prefer to refer to it as the dining boom. As we move on from the mining boom, we enter the dining boom, because a doubling in our output would still be a boom. A doubling of output would be a welcome achievement in this country, but a tripling of output would be even better, and it is not beyond our capability if we are smart about it. However, a tripling of the output will still not equate to a substantial share of the food demand in Asia. We will still be a small player there, but we would experience a boom here. A tripling in our output would be very nice.


The question then becomes: how do we get there? It is going to be hard. I have acknowledged in here before that I think the member for Hume, in an earlier life, was the key author of a report by ANZ bank and Port Jackson Partners, in which they suggested that to achieve our ambitions out to 2050 we will need something like $500 billion of infrastructure investment in this country. It is axiomatic, and clear to all of us here, that if we are going to get anywhere near that level of investment in this country we will need a great deal of foreign investment. That is why I am so disappointed that the government, so early in its life, has sent all the wrong signals to potential foreign investors by rejecting the ADM takeover of GrainCorp.


The former Labor government was investing heavily in one of the key infrastructure issues in this country, and that is the challenge we face getting our grains to export markets—through our rail lines in particular, and then through our ports. We were investing heavily in some of that rail infrastructure back in New South Wales and Western Australia—the key export state, because Western Australia exports about 90 per cent or more of the grains it grows—and that is something we are not seeing any more under this government.


It is true that fiscal rectitude in government is important. Keeping the budget in balance over the cycle is important. But those opposite, as they sneer, seem to constantly forget that only a few years ago we had the biggest global economic downturn since the great depression. We used that cycle responsibly and appropriately. It is all right putting money away in the cookie jar, but if you are under-investing in your critical infrastructure there is no net gain—there is a balance, and I fear this government does not propose to get that balance right. But, we shall see. I may be proven wrong.




Mr Briggs:
  You will be proven wrong.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Well, I will bet 20 cents I am right. I am not a gambler, so 20 cents will do the job. There is a much bigger issue at hand. The question becomes one of how we can produce twice as much food, or three times as much food, with the same water, land and human resources. How do you do that? Before I attempt to answer that, I will correct what I just asked, and add that it is also a question of how you do it with the same natural resources, when those resources are depleting. There is no doubt that we do face very large challenges in terms of our natural resources, whether it be in relation to salinity, land degradation, or a rapidly changing climate.


This is where it gets very interesting for me, because when I read all of the literature climate change is taken as a given. There does not seem to be any contest out there. There might be arguments about what causes climate change and there might be arguments about what we do about it—whether we should use mitigation or adaptation. But there is no argument that the climate is changing. I told a little story in this place recently about Bruce Tyrrell. I will not repeat it at length, but he pointed out to me that the bees are on his vines much later than usual, and he attributes that to climate change.


So, let us put to one side the debate about whether climate change is induced by human activity, or what we should do to mitigate it. The climate is changing and it is going to continue to change. The science on that is settled, and it is going to be bad news for our agriculture sector. Things are going to get tougher and drier, droughts are going to be more prolonged and will hit us more often. On the other side of the equation we are going to have rain events, and other cyclonic events, that are also going to make life difficult for those who live on our land and produce from it.


This is a serious issue. You cannot run around the country promoting the Asian food bowl concept if you are not serious about action on land resource sustainability. That is why it shocks me that the current government is progressing an agricultural white paper, whose terms of reference make no mention of natural resource sustainability or climate change. They did not have to call it climate change; they could have found another name. I know they do not like admitting that climate change is a problem in this country, but you cannot plan for the countries agricultural future without having a look at the impact of climate change in the future. You cannot plan our output and you cannot even plan infrastructure investment until you know what are the other impacts from changing weather patterns in this country. As I said at the NFF last night—and I know it is not music to the ears of every farmer in this country or every farming representative body—having not been the most enthusiastic supporter of mitigation on this side of the House over my 18 years here, and having not been the most enthusiastic supporter of every initiative taken in the area of climate change, I have always been a signatory to the precautionary principle—that is, if you are in doubt do something about it. Do not wait until it is too late. But that is on the economy more generally.


In this sector it is even more important. It is so clear to me that we will not double output by volume. We will not, certainly, triple output by volume with depleting natural resources—and depleting they are. Again, I have not seen any literature anywhere that contests that idea, and I look forward to hearing members in the other place make a contribution on this bill, because they might like to respond to that and share their thoughts with me.


I am inviting a bipartisan approach to this. Climate change, however you want to interpret it, is a challenge for all of us. I think it is time, like I suggest with the drought policy, we put the weapons down and work out as a parliament how we are going to deal with these challenges. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that those who sit opposite have the same greenhouse gas emissions reduction target as the Labor Party, the official opposition. It seems that we only have an argument about how we get there on the mitigation front—but, again, mitigation will only be one issue. Adaptation is going to be of critical importance. There were so many adaptation programs, broadly speaking, that were attached to the former, Labor government's response to climate change which now no longer have a funding source. I challenge, in the friendliest of ways, those sitting opposite to tell me how we are going to take up those opportunities that increasing global food demand is presenting for our country, without dealing with some of those climate issues and some of those adaptation issues that will be necessary.


Likewise, I challenge those opposite to tell me and to tell the House how we are going to get additional wheat to market without a significant initiative taken on the supply chain to our export markets. People talk about our proximity to Asia, and we certainly do have an advantage in terms of our proximity to Asia. But in transport cost terms it is an advantage that can be very quickly eroded and, indeed, is being eroded by our inability to compete on the supply chain to the port rather than after our goods leave port. These are issues that will have to be tackled, not just by this government but, again, by people who are looking for some bipartisanship on these issues by this parliament more generally. We will not agree all of the time and, I am sure, we will often disagree, but Australia has a wonderful opportunity here and we should be grabbing hold of it and doing something about it. An agricultural white paper without any reference to climate change will not get us there; a lack of references to sustaining natural resources will not get us there; and a lazy, myopic approach to what we need in terms of infrastructure in this country will not get us there either.


We have the worst of both worlds here on that front—the government is not going to spend any money on infrastructure and it is not going to let foreign investors in to spend their money on infrastructure. That is very disappointing from my perspective, and I am sure it is disappointing from the perspective of many who live off the land and supply us and our export markets with food.


I want to go back to where I began, and that is on the specifics of drought policy. This is a very important safety net again borne out of the intergovernmental agreement when the Labor Party was in government. But I note it was supported by those who sit opposite and, of course, supported by all states of the day. It was a big thing to get rid of the old exceptional circumstances policies. So many farmers had come to rely on them for such a long time. They were very popular amongst many farmers, but all the literature said they should go. All the states agreed that they should go. But we should not, and cannot, stop here. The safety net is important, but we need to find new and innovative ways, not so much to respond during drought but to ensure all those who run farm businesses have access to incentives that ensure that they are better prepared for drought. The alternative to that, of course, will be to say, 'If you are on marginal land, just get off.' Again, going back to our ambitions in Asia, we cannot afford for anyone to get off. We need all the farmers we can get. We need to do all the farming that we can do. But we will need investment. We will need more policies on adaptation in addition to mitigation. Of course, we will also need more on research and development. No matter what we do on adaptation—and they are the one and the same, really—and no matter what we do on infrastructure investment, it just will not be possible to very substantially increase output without more innovation.


Australia farmers and the RDCs and others who support them—our universities and our learning institutions—have been at world's best in these initiatives. But we will have to do much better. We have kept our productivity up in the past and we have increased output in the past through both the use of new fertilisers and the use of additional land, but that is plateauing and we need a new phase, a new round, of innovation. There will not be more land; there might be less land. We will rely very, very heavily on innovation. I welcome the government's commitment on that front to its pre-election promise for an additional $100 million in research and development. I understand that promise will be kept. I will be disappointed and the farming community will be disappointed if it is not, but I am confident it will be. I understand it is to be split amongst the RDCs; so, instead of a dollar-for-dollar basis, the government might pay $1.05 or $1.10 to the RDCs. That is a good thing. Dare I say, at the risk of making a commitment in addition to that—I am certainly not doing that this stage of the political cycle—we will, sadly, need more to produce the sort of innovation we will need to make the most of those opportunities.


Of course, along the way we will have a debate about genetically modified crops. It is a debate we have to have because, I suspect, we will not realise our ambitions without proper management and taking up of opportunities GM crops present for many reasons, whether it be crop protection, our capacity to lift our output et cetera.


Finally, on that point, the dining boom will come best for us if we do not just chase volumes but, more importantly, chase value. Our limited resources will need to be concentrated on those commodities and agricultural interests which produce the greatest possible return for our country. Our farmers do not need that lecture from me; they know that, as do their peak bodies. In working together in this place I believe that, while not building a capacity to substantially feed Asia, we can position ourselves as a country which produces a lot more food than we do now and which sees a much greater return on our produce than we do now.


But we will have to be very smart about it. We are going to have to be more open to foreign investment. We are going to have to be more willing to invest in infrastructure. We are going to have to be more willing to invest in R&D. And of course we are going to have to be more willing to ensure that those who are on marginal land—those people we want to stay in the sector—have the protection they need when severe drought comes, and that in my view means making sure the appropriate incentives are in place that give them the opportunity to do what so many in the industry are doing: preparing themselves as best they can for future drought events. The opposition supports this bill.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:40):  I stand in this place today as the daughter of a farmer and in strong support of the Farm Household Support Bill 2014. I understand the trials and tribulations that go with depending on the land for your living. In fact, I remember when growing up they introduced a board game called Squatter, and my father could never bring himself to play it, because he said it was too realistic. Every round of the board you were faced with a drought, a famine, a fire and a flood; and, if you survived that, usually your stud ram died in the last few squares of the game.


As the drought takes hold, farmers have to watch as their cattle slowly starve and their crops turn to dust. You cannot do anything to help them; there is no water to make the grass grow, and buying food for cattle becomes increasingly expensive. There are many who speak up about the isolated incidents of animal cruelty that happen overseas, yet I question where their voices are now when hundreds of thousands of animals are dying slow, painful deaths in our own country.


Assistance to farmers in times of need is a serious matter. I am proud today to stand on this side of the chamber bringing in legislation that will establish the farm household allowance and give some small hope and assistance to Australia farmers. It is the determination of this government to stand by these Australians in the hard times. We cannot work miracles—there are no magic wands—but we do what we need to offer some small support. This new package will assist drought affected farm businesses and farm families in dealing with the immediate financial pressures and improve their capacity to recover when the current drought breaks. The coalition government is introducing measures that will assist farmers and their families with managing during drought and being in a stronger financial and emotional position to effectively recover when the drought ends.


This package includes measures that offer financial, social and mental health support to our farming communities. The drought assistance package will provide $280 million to hundreds of farmers to access five-year concessional loans at a rate of four per cent up to the value of $1 million. It enables farmers to access a fortnightly farm household allowance which is equivalent to the Newstart allowance even if they have total net farm assets of up to $2.5 million on paper. This package will also provide additional money to the Queensland and New South Wales state governments for water related infrastructure rebates as well as $10 million to help reduce the impacts of wild pigs and other pest animals. Another $10.7 million will be provided to help with the delivery of social support services, including access to mental health support in drought affected areas.


As the Prime Minister has stated, the measures in this bill are largely building on existing programs, but the coalition government is making them more responsive to the particular needs of farmers who are hit by drought. The interim farm household allowance will replace the current transitional farm family payment, and payments to new applicants under the interim farm household allowance started back on 3 March 2014. The coalition recognises that most farmers cannot easily access other forms of assistance compared to others in financial hardship. Having a farmer-specific income support payment ensures that these farmers in hardship can access support when they need it most to put food on the table and pay the bills. The new payment provides a more generous asset test than the previous transitional farm family payment, ensuring more families and farmers can receive support in difficult times. Under the new payment farmers will automatically receive a Health Care Card, and these changes are an interim measure until the farm household allowance commences on 1 July 2014. Funding for this measure is uncapped, meaning it will be available to anyone meeting the eligibility criteria.


We often hear in the media about drought affecting farmers, but rarely do we understand what it actually means. The most immediate consequence of drought is a fall in crop production, due to inadequate and poorly distributed rainfall, and the subsequent loss of income. Farmers are then faced with harvests that are too small to both feed their families and fulfil their other commitments. Livestock sales act as a buffer in times of hardship, with farmers divesting of these assets to buy food. The first animals to be sold are usually those which make the least contribution to farm production, such as sheep and goats. However, as the period of drought-induced flood deficit lengthens farmers will have to start selling transport and draft animals as well as breeding stock, which constitutes the basis of the household's wealth.


Farming is a very significant part of our economy and will continue to play a crucial role in our economic future, which is why the coalition government is offering this $324 million dollar drought lifeline to our struggling farmers. The future of farming is vital to the future of Australia. I am proud to support these measures and I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (12:45):  Very few times in this House do we see a level of bipartisanship, but this is one issue—standing by people in drought and making sure that they know that the Australian government is listening to them and they are being heard—where this is the case. I thank the member for Hunter for his kind words and also, before me, the member for Ryan for her kind words.


As a farmer myself, one of the things that I used to wonder about was whether anyone in this green chamber in this place called Canberra had an appreciation of what it was to live through a drought. I want to reflect for a little bit as we talk about this issue today about just what it is like. My journey has involved farming through many of the millennium drought years. You think you can make the right choices, and you think you can make wise choices. I know what it is like to have a $90,000 interest bill and to have a wife who is earning $40,000, and because she was earning $40,000 it precluded us from being eligible for drought assistance.


It is pleasing that in this package we have learnt something: we have learnt that you can actually have $80,000 of off-farm income and still receive access to some drought assistance. That is a welcome initiative. It needs to be stated that there are a lot of hardworking partners of farmers who are really battling to put food on the table, and we are really pleased to see that in this initiative they are not precluding themselves from being eligible for farm support.


In a drought, there are times that you always remember. One of those times for us was toward what we thought was going to be the end of a drought. We made a decision that we were going to buy some young stock. It is important at the end of a drought that the stock you have is young because you want to have the best recovery phase. We did; we bought this stock from Tasmania and we brought them over—two days to bring them over on the ship. We had mortgaged ourselves more to afford this. We put the stock on some water—they were quite thirsty; it was hot and it was dry. I went back to my house that night.


That night the stock agent rang up and said, 'I hope that stock arrived safely?' I said, 'Yes, they did'. He said, 'Now you didn't put them on water did you?' And I said, 'Well, they were thirsty, of course I did'. He said, 'No, you know that is the last thing you should do!' As I now know, when they have an empty belly and you put them on some water, they drink the water, they blow up and they die. So here were we at the end of a drought, taking a financial risk only to find out that we may have just blown another $40,000 on stock.


We drove down there that night and there was one dead sheep there and another dead sheep over there. I have to tell you, if you want to see pressure on mental health for a young farmer with a big mortgage who has just taken a risk and it has blown up in his face, that was one of them. I called up my father to bring over some bales of hay. I called my wife on the UHF to come down and they tried to move those stock around the paddock in order to get them to pass that water by moving. We tried our best and, as irony would have it, a dust storm—I know is sounds like the movies, but it is very real in my mind—rolled in. My wife was at one end of the paddock and I could not physically see her. I had dead sheep. We were trying to move sheep, and we were trying to do the right thing. If you want to see something that brings a person to breaking point, that is drought.


What I want to say to the green chamber is that we have people in this place now who have lived it, and in living it you understand it. We have to have that experience right across the Australian spectrum. We must stand by people through drought. It is easy to have the philosophical argument about whether they are on unviable land? Should we be farming there anyway? Is this corporate welfare? Now is not the time for that argument. The time for that discussion is when we are not in drought, when we can sit back with emotion out of the way and discuss how we create a drought-preparedness model. Something that the Australian parliament, in my opinion, has not done effectively yet, and which is the challenge for us. But the times when people are looking at dry dams, trying to make tough decisions about their own future and looking at their children, knowing that they want to pass on that farm to them—knowing that their father or their mother has worked hard to pass it on—those are the times when we should say, 'We stand by you, we believe in what you do, we recognise your contribution to the Australian economy and we are prepared to release some community funds—some tax payer funds—to ensure you have a viable future.'


This drought package is really about that. We have concessional loans; this is not a gift, this is a loan. It is to buy you time to restructure your business; to buy you time, because we know that this is the land of droughts and flooding rains. As sure as it is dry, it will be wet again. Whenever it is wet, it will be dry again. This is to buy them time for when the good times return—and they will return. They did for me, they will for you.


The one thing that is important when you are talking to people who are in drought is to remind them that it will rain again, you will make money again and there is a future for the Australian agricultural industry. Never, never rob people of hope. When people are going through crisis, the one thing they hold onto is hope. You never rob them of that. This is why we can have the discussion about climate change, but the discussion about drought is recognition of seasonal viability. There is a long-term future for you involved in agriculture; there is a long-term future for the northern cattle industry that is getting hit very hard at the moment. This government understands that there is a long-term future, and we will stand by you.


One of the great things in this package is a recognition of mental health. In a previous life I was president of the Victorian Farmers Federation. I used to say to blokes, 'When was the last time you changed the oil in your tractor?' And they would be able to say, 'Well, actually, it has been three months; it has done 470 hours, it is a 500 hours oil change—it is time to do that'. I then used to ask them when their wedding anniversary was, and they usually did not know that. I also used to ask them when the last time was they went and had a health check-up. Farmers are notorious for not getting health check-ups.


Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. I say to the farmers who are doing it tough: 'Please get up early one morning. Get the jobs done you have to do then go see a doctor. Get your physical health and your mental health checked. You are the most important asset on your farm. You need to look after yourself. The best thing you can do for your family is look after your health. Be a little selfish for a change and look after your mental health.'


When I was talking to farmers in those very lean years I would find that the wives would be carrying the burden. The farmer would be full of bravado but the wife would realise that her husband was under pressure. I do not care what they say; they are under more pressure than they think. It is pleasing to see that we have recognised that as a community now. There is no stigma attached to saying you are under pressure and seeking some help. The $10.7 million in this support package for mental health is a very good thing.


Another great thing I see in this package is some water infrastructure. One of the great revolutions of agriculture that no-one talks about is the poly pipe. Being able to take water to stock enables you to drive productivity through different stocking ratios. It is pleasing that in this package there is continued infrastructure investment in water and some small, on-farm packages to help farmers put poly pipes and tanks in.


Whilst I talked about the young stock on my own farm that I try to get at the end of the drought, I have always had a passion in agriculture to ensure that we have young farmers at the end of the drought because young famers drive the greatest productivity. Those under 35 are the best productivity drivers for the country. They are the people we do not want to lose. They usually are the ones who are most in debt. They have taken the financial risk. They have gone out and have grown and endeavoured. They are the ones who lease additional pieces of ground and try something new. We have to make sure we look after them. I hope in this drought package we hit the mark to make sure that young farmers stay there because it is not just for their benefit; this is actually for the country's benefit.


Before the member for Hunter left the chamber he pointed out the dining boom. There are great opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region for the agricultural industry, particularly in mechanised starch products and protein products. When I was in China a number of years ago I talked to a guy who was 30th in charge of China. When you have 1.3 billion people, that is fairly high on the pecking order—Mr Deputy Speaker, even higher than you, relative to the population. I had a discussion with him about the merits of democracy—and I am digressing here—and he told me that if they had democracy they might do what is popular instead of what is right. Maybe he did win the argument in that instance.


In the discussions he made it clear to me that the current consumption of dairy products was 56 grams per child per day. It was the Chinese government's ambition to increase that to 500 grams of dairy product per child per day. In this chamber here people generally have good health. We probably do not have a full appreciation of just what protein in the diet does for the health of children and people. I want to hark back to a little bit of history here. When the Massachusetts colony settled in America, the people who left Britain and first settled in America, within three generations, because they had access to red meat and dairy products, their life expectancy jumped by 20 years. The Chinese know this. They want to give their children protein. We are actually well placed for that. One-third of the world's export milk comes out of Victoria and New Zealand. We are well placed to really hit the Asia-Pacific region and for a change we actually have a freight advantage over our competitors because of our proximity to the markets.


What I want to drive home is that when we go through a drought we must make sure out the other side we have young farmers, who will drive productivity. That productivity is going to drive our export markets. Even in my small, humble electorate we produce $5.3 billion worth of exports every year. If you multiply that right across Australia, the contribution of the agricultural sector is significant. It is also significant for the secondary workforce in marketing, transport, refining and research and development. We have a good industry to be proud of. I think the $320 million drought package is simply an investment in our future. It is saying to the people in drought: 'We stand by you. We understand what it is like to go through drought. We value you. Your contribution is needed as we continue to grow this great economy.'

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (12:58):  It is a real privilege to speak today on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. We have heard from a lot of members of parliament today who represent rural electorates—and of course they have a special interest in this legislation. But I think it is really important that members of parliament who represent in this place big parts of our cities—and I represent an electorate in Melbourne—come forward and say how supportive we are on behalf of our constituents of putting in place this necessary and important support for farmers who are genuinely struggling in a once-in-a-generation drought in this country.


I want to echo the very good words I heard earlier from our shadow spokesperson on agriculture, Joel Fitzgibbon. He indicated that this is an area where we see strong potential for bipartisanship. Labor has done a lot of good work in the area of drought policy, which I will talk a little bit about. Importantly, today Labor is standing here in partnership with those on the other side to say it is important that we support our farmers, and that is what this legislation is trying to do.


I want to talk to some of the specifics of the legislation. This legislation provides a mechanism to implement the farm household allowance. That is up to three years of income support payments or ancillary benefits for farmers and their partners who can demonstrate financial hardship. The FHA is to commence on 1 July 2014. It is set to replace the exceptional circumstances relief payment, which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, was available only to regions declared to be in extreme drought. Importantly, the bill acknowledges that the government has implemented the interim farm household allowance and allows for the transfer of existing support scheme recipients. It makes some other changes to various pieces of legislation that essentially bring those things together. 


I will speak in a little more detail on the specifics of this legislation, but I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about why this issue is so important for Labor. It speaks to our genuine commitment to supporting Australia's farmers and farming communities, especially in an hour of need such as we have before us today. The member for Hunter talked about the high regard in which farmers are held in the broader community. Speaking from the city perspective, I can echo that. What I hear from many constituents talking to me about economic changes in Australia is that they want to live in a country that continues to make things. That speaks to some of the importance of our manufacturing industry, but it also talks about primary industries and agriculture. People talk to me about a feeling that comes through of the honesty and integrity of actual production. 


We have a very proud history of agriculture in our country. When we look back on our history, we see that this is the foundation stone of Australia's economy. It was where we started to see this exciting spirit of innovation that we have carried right through our economic history in Australia. You can look back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the development of the stump-jump plough, the combine harvester and irrigation. These are all things that have spread and reformed agriculture all over the world. They are things that happened right here in Australia. When people like the member for Chifley and I put our heads together and think about Australia's economic future, what we try to think about is how we can harness that incredible spirit of innovation and bring that to newer sectors on which we will rely more on the future. Innovation has been the watchword. 


We have seen an incredible transformation happen to agriculture in this country. Today, farms that would have required hundreds of employees can be run with just a handful of employees. That is great for efficiency, although it does create issues in some of those farming communities. We are well aware of those. The critical point to acknowledge today is that Australia's agricultural industry is one of the most efficient in the entire world, one of the least protected agricultural communities in the entire world. It is really important that Australians understand that this sector has worked through a very difficult transition over the last 20 or 30 years to get to this point. When I talk to the Victorian Farmers Federation and the National Farmers' Federation about reforms like the one that is before us today, what I hear is them saying, 'We have done the hard yards'. They have done the hard yards. The farmers of this country have made some incredibly tough decisions. They have come out the other end with an agriculture sector that we can be incredibly proud of here in our country. 


I think there is a consensus that, having done those hard yards, when something really catastrophic happens, particularly like what we see happening in Queensland, city people are happy to support their country cousins with a safety net. The legislation that we are talking about today is putting that into place. When we think about the economic future of our country, it really has yet to seep into the mindset of Australians that agriculture is not an industry of yesterday for us; it is actually an industry of the future. The member for Hunter talked about what he likes to call the 'dining boom'. We know that demand for food in our world is going to double over the next 15 or so years. We cannot double the amount of agricultural land; it is going to mean more efficiency and more productivity on existing agricultural land. Our Australian farmers can really benefit from this. As I said, we have a long history of innovation. We are poised to take this big opportunity in hand. 


But what we will need to do is see farmers through some difficult times such as what we are seeing right now, hence the importance of this legislation. We can be part of this very exciting boom that many in this chamber talk about frequently. But we do need to support our farmers to get there, hence this legislation and, of course, Labor's support for it. 


I wish to speak a little bit more about the context. I do not know if any the listeners at home or people in the chamber have taken the time to look at the map of Queensland and see the drought affected areas, but it is genuinely terrifying to see, because almost the whole of Queensland has been declared a drought zone. I think what we are seeing now in Queensland is the largest portion of land ever to be declared drought affected. There is just a little thin strip across the eastern coast of Queensland which is declared not drought affected. Scores of shires have been added to the list of drought affected areas of Queensland. I think this is a very specific incident and definitely justifies the legislation before us. 


Let me go back to some specifics of the legislation I wanted to touch on. One of the reasons Labor is so supportive of this is that the bill delivers on what was Labor's commitment under the Intergovernmental Agreement on National Drought Program Reform. This was to provide a new nationally agreed approach to drought programs this included time-limited income support payment for farmers and their partners, based on individual need. We are very happy to see that come into the legislation. If we were to quibble at the margins on this one, there is a question here about the timing of the legislation. We have known about drought conditions in parts of Australia for some months now. There is a little disappointment that it took so long to get to this point when it was obvious some months ago what was needed. We would have liked to have seen this bill be introduced much sooner to enable more timely assistance to struggling farm families who really have been in limbo for quite some time. 


A second point I would make on this one is that it is focused on the short term. What Labor wants to see is a real, genuine conversation about long-term drought preparations between this parliament and the farming community in Australia and the bodies that represent them. One of the things that has been disappointing is to see that in December 2013, the Abbott government decided to abolish the key COAG vehicle, the Standing Committee on Primary Industries. That body was established just to consider this question of long-term drought management. It is something that both sides of the House should be keen to work on. Last year, the Commonwealth government and the states agreed through that committee to transition away from the exceptional circumstances program and towards a policy that promoted greater drought planning and preparedness. Unfortunately, despite some rhetoric about interest in long-term drought reform from the other side of the House, we have seen a government that has run for six months now with no real progress on that front. I know the National Farmers' Federation are talking about things we can do to help our farmers in the longer term and we are very committed on this side to see that work progress. So we will continue to hold the government to account and to speak to the other side about how we can progress long-term drought policy.


I might close with a bit more of a sense of the personal on this one. I am very fortunate to have married into a family of dairy farmers in northern Victoria. They are a part of a wonderful dairy community in our little town called Gunbower. Having a city background and then being exposed to this set of small communities in northern Victoria, I know it is really hard to understand, unless you experience it day to day, how tough things can be for farmers in a period of drought.  What a lot of Australians who live in our cities do not realise is that, when a community falls on tough times, it affects not just farming families; everyone is affected. All small businesses are affected and everyone just goes into a deep struggle. 


Something else we probably do not realise, aside from the widespread effect of things like serious drought, is just how tough things really get for our farmers. Being a part of this big farming family, I know people genuinely struggle to put food on the table. That is not hyperbole; it is real. I know that the people of Hotham do not want to live in a country where we have significant portions of our population who are working doing backbreaking labour day in, day out and still cannot feed their families. I see this package of legislation as my community standing beside fellow Australians, both in good times and in bad. I am very pleased to join the voices in the parliament who are supporting this package.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (13:09):  May I at the outset commend the member for Hotham for her generous and heartfelt words and for her support for this very important legislation, the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. I might add that her predecessor, Simon Crean, was also very interested in regional Australia. I had a lot of time for Simon Crean, as the member for Hotham, for the role he played in regional Australia. I hope that his successor follows in his footsteps by also playing a good productive role in regional Australia. We certainly welcome the points the member for Hotham just made. 


However, I must take issue with some of the things said by her colleague Mr Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter and shadow agriculture minister. He downplayed the ability of Australian farmers to support the Asian century by being a food bowl for the Pacific rim, supplying the growing and burgeoning markets in Asia. By 2050, the world's population will reach nine billion, if not more. Certainly Joel Fitzgibbon mentioned that, but he said he thought that the Asian food bowl was a misnomer. He thought that we would not be able to produce the volume and, in his words, 'double the output' to support the growing protein need of the Asian middle class, but we would if we had the right policy settings. 


The coalition are doing everything we can to provide those policy settings. We went to the last election with a plan to develop a strong five-pillar economy of which agriculture was very much one of the most prominent parts. In the last parliament, the 43rd Parliament, we saw an attack on agriculture, an attack on our farmers by the Labor government. We saw the live cattle export fiasco and the slowness to react to the Asian bee incursion, but the very worst was what Labor did, in cahoots with the Greens, with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. 


I probably spoke on water more than anyone else in the last parliament. Perhaps I harped on it but it is important. As Samuel McCaughey, the founder of Australian irrigation, certainly the founder of Riverina irrigation, stated, 'Water is a more important and valuable resource than gold.' He recognised the need for water and he pioneered the irrigation channels which now flow throughout the Riverina providing wonderful fresh food and fibre for the growing Asian market and feeding and clothing our own nation. Sir Samuel McCaughey's words should never be forgotten, certainly not in this place where we set policy hopefully to help our farmers and our irrigators. That is what these bills seek to do. 


At an international food summit speech, former Prime Minister Julia Gillard raised the question: could Australia become the new food bowl of Asia? She certainly thought the answer was yes. She revealed to the crowd her vision for the country to become a global superpower, to meet the needs of a rapidly emerging Asian population. It would involve building our food processing industries so that they can supply Asia's growing consumer markets and developing research technologies and logistics to strengthen irrigation. I repeat: the former Prime Minister said strengthen irrigation, grow higher yielding crops and improve food safety. Her remarks angered leaders in the agriculture and the food-processing sectors who argued that the federal government's policies did not align with that idea—and they were certainly right. 


Victorian Farmers Federation President Peter Tuohey said that the looming carbon tax and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority were expected to have disastrous effects on agricultural people—growers and farmers in Australia—and he was certainly right. He said that the current MDBA plan will remove 30 per cent to 35 per cent of water from irrigators who produce more than 40 per cent of Australia's food. We know that the carbon tax continues to be a huge impost on our farmers, on the people who grow the food to feed our nation. It certainly rings true today. Julia Gillard was right and her own party should have put in the policy settings to enable what she then perceived to become a reality. 


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was a disaster. Fortunately, New South Wales has just come on board. They held out for a better deal, wisely so, so that they could get the sorts of policy settings from a government that actually cares about irrigation farmers—that is, the coalition—to make sure that New South Wales got the very best deal. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Simon Birmingham, whose portfolio area includes water, came out and allocated an additional 10 gigalitres of environmental flows to the Gwydir Valley for productive use. If there had been bipartisan support—as there is with the Farm Household Support Bill—for irrigation, as Labor claims there now is, why did Senator Birmingham's idea get attacked in January when he allocated that additional 10 gigalitres of water? It is because Labor says one thing but then does another. 


I am very pleased to support this bill today. The Farm Household Support Bill 2014, in conjunction with the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014, serves to repeal the existing Farm Support Act 1992. It provides a farm household allowance and transitional farm support payments—the interim FHA—from 3 March 2014 to farming families in need, and there are many of them. The government recognises that the Farm Support Act 1992, which this bill repeals, has been an important mechanism by which successive governments have delivered much-needed assistance to Australian farming families for more than two decades. However, we equally acknowledge that we need to reform the way assistance is delivered to the farming sector if we want farmers to have a viable future. That is what this bill does and that is what Australia needs.


Governments of all persuasions have historically valued Australia's agricultural sector highly. We accept that the assistance that we give to our farmers is a special type of assistance and is given in recognition of the very unique circumstances in which they live and work. As the famous slogan goes, every family needs a farmer. It is true. Every family, every community and every nation needs a farmer. The agricultural sector delivers significant economic benefits to communities in many parts—I would say all parts—of our country and indeed to the country as a whole. As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, Australian agricultural exports reached $38 billion last year. That equated to 13.8 per cent of all Australian exports. The gross value add of agricultural production was some $47 billion. In my electorate of Riverina the gross value of agricultural production came to $1.8 billion in 2010, which equated to 16 per cent of the New South Wales total. It is no wonder that people call the Riverina the food bowl of the state. I would say that it is the best food bowl of Australia. Agriculture is our single largest industry, providing 7,900 jobs or 12 per cent of the total employment, which is the highest of all sectors. There are 4.4 million hectares of productive farming in the Riverina region—2.5 million hectares of grazing land, a further 1.5 used for cropping and the rest either in forestry or set aside for conservation. The Riverina has a diverse variety of agricultural products from wheat to beef, rice, barley, dairy and cotton. The Riverina produces the largest output of potatoes, almonds, oranges and apples of any region in New South Wales. We are also the largest producer of wine grapes and wine in New South Wales. Agriculture is therefore a strategically vital industry not just for the state and for the nation but also for my own electorate. I know that the member for Parkes, who is sitting in the chamber, would certainly agree with the role that the Riverina plays. I know the role that his electorate also plays—it is the biggest electorate in the state and certainly a key player in the agricultural sector. Agriculture is a critical industry in the Riverina and I am committed to supporting it. I know that the member for Parkes is also an avid supporter of everything agriculture based, in both good times and bad.


While we are fortunate that the drought has not yet had the impact in the Riverina that it certainly has had in Mark Coulton's electorate, there are certainly areas within my electorate that are beginning to feel the effects of drought. Places in the north-west of my electorate—in the Bland Shire, in the Carrathool Shire and in places such as West Wyalong, Ungarie and Rankins Springs—are experiencing drought-like conditions. It is very dry. I am proud to be able to support measures such as this which will directly benefit those in my electorate who need assistance now and may well need it into the future. As the Prime Minister highlighted recently on his national drought tour, Australia is currently in the midst of a severe and prolonged drought—a once-in-a-century drought for some areas. Last year alone, more than 150 temperature records were broken across the country. It was the hottest year on record according to the Bureau of Meteorology's recent report, State of the climate 2014. Projections from both the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the weather bureau suggest we will continue to experience higher temperatures into the future. It would be prudent, given those projections, that we prepare ourselves for a future where we are at higher risk of drought. To that end, I would say we need to be prepared for this—we need to build more dams. I said it in my inaugural speech, I will say it again and I will say it in my valedictory speech—hopefully by then we will have built a few more dams—we certainly need more water storage. 


The income support this bill will introduce is part of a comprehensive package of drought assistance measures the Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture announced on 28 February. This bill, and indeed the entire drought assistance package, is the result of significant work by this government to deliver a credible and sustainable support mechanism for farming households and farm businesses facing the impacts of drought. The government's full suite of policies is appropriately and unashamedly focused on building community resilience and drought preparedness as we move away from the sometimes ad-hoc and crisis-response nature of successive drought policies in years gone by, particularly over the past six years.


The Farm Household Support Bill 2014 provides for up to three years of income support to farmers and their partners affected by drought anywhere in Australia subject to eligibility criteria. Importantly, the income support provided for in this bill is not contingent on a climatic trigger, such as an Exceptional Circumstances drought declaration, which is required to access an Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment under the existing act. To be eligible for the FHA, applicants must meet a revised means test which provides for a higher asset threshold than normal, taking into account the value of property and other capital which farm businesses hold but which is not sufficiently illiquid or productive due to the drought. This brings the FHA in line with other forms of social security assistance so that we are supporting individuals and families who are facing similar hardships in earning an income. 


Subject to eligibility criteria, and in line with other social security payments, receipt of the FHA confers a range of further ancillary benefits to recipient families including a health care card, a telephone allowance, a remote area allowance, a clean energy supplement—the carbon tax compo—and rent assistance. Receipt of FHA will in some instances also qualify young people, most importantly, to meet the parental means test for youth allowance, which is vital for many of our regional youth who are forced to relocate to pursue higher education and vocational training opportunities. This is a sector of people who were forgotten under Labor. Importantly, it is now a requirement that people undertake a financial improvement agreement and have a farm finance assessment carried out in order to qualify for the FHA. Neither of these processes is intended to be one size fits all, and both are equally important in assisting recipients to determine their own futures. 


Implicit in this policy is an acknowledgment that not all farm households will stay involved in farming either during or following periods of drought—that is a reality—but the best thing government can do is to support these households to make the best decision for them in their circumstances. There is provision for a $3,000 payment, known as an activity supplement, to assist people to retrain, seek advice or engage in another approved activity consistent with their financial improvement agreement. Under this approach, there are still obligations placed on allowance recipients. However, more significantly, as a government we want to support recipients in meaningful and practical ways as they transition through this period of uncertainty in their lives.


While the FHA will be demand driven, the cost of this income support measure is expected to be in the order of $99.4 million over three years in both administered and program expenses. Certainly, the farm household allowance is an important component of the government's drought assistance package, but every part of the government's additional $320 million commitment is necessary in assisting communities through periods of drought. Income support alone, no matter how well designed, is not enough to get our communities through the drought. That is why the other measures are so important. These include the $280 million in concessional loans, $12 million for water infrastructure, $10 million for pest management and $10.7 million for social and mental health services. As the member for Mallee pointed out, social and mental health services are so crucial. 


I digress for a moment to point out that this Saturday at the Coolamon Sport and Recreation Club there is a family fun day for those people who are suffering the effects of mental pressure. Its purpose is to ease the burden on those people through getting together and talking about all things rural related and having a good time. I certainly would recommend anybody in the vicinity of Coolamon to attend and avail themselves of the opportunities there. In conclusion, I support this bill.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (13:24):  I rise today to speak on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. This bill is very close to my heart and it is very important to the people I represent. Indeed, the Parkes electorate has been the epicentre of this current drought. In particular, the three shires along the Queensland border—Bourke, Brewarrina and Walgett—and the western end of the Moree Shire and the northern end of the Coonamble Shire have been dry for a very long time. To put it into context, in a normal season the Walgett Shire produces a million tonnes of wheat. Last year, they produced none. The sad reality is that this drought is not over. Indeed, with no subsoil moisture and the window for planting winter crops only a matter of months away, circumstances look incredibly dire for the next 12 months.


I acknowledge the Prime Minister's support for this bill. I also acknowledge the very good work by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce. While this drought affects a large area, in the overall scheme of things it does not affect a large number of people. However, through the work of Barnaby Joyce, this drought became known right across the nation. I acknowledge the work that he did in bringing the plight of the people I represent onto the national stage. The Prime Minister visited Bourke, stood in a paddock completely denuded of grass and recognised that we were actually witnessing a natural disaster, and I believe that was very beneficial. The fact that he ended up getting 70 millimetres of rain on top of him before he left was an added benefit. While that was a wonderful start for the area around Bourke, I was out there last week and it is still very dry elsewhere—particularly in the Walgett-Collarenebri area, but right across into the slopes back towards Moree and Warialda. So we are in the middle of a very dry time and we have not seen the end of it yet. 


This package has several components. Indeed, the interim farm household allowance will give people who are in very desperate circumstances access to funds to pay immediate household bills and put food on the table. So, regardless of whatever else they are battling in their daily lives, they will know that they have money to feed their families and pay essential bills. I also acknowledge that some of the guidelines for receiving that support have been changed in this bill. I very much welcome that. This will allow more people to access these funds, as some of the people who were excluded under the previous system will now be included.


Another component of the package is the concessional loans, with $280 million available to people at a reduced interest rate. That will give farmers access to funds to continue buying fodder for their stock and to pay immediate farm bills. This is not going to cure the ills of the drought and it is certainly not going to completely take the pressure off farmers. As they look forward, with mounting debts and no end in sight, it is, and will remain, a very stressful time. These concessional loans will act as a circuit breaker, allowing farmers to access some funds and maybe offset some of the long-term debt they have with the banks. These concessional loans may allow them to get some interest relief and free up a bit of cash for farm expenditure.


The water related infrastructure fund is also a very crucial part of that. I am rapidly coming to the end of my time to speak now but, hopefully, when I am able to conclude this presentation I will be able to expand on the need for the water infrastructure fund and the fact that water is—

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:30):  I recently took part in the annual Rickshaw Run, which escorts epicureans through the streets, markets and restaurants of fantastic Footscray in my electorate. The Rickshaw Run is part of the Eat.Drink.Westside program in the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival and gives participants a taste of the flavours of Vietnam in Melbourne's west. The event showcases Footscray as the diverse cultural and culinary mecca which it is today thanks in large part to the many migrants who have made it their home.


The word 'rickshaw' is a transliteration of a Japanese word meaning human powered vehicle. In this way, there was symbolic value to an event where volunteers literally pulled their weight in support of a local community. Special thanks go to those rickshaw pullers from the Footscray Rugby Union Club who pulled even more than their already substantial weight and showed their community spirit by staffing a whole session of the rickshaw pulling. They certainly made pulling a rickshaw look easier than I made it seem to observers!


With the event selling out yet again, the Rickshaw Run showcased fantastic Footscray to hundreds of eager diners from across Melbourne. Thanks must go to the dozens of rickshaw managers, team leaders, marshals, pullers, meeters and greeters—including the effusive Kenny Weir of the Consider The Sauce food blog—musicians, traffic managers and photographers who participated on the day. Thanks also to the Footscray Traders Association and the local traders who plated up a selection of Footscray's finest flavours.


Finally, I extend my deepest appreciation to the event coordinator, Lauren Wambach, the proprietor of the excellent Footscray Food Blog. Lauren is committed to Melbourne's western suburbs and has for some years now run a food blog celebrating the food culture of Footscray. I commend everyone involved in this event.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (13:45):  On Sunday, along with my wife Carolyn, I had the pleasure of joining the parishioners of St Thomas' Anglican Church for their 125th anniversary celebration in North Ipswich. The church was consecrated in 1889 and its first priest was the Reverend John Wheatley. Its mission statement is 'To proclaim the good news of God's reign'. The erection of the church building began in 1887. It was designed by John H. Buckeridge, an English-born Australian architect who built about 60 churches in Queensland. The church was constructed of wood, with an iron roof and timber ceiling, and is located opposite Ipswich North State School. In April 1891 tenders were called to build a new school building for the Sunday school. This building still stands, and it is called 'the big hall'. It was built at a cost of 300 pounds and was completed in nine weeks.


During the early years fundraising activities—from quarterly socials to fancy fairs—were very much a part of the life of the church. In fact, more than 5,000 tickets, at the cost of a shilling each, were sold in an art union draw. In 1969 maintenance of the church building was becoming more difficult because of finances, so cladding with red brick took place on the north, south, east and west walls. A mature persons' fellowship group was started in 1984, and they celebrated their 30th anniversary this year.


The Archbishop of Brisbane, the Most Reverend Phillip Aspinall, officiated at the service on Sunday. The current priest—Father Bill Redman, who has been with the church for 15 years—also assisted. This church has a rich history of service to the Ipswich community, and I congratulate the Anglican community of Ipswich. (Time expired)

I wish to inform House that so far the Royal Australian Air Force has conducted two sweeps over the southern search corridor. Another sweep is scheduled to take place later today. Shortly, there will be four Royal Australian Air Force Orion maritime surveillance aircraft active in this search area. A New Zealand Orion and a United States Poseidon aircraft are repositioning to the search and should be available shortly.

In an answer earlier today I said that the Leader of the Opposition must have been out to lunch when the coalition said that we would scrap the income support bonus. I did the Leader of the Opposition a disservice. I am sorry about that. I really did do him a disservice, because the Labor Party knew all about our policy to scrap the income support bonus, because they were trying to scare people about it before the election. I am quoting from this document from Australian Labor:


Labor is assisting families and pensioners through measures such as the SchoolKids Bonus, the Income Support Bonus … These are all measures that Tony Abbott … will cut should he be elected.

"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (15:14):  It is with great disappointment that I rise today to outline to the House the gross failure of this government to properly invest in Australian skills, training and education and to outline the impact that that is already having on jobs across our nation.


I ask: what does it say about a government, when presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make every school a great school, that they simply turn away? What does it say when instead of stopping state education cuts, which are slashing the quality of education across Australia, and reforming our schools, the government choose to instead to turn a blind eye? And what does it say, when they are looking at rising youth unemployment, that this government decide that all they can do is cut the job programs that do exist for young Australians? Faced with mass job losses and economic changes, they do absolutely nothing to upskill displaced workers. Faced with declining international rankings, they have a minister who is more interested in schoolyard politics than he is in improving our schools. They have the opportunity to make sure that no child is left behind, yet they choose to revert to a broken funding system and a lottery of orders. They are prepared to leave every student and every school worse off. They say one thing and then they do another.


I will tell you exactly what all of those facts say about this government: those facts say that this government is out of touch. It does not understand what is important to Australians—a good job and a secure future. It says that it is lazy, it is too busy with petty politics to follow through on its promise to deliver once-in-a-generation reforms to every Australian school. It says that this is a small-minded government, a government that wants to drag our nation back instead of building the prosperous future that all Australians deserve. It says that it is heartless, that it will rip away the opportunity that education and skills training can deliver to every Australian—particularly to those Australians who might otherwise fall between the cracks.


But most significantly it says that this government are just nasty and deceptive. They made incredibly clear promises to the Australian people before the election, promises that they have wriggled out of, promises that they have thrown away—a betrayal of tens of thousands of students, of parents, of teachers, of educators. It shows that this government just do not get it, and they do not get it because they do not care. By failing to keep these promises and by walking away from Labor's Gonski reforms this government are setting their sights on a smaller future for Australia. They are setting their sights on a system which is not only impacting on jobs right now—we will be looking at the example in Western Australia today in just a moment—but will also impact on jobs for years and years to come. That is the real tragedy of what this government are doing when it comes to education and training.


Let us just refresh our memories: before the election there was a very different picture that was being painted by the now Prime Minister and the now education minister. Before the election they said:


So you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school …


That is what was said on 29 August: 'exactly the same amount of funding for your school'. But what did we hear from the Prime Minister in question time today? 'You've got to look at the small print. You need to look at the asterisk. We mean exactly the same amount just for a few years, just from prep til year 3, but beyond that we don't really mind what's going on in the schools.' Before the election the now Prime Minister said:


As far as I am concerned, as far as Christopher Pyne is concerned, as far as the Coalition is concerned, we want to end the uncertainty by guaranteeing that no school will be worse off …


Well, isn't that great, before the election guaranteeing no school will be worse off—except that since being elected they have refused to repeat this guarantee. They will not stand up in this parliament and guarantee that no school will be worse off because they know that it is utterly false.


They know that the actions of this government in six months have already ensured that every school is worse off—but that is not what they were saying at the polling booth, this very mean and sneaky government. On 29 August the now education minister said:


We have agreed to the government's … school funding model …


That's funny, isn't it? I recall that after the election he stood in this parliament and said: 'Oh no, we're coming up with a whole new model. That's all been thrown aside; that's all been discarded.' It shows that this government have broken every single promise when it comes to education. They have broken every single promise that they made to teachers, to schools, to parents and to students across Australia. They were proud—there are members sitting opposite today shaking their heads at me who were proud to stand at polling booths saying, 'You will get the same amount of funding if you vote Liberal or Labor'. Well, we have seen those signs but unfortunately we have also seen that this government have torn them up already.


What an absolutely cruel joke this has become: whereas the now Prime Minister used to say, 'I am on a unity ticket with Kevin Rudd when it comes to education', what we can actually see now is that he is on a unity ticket with Colin Barnett when it comes to education, and it is a unity ticket which is aimed at nothing more than slashing school budgets and pulling money out of school services.


Let us have a look at what they promised compared to what they are giving. A unity ticket, where Labor's reforms would have delivered $14.65 billion in additional funding in our schools; just $2.8 billion under this government. Six years of guaranteed funding under Labor—which we are absolutely committed to, which we have always been committed to and which we will fight to ensure that the Australian public gets; just four years under this government. A fraction of the money and none of the reforms.


And there is another side to all of this: not only are they not meeting their own funding commitments, but they are also letting the states off the hook. While those opposite would have us think that it has got nothing to do with Canberra, nothing to do with the Prime Minister and nothing to do with the education minister when states like Western Australia rip money out of their schooling systems, the truth is actually very different. Under the model that they told the Australian people they had signed up to, there were some very clear conditions. There were conditions of three per cent indexation each and every year. There were conditions that a co-contribution of $1 would be made by the states for every $2 that was invested by the federal government. But, importantly, there was another very simple condition: that, if you were to receive Commonwealth funding for your schools, state governments would have to guarantee that they would stop the cuts.


But what have we seen in Western Australia? In Western Australia we have seen over $183 million ripped out of their schools by their state government, by Colin Barnett, with the approval of Prime Minister Abbott and education minister Christopher Pyne. What we have seen in Western Australia is 342 fewer teachers at a time when the entire Western Australian and Australian public were told we were going to build up our education and our school system—342 teachers ripped from the system. We have seen 500 fewer support staff across the education system. This is what we have seen already, in just six months, because those opposite misled the Australian public and are now are too weak to stand up, meet their commitments and fight for education funding and the best future for all of our students.


But we know it is not just about schools. At a time when, on the one hand, over in Western Australia and elsewhere around the country, this government is out saying: 'We have a skills shortage; we have to increase the number of 457 visa holders—we simply have to, in order to meet the requirements for skills in our community,' what are they doing on the other hand? They are cutting the trade training centres—ripping out a billion dollars. They will not build a single additional trade training centre. So, on the one hand, we have skill shortages and, on the other hand, we are cutting a billion dollars so that we cannot train any Australian young people to fill those shortages. Shame on the government!


At a time of rising youth unemployment, we have a program: the Youth Connections program. It is operating in communities right across the nation. It is out there, specifically geared towards disadvantaged youths who are in danger of becoming unemployed in their youth. What is the government doing, at a time when they are watching youth unemployment increasing? They are threatening the funding and refusing to even acknowledge that this program should continue post the budget.


I tell you: we will all be watching—everybody in those communities will be watching—because we can see that this government has massively failed when it comes to the education system, when it comes to building the trade training centres and when it comes to the youth programs which are required to make sure that we are creating jobs right now and that our population is trained and skilled for the jobs of the future. The other thing we have seen—

Ms LEY
 (Farrer—Assistant Minister for Education) (15:25):  I am pleased to respond on the matter of public importance raised by the member for Adelaide. In 10 minutes of invective, nastiness, political jargon and rhetoric, the member for Adelaide has not brought to this parliament the real world experience of the trades and of training; she has not mentioned a single apprentice; she has not talked about a single RTO or the work that TAFE does; she has not understood. It is simply pure political rhetoric.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—



Ms Kate Ellis interjecting—




Ms LEY:
  I do want to address this matter of public importance in a sensible manner, in a way that looks at the issues that we are all facing in the country today, but I will start with the trade training centres because this is what is being thrown across the table at me.


In 2007, Labor committed to $2.5 billion for trade training centres in every single one of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools. Who can forget Kevin Rudd standing at this dispatch box saying: 'Every single school will have a trade training centre. There will be trade training, redeveloped, redefined, remade and remodelled in every single school in Australia.'



Ms Macklin interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Jagajaga is not sitting in her seat and may not interject.




Ms LEY:
  Only $1.4 billion of that funding has been allocated for 511 trade training centres servicing 1,297 schools. So one of the problems with the whole system was not just that it did not work but also that it was so patchwork. And the activities that take place inside these trade training centres today often are not proper vocational educational training; are very rarely linked to industry; do not produce school based apprentices as often as they should, even though admittedly they do at times; and are insufficiently embedded in the training and industry work that is in the school community where these trade training centres exist.


So what Labor did was to borrow money under the stimulus funds, build infrastructure and not care about what happened inside these buildings. Once the trade training centre is there, the issue is: who maintains the infrastructure? Who makes sure that the training is modern and relevant to industry? And who develops the pathway for the young person from school into work?


So we did in fact honour the last round of Labor's trade training centres. We did in fact build 136 new centres. We have committed to the last round of 136 new centres to be known as Trades Skills Centres. The important difference here is that our Trades Skills Centres will forge closer links with business and industry as the Australian government strengthens its focus on vocational education and training in schools.


We saw a national partnership under Labor. Who can forget Julia Gillard and the April 2012 announcement of over $7 billion in vocational education to support the National Training Entitlement across Australia, signed up to by every single state and territory—except the sign-ups did not happen? The entitlement system is in disarray. It is patchwork across every single state; nobody has consistency; and courses are being pulled left, right and centre. 


The shadow minister should be aware that, in her own home state of South Australia, child care has now been pulled from the national entitlement system in South Australia, which means that a profession so much in demand and often emphasised by the member for Adelaide cannot be achieved at certificate III level under Labor's national entitlement system.


I want to briefly talk about Labor's record on employment, because they mentioned that many times. There are 200,000 more unemployed Australians than there were in November 2007 when the coalition was last in government. The number of Australians unemployed went from 492,000 in November 2007 to 694,000 in September 2013—an increase of close on 200,000 Australians unemployed.


From 2008 an average of 67 Australian manufacturing jobs were lost every single day under Labor. A manufacturing job was lost every 19 minutes while Labor was in government. In May 2011 Labor Treasurer Wayne Swan promised to create 500,000 new jobs over the following two years. Labor missed their own target by well over 200,000 jobs. The Labor legacy is 700,000 unemployed Australians, the highest number in 15 years. Under Labor the number of long-term unemployed nearly doubled. It went from 69,800 in November 2007 to 135,400 in September 2013.


All of us in this place are right to be concerned about youth unemployment, but the most critical time in a young person's life is the pathway from school to trades training, an apprenticeship or higher education. The 18 months between leaving school and possibly finding work are the most risky for a young person. We know that that person is at the highest risk of falling out of employment and a pathway into a meaningful life and a real place in the real economy. We should all be absolutely concerned about this. To this end, I convened a roundtable on vocational education in schools with state and territory senior officials in Melbourne a few weeks ago. There was no politics in the room and nor should there have been. What was really encouraging was the level of goodwill; the level of participation that states, regardless of their political persuasion, wanted to contribute; and the understanding that we do need to get a national system.


We have got a national qualifications framework that we all operate to, so we should have a national system of vocational training in schools. When you look at the fact that 40 per cent of our students are doing vocational education in schools but only nine per cent are actually in school based apprenticeships, we realise that that figure absolutely has to increase. While we recognise that there is a learning-for-life component in vocational education and it is good for students to do that, there very much needs to be an emphasis on a school based apprenticeship—the employer needs to find the student and vice versa and the job pathway needs to be articulated.


What employers tell us is that because Labor never invited industry to sit at the table with them, whether it be in the schools—




Ms Bird:
  Rubbish!




Ms LEY:
  Whether it be in the schools or in the apprenticeship centres, Labor never invited industry to sit at the table. The problem was that the graduates that came out of the training systems under Labor were not sufficiently linked to industry and were not useful for industry. So what we have said—and the entire focus of our policy in this area around apprenticeships and training, including vocational education in schools—is make sure that industry has that buy-in and that industry participates. In some school communities around Australia you do see that and it is done extremely well. You see school principals achieving in spite of the obstacles put in the way. The most important thing, again, is that the interests of the young person are front and centre of those considerations.


So when it comes to youth unemployment we are determined to do something. We do recognise that, with the streaming of students into two different pathways, we unfortunately see too often the recognition that, 'Oh well, if you are not going to university, you are going to the trades and training,' almost as if it is a secondary pathway—and that has got to stop. We have to recognise that it is an equally valid pathway for a student to take a job in trades training or an apprenticeship or go on to higher education. When you look at the figures for the first job for students that come out of universities and you see that huge numbers actually do not leave their university degree and find employment, you realise that, perhaps if they had considered something that maybe they were more suited to in the first place, they would actually have that job. It is not an either/or proposition, Deputy Speaker Scott, as you well know with your rural electorate and as I do in mine. Many people combine a vocational pathway and a higher education pathway over the course of their lifetime. What matters is that people participate in the real economy and that they find the right start and it leads wherever it may.


This MPI is not reasonable. It makes no sense for the opposition to bring this to the parliament today. The failures that the member for Adelaide points to are Labor failures. We are absolutely committed to a skills training and education system that links to a job. We are not interested in distinguishing between students who are good at higher education and not so good at training. We are absolutely committed to making sure that each and every young person has a pathway and a future.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (15:34):  I would like to give points for effort, but I am not going to. One of the most significant issues facing the restructuring of our economy is the matching of skills to the emerging demands and the transformations of the economy. We have two senior ministers who are supposed to have direct responsibility for skills and education. Neither of them can even be bothered to be here. That is the reality of the significance that this government gives to the skills development that is needed in this nation to face the challenges that so many of our communities across the country, but in particular in Western Australia, face.


Previously as a member of some of the standing committees of this parliament when those opposite were last in government, the former Treasurer, Mr Costello, asked the committee to travel around the country and look at the pressures that would be on the economy post the mining boom. One of those that came out loud and clear from all of the visits that we did to Western Australian towns and into Perth itself was the lack of match between skills and emerging demands for training and where the new economy would create opportunities. It is a critically important factor.


The former speaker, the minister, made the point that it is important to have industry on board. Throughout the Labor government, industry—ACCI, the AiG—consistently stood side by side with the government to give priority to skills development in this nation. We put in place the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency; we put in place the Australian skills quality assurance framework to make sure that training was not available but was also quality and that it matched the needs of industry. We put in place a program, as the shadow minister outlined, through our school system. We were building trades training centres in schools and we were linking that to the pathways through things like the—




Mr Nikolic:
  Small numbers.




Ms Collins:
  It is a 10-year program!




Ms BIRD:
  It is not small numbers! I challenge members opposite. I cannot believe that the minister had actually ever visited a trades training centre. Look at them across electorates. They were being built. Schools were keen to have them. They were great success stories and local businesses were working with them. And if those opposite are seriously complaining that there were not enough of them, take it up with your own minister because you have just cut a billion dollars out of the program. Every school that was waiting to get on to that program has now—




Mr Nikolic:
  They have been waiting six years.




Ms BIRD:
  You claim that under us they have been waiting six years? They are never getting them under you. They are not getting them at all. So for all of the talk, all of the concern and all of the crocodile tears about youth unemployment and creating pathways for young people, you are cutting the program that provided those opportunities for schools across the entire region.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Cunningham might resist using the word 'you' because I will not have any authority on the subject.




Ms BIRD:
  I understand. I would never cast that aspersion on you. The reality is, for those on the other side, there actually is a real skills challenge facing this nation. When we look at what those in government said in their policy papers leading up to the election about skills, it is deafening in its silence. You took one policy to the election: to provide some income loan support to apprentices. That was it; that was your whole skills plan. So it would not surprise you that we are extraordinarily anxious about what cuts to this sector are hiding in those 900 pages of the Commission of Audit. I know some of the junior ministers have not seen it, and I am only presuming that the ministers in the cabinet who are directly relevant for this area have seen it. I would say go and grab them and have a quick talk to them.


In government we put in place programs—working in co-investment models with business—like the National Workforce Development Fund and the Workplace English Language and Literacy Program to raise the skills of existing workers, to match the needs of emerging industries and to make sure that we lifted the productivity of our population. Those programs had better not be on the table for cuts. Those skills that industries need in areas where we are seeing the transformation of industry—for example, in the mining industry in WA—and those skills in affected industries moving to a production model and relying on a new set of skills for workers along the supply chain had better not be on the cutting board under the Commission of Audit.

Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (15:39):  I must admit, with no disrespect to the speaker who just finished and who I think talked very coherently and measuredly, that the gall of the Labor Party to put this MPI forward beggars belief. It never surprises me what they are up to. Look at this matter of public importance: the government's failure to properly invest in Australian skills training and education and its impact on Australian jobs. I did not hear a fact or a figure from the other side. I heard a lot of empty rhetoric. I am going to give you a few facts and figures.


You were talking about the impact of unemployment on Australians jobs. What happened over the last six years? When you guys came into office, the unemployment rate was four per cent. It is now six per cent. The fact is that Treasury forecast that at the end of your term it would go to 6.25 per cent—that is a 200,000 jobs net increase over what it was. Two hundred thousand jobs have been lost under Labor over the last six years. That is your record. The Leader of the Opposition was an employment minister in the last government. During his watch, the unemployed rate, the number of jobs that were lost, went up 80,000. That is his record.


You guys talked about manufacturing. How many jobs were lost in manufacturing under your watch? A discrete 129,000 jobs were lost under you. So the fact is that you guys have decimated the small business community and the manufacturing community. In small business, it is lucky that some jobs were created in other parts of the economy because 412,000 jobs were lost in small business under the Labor government in six years. That is shameful. Small business, which is the engine of our economy, has been hit. Rather than the 53 per cent of the employed workforce it was employing in 2007 when you got in, it is now 43 per cent—a 10 per cent drop. There are 3,000 fewer small businesses employing people. That is the employment record of you guys. It is just disgraceful when you consider a couple more statistics.


The number of long-term unemployed—that is, unemployed for more than 52 weeks or a year—nearly doubled and went from 69,800 in November 2007 to 135,400 in September 2013. That happened under you guys. The youth unemployment rate—that is, persons aged 15 to 19 and looking for full-time work—went from 19.6 per cent in November 2007 to 27.3 per cent in September 2013. That is an extraordinary result.


You should be ashamed to put a motion into the parliament today to talk about the government and its jobs program. We are fixing the problem you guys created. As a former CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, I spent a lot of my time on skills and training. In 2007 we produced a report, a blueprint in fact, called Skills for a nation: a blueprint for improving education and training. I think the coalition has picked up a lot of the points that the ACCI put forward in that comprehensive blueprint and is now starting to implement that.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (15:44):  I would like to thank the shadow minister for putting this matter forward as a matter of public importance today. I do that because it is not simply important that we debate Australia's skills, training and education, it is vital. And it is vital that we engage with this issue in a way that takes responsibility in this place for the decisions that we make that influence the communities we represent.


Over the course of the last two years, we have seen some very significant changes in the economy of Western Australia. From being the investment powerhouse not just of our nation but of the world, Western Australia has seen significant reductions in capital expenditure, new mine construction and new project construction. We have seen, in every community, our economy change. I do not say that from the point of view that that is terrible. Western Australia happens to be a blessed community. We have not suffered two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth—a technical recession—in Western Australia since 1969. We are a good part of the world. However, let's be real about the obligations that we have as a parliament to support our state governments and our communities in trades training.


The communities I represent—Rockingham, Kwinana and Mandurah—are communities where students go to school, get good grades and then go and get trades. As the member for Eden-Monaro would know, it costs about a million dollars to train a good trades technician in electrical skills to get them up onto a mine site. It was a pleasure to be with the shadow minister, Brendan O'Connor, at Southern Cross Electrical Engineering last week talking to apprentices being supported in their training by the training enterprise structure put in place by the Kwinana Industries Council. That structure provides practical job training for young men and women, for Aboriginal men and women, to work in our resources sector. As I said earlier, the resources sector is changing; investment is in decline and we are now moving to production jobs. We need to have people job ready for those production jobs on the mine sites and in the production facilities, for the sophisticated value adding that we now do to our minerals not just in Western Australia but around the entire country.


What Canberra really does not understand is that a lead mine does not mine lumps of lead; that a copper mine does not mine copper pipes; that in a nickel mine you do not pull out nickel by the tonne; that minerals processing in our modern minerals economy is sophisticated value adding, which requires people with high levels of technical expertise and skill. It requires people with the skills to deliver their particular service in a mine site in a remote location in a production train that keeps that productivity happening for the benefit of all Australians.


I am pleased that in the course of the last month the federal government has announced funding for the trades training centre of the Peron Alliance, the local alliance of schools in my electorate, in partnership with the Kwinana Industries Council, the CCI and Apprenticeships Australia. In a number of the high schools I represent, that will broaden the number of trades training centres that will cover hospitality, health, electrical, automotive—the jobs that the young people in my electorate want to do. It will cover the skills needs of the Kwinana industrial strip. It will cover the production needs of our nickel mines, our gold mines, our magnetite facilities and our iron ore mines. It will also cover the diesel fitting needs of the transport infrastructure in Western Australia to bring our grain crop harvest to a port.


These investments are not simply lost money and dead money. They are investments in people's lives, they are investments in skills, they are investments in the future that allow young people to take control of their lives. They allow our community to be what it aspires to be—that is, productive, wealthy and able to provide good jobs for future generations.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (15:49):  I am delighted to be speaking in this debate today because, quite frankly, if this is the worst gripe that those members opposite can come up with today then our government is clearly doing a lot of things right. Seriously, this MPI beggars belief, coming from those opposite who have spent the last six years in government. For the member for Adelaide to be suggesting that a lack of investment in skills and training is now impacting on jobs is surely a much greater reflection on the poor policies of the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. In simple and very practical terms, most trade training courses have a duration of much longer than six months. So the reality is that it will take some years to repair the damage that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments did to the trade training sector. It will certainly take much more than six months to address the skills shortage that our nation does indeed face as a result of Labor's totally ineffective policies in this area.


Those policies included the spectacularly forgettable Productivity Places Program, which, like many of Labor's thought bubbles, was an expensive and astronomical failure. It was designed to train over 711,000 people. This $2.1 billion program was so badly administered that, according to documents obtained through FOI, evaluators could not even determine who had received training. The program failed to provide tangible employment outcomes, with more than half of the participants not finding a job and only 20 per cent finding a job in the area they had received training for. Then, in 2007, Labor committed $2.5 billion to build trade training centres in every single one of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools but, once again, they failed to deliver. Through the course of their term, only $1.4 billion of that funding was allocated for 511 trade training centres, and just 320 of these centres have actually commenced operation. This is Labor's track record. This is how they approached the need to train and upskill Australia's workforce when they were in office.


On top of bad policy, they also inflicted increased costs on registered training organisations, with some fees rising by 400 per cent. In the 12 months leading up to the last election, Labor stripped $600 million of employer incentives for many vocational education programs. They piled more red tape and regulation on the sector, which acted as a disincentive.


When it comes to talking about an impact on Australian jobs, Labor introduced the job-destroying carbon tax that added to the cost of all businesses through increased energy prices. I am quite gobsmacked that the member for Adelaide has the gall to put forward such a—quite frankly—lame MPI, given her party's track record.


When it comes to skills shortages, traditional trades and engineering are the most serious areas of concern in this country. As an engineer by profession, I take every opportunity I can to encourage young people into engineering and to study maths and science at school. Sadly, these two disciplines have faltered under the Labor government and their national curriculum. I hope that the review that we are currently conducting can help reverse the trend and restore the value of maths and science in order that we have more students going into science and also into engineering. I note that this week many members of this House have met with scientists as part of the Science meets Parliament program, which is just terrific. There certainly should be much greater engagement between individual MPs and senators, scientists and the scientific community.


When it comes to traditional trades, it is a sad fact that completion rates for apprenticeships in this country fell to just 48 per cent under the Labor government. In contrast, the coalition has announced positive plans to boost apprenticeships. As promised during the last election, we will introduce a trade support loan initiative. It is a practical plan to help young people who are completing an apprenticeship in much the same way our higher education loans system helps young people who go to university. I am happy to note that we are on track to implement those loans from July this year. Additionally, the government is engaging with the vocational education industry and the community through a specially formed VET review task force that is seeking stakeholder input through workshops around the country. The government is committed to a strong and robust Australian apprenticeship system that meets the needs of employers whilst delivering skilled workers.


Unlike Labor, the coalition government is committed to consulting stakeholders and ensuring that the money we invest in the trade training sector achieves results. This will, of course, take some time, but it is important to make the time to get it right.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (15:55):  The government asked us to recite some facts. I will give you a very salient fact. Today, there are 84,000 people in Western Australia that are unemployed—that is 5.9 per cent. That is the highest rate of unemployment in Western Australia since the days of the Howard government, when it peaked at that height in December 2003. So we have a very significant problem in Western Australia that we need to deal with.


I will mention a few more facts. The Assistant Minister for Education came to Western Australia recently. She was being interviewed about apprenticeships. John McGlue, the journalist, asked her: 'Why are apprenticeships now just not as popular as they used to be …'. Do you know what she did? She blamed the schools. She said:


Look, there's lots of reasons and to some extent I blame careers advisors in schools … there's not enough “try a trade” for those kids in school so they can see what it is they want to do.


There is not enough 'try a trade'—that is the fundamental problem, she says. She has blamed the school teachers, she has blamed the advisers and she has blamed the lack of the opportunity for students to try a trade. It is really important to have a try-a-trade capacity within our schools to give children, students and young people the opportunity to have a go at these trade skills, to see whether they are suited to them. Indeed, that was absolutely what this program was all about. Today, we have seen her saying, 'This has been a failure. You have only delivered 320 across Australia.' I actually think that is a great achievement. To say that we are going to cut the money because you have only delivered 320 of these seems to me to be absolute madness.


We have 49 trade training centres operational in Western Australia, and they are affecting around 150 schools that are involved in clusters. They are absolutely delivering. The sorts of nonsense that I heard coming from the government today really are not borne out by our experience in Western Australia. I want to talk about two centres that I know well, one in my old electorate of Armadale, which has been operational for around three years. They have got programs being delivered by Polytechnic West, and there is absolutely no doubt that it is attracting far more kids into the trade. I am also talking about Morley Senior High School, which is in a cluster of five schools and is delivering through its trade training centres. It has become very competitive to get a place at Morley Senior High School. We even have parents who have taken their children out of private schools in the area and put them into some of the cluster schools so they can gain entry to the automotive program, so highly sought after is it. Private enterprise is represented on the panel that selects the students. Industry is deeply involved in these programs. This has been an excellent program and it is absolutely bizarre that we are cutting it.


At the same time that we are cutting down our base of skilled people we are loosening the reins on 457 visa class. We have already seen the start of that. We have 21 per cent of people on 457 visas in Western Australia. They have played an important part. We did recognise last year that this scheme was getting a little bit out of control and that there were many people coming into Western Australia when there was growing unemployment. We need to ensure the 457 visa class has community support, and we are not going to do that if we are systematically loosening the reins on it, as is underway now with the government, and allowing people of very modest skill levels coming in when we have got 84,000 people in Western Australia that are unemployed. Here we have a government that is saying we have to unleash the 457 visas, that we are going to take off the restrictions so we can bring in more skills from overseas, and at the same time dumbing down our education system and taking out that very, very successful plan.

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (16:00):  In addressing this MPI we cannot look at the last six months in isolation. Certainly we can talk about—and I will talk about—what we have done in the last six months and what we are going to do over the next 2½ years. But I think everyone in this chamber should be a little sobered by the report from the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which shows that Australian academic standards have been slipping since 2009. They say that the latest results are a serious wake-up call for Australian education, showing a downwards trend since 2009 to late 2012 in Australia's student performance relative to other countries across mathematics, reading and scientific literacy. Surely if we are going to discuss this, we—and the previous government, with all due respect—need to acknowledge that academic standards slipped for four years of their six-year rule in this country, and they slipped in the three areas that are obviously very important to every student in this country.


Another salient fact that we need to acknowledge—because we cannot look at the last six months in isolation—is that the number of 15- to 19-year-olds commencing apprenticeships or traineeships fell by four per cent between 2011 and 2012. So from 2009 to 2012 we had falling educational standards and falling traineeship and apprenticeship take-up in this country. That is the context that we took over. We took over an education system where we were falling down the ranks. We took over an education system where apprenticeships were being taken up less and less. So let us look at what we are going to do about that. As the assistant minister very eloquently stated earlier on, we are opening 136 trade skill centres, and I have visited some of those that are going to open in my electorate. We have five. The Alstonville High School will be building a million-dollar primary industry centre—an agricultural centre. I went and had a look at that the other day. That is going to be built. We announced that funding recently. There will also be a million-dollar hospitality centre at the Evans River School and centres at Grafton High School, South Grafton High School and Trinity Catholic College.


So we are not abandoning that—we are running out 136 of those centres. But nothing stays still, so if we are going to be training and educating our high school students to join the vocational educational part of the workforce, we have to look at other ways as well. The assistant minister also mentioned that. For a period of time I was a high school teacher, and I was also involved in giving career advice to high school students and saw different methods work in different ways. One way that worked very well—and one we will certainly be encouraging—is school based apprenticeships and traineeships. Certainly there is a space within a high school where you can be taught different vocational education, but there is a big push for–and a lot of room for—students being at high school but also spending a period outside that high school at a school based traineeship or apprenticeship where they get on-the-job training. We certainly will not be abandoning that system; we will be encouraging it. As was previously said, we have established the VET reform task force, because we want to design a system that is flexible and will create results. So we have planned that as well.


We say this a lot, and I almost always get derision from the other side when I mention it, but we are going to cut red tape and all the compliance costs and everything else that those training providers and employers have to do. That is important. We are also talking about higher education as well. We know that the previous government cut $2.8 billion from education, so we have seen falling results in most measures—(Time expired)

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-03-18,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:05):  I rise in support of the matter of public importance brought before the House by the member for Adelaide. Before commencing my remarks, I think I should acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Page, because he did something quite extraordinary in this parliament: he talked about some things the government is actually doing. So I congratulate the member for Page in taking about two minutes of his contribution to talk about the responsibility of this government. At least he believes in no excuses.


It is disappointing that we have to have this debate, because before the election—as everyone in this place knows—we had a unity ticket on education funding, which goes to the core of the challenge that the member for Adelaide is putting forward today and which is at the core of Labor's agenda. It is very disappointing that we have to have this debate, because while it relates to many cuts and many broken promises, at the core there is one: the unity ticket on schools funding. But this is a government that said one thing before the election and quite another after. Yesterday I spoke about the government's neglect in the area of skills in the legislation that is presently before this House. We have a very, very thin agenda that goes nowhere near creating the high-skilled high-wage jobs of the future, whereas skills, training and education and their impact on people's ability to secure meaningful employment is of vital concern to the people I represent in the Scullin electorate and indeed Australians everywhere. This goes to the heart of meeting our productivity challenge. But opposite us we have a policy-free zone.


Today I was proud to walk out the front of parliament with many of my colleagues on this side of the House and stand with the Gonski vans, which have conducted a road trip around Australia. I did not see members opposite, but I am proud to stand up with advocates for public education in support of needs based education funding. From there I came into the parliament to meet with children from St John's Primary School in Thomastown. They were thrilled to see Bill Shorten, Australia's next Prime Minister, and they were very excited to hear from him. They were also very interested to hear that we would be debating education and skills, and I think their teachers were interested too, to see if this parliament can chart a pathway to better productivity, and to the high-wage, high-skill jobs of the future.


The urgency and importance of this debate is heightened for me and for many of my colleagues by the recent major job announcements, which impact on many people in the northern suburbs of Melbourne—most recently at La Trobe University, building on from Golden Circle, Ford, Holden, and all the other auto-related jobs. The government still does not have a jobs plan, but it is much worse than that. The failure to invest in education and skills will cause profound damage to our future prospects. This challenge is about productivity, but it is also about equity. That is why Labor took the Better Schools Plan to the last election. We acknowledge the critical role education plays in giving children the best possible chance of getting good jobs. Labor's plan, of course, was not the no-strings, bucket of money approach. It was a targeted, equitable allocation of funds based on individual student needs. It provided certainty to schools, something they never had under the SES model of the Howard government.


I heard yesterday from representatives of the Catholic Education Office, who are keen to emphasise these very points. They discussed their noble aim, and tradition, of assisting students in need, but they highlighted the massive financial disincentives the Howard era funding model created. For example, it costs about $13,000 to educate a child, but $64,000 to educate a child with special needs. Under the coalition's funding model, schools had a perverse incentive to turn away children who cost more to educate—this was needs based funding in reverse.


All schools and school communities desire certainty, and Labor gave it to them. That this government saw fit to walk away from that certainty, or perhaps to weasel out of existing arrangements, shows the contempt that the coalition has, not only for students and staff but for schools themselves, for Australia's future and for the job prospects of the kids at St John's Primary School in Thomastown, and many kids like them.


The coalition liked to engage in motherhood statements about education. We have heard some of them today, but their instinct is to cut it. As the member for Isaacs knows, one of the first acts of the Baillieu government in Victoria was to slash funding for TAFE. One of the first actions of this government was to break its core promise of a unity ticket for education funding.


As the member for Adelaide put it, at the core of the government's agenda is a smaller future—an end to needs based school funding, cuts to trade training, cuts to Youth Connection, and no skills agenda. It is neglect that must come to an end.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:10):  Like a number of other speakers on this side, when I saw the MPI I thought we must have put it up. It is about the 'government's failure to properly invest in Australian skills training and education, and its impact on Australian jobs'. In 2007, the then Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd declared a war on skills shortages. He announced $2.5 billion for Trades Training Centres in all of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools. The problem is they only spent $1.4 billion of that money, which is over half, and they started the allocations for 511 of these Trades Training Centres—servicing 1,297 schools—but only 320 of these are actually up and running. So they have spent over half the money for 25 per cent of the actual number of Trades Training Centres, but only 12 per cent of them have actually been operating. So where will the rest of the money come from?


When we are talking about properly investing in education and training in this country, and allocating the right amount of funds, they have fallen at the first level, in the same way they have with so many things, whether it is the Early Childhood Learning Centres or the GP Super Clinics, which we have been hearing so much about. At every level the previous Labor government came out and made these grand promises about delivering all these magnificent things, yet when it came to implementation they have fallen at the very first hurdle.


The problem with the previous Labor government is that they think that writing something on paper actually delivers it. It does not. You have to actually employ the tradespeople to do it. When Labor came to office in 2007 Australia had a perfectly good technical college system. We had a fantastic one in Townsville for instance. The best part about what this government did to it—and it shows you what their commitment to education is—is that they made the Townsville technical college change their name from the Australian Technical College North Queensland to Tec-NQ, at a cost of $50,000. And then they just pulled their funding. That was their commitment to school based education. Tec-NQ is still providing these quality services; they are still working as an RTO. Those are the sorts of things the previous government did. They just pulled the funding out, proving they just do not get education when it comes to these things.


We are shifting the VET sector out of education and into industry, because we believe that is where the focus should be. The focus should be on outcomes and on jobs. All the way through we have seen the previous government get up and talk about what their commitment has been. Last week I heard an absolute cracker about how the former government was working on bettering education and on job placements. During a Certificate II in Active Volunteering, you did not have to volunteer. Part of the course on active volunteering was that you did not have to volunteer. All the way through a Certificate II course on active volunteering you did not have to volunteer. Only Labor could do that.


The Education and Employment Committee is going to actually finish off the work of the 43rd Parliament, because we want to make sure that TAFEs in particular are not being hurt. TAFEs have to do a very big job when it comes to the capital work, and to the big trades. We want to make sure all the other RTOs are not just taking the cream off and making TAFE a stand-alone facility where the capital cost is high, making them a target for cuts. This is because we believe in the TAFE sector, and we believe in the VET sector.


We have real challenges in youth unemployment, and they are not all related to training, skills and education. The member for Brand spoke earlier about refining. One of the key things to making sure that refining works is to make sure that your input costs are low. The one thing you do if you want to make sure that you keep jobs in manufacturing and refining is keep your electricity costs low, and you do not introduce a carbon tax. That makes people shift refining, and other energy intensive occupations and practices, overseas. The Abbott government is committed to real job growth; the Abbott government will deliver on jobs and education. We are a good government.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2014-03-18,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:54):  I must address the final comments by the previous speaker, the member for Wannon, who spoke on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. He said that the outlook for agriculture in Australia is wonderful and that he has every faith and confidence in it. I do not think anyone in agriculture, listening to his speech, would have any confidence in him. If you come in here and make stupid statements, you should be made to pay for it somewhere. Let me just narrate to you the ridiculous nature of his statement. I do not know where he comes from in Australia. But if he comes from Victoria—




Mr Dreyfus:
  The Western District of Victoria.




Mr KATTER:
  Western District of Victoria—well, that makes it quite extraordinary!




Ms Ley:
  You come so infrequently, you do not know where anybody comes from. 




Mr KATTER:
  The lady government representative at the dispatch box—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  That would be Minister Ley.




Mr KATTER:
  just made a comment that I do not know where anybody comes from.




Ms Ley:
  You do know where I come from!




Mr KATTER:
  Well I hope that I do not because I do not want to be personal in my comments. I do not direct personal attacks where I can avoid them, unless I am really provoked, but I do want to address what the former speaker said. The member for Wannon said the output for agriculture in this country is good. The honourable minister at the dispatch box, the Assistant Minister for Education, represents a country area in Australia. I would like to throw to Minister Ley the challenge that she will answer what I am going to say about agriculture in Australia. This is not an opinion of a member of parliament; these are the actual ABS statistics. 


The Weekly Timespublished a major article saying just that, and I hope that the minister at the dispatch box reads the Weekly Times—probably the only agricultural paper in the country worth reading, most certainly in Queensland. The Weekly Times said that Australia is going to be a net importer of fruit and vegetables. I think this is quite extraordinary. Australia is already a net importer—not going to be, but is a net importer of fruit and vegetables. I got five separate sets of statistics out from the Library and there was no doubt whatsoever that Australia is a net importer of fruit and vegetables. 


We have people in this parliament who come in here and make stupid statements that outrage and anger the farming community of Australia—not anger or enrage them to the point where they change their vote, but anger and enrage them and make them very cynical towards all politicians, which they are entitled to be. They say, 'We are going to be the food bowl of Asia.' How ridiculous—how utterly ridiculous! We will be a net importer of food from Asia and there is no doubt about that. Let me return to fruit and vegetables. We are a net importer of fruit and vegetables, we are a net importer of pork and we are a very big net importer of seafood. Five or six years ago, we were big exporters in all of those items. To give you some sort of perspective, if you draw a growth line on prawn and fish farming in China and extrapolate it out to 2050, then it is a fair call that almost all of the protein on earth will be coming from prawn and fish farms in China. I am not saying that China will increase its present production levels but it can. It does not need any area of land, not that China is short of land covering maybe a fifth of the surface area of the world. Even if it was short of land, prawns and fish can be produced in the ocean in nets. So those are the three items where we are already importers. That fruit and vegetable figure is prior to SPC Ardmona, Golden Circle, Simplot and McCain all getting into serious trouble. I predicted in this place on many occasions that unless something was done about the car industry we would have no car industry within seven years. Well, I was dead wrong—it was seven months after I made that statement that all three of them announced their closure. I find it very difficult to see how fruit and vegetable processing in Australia will be able to remain viable. It is no fault of the workers in those plants and it is no fault of the management in those plants. Rather, it is the problem we have in agriculture.


Let me switch from fruit and vegetables and pork and seafood to the major players in agriculture in Australia, starting with the beef industry. Our figures show, before this drought and before the wicked decision by the ALP government to ban live cattle exports, we were down to 23 million head of cattle from a herd level of 33 million head—and it should be more than that today. The wool industry was the biggest exporter in this country before Mr Keating, as Treasurer of Australia, wrecked it completely. Until that point, wool was a bigger export item than coal. This country was still riding on the sheep's back in 1990 before that person destroyed the industry. The sheep herd has fallen 63 per cent. Sixty-three per cent of that great industry which kept this nation going for nearly two centuries has all but vanished—wool is not up there as one of the serious export items anymore. The third item I want to talk about is dairying. No-one in this place needs to be told about dairying. We told, we pleaded, we howled and we cajoled, saying 'Do not deregulate the dairy industry! Look at what has happened in Victoria, where they deregulated it into the Melbourne markets. Do you want that all over Australia?' They would not listen so they deregulated the dairy industry. The dairy herd is down 31 per cent. The export of dairy products is down very significantly, though I do not have the figure with me at the present moment.


When a person gets up in this place and says the outlook for agriculture is bright I would like to know where it is bright. I would like to know where this brightness is coming from. I went to a meeting in Meridan where 1,200 wheat farmers turned up. I have attended three or four meetings in Victoria and there would have been over 1,000 people at each of those meetings. They tell me over 6,000 people attended those meetings. Near the area of the honourable minister at the dispatch box, the member for Farrer, 14,000 people came to the meeting in Griffith. So, we have all of these happy farmers who are doing so well and can look forward to a bright future! I want a member of the government or the opposition to stand up and tell me where this brightness is coming from. Maybe they are referring to the grape industry or the citrus industry—or what is left of those industries. And you ask what is left of those industries. It has got nothing to do with the drought.


We praise the minister and the government for improving this proposal which came forward from the Labor government. We thank the Labor government and the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, for introducing this concept. But, I want to put on record the people from whom this concept originated. This concept originated with the Mareeba Rural Action Council. I have never seen such a band of tenacious and unrelenting fighters. The honourable member for Mallee spoke in this debate earlier; he was head of the Victorian Farmers Federation. I would like to know what our farming organisations have done for us over the last 30 years. I would like to know one thing that they have done for us in the last 30 years. Almost every single initiative that has been worth two bob has come from spontaneous, people-on-the-ground, grassroots movements. I speak with great anger because my industry, the cattle industry, was nigh on destroyed by the inaction of the MLA, the NFF and all of the other bodies associated with the cattle industry who knew what was going on in Indonesia and chose to do nothing about it. When we saw what we saw on Four Corners—we criticised them for it—nothing was done by any of those organisations, including the Victorian Farmers Federation, including New South Wales Farmers Association and including AgForce in Queensland. None of those organisations moved to do anything about sending stun-guns and knocking boxes up to Indonesia and acting on what needed to be acted upon immediately. 


The people who have led this fight that has culminated in a great decision by the previous Labor government and an excellent enhancement of that decision by the existing government are: Johnny Gambino—no-one can underestimate the importance of this person to rural action throughout Australia; he was one of the founders of the serious mango industry that we have in Australia today; Bernie O'Shea, who many times appeared on television to the great benefit of every single farmer in this country even though he does not come from a farming background; Max Srhoj, the person who pushed me to get out of the party system in this country as it existed so I could stand up and fight properly for the people I am supposed to be paid to represent, and one of the most successful farmers and one of the very few successful farmers that we have up on the Atherton Tableland area, which produces about five or six per cent of the fruit and vegetables we are still producing in Australia; Ned Bruschetto, who spent some years on the council up there as an excellent councillor; Vince Mete;  Johnny Myrteza; Peter Henderson; Kevin McGrath who, again, served many years on the council; Joe Moro, who has been a great leader up there for many years; Lidio Nicolosi; and Scotty Dixon, who will fight till the day that he is pushing up daisies—what a great asset he has been to the team up there. 


Why are we in this situation? We are in this situation because our RBA interest rates have been set at 3.2 per cent, on average, for the past two or three years. The rest of the world averages 0.27 per cent. That is a 1,000 per cent difference. It is not a 10 per cent or a 50 per cent difference; it is a 1,000 per cent difference! Every farming organisation and farming representative in this place should be screaming it from the rooftops on a daily basis—heaven only knows I tried to. If you have interest rates that are 1,000 per cent out of step with the rest of the world then clearly you are going to have a currency which is wildly overvalued. That value should be at US50c. That is not my opinion; that is the opinion of the international monetary markets. 


Mr Keating did something very good: he allowed the dollar to free float, and it went down to US49c. When Mr Costello came in he did a very good thing: he allowed the dollar to free float. These people advocate free markets. They both did the right thing. They were as good as their word; they came in and they allowed the dollar to free float. And it went to US52c. So, when the dollar was allowed to free float, it went to US49c and US52c, and then our terms of trade deteriorated disastrously from that point. We were running current account deficits of $10,000 million; we are now running a current account deficit of $60,000 million. That is creeping up to a significant percentage of the entire budget of the Australian government. 


Worldwide, the level of support for agriculture subsidies and tariffs is 41 per cent—you can get this information from the library or from the OECD website. Australia's was 4.5 per cent the last time the OECD released international figures. We have the Coles/Woolworth situation. No other country on earth has a situation like that. In America, the big two have a 23 per cent market share and the Americans are squealing blue murder. The big two here have somewhere over 85 per cent of the marketplace. We need collective bargaining. When it was taken away from us in the milk industry, in the sugar industry and in other industries, we were crucified. under collective bargaining in the year 2000 we were getting 59c for fresh milk in North Queensland. Our farmers are now being paid 48½c. 


Moving to ethanol, ethanol fixes up the cattle industry, the sugar industry and the beef industry. We would not need drought support if we had an ethanol— (Time expired)

Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (17:10):  I will eventually bring the discussion back to the Farm Household Support Bill 2014, which I have not heard a lot about in the last 15 minutes. I do want to take up what the member for Kennedy just said. He has raised some interesting points. He made reference to the contribution by the member for Wannon, who spoke earlier. Some of the statistics that the member for Kennedy just cited are true. Our agricultural sector certainly faces some serious challenges, and they are issues that we need to get right. 


The member for Kennedy challenged any member of parliament to give him a positive or an optimistic agricultural scenario. My electorate shares the challenges that he describes in the sector. One of the biggest private employers in my electorate is an abattoir. They certainly were very much harmed, as the industry was, by the live export ban. We saw cattle prices decrease significantly because of that.




Mr Katter:
  That helps the abattoirs.




Mr HOGAN:
  Well, it did not help them, because all the cattle that were supposed to be sold offshore moved south and, as they moved south, our market was inundated with cattle, which completely depressed our prices.



Mr Katter interjecting—




Mr HOGAN:
  It does, but it certainly did not help industry. I think that harmed the industry, and the drought certainly has not helped either. The positive story I have to share with the member is that they have been actively searching and finding new markets for their product. There have always been an exporter of their product. Almost 70 per cent of their product gets exported. For example, 18 months or two years ago China bought hardly any of their frozen boxed beef; it is now a significant buyer of their product. They are optimistic about their future. They are a cooperative. The cooperative is positive about their future. With rain—which I will get to in a minute in relation to this bill—they are very positive about what can happen when the restockers come back into that market.


The member for Kennedy mentioned the dairy industry. I have a dairy cooperative in my electorate, and they too are very optimistic. They have certainly faced challenges with the supermarket duopoly, which the member spoke about. But they too are positive, because just this month they accessed a new market in Asia, not just for dairy but for fresh milk. This is because of what is happening with some of the export protocols that we are dealing with, one of which relates to Korea, where tariffs on our agricultural products have been reduced. So, I say to the member: I hear you on some of the challenges faced by the agricultural industry, but there are positive stories out there. I certainly share the member for Wannon's optimism on agriculture. 


I do want to talk about the bill that we are supposed to be debating. I would like to share with the House a letter written by a dairy farmer in my electorate. It refers to the drought, an issue which makes this bill so important. It was written by Leigh Shearman, who is a member of the Far North Coast Dairy Industry Group, DIG, and I have Leigh's permission to share it with you. In writing to the manager of North Coast Local Land Services in Kempsey, Leigh states:


Dear Nicole


I am writing on behalf of the Far North Coast Dairy Industry Group, our group represents 145 dairy farmers from Murwillumbah through to Grafton. The situation is deteriorating with every week that passes and no rain in sight. With pasture growth now non-existent and with only very limited dairy farmers able to irrigate under their water sharing agreements. 


The cost of conserved fodder, which a majority of farmers are now totally reliant on, is escalating and very hard to locate. Corn crops that a lot of dairy farmers rely on for supplementary feeding when times are tight are only yielding very minimal returns, as is with a lot of silage crops. Dairy farmers are high grain purchasers and with the failed crops now really starting to push already high grain prices even higher the cost of production is rising beyond milk returns.


We cannot impress strongly enough that you keep dairy farmers in mind and act as quickly as possible to implement any support that is available. As most are aware dairy farmers are struggling financially under the cost of production and the climatic conditions are placing an enormous financial burden once again on an industry that is an important industry to our region.


If you would like further information I would be very happy to be of assistance.


That is a letter from a farmer who is obviously being affected by these climatic conditions.


Before going to the bill specifically, I would like to share a conversation that I had just recently with a person in my community, Anne Thomson from Eltham, who has supported drought appeals for 20 years and encouraged people to support people in drought, wherever the drought seems to be or where the money is needed. Obviously, there are times when there is no drought. She focuses on sending money, food and Christmas presents. She has no idea of how much, but she has raised tens of thousands of dollars over many years for drought affected people. An important point is that she often comments that the people giving that support are often pensioners, old people or people with very little income. They come along and see her every fortnight after they have received their fortnightly payment to give her a bit of money or a bit of food to share with people in drought. She has sent assistance in previous years to areas like the Riverina. This year she sending a lot to Brewarrina and Walgett and as far away as Lightning Ridge. One of her distributors, Betty, who lives between Moree and Mungindi, has been nominated for a senior citizen of the year award for distributing those gift parcels.


I wanted to start with those examples because they show two things for me: the real financial consequences of drought, as the letter from the dairy farmer showed, and the help that we see from everyday mums and dads trying to help people who need assistance. I think they are a good introduction to the fact that we as a government should also be providing some of that type of assistance.


One thing that I think we need to stress—and there have been a lot of conversations about this in relation to other industries—is the point that was made by the member for Parkes that this is not a handout; this is a hand up. This is not a structural problem for farmers. Our farmers, as was said, are some of the most efficient farmers in the world, and they have to be because we as a country give them very few subsidies. If you look at other countries around the world, they give huge subsidies to their agricultural producers—we have read about them and they have been well articulated in this place. We do not do that. We have made sure that our farmers are the best in the world because they have to be to survive. So this is not about a handout; this is about a hand up.


Climatic conditions are deteriorating as we speak. This bill, which introduces the farm household allowance, is a once-in-a-generation reform of government support. The timing is appropriate not just because of the drought but also because it is the International Year of Family Farming. We are also proposing this bill now because this cannot wait until 1 July when it was originally due to come in. It will replace the Farm Household Support Act, including provisions relating to the exceptional circumstances relief payment, and makes support much more responsive to farmers' financial hardship. It will provide time limited three-year payments and support for those eligible to improve their situation without the need for a climate trigger. The three-year support will provide farmers with time to plan for the future and to achieve financial security and self-reliance.


It includes a $2.55 million net farm assets test, which will be indexed, and off-farm and liquid asset threshold aligned with Newstart allowance, which excludes the principal home. This is higher than the mainstream assets limit in recognition that farm assets are relatively illiquid, especially—as you would appreciate, Deputy Speaker Mitchell—when these payments are needed and cannot be relatively drawn on for self-support. There is an income test consistent with Newstart allowance, but with a provision that means that off-farm income will not be regarded as income when it is used to pay interest to a bank or commercial lender. There are also provisions for automatic entitlement to a Health Care Card and waiting periods the same as social security payments.


There is support for the Department of Human Services to assess farmers and help them develop a financial improvement plan. I want to go into this in a little bit more detail later, but this is a really important part of this bill. It provides counselling, financial or otherwise. Farmers tend to be a fairly proud lot. They are obviously not employees; they are running their own business and are usually fiercely independent. So to ask for help, whether it be financial or otherwise, when they need it can sometimes be difficult. So part of this is to encourage that and to make access to that easier. It will also support farm families to educate their children. Parents receiving the allowance automatically meet income test provisions for the child's youth allowance.


Before I go into some of the details of the bill more in depth, I want to make a point because I was somewhat taken aback by the pessimism of the member for Kennedy's views on agriculture. I think we need to look at the positive contribution that it is making and the fact that, to my mind, it has great potential to grow. It generates now over $47 billion in gross value of production, so it is one of the main five pillars of our economy. Agricultural exports just last year were worth $38 billion. This is real money. This is money produced by the private sector, the agricultural sector. They are paying taxes. They are generating real wealth for this country, and I am very confident they will continue to do so.


Just in my region, the agricultural sector generates more than half a billion dollars, or about five per cent of our gross regional product, and employs directly over five per cent of the workforce. Most of these are small family-owned operations. I alluded to it before; there are some very positive stories out there in my community and I know they are replicated across the country. I have a dairy cooperative and a meat cooperative that have a positive story to sell. They are gaining access to new markets. They have new buyers who, come good weather, are going to push up prices, I believe, for many agricultural products. I have a blueberry farmer who is building quite an operation in my electorate who is very excited about his prospects of gaining access to markets in Asia and will employ—



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—




Mr HOGAN:
  We love blueberries. We realise that blueberries are a wonderful anti-oxidant and we encourage all agricultural products. We have some of the most efficient farmers in the world. We need to help them in this short-term period, while climatic conditions warrant it.


I will put on record some of the specifics of this bill. The interest rates on the new drought concessional loans will be set lower—that is 0.5 per cent below the interest rate for the farm concessional loans. The previous speaker was talking about interest rates; the interest rates under this will certainly be lower than they otherwise would be. There are things in there for counselling, both financial and otherwise. There is a review, as part of this, that looks at drought preparedness, because while you can not necessarily prepare for all droughts—especially one that, in some cases, has gone on for so long—there are certainly ways that we can improve what we do. This bill will help with that. The drought concessional loans are going to be available to drought affected farm businesses that have already taken steps to prepare for the effects of drought, but which with some financial assistance can do more.


I will finish on the topic of my optimism for this industry. Fifteen or twenty years ago, people were very critical of the mining industry in the sense that it did not negotiate hard enough. It was not getting good enough prices for its product. Back then there were the BHPs and, I think, it was Western Mining then, not Rio Tinto. Their main buyer back then—their sole buyer, really—was Japan. What happened was that we had a new buyer who came into the market and greatly increased the prices and the viability of that industry. I am very positive about the agricultural sector and I support this bill to help them over their short-term climatic conditions.




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Does the member claim to be misrepresented?




Mr Katter:
  Yes, I do, Mr Deputy Speaker. The previous speaker said that I had attributed this to the current federal government. That is not entirely true. I attributed it to this government and the previous government, but most of all to the Rural Action Council of North Queensland. They have developed the proposal and brought it forward and carried it by themselves for 10 years.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Speaker made it clear today that if we are going to have these, you should check the record and then come back and do it. That would be good.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (17:25):  I rise to support wholeheartedly the Farm Household Support Bill 2014. In doing so, I pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and my good friend the member for New England. He is a man who is extremely passionate about Australian agriculture, particularly passionate about family farms, and about ensuring that farming families can continue on into the future. We have heard some talk in the public sphere—notably Paul Howes, the head of the Australian Workers Union—that farming families are no longer needed in Australia, that the ma and pa families are something of the past. I am glad we have a Minister for Agriculture that does not subscribe to that view. Because the many farming families throughout my electorate of Dawson—farming families who are engaged in enterprises such as sugar, tomatoes, capsicums, fruits, vegetables and cattle—want to continue, and they want their farms to be handed down through the generations. This is something that is in the blood. I could not grow a lettuce actually, I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I come from a generation of cane farmers. Every time I see a stalk of sugar, I want to hug it. It is something that is in the blood. I salute our Minister for Agriculture, who recognises this and wants to protect farming families in Australia, and I look forward to seeing a lot more positive policies from the Abbott Liberal-National government and the Minister for Agriculture to help this sector and farming families.


The bill before us seeks to implement an income support payment for farmers and their partners who are in financial hardship. It is called the Farm Household Allowance. Australian history has been a rich narrative of tough people battling tough conditions. Our reputation as one of the best agricultural producers in the world is counterbalanced with bouts of droughts and floods. While the harsh conditions are nothing new to our farming families, they operate in a different environment to that of their forefathers. The great wealth that was once produced by family farms during good times helped tide families over during the bad times. The boom times are no longer the boom times of old, in some respects. Increased competition, more regulation and a cost base, escalating due to things such as the carbon tax, make farms much more vulnerable. It certainly does not help when governments decide to shut down things such as the live cattle trade overnight and without warning. It does not help, as I said, when the government imposes a carbon tax that actually impacts on trade exposed industries such as agriculture.


Right now, though, our farmers—especially those in western Queensland and western New South Wales—are battling what is quite clearly the worst drought in a century. And in response to these tough times the Abbott Liberal-National government is delivering a range of measures to assist these drought impacted farmers. The measures outlined in this bill provide for up to three years of income support for farming families without the need for a weather related trigger, and that is very important. The means test will provide more equitable treatment for people who lack sufficient means to support themselves. The assets test will be higher than mainstream limits, recognising that family farms—the actual farm asset itself—cannot be drawn upon for self-support as easily as can other types of assets.


I note that we are a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that article 9 of the covenant talks about the right to social security. This is a case in point in relation to this government acting for a segment of the population: when everything goes to hell, there is not adequate support for them. Through these measures, we are making sure that the safety net is indeed there.


So the government stands ready to support those in our community who are most vulnerable through no choice or fault of their own—they are simply subject to the vagaries of the weather and, unfortunately, to government policy of the day, which can sometimes be deleterious on their enterprise as well. But our goal is to ensure long-term self-sufficiency in the agricultural sector, and to this end the legislation that is before us includes provisions for a farm financial assessment and requires allowance recipients to enter into a financial improvement agreement. That means that recipients of government funds through this measure will undertake education or training or even off-farm employment that will increase their capacity and ability to deal with the situation that is before them and, frankly, to keep the family farming tradition alive in this country. When applicants meet those eligibility requirements they can gain access to further benefits, such as the health care card, the telephone allowance, remote area allowance, the clean energy supplement, pharmaceutical allowance and rent assistance. So, there is a range of different benefits that derive from this legislation.


The Farm Household Support Bill provides an income support payment for farmers that aligns with social security laws that exist in other areas, where that is possible. As a Liberal-National coalition government we want to ensure that farming families are treated fairly and that they have access to the same benefits and services that other families facing difficult circumstances have access to. For families who are living outside of the city, access to a whole range of services becomes something of a problem. Isolated families do not have things like regular waste collection services. They do not have access to community libraries. They do not have access to adequate sporting facilities, parks and recreational areas or even business facilities that we take for granted even in small country towns. As much as these things impinge upon lifestyle, it is far more serious when farming families reach the point where they have difficulty in just putting food on the table. When things are truly, truly tough, it is our responsibility as a nation to ensure that help is there. We do not want these families to feel they are completely cut off, with no hope for the future. Too many farmers have been in a position where they cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we must do whatever we can to provide that light at the end of the tunnel—to provide, as I said before, an adequate safety net.


And I hope that we go further than just that. I hope that we are able to go further very soon in this parliament, and remove other impediments to the agricultural sector, such as the carbon tax, which I know equates to about $20,000 per farmer in the sugar industry. I hope we can actually pass reforms that get rid of all the red tape and regulation surrounding the process of registering agricultural chemicals. Here I must commend the parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, for the work he has done in this field, because it will be of tremendous value to farmers right across the nation. The red tape introduced by the last government was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing, and the repeal of that red tape will put useful tools and agricultural chemicals on the farms quicker and at a cheaper cost. If there is one thing we want to do, it is to make life easier for these people on the land who are going through such terribly trying circumstances right now. We need to let these farming families know they are not forgotten. We need to let them know that we are going to help them through their darkest times. We need to let them know that we are going to help them to build a brighter future.


My electorate is a narrow strip of coastal North Queensland. It is about 400 kilometres that stretches from Mackay through to Townsville. It is a very agricultural electorate, taking in the largest sugar-producing region in the country. But it also has other agricultural, pastoral and horticultural industries; in fact, would you believe that Bowen—so famous for its mangoes—also produces two-thirds of Australia's winter tomato crop? That is the kind of electorate I come from—a very, very strong agricultural electorate. I have to say that, being on the coastline, my electorate enjoys a higher and more consistent rainfall—particularly after a cyclone comes along. But we have been in drought before. Coastal areas also suffer drought, but not for long, and not as harsh as those who are out in western Queensland and north-western New South Wales have had to go through. Our hearts go out to people who battle those dry conditions, day in and day out, sometimes for years on end. Australia has always held very romantic notions of the bush and the battler, despite the fact that most of us now live in urban area, probably just a few minutes walk from a local cafe, or a hairdresser, or a hardware store. However, the strong connection and affection for farmers and rural communities comes to the fore whenever our sunburnt country is in the grip of droughts, flooding rains, or bushfires.


When times are tough, people stretch out their hand and offer help. We like to think we all do—but in some cases we see situations where people are kicked when they are down. I have to note once more my disbelief that the green movement is coming together next week—in the middle of the harshest drought we have seen in a long time, while farmers are reeling from it, and from government policies—to promote vegetarianism and veganism to the entire nation with Meat Free Week. They want to encourage people not to eat meat for a week. That is why I have launched my counter proposal, the 'free meat week', where I am encouraging Aussies—and the member for Wright might get into it—to support Aussie farmers by putting on a barbie and shouting some free meat to their neighbours and mates. We need to stand up to this green movement, which kicks our farmers while they are down.


When times are tough, people who are real, genuine and compassionate stretch out their hand. Right now, times are very tough for our farmers. It is time for this government, in a bipartisan manner, to reach out a hand and deliver fairness, equity and a fair go to the people who put food on our tables. With those words I commend the bill to the House.

"Pasin, Tony, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (17:39):  I rise today to speak on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. I do so as a proud representative of the farming communities in Barker. I was privileged to have a rural upbringing, and I continue to take an active interest in my families farming enterprise around Mount Gambier. That is a part of the south-east of South Australia that, thankfully, enjoys some of the most reliable seasons of any agricultural district in the nation—although, as we saw cruelly in years like 2006, we are far from immune to drought.


Barker, however, is a diverse electorate—64,000 square kilometres of diversity. Today in my electorate we are experiencing extremely dry conditions throughout the Mallee. So, while, thankfully, the current situation seems confined, tragically, the spectre of drought for those in Northern Queensland and New South Wales—just as it is in areas such as my electorate.


When financial hardship can strike more assured farm communities such as those in my electorate, as it has done in recent years—especially among local dairy farmers—we are reminded of the threat of more widespread drought in other areas of Australia. I have always believed that it is the responsibility of a good government to strike the right balance when it comes to exceptional circumstances. I think it is important to have a system in place to support those farmers who are experiencing extraordinary hardship, and provides them with the assistance they require for their livelihoods to be sustained with dignity and into the future.


I am proud to represent an electorate that makes a significant contribution to Australia's agricultural industry each year. It is a sector that, as other speakers have pointed out, generates over $47 billion of revenue nationally, in terms of gross value of production. Farmers throughout Barker contribute disproportionately to the nation's farm exports, amounting to total sales of approximately $38 billion in the last year alone. This income is absolutely vital to our entire economy, but particularly in regional communities such as those throughout Barker. When those sales literally dry up, due to tough seasonal conditions, our farmers need the support of the Australian government to ensure they survive the bad times, so that they can quickly thrive and capitalise when seasonal and market conditions improve.


Like others in this House, I have a bullish view of the future of the agricultural sector in Australia, and particularly for the agricultural sector in Barker. But one of the greats risks is the concept of generational farming. We need to ensure that farming is both profitable and attractive for the next generation of farmers that I hope, as I am sure the member for Mallee hopes, will come along with us on the extraordinary journey we are on in this place. I am very pleased that the coalition, through these measures, are doing everything that they can to encourage and assist farmers to adopt best practise farm management techniques and smarter business management strategies, so they can grow and adapt in the face of uncertain seasons and ongoing economic challenges.


We must also acknowledge that periods of extreme difficulty can be caused by a number of different factors and, importantly, this bill confirms the coalition's commitment to introducing a new Farm Household Support Payment to those in need of financial assistance. That is an important point. This is a needs based system. In the absence of the member for Grey, I must say as a regional representative from South Australia that, contrary to some of the media speculation early in this debate, this is a measure that will address the hardship being experienced by those farmers in northern South Australia. The member for Grey represents South Australia's pastoralists, in particular the ones who produce livestock in those areas, and this measure is available to them. That was done in response to approaches to myself, the member for Grey, and the Minister of Agriculture, by organisations including Livestock SA.


It is important to acknowledge the bipartisan way in which these changes have been supported thus far. I commend the members on the other side of the chamber for working with the government to implement these important changes. Nonetheless, I know there are those that have been critical of the coalition's commitment to provide this kind of assistance to farming families in need. To be honest, I think anyone who does not support this kind of package either is trying to play politics with this very important issue or has a shameful lack of appreciation for the agricultural sector and food production in particular.


I think it is clear that these measures will address many issues faced by farmers in drought, including rising debt levels, the capacity to make household payments, limited water for livestock, personal stress and the management of pest animals. This is reflected in the way that industry has welcomed these changes since they were announced in February.


In looking for a moment at the bill in more detail, I note that the farm household allowance provides: three cumulative years of income support for farmers and their partners in hardship without the need for a climatic trigger; a $2.55 million net farm assets test where the principal home is excluded; an income test consistent with Newstart allowance but with a provision that will allow off-farm income to be disregarded as income where it is used to pay interest to a commercial lender; automatic entitlement to a healthcare card; waiting periods consistent with social security payments; support from a Department of Human Services case manager to help assess a recipient's situation, develop financial improvement agreements and then fund activities set out in the agreement; and a compliance framework to ensure obligations are met to address fraudulent activity. Of course, it is important not to lose in this debate the very significant stress placed on farmers in drought conditions. As someone who has worked with a disproportionate number of people in my previous professional life who suffered mental health conditions, can I say we must never forget that at these times of high stress.


I know that the relief package was a major topic for discussion when I hosted the Minister for Agriculture in my electorate of Barker on 18 and 19 February in advance of this announcement. We met with a number of livestock producers and mixed with farmers from throughout the south-east and even parts of western Victoria, represented so well by the member for Wannon. The late Tuesday afternoon at the Mt Gambier saleyards, where preparations were being made for the following morning's weekly prime cattle, sheep and lamb market, was a very suitable backdrop for a discussion about the relief package, which had only just come to significant media attention. We know that the physical markets are nearly always still the best barometer for how the livestock industry is travelling during these tough times of drought. Even though the seasonal conditions that we speak of are far away in northern New South Wales and Queensland, they still impact on the markets in the south. It is a consistent reminder of how all Australian farmers are so closely linked together within this industry, no matter how many thousands of kilometres separate us.


At that gathering we had members of a number of significant primary industry organisations, including Mr Andrew Ogilvie, who is President of the Cattle Council of Australia and a local beef producer. We also had in attendance the President of Livestock SA, Mr Richard Halliday, and the Vice President, Mr Jack England—both of whom are also south-east farmers. I was also pleased to welcome the Mackillop Farm Management Group Chairman, Mr Duan Williams, and his deputy, Mr David Farley. The Mackillop group is an exceptional regional-based producer network that is independent and proactive, and develops innovative and sustainable farming practices through research and extension for the benefit of primary producers in the south-east. They are very much a can-do organisation.


The relief package was also of interest the following day when the minister and I travelled to Renmark in the northern parts of my electorate. There we met with the Riverland wine grape and citrus growers, who know, unfortunately all too well, about drought. It was an interesting discussion regarding the government's relief package. With such informed groups, I know the minister enjoyed the positive feedback he received during his time in Barker. I was very pleased to help facilitate these discussions because I think it is important that primary producers in my electorate know that Australia has a federal agriculture minister who knows his way around a set of cattle yards and is at ease surrounded by farmers. What a welcome change it is to those of us in rural Australia with an interest in farming that we have a minister who is actually passionate about agriculture. The feedback we received on our tour was positive. Just as encouraging has been the ongoing discussion that I have been having with primary producers in Barker about the government relief package.


Farming families and industry groups are grateful that the federal government is genuinely committed to ensuring regional communities are not    abandoned at this time of crisis. I, too, am grateful that our Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture have put a suite of measures on the table which offer an updated financial, social and mental health support framework for those in greatest need. I echo the sentiments of the National Farmers' Federation President, Brett Finlay, who I understand was in the building earlier today. He has said that the government's relief package announced demonstrates that the coalition government is listening to the farming community. I think Mr Finlay was spot-on when he described the package as being both fiscally responsible and considerate of circumstances suffered by rural communities in many parts of Australia. I also concur with Mr Finlay's commendation of the minister for his continued efforts as a champion for Australian agriculture.


I believe this bill is the cornerstone of the coalition's commitment to supporting family families through difficult times and investing in the growth of a profitable and globally competitive agricultural sector. This is important because, as others have said in this place, it will rain again; and, when it does, we need to be ready to take advantage of that situation.


That is why I am proud to be a member of the coalition government and proud that we have introduced this bill into the parliament. This bill reinforces the federal government's support for the Australian food and fibre producers and, more broadly, for our nation's rural and regional economies. As such, I commend it to the House.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (17:52):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014 this evening in the chamber. Before I speak directly to the bill, it would be remiss of me not to take charge of some of the comments that came from the other side of the House during this debate.


Members opposite took the opportunity to burnish their credentials, claiming that pricing carbon was a good thing for our farming sector. I was speaking with an irrigator only last Saturday, and when he opened his power bill he was physically sick as he looked at the escalating cost of him doing business in the agriculture sector. Can you imagine what stress that has on a family's mindset? Can you imagine what pressure it puts on the family budget? I challenge anyone in this place to think of the last time they opened a bill and their immediate response was to be violently ill. To come to this place and claim that pricing carbon is a wonderful aspiration for the agriculture sector is fundamentally flawed. It is playing a crippling role.


We heard comments from the crossbench that it was ridiculous that Australia could be the food bowl for Asia. Members from the crossbench, who have spent more than 27 years in parliament, whether it be in state parliament or in this place, are part of the problem. It is those who sit on the crossbench who decide. Go back and look at their years of experience. When they came to the parliament, state or federal, farm input costs were up to six times lower. When those members of the crossbench came in here and said there was not a future in agriculture and scoffed at the coalition when we said that there was, the average cattle property in his electorate would have had 10 full-time workers on it. Today in his electorate, the average workforce on a property would be mum, dad and the odd contractor that would come in on an annual basis.


Input costs are crippling our sector, whether it be through petroleum costs, labour costs or seed costs. We say that we are a smart nation, but a John Deere harvester in America is $400,000. We were at parity with the US dollar not too long ago, and the exact same machine here was $800,000. Why? It is the crossbenchers who have overseen that and then dared to come in and criticise the coalition when we came in and put up packages to assist this sector.


I am proud of the sector in my electorate. We have the Lockyer Valley with Gatton, Laidley and Forest Hill. In addition we have Beaudesert, the Fassifern Valley with Boonah, Harrisville and Peak Crossing, and, to the south-east, Canungra and Beechmont. Each one of those communities relies heavily on the success of the agriculture sector, whether it be beef, dairy or horticulture. When one of my farmers is doing well, they are in town buying new stock or product.


A typical farming business in my electorate is a family business by the name of Dovers and Son. They are third generation and openly saying it is as tough as they have ever seen. And it is tough. We were affected by the live cattle export trade debacle that we saw introduced by the other side of the House and supported by the Greens; but, as a result, when those northern cattle no longer had an export market, they were forced into our southern markets, so our traditional prices that we would have got took a beating.


Our dairy industry is on its knees at the hands of the duopolies of the processors that they sell their milk to. When you go to the processors and put them under the pump, they will make it absolutely clear that the pressure is being screwed on them on the back of dollar-milk processing. In Queensland I now have less than 500 dairy farmers when 10 years ago there were 2,500. It is a bleak future. I have stood in this place and spoken about the dairy industry many times before, saying that I cannot fix this industry with a single piece of legislation for a mandatory code of conduct. There needs to be in the dairy sector in my electorate a muscling up on the processors and demanding a better price for the product at the farm gate. The retailers understand the value of the price of milk; they strategically place it at the back of the store so that you have to walk past all their other product lines to go and get it. They understand the value of milk. They use it as a cost leader to get people in the door so they can take advantage of the market.


I have the seventh-most-fertile valley in the world in the Lockyer Valley, which is situated right next door to the Fassifern Valley. The Lockyer Valley produce is sent to vegetable markets in all major cities and contributes around $250 million worth of product each year just from that area. Next-door, still within my electorate, the Scenic Rim is dominated by agriculture, contributing about $196 million and $13.6 million of the gross regional product of the Scenic Rim. Agriculture is also the largest employer within the Scenic Rim, employing a total of about 1,400 people, or 13.7 per cent of the region's workforce.


The thing that unites my agricultural sector, whether it be dairy, beef or horticulture, is rising debt. A quick synopsis: roughly, if you bought a place in the electorate about 10 years ago you would have paid around $5 million for it. Your debt ratio would have always been skewed at around 50 per cent. Over the last 10 years, the value of your property would have gone from $5 million to $10,000,000. So as a result, your debt ratio at 50 per cent went from $2½ million to $5 million as the price escalated. You have a debt of $5 million on a valuation of $10 million.


In recent years, on the back of the drought and the poor policy decisions by the previous government, the value of land has come back. We have properties now that were worth $10 million but, if pushed for a fire sale, today they would be worth around $6 million—but they are still carrying a $5 million debt. So they are way outside their 50 per cent loan ratio and that is why we as a government are here today introducing the Farm Household Support Bill 2014. We are doing our share in lifting up and trying to help this sector back to prosperity.


There is a responsibility for our banks, who rode the wave of prosperity, who saw the opportunity to lend to the market, who saw the opportunity with rising valuations and who saw that it was a safe bet with security if things went sour, that their money would be secure. So I say that there is a role for our major banks in being part of the solution. There is a future in the agricultural sector in Australia; there is a future in the dairy industry, there is a future in the beef industry and there is a future in the horticulture industry. If you listen to the crossbenchers they will tell you that there is not. Evidence to support my case, that there is a future in this sector, is that when a place worth over $200 million wants to get sold there is a kilometre-long line of international buyers standing and waiting to come to Australia to invest into this sector because they see the future benefit. Why do they see the future benefit and why do they see Australia as a safe bet to invest in? Because we are the smartest in the world. We are the most efficient farmers in the world. We have the most initiative, and we are the most intuitive farmers in the world. We will continue to be because we have to be.


I have a local family in the dairy industry, the Dennis family. They said, 'No more, I am not accepting the processors price.' They pulled a couple of million dollars and did a partnership deal with some friends, some family and some banks. They set up their own bottling plant and they are now distributing their milk, Scenic Rim 4Real Milk brand, to over 200 outlets in the south-east corner. That is the initiative. That is the intuition that inspires us as a nation—that singular type of operator.


As a government, the producers are not looking to us for a handout. They just want us to get out of their way. These are our people; the agriculture sector are our people. Just as the unions are linked at the hip to the Australian Labor Party, the agriculture sector are our people. When we cut ourselves they bleed. The agricultural sector believes in the same political ideologies of freedom, of free market, the values of family and the values of Christianity. These people are the true quintessentials who have made Australia what it is. They need to be looked after—they are our future.


At lunch on Saturday, again, I was disappointed when I heard a grown man tell me that he is spending nearly $20,000 a week on feed to keep his stock alive at his property west of Longreach. He has three kids coming through and I said, 'Do you want the kids to take over the place?' He said, 'Not a chance. This is killing me. There is no way I want my kids to do that.' And he said, 'Do you know what? However tough it is, I will get out of this. I will be better for it.' Then he said, 'I know it is not the right thing. I do not want to push my kids into it. But I know that they will live here. My parents lived here. I lived here. My kids will live on this place.'


There is a sense of pride in the bush. There is a sense of achievement. As a coalition government we need to lock arms with this sector and ride with them for the next 10 years, in conjunction with the banks; by writing good policy and by making sure that we do everything in our power to reduce these horrific input costs. Every day that we have breath in ourselves, we should remember that there are people out there at the moment opening their energy bills and who are being physically sick—ill—because they have no idea how they are going to meet those costs. I thank you for your indulgence, and I commend the bill.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (18:06):  It is a great privilege to speak on the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014 today. Almost 10 per cent of my electorate work directly in agriculture, and many more work indirectly in the sector, so any legislation impacting on agriculture is of great interest to me. It is also of interest to me as a fifth-generation farmer myself.


A traditional feature of agriculture, and indeed small business more generally, is that the household and the business are often one and the same. To understand how we might best help farm households we need to talk first about farm businesses and how we might support them in the coming years.


It is unfortunate that the last government never understood agriculture, the opportunities it presents and the policy framework we need to put in place to make it succeed. We saw a raft of policy failures, and more about that in a moment. On this side of the House we understand—and many other speakers who have come before me have said the same thing—that agriculture stands on the edge of the greatest opportunity we have seen in decades and perhaps even centuries. Many seem to not understand this point. Yes, this opportunity is not getting through to the bottom line for many farmers for reasons that I will explain, but some other members, like the member for Kennedy, need to get out a bit more into our export markets to see what is really happening out there. These are strong words, but let me explain.


In 2005 I began work on a project in Western Australia. I was working with the largest iron ore producer in Australia trying to understand the impact that Asian demand was having and was going to have on its business. The results of the work were absolutely staggering. China had suddenly realised that self-sufficiency in iron ore was no longer realistic. Its thirst for our exports that followed was growing by the day and prices began their extraordinary journey from $20 a tonne to $200 a tonne. We talk now about how terrible it is that the iron ore price has got to $100 a tonne, but it is still five times higher than it was before the Chinese surge began. Meanwhile it became clear in this case that a business producing just over 100 million tonnes a year could be producing over 300 million tonnes in 10 years time. Most of the management team of this organisation fell over laughing, but the prediction proved correct.


Then in 2008 many, including me, began to apply the same approach to understand agricultural demand. The results were similarly staggering. Not only would population drive growth in demand for our food and fibre but far more importantly rising income would change diets in the most fundamental ways. As people get wealthier their calorie consumption rises—sometimes to their great regret—and, more importantly, the make-up of those calories changes too. As we get wealthier we eat fewer carbohydrates and more proteins, fruit, vegetables, oils and sugars. That in itself is interesting, but the story gets better for our farmers.


The land and water required for those calories is increasing at a remarkable pace as more and more people enter the global middle class and as the land and water requirements for more intensive proteins increase. To put this in perspective: two-thirds of the growth in the world is now in poorer, developing countries, as against just one-third a decade ago. So where is that land and water coming from to meet this need? The clear answer is: nowhere. For all practical purposes there is no new land and water to access and we will probably lose a lot of it to agriculture in the coming years. So the problem can be solved only by producing more with less—higher productivity—and not just more of anything but more of the right foods and the right fibre. Oilseeds, fresh fruit and veg, proteins and even sugar are the foods that will see the greatest gains.


Already this is having a big impact on global prices for many products. In the summer season just passed we saw extraordinary prices for fresh fruit and veg in countries to our north. They are prices that we are not yet accessing but they are extraordinary prices and markets nonetheless. Global dairy prices, not local ones, have reached new highs in recent years and oilseeds are being imported into China at unprecedented rates. The global markets for lamb and even beef have never looked so good, despite what is happening locally. Despite all this good news, only last week I hosted a forum for farmers in Goulburn and heard about the continuing cost-price squeeze that our farmers face.


So with all this good news why aren't we seeing greater farm profitability and greater farm prosperity? The answer is sobering. For a start, our competitiveness has suffered badly from a high dollar that has been exacerbated by extraordinary public spending in recent years. Any resource economist will tell you that the first thing you should do when you have a resources boom is save government money to take pressure off interest rates and take pressure off the currency, but our Treasurer at the time, the member for Lilley, decided to run a grand experiment by doing the exact opposite and spending money as fast as he could. At the end of the day who can stand between the Labor Party and a wasteful public spending agenda?


But the problem was worse. When a great opportunity in the marketplace presents itself, the key is to get access to new markets. So the government did the opposite again. They started shutting down export markets. The most successful agricultural market in the last 20 years was the live export market. The former government, in its infinite wisdom, decided to shut the market down. We have to remember that, despite what the member for Kennedy would have us believe, the bulk of our agricultural sectors are export focused and have been for almost 200 years. To make matters worse the last government made no progress on accessing new valuable markets. While the Kiwis managed to get a free trade agreement with China, which is now powering their economy through dairy exports, we got nothing. That is why we announced within months of getting into government an agreement with Korea and why we will continue to work hard on Japan and, perhaps most importantly, China.


But agriculture needs more than just markets; it needs secure access to water and land. The Labor Party got to work on this one with its appalling Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Instead of looking at innovations to save water and use it better for environmental purposes, the ALP went for the lazy answer of taking water from agriculture. Meanwhile, agricultural education and R&D have suffered badly. We saw a reallocation of money to green research and education. The focus was taken away from productivity. But I guess when you are married to the Greens that is what you do. Farm extension services, the lifeblood of farm productivity, have gone the same way, with a shift from a productivity focus to an environmental focus. All farmers understand sustainability and understand that profitability is a prerequisite for sustainability. Throughout all of this, our supply chains had suffered from a policy vacuum. We stepped in to deal with the proposed Archer Daniels Midland purchase because there is limited competition in our grain ports and an ineffective regulatory framework. Grain is not the only industry where this is true. We know there are problems to solve in the sugar industry and in parts of the meat and dairy industries. 


Farm finance has also suffered from a policy vacuum. As farm debt levels climbed from $30 billion to over $70 billion, there was no debate in this country about how we would finance the next generation of farmers into this wonderful industry. These younger farmers should not just be the sons and daughters of current landowners. Instead, we want to follow the New Zealand example of finding ways to bring new blood into our industries. At the end of the day, the owner-operator, the family farm, will remain the heart of our farming industries; but that owner-operator will need to have its business partners to succeed. 


Into this context, the coalition is determined to take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities we currently face in agriculture, opportunities that others dismiss. We are re-establishing the live export trade. We are opening up new markets in Asia, both through increased market access and also through enhanced biosecurity. We are focusing on delivering more water in the Murray-Darling Basin for both agriculture and the environment. We are putting more money into R&D. We are focused on helping farmers to reduce their costs through reduced energy prices, reduced red tape and less government borrowings to take pressure off interest rates and our currency. Our agricultural white paper is the first serious look at the broader policy framework for agriculture for many years. The paper will look hard at many of the issues I have already talked about, including agricultural finance, education, R&D and supply chains.


But we also need to support those suffering from the ravages of years of poor policy combined with harsh seasons. Coalition policy will never focus on propping up failing businesses, but it will focus on helping out households facing impossible circumstances. My first significant memories of drought were in the early 1980s. When lying on the ground, I could shoot rabbits hundreds of metres away without a blade of grass between me and the rabbit. That was bad news for the rabbit but worse news for us as farmers. The stress on families in these periods of drought is enormous, and I saw it in my own family. I prayed for rain constantly, if only to relieve those family pressures, let alone the business pressures.


I am pleased that both sides of the House support this legislation. I acknowledge the commitment of the member for Hunter for supporting many of our agricultural policies. He understands the flaws of past policies, and the serious need to move away from the mistakes of recent years. There are many aspects of this legislation before the House that show a deep insight into modern agriculture, farming businesses and farm households. We understand that the asset threshold that would trigger this assistance needs to be relatively high, and exclude the family home. That is why we have set the asset trigger at over $2.5 million and rising with the CPI. Selling down a farm business in a drought is a disastrous financial outcome, and a policy that forces such a sale would be poor policy indeed. We also recognise that off-farm income is often used to keep farm businesses going, but we should not discriminate against those who are earning that off-farm income. The legislation recognises this.


While my electorate is not suffering from drought in the way that many other regions are, there are areas of great hardship. This legislation recognises that farmers can face this hardship, even in areas that are not in what we might traditionally call drought-declared. Our agricultural policy is focused on helping farmers to be self-reliant, including in drought. Farmers want their businesses to succeed without government support. That is our focus, and the focus of this legislation. Only when self-reliance is impossible should the government step in. That is also the focus of this legislation.


This is an extraordinary time for agriculture. In 1788, when Europeans first arrived in Australia, they could not have known that in a few short decades this new country would become an agricultural powerhouse, building enormous prosperity on the back of exports to England. We currently face an opportunity of similar magnitude. We will not get there unless we provide the right policy framework and the right support to our farmers, in their times of greatest need. I commend this legislation to the House.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (18:19):  Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak on the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. This becomes the second iteration of a drought policy. I took the first part through the cabinet and the parliament at the end of last year. That allowed the movement of tens of millions of dollars into drought affected areas and also allocated $10 million towards water infrastructure. At that point, we hoped and prayed that we would get rain and the issues would be alleviated. Of course, that was not the case. This brought us to the position where we had the second iteration, of which this is a crucial part. 


Prior to this, we had the transitional farm family payment. The trouble with that transitional farm family payment was that it was not accessible to enough people to deal with their financial trauma. In many instances we had people who had no access to money whatsoever, none. They were actually ruled out from having access to social security by reason of the asset test. When the asset test comes to a position of $1.5 million and you have a property worth $3 million, which is not unusual nowadays, with debts of $1 million without any real desire for the bank to go any further than that—they actually were outside the assets test. What does this mean? The differentiation for them is that we had houses with no money going into them at all. They did not get Newstart; they were not allowed to get Newstart. They had no access to income from the farm because they were in drought. They could not just close the gate and walk out the door because you are actually bound by law for the maintenance of your stock and other vital components of the farm. 


No matter which side of the chamber you are on and who you are, there is something inside you that says something has to happen, that this is not right; that our fellow Australians and fellow Australian families should not be put in this sort of condition. When you get to an area you can see that sort of pall of depression and darkness that falls over people as they say: 'Well I cannot see a way out. I cannot even clean up the accounts in town. I cannot go to town because I am a bad debt. If I go to town, how do I pay for my fuel? How do I clear the chemist account? How do I deal with all these other things about which people say, 'That doesn't happen in Australia'. Well it does. There is no more vital sign of misery in our nation that we refuse to see than rural misery, where people live in a diminished condition. Not only that, these people live in a diminished condition miles away from the benevolence of the government that is apparent in the multiple hospitals and schools that you would see in larger urban settings. 


I said that at the start because it is very important that people clearly identify the difference between doing it tough in the country and doing it tough in other parts. I am not saying for one moment that there are not people in  the western suburbs of the major cities, or in other areas, who are doing it tough as well. This is a particularly cruel form where not only are you without your regular income stream, which is tenuous on many occasions by reason of the fact that is it is related to the vagaries of the weather, but also you are taken away from any social security settings. It is vitally important that we immediately change this. 


I commend the support of the coalition and the Prime Minister and the support of the opposition in saying that, on this occasion, people on either side of the political divide are not going to let this human misery continue. So what this legislation allows people to take the limit from 1.5 to 2.55 million and their house is exempt as well. Exempting your house, your primary domicile, probably gets you close to a $3 million net asset limit. If you go away contract harvesting, if you go away working on the road or if you go doing some work in one of the mines, it allows you to earn up to $80,000, provided that your interest bill is bigger than that because we know that, when the money turns up, the banks will just hoover it up and send it straight off to fix them up. At least, it allows you some sort of mechanism to earn some external income. This allows off-farm assets for a couple, for partners, of about  $280,000 as well. All in all, it is a good outcome.


I have had some people say it was rushed. The member for Moreton said it was rushed. It was not actually. He should be aware of his own government's position. The first time we started reviewing this was in 2008. On this issue, we are bringing forward and adjusting the settings, but the overall scheme is something that we have been looking at for some time. It is part of a process of dealing with the issues of drought into the future. We will have other settings in other parts, to which we wish to ensure people will get access. We will make sure that people will get access to $280 million at four per cent, or a million dollars or 50 per cent of the facility, whichever is the lesser, so that people can have access to money. It is not part of these bills but, in similar settings, is part of the drought package. That gives people access to money to replant, to restock, to try to get cash flows moving again. 


I will be happy to say the interim farm household allowance is currently working under executive orders. What we are talking about is the settings as of 1 July. I suppose people are wondering, if we are talking about this legislation now, how on earth are people are getting access to it? It is happening under executive orders. I want to remind people that we already have about 83 claims that are true. So 83 families now have access to this scheme, which is uncapped. Whoever is out there in need and is listening, this scheme is uncapped. You will get access to it if you fit the criteria. We are seeing right now that people are doing precisely that—they are fitting the criteria. Before with the interim farm family payment, when I went to some towns only one person in the whole town it. It was not really ticking the box.


We have also had some other discussions. With the greatest respect, there was one where the member for  Hunter asked for clarification about the costs associated with the farm household allowance and the $99.4 million that was agreed to by the Labor government in 20013-14 as the cost of the allowance over the forward estimates. This included $37.3 million for the Department of Human Services to administer the allowance. Of this 30 million was set aside in 2013-14 to build a dedicated IT system to support the payment and for case management of the allowance. Again, this was the setting put in place by the former Labor government. The member for Hotham brought up that her husband's family was associated with the dairy industry and noted that the scoping meetings—they are not happening any more—would bring an end to civilisation as we know it. We will still have as required—




Mr Albanese:
  Move on, Senator!




Mr JOYCE:
  It is good to see the member for Grayndler, from the large rural seat of Grayndler! I noticed that St Mary's Cathedral is right next to Hyde Park.




Mr Albanese:
  Libya Hill—say thank you and move on, Senator!




Mr JOYCE:
  Lucky we got the money back for that. 




Mr Albanese:
  Just say thank you and move on.




Mr JOYCE:
  I would say thank you if you had left any money in the bank, but you did not; we had to go and find it.




Mr Albanese:
  That is nonsense and you know.




Mr JOYCE:
  You should ask me more questions. Why don't you ask me some more questions? It was very important that we recognised that we can actually have meetings, if people want them. We will be having meetings from time to time and I envisage that we will be having a meeting in the very near future to deal with, among other things, working out a national approach for fruit fly.


Agriculture in Australia is vitally important. There is no better example than what happened in January. This nation thought we were going to have a $100 million loss for the month but we ended up with a $1.4 billion surplus. The member for Hunter, who is sitting beside the member for Grayndler, will be able to tell him exactly where that came from. Predominantly it was driven by agriculture. This goes to show that agriculture puts money on the table to pay its way. How did we get that money on the table? We harvested $17.2 million worth of wheat in Western Australia—we got in excess of six million tonnes of wheat onto boats—and we had the live cattle trade, with those terrible people in the live cattle trade putting all that cattle onto boats, getting paid for it and helping our nation get back into profit. We also had all those terrible people in the live sheep trade, getting paid for putting sheep on boats and bringing money back into the country. It is great when we get these trades going again because that is how we turn a buck. When you are making a buck you do not need the Farm Household Support Bill, because you are making money. But, if you have got a drought and you are doing it tough, these are the sorts of policy settings you need. Our minds are always directed towards how we can turn a profit and how we can take the agricultural future of our nation forward. That is why I am also very encouraged by the support we are getting for the white paper. 


The white paper is going to be a seminal document. It is going to increase the capacity of all those people throughout the agricultural sector to have their say in where our nation is going. It will make sure those people will be able to make their contribution on how we get a fair return back to the farm gate; how we can get a better return back to the mums and dads, back to the kitchen table, back to the people who are putting the cattle on the boats and paying their way in our nation, back to the people putting the wheat on the boats and paying their way in our nation, back to the people who are working under the belief that, even with the vagaries of the weather, they are doing the right and proper thing by creating the food and creating the fibre which feeds people and which clothes people—I cannot think of a more honourable life; that would have to be one of the best. These people deserve our support and I hope that will stem from the white paper. I think that this hope is not in vain. There will be a good sense of bipartisanship as we try to make sure that we create settings ensuring that long after I have gone, the member for Hunter has gone and other people have left there is a document that can be taken forward—




Mr Albanese:
  Who do you reckon will be here the longest?




Mr JOYCE:
  I do not know. The way I am going, probably you. We will have a document that can be taken forward. It is something similar to a defence policy, so people know roughly where you are coming from and how it is going to work. I know that this is basically non-contro apart from the expected couple of jibes that you always get on an issue like this. We have something later on that is going to be slightly more contro—we will see how it goes—and that concerns the re-registration of chemicals. Maybe that will liven the place up a bit. I thank those in the chamber for their attention.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:54):  I must address the final comments by the previous speaker, the member for Wannon, who spoke on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. He said that the outlook for agriculture in Australia is wonderful and that he has every faith and confidence in it. I do not think anyone in agriculture, listening to his speech, would have any confidence in him. If you come in here and make stupid statements, you should be made to pay for it somewhere. Let me just narrate to you the ridiculous nature of his statement. I do not know where he comes from in Australia. But if he comes from Victoria—




Mr Dreyfus:
  The Western District of Victoria.




Mr KATTER:
  Western District of Victoria—well, that makes it quite extraordinary!




Ms Ley:
  You come so infrequently, you do not know where anybody comes from. 




Mr KATTER:
  The lady government representative at the dispatch box—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  That would be Minister Ley.




Mr KATTER:
  just made a comment that I do not know where anybody comes from.




Ms Ley:
  You do know where I come from!




Mr KATTER:
  Well I hope that I do not because I do not want to be personal in my comments. I do not direct personal attacks where I can avoid them, unless I am really provoked, but I do want to address what the former speaker said. The member for Wannon said the output for agriculture in this country is good. The honourable minister at the dispatch box, the Assistant Minister for Education, represents a country area in Australia. I would like to throw to Minister Ley the challenge that she will answer what I am going to say about agriculture in Australia. This is not an opinion of a member of parliament; these are the actual ABS statistics. 


The Weekly Timespublished a major article saying just that, and I hope that the minister at the dispatch box reads the Weekly Times—probably the only agricultural paper in the country worth reading, most certainly in Queensland. The Weekly Times said that Australia is going to be a net importer of fruit and vegetables. I think this is quite extraordinary. Australia is already a net importer—not going to be, but is a net importer of fruit and vegetables. I got five separate sets of statistics out from the Library and there was no doubt whatsoever that Australia is a net importer of fruit and vegetables. 


We have people in this parliament who come in here and make stupid statements that outrage and anger the farming community of Australia—not anger or enrage them to the point where they change their vote, but anger and enrage them and make them very cynical towards all politicians, which they are entitled to be. They say, 'We are going to be the food bowl of Asia.' How ridiculous—how utterly ridiculous! We will be a net importer of food from Asia and there is no doubt about that. Let me return to fruit and vegetables. We are a net importer of fruit and vegetables, we are a net importer of pork and we are a very big net importer of seafood. Five or six years ago, we were big exporters in all of those items. To give you some sort of perspective, if you draw a growth line on prawn and fish farming in China and extrapolate it out to 2050, then it is a fair call that almost all of the protein on earth will be coming from prawn and fish farms in China. I am not saying that China will increase its present production levels but it can. It does not need any area of land, not that China is short of land covering maybe a fifth of the surface area of the world. Even if it was short of land, prawns and fish can be produced in the ocean in nets. So those are the three items where we are already importers. That fruit and vegetable figure is prior to SPC Ardmona, Golden Circle, Simplot and McCain all getting into serious trouble. I predicted in this place on many occasions that unless something was done about the car industry we would have no car industry within seven years. Well, I was dead wrong—it was seven months after I made that statement that all three of them announced their closure. I find it very difficult to see how fruit and vegetable processing in Australia will be able to remain viable. It is no fault of the workers in those plants and it is no fault of the management in those plants. Rather, it is the problem we have in agriculture.


Let me switch from fruit and vegetables and pork and seafood to the major players in agriculture in Australia, starting with the beef industry. Our figures show, before this drought and before the wicked decision by the ALP government to ban live cattle exports, we were down to 23 million head of cattle from a herd level of 33 million head—and it should be more than that today. The wool industry was the biggest exporter in this country before Mr Keating, as Treasurer of Australia, wrecked it completely. Until that point, wool was a bigger export item than coal. This country was still riding on the sheep's back in 1990 before that person destroyed the industry. The sheep herd has fallen 63 per cent. Sixty-three per cent of that great industry which kept this nation going for nearly two centuries has all but vanished—wool is not up there as one of the serious export items anymore. The third item I want to talk about is dairying. No-one in this place needs to be told about dairying. We told, we pleaded, we howled and we cajoled, saying 'Do not deregulate the dairy industry! Look at what has happened in Victoria, where they deregulated it into the Melbourne markets. Do you want that all over Australia?' They would not listen so they deregulated the dairy industry. The dairy herd is down 31 per cent. The export of dairy products is down very significantly, though I do not have the figure with me at the present moment.


When a person gets up in this place and says the outlook for agriculture is bright I would like to know where it is bright. I would like to know where this brightness is coming from. I went to a meeting in Meridan where 1,200 wheat farmers turned up. I have attended three or four meetings in Victoria and there would have been over 1,000 people at each of those meetings. They tell me over 6,000 people attended those meetings. Near the area of the honourable minister at the dispatch box, the member for Farrer, 14,000 people came to the meeting in Griffith. So, we have all of these happy farmers who are doing so well and can look forward to a bright future! I want a member of the government or the opposition to stand up and tell me where this brightness is coming from. Maybe they are referring to the grape industry or the citrus industry—or what is left of those industries. And you ask what is left of those industries. It has got nothing to do with the drought.


We praise the minister and the government for improving this proposal which came forward from the Labor government. We thank the Labor government and the former Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, for introducing this concept. But, I want to put on record the people from whom this concept originated. This concept originated with the Mareeba Rural Action Council. I have never seen such a band of tenacious and unrelenting fighters. The honourable member for Mallee spoke in this debate earlier; he was head of the Victorian Farmers Federation. I would like to know what our farming organisations have done for us over the last 30 years. I would like to know one thing that they have done for us in the last 30 years. Almost every single initiative that has been worth two bob has come from spontaneous, people-on-the-ground, grassroots movements. I speak with great anger because my industry, the cattle industry, was nigh on destroyed by the inaction of the MLA, the NFF and all of the other bodies associated with the cattle industry who knew what was going on in Indonesia and chose to do nothing about it. When we saw what we saw on Four Corners—we criticised them for it—nothing was done by any of those organisations, including the Victorian Farmers Federation, including New South Wales Farmers Association and including AgForce in Queensland. None of those organisations moved to do anything about sending stun-guns and knocking boxes up to Indonesia and acting on what needed to be acted upon immediately. 


The people who have led this fight that has culminated in a great decision by the previous Labor government and an excellent enhancement of that decision by the existing government are: Johnny Gambino—no-one can underestimate the importance of this person to rural action throughout Australia; he was one of the founders of the serious mango industry that we have in Australia today; Bernie O'Shea, who many times appeared on television to the great benefit of every single farmer in this country even though he does not come from a farming background; Max Srhoj, the person who pushed me to get out of the party system in this country as it existed so I could stand up and fight properly for the people I am supposed to be paid to represent, and one of the most successful farmers and one of the very few successful farmers that we have up on the Atherton Tableland area, which produces about five or six per cent of the fruit and vegetables we are still producing in Australia; Ned Bruschetto, who spent some years on the council up there as an excellent councillor; Vince Mete;  Johnny Myrteza; Peter Henderson; Kevin McGrath who, again, served many years on the council; Joe Moro, who has been a great leader up there for many years; Lidio Nicolosi; and Scotty Dixon, who will fight till the day that he is pushing up daisies—what a great asset he has been to the team up there. 


Why are we in this situation? We are in this situation because our RBA interest rates have been set at 3.2 per cent, on average, for the past two or three years. The rest of the world averages 0.27 per cent. That is a 1,000 per cent difference. It is not a 10 per cent or a 50 per cent difference; it is a 1,000 per cent difference! Every farming organisation and farming representative in this place should be screaming it from the rooftops on a daily basis—heaven only knows I tried to. If you have interest rates that are 1,000 per cent out of step with the rest of the world then clearly you are going to have a currency which is wildly overvalued. That value should be at US50c. That is not my opinion; that is the opinion of the international monetary markets. 


Mr Keating did something very good: he allowed the dollar to free float, and it went down to US49c. When Mr Costello came in he did a very good thing: he allowed the dollar to free float. These people advocate free markets. They both did the right thing. They were as good as their word; they came in and they allowed the dollar to free float. And it went to US52c. So, when the dollar was allowed to free float, it went to US49c and US52c, and then our terms of trade deteriorated disastrously from that point. We were running current account deficits of $10,000 million; we are now running a current account deficit of $60,000 million. That is creeping up to a significant percentage of the entire budget of the Australian government. 


Worldwide, the level of support for agriculture subsidies and tariffs is 41 per cent—you can get this information from the library or from the OECD website. Australia's was 4.5 per cent the last time the OECD released international figures. We have the Coles/Woolworth situation. No other country on earth has a situation like that. In America, the big two have a 23 per cent market share and the Americans are squealing blue murder. The big two here have somewhere over 85 per cent of the marketplace. We need collective bargaining. When it was taken away from us in the milk industry, in the sugar industry and in other industries, we were crucified. under collective bargaining in the year 2000 we were getting 59c for fresh milk in North Queensland. Our farmers are now being paid 48½c. 


Moving to ethanol, ethanol fixes up the cattle industry, the sugar industry and the beef industry. We would not need drought support if we had an ethanol— (Time expired)

Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (17:10):  I will eventually bring the discussion back to the Farm Household Support Bill 2014, which I have not heard a lot about in the last 15 minutes. I do want to take up what the member for Kennedy just said. He has raised some interesting points. He made reference to the contribution by the member for Wannon, who spoke earlier. Some of the statistics that the member for Kennedy just cited are true. Our agricultural sector certainly faces some serious challenges, and they are issues that we need to get right. 


The member for Kennedy challenged any member of parliament to give him a positive or an optimistic agricultural scenario. My electorate shares the challenges that he describes in the sector. One of the biggest private employers in my electorate is an abattoir. They certainly were very much harmed, as the industry was, by the live export ban. We saw cattle prices decrease significantly because of that.




Mr Katter:
  That helps the abattoirs.




Mr HOGAN:
  Well, it did not help them, because all the cattle that were supposed to be sold offshore moved south and, as they moved south, our market was inundated with cattle, which completely depressed our prices.



Mr Katter interjecting—




Mr HOGAN:
  It does, but it certainly did not help industry. I think that harmed the industry, and the drought certainly has not helped either. The positive story I have to share with the member is that they have been actively searching and finding new markets for their product. There have always been an exporter of their product. Almost 70 per cent of their product gets exported. For example, 18 months or two years ago China bought hardly any of their frozen boxed beef; it is now a significant buyer of their product. They are optimistic about their future. They are a cooperative. The cooperative is positive about their future. With rain—which I will get to in a minute in relation to this bill—they are very positive about what can happen when the restockers come back into that market.


The member for Kennedy mentioned the dairy industry. I have a dairy cooperative in my electorate, and they too are very optimistic. They have certainly faced challenges with the supermarket duopoly, which the member spoke about. But they too are positive, because just this month they accessed a new market in Asia, not just for dairy but for fresh milk. This is because of what is happening with some of the export protocols that we are dealing with, one of which relates to Korea, where tariffs on our agricultural products have been reduced. So, I say to the member: I hear you on some of the challenges faced by the agricultural industry, but there are positive stories out there. I certainly share the member for Wannon's optimism on agriculture. 


I do want to talk about the bill that we are supposed to be debating. I would like to share with the House a letter written by a dairy farmer in my electorate. It refers to the drought, an issue which makes this bill so important. It was written by Leigh Shearman, who is a member of the Far North Coast Dairy Industry Group, DIG, and I have Leigh's permission to share it with you. In writing to the manager of North Coast Local Land Services in Kempsey, Leigh states:


Dear Nicole


I am writing on behalf of the Far North Coast Dairy Industry Group, our group represents 145 dairy farmers from Murwillumbah through to Grafton. The situation is deteriorating with every week that passes and no rain in sight. With pasture growth now non-existent and with only very limited dairy farmers able to irrigate under their water sharing agreements. 


The cost of conserved fodder, which a majority of farmers are now totally reliant on, is escalating and very hard to locate. Corn crops that a lot of dairy farmers rely on for supplementary feeding when times are tight are only yielding very minimal returns, as is with a lot of silage crops. Dairy farmers are high grain purchasers and with the failed crops now really starting to push already high grain prices even higher the cost of production is rising beyond milk returns.


We cannot impress strongly enough that you keep dairy farmers in mind and act as quickly as possible to implement any support that is available. As most are aware dairy farmers are struggling financially under the cost of production and the climatic conditions are placing an enormous financial burden once again on an industry that is an important industry to our region.


If you would like further information I would be very happy to be of assistance.


That is a letter from a farmer who is obviously being affected by these climatic conditions.


Before going to the bill specifically, I would like to share a conversation that I had just recently with a person in my community, Anne Thomson from Eltham, who has supported drought appeals for 20 years and encouraged people to support people in drought, wherever the drought seems to be or where the money is needed. Obviously, there are times when there is no drought. She focuses on sending money, food and Christmas presents. She has no idea of how much, but she has raised tens of thousands of dollars over many years for drought affected people. An important point is that she often comments that the people giving that support are often pensioners, old people or people with very little income. They come along and see her every fortnight after they have received their fortnightly payment to give her a bit of money or a bit of food to share with people in drought. She has sent assistance in previous years to areas like the Riverina. This year she sending a lot to Brewarrina and Walgett and as far away as Lightning Ridge. One of her distributors, Betty, who lives between Moree and Mungindi, has been nominated for a senior citizen of the year award for distributing those gift parcels.


I wanted to start with those examples because they show two things for me: the real financial consequences of drought, as the letter from the dairy farmer showed, and the help that we see from everyday mums and dads trying to help people who need assistance. I think they are a good introduction to the fact that we as a government should also be providing some of that type of assistance.


One thing that I think we need to stress—and there have been a lot of conversations about this in relation to other industries—is the point that was made by the member for Parkes that this is not a handout; this is a hand up. This is not a structural problem for farmers. Our farmers, as was said, are some of the most efficient farmers in the world, and they have to be because we as a country give them very few subsidies. If you look at other countries around the world, they give huge subsidies to their agricultural producers—we have read about them and they have been well articulated in this place. We do not do that. We have made sure that our farmers are the best in the world because they have to be to survive. So this is not about a handout; this is about a hand up.


Climatic conditions are deteriorating as we speak. This bill, which introduces the farm household allowance, is a once-in-a-generation reform of government support. The timing is appropriate not just because of the drought but also because it is the International Year of Family Farming. We are also proposing this bill now because this cannot wait until 1 July when it was originally due to come in. It will replace the Farm Household Support Act, including provisions relating to the exceptional circumstances relief payment, and makes support much more responsive to farmers' financial hardship. It will provide time limited three-year payments and support for those eligible to improve their situation without the need for a climate trigger. The three-year support will provide farmers with time to plan for the future and to achieve financial security and self-reliance.


It includes a $2.55 million net farm assets test, which will be indexed, and off-farm and liquid asset threshold aligned with Newstart allowance, which excludes the principal home. This is higher than the mainstream assets limit in recognition that farm assets are relatively illiquid, especially—as you would appreciate, Deputy Speaker Mitchell—when these payments are needed and cannot be relatively drawn on for self-support. There is an income test consistent with Newstart allowance, but with a provision that means that off-farm income will not be regarded as income when it is used to pay interest to a bank or commercial lender. There are also provisions for automatic entitlement to a Health Care Card and waiting periods the same as social security payments.


There is support for the Department of Human Services to assess farmers and help them develop a financial improvement plan. I want to go into this in a little bit more detail later, but this is a really important part of this bill. It provides counselling, financial or otherwise. Farmers tend to be a fairly proud lot. They are obviously not employees; they are running their own business and are usually fiercely independent. So to ask for help, whether it be financial or otherwise, when they need it can sometimes be difficult. So part of this is to encourage that and to make access to that easier. It will also support farm families to educate their children. Parents receiving the allowance automatically meet income test provisions for the child's youth allowance.


Before I go into some of the details of the bill more in depth, I want to make a point because I was somewhat taken aback by the pessimism of the member for Kennedy's views on agriculture. I think we need to look at the positive contribution that it is making and the fact that, to my mind, it has great potential to grow. It generates now over $47 billion in gross value of production, so it is one of the main five pillars of our economy. Agricultural exports just last year were worth $38 billion. This is real money. This is money produced by the private sector, the agricultural sector. They are paying taxes. They are generating real wealth for this country, and I am very confident they will continue to do so.


Just in my region, the agricultural sector generates more than half a billion dollars, or about five per cent of our gross regional product, and employs directly over five per cent of the workforce. Most of these are small family-owned operations. I alluded to it before; there are some very positive stories out there in my community and I know they are replicated across the country. I have a dairy cooperative and a meat cooperative that have a positive story to sell. They are gaining access to new markets. They have new buyers who, come good weather, are going to push up prices, I believe, for many agricultural products. I have a blueberry farmer who is building quite an operation in my electorate who is very excited about his prospects of gaining access to markets in Asia and will employ—



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—




Mr HOGAN:
  We love blueberries. We realise that blueberries are a wonderful anti-oxidant and we encourage all agricultural products. We have some of the most efficient farmers in the world. We need to help them in this short-term period, while climatic conditions warrant it.


I will put on record some of the specifics of this bill. The interest rates on the new drought concessional loans will be set lower—that is 0.5 per cent below the interest rate for the farm concessional loans. The previous speaker was talking about interest rates; the interest rates under this will certainly be lower than they otherwise would be. There are things in there for counselling, both financial and otherwise. There is a review, as part of this, that looks at drought preparedness, because while you can not necessarily prepare for all droughts—especially one that, in some cases, has gone on for so long—there are certainly ways that we can improve what we do. This bill will help with that. The drought concessional loans are going to be available to drought affected farm businesses that have already taken steps to prepare for the effects of drought, but which with some financial assistance can do more.


I will finish on the topic of my optimism for this industry. Fifteen or twenty years ago, people were very critical of the mining industry in the sense that it did not negotiate hard enough. It was not getting good enough prices for its product. Back then there were the BHPs and, I think, it was Western Mining then, not Rio Tinto. Their main buyer back then—their sole buyer, really—was Japan. What happened was that we had a new buyer who came into the market and greatly increased the prices and the viability of that industry. I am very positive about the agricultural sector and I support this bill to help them over their short-term climatic conditions.




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Does the member claim to be misrepresented?




Mr Katter:
  Yes, I do, Mr Deputy Speaker. The previous speaker said that I had attributed this to the current federal government. That is not entirely true. I attributed it to this government and the previous government, but most of all to the Rural Action Council of North Queensland. They have developed the proposal and brought it forward and carried it by themselves for 10 years.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Speaker made it clear today that if we are going to have these, you should check the record and then come back and do it. That would be good.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (17:25):  I rise to support wholeheartedly the Farm Household Support Bill 2014. In doing so, I pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and my good friend the member for New England. He is a man who is extremely passionate about Australian agriculture, particularly passionate about family farms, and about ensuring that farming families can continue on into the future. We have heard some talk in the public sphere—notably Paul Howes, the head of the Australian Workers Union—that farming families are no longer needed in Australia, that the ma and pa families are something of the past. I am glad we have a Minister for Agriculture that does not subscribe to that view. Because the many farming families throughout my electorate of Dawson—farming families who are engaged in enterprises such as sugar, tomatoes, capsicums, fruits, vegetables and cattle—want to continue, and they want their farms to be handed down through the generations. This is something that is in the blood. I could not grow a lettuce actually, I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I come from a generation of cane farmers. Every time I see a stalk of sugar, I want to hug it. It is something that is in the blood. I salute our Minister for Agriculture, who recognises this and wants to protect farming families in Australia, and I look forward to seeing a lot more positive policies from the Abbott Liberal-National government and the Minister for Agriculture to help this sector and farming families.


The bill before us seeks to implement an income support payment for farmers and their partners who are in financial hardship. It is called the Farm Household Allowance. Australian history has been a rich narrative of tough people battling tough conditions. Our reputation as one of the best agricultural producers in the world is counterbalanced with bouts of droughts and floods. While the harsh conditions are nothing new to our farming families, they operate in a different environment to that of their forefathers. The great wealth that was once produced by family farms during good times helped tide families over during the bad times. The boom times are no longer the boom times of old, in some respects. Increased competition, more regulation and a cost base, escalating due to things such as the carbon tax, make farms much more vulnerable. It certainly does not help when governments decide to shut down things such as the live cattle trade overnight and without warning. It does not help, as I said, when the government imposes a carbon tax that actually impacts on trade exposed industries such as agriculture.


Right now, though, our farmers—especially those in western Queensland and western New South Wales—are battling what is quite clearly the worst drought in a century. And in response to these tough times the Abbott Liberal-National government is delivering a range of measures to assist these drought impacted farmers. The measures outlined in this bill provide for up to three years of income support for farming families without the need for a weather related trigger, and that is very important. The means test will provide more equitable treatment for people who lack sufficient means to support themselves. The assets test will be higher than mainstream limits, recognising that family farms—the actual farm asset itself—cannot be drawn upon for self-support as easily as can other types of assets.


I note that we are a signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that article 9 of the covenant talks about the right to social security. This is a case in point in relation to this government acting for a segment of the population: when everything goes to hell, there is not adequate support for them. Through these measures, we are making sure that the safety net is indeed there.


So the government stands ready to support those in our community who are most vulnerable through no choice or fault of their own—they are simply subject to the vagaries of the weather and, unfortunately, to government policy of the day, which can sometimes be deleterious on their enterprise as well. But our goal is to ensure long-term self-sufficiency in the agricultural sector, and to this end the legislation that is before us includes provisions for a farm financial assessment and requires allowance recipients to enter into a financial improvement agreement. That means that recipients of government funds through this measure will undertake education or training or even off-farm employment that will increase their capacity and ability to deal with the situation that is before them and, frankly, to keep the family farming tradition alive in this country. When applicants meet those eligibility requirements they can gain access to further benefits, such as the health care card, the telephone allowance, remote area allowance, the clean energy supplement, pharmaceutical allowance and rent assistance. So, there is a range of different benefits that derive from this legislation.


The Farm Household Support Bill provides an income support payment for farmers that aligns with social security laws that exist in other areas, where that is possible. As a Liberal-National coalition government we want to ensure that farming families are treated fairly and that they have access to the same benefits and services that other families facing difficult circumstances have access to. For families who are living outside of the city, access to a whole range of services becomes something of a problem. Isolated families do not have things like regular waste collection services. They do not have access to community libraries. They do not have access to adequate sporting facilities, parks and recreational areas or even business facilities that we take for granted even in small country towns. As much as these things impinge upon lifestyle, it is far more serious when farming families reach the point where they have difficulty in just putting food on the table. When things are truly, truly tough, it is our responsibility as a nation to ensure that help is there. We do not want these families to feel they are completely cut off, with no hope for the future. Too many farmers have been in a position where they cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we must do whatever we can to provide that light at the end of the tunnel—to provide, as I said before, an adequate safety net.


And I hope that we go further than just that. I hope that we are able to go further very soon in this parliament, and remove other impediments to the agricultural sector, such as the carbon tax, which I know equates to about $20,000 per farmer in the sugar industry. I hope we can actually pass reforms that get rid of all the red tape and regulation surrounding the process of registering agricultural chemicals. Here I must commend the parliamentary secretary, the member for Kooyong, for the work he has done in this field, because it will be of tremendous value to farmers right across the nation. The red tape introduced by the last government was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing, and the repeal of that red tape will put useful tools and agricultural chemicals on the farms quicker and at a cheaper cost. If there is one thing we want to do, it is to make life easier for these people on the land who are going through such terribly trying circumstances right now. We need to let these farming families know they are not forgotten. We need to let them know that we are going to help them through their darkest times. We need to let them know that we are going to help them to build a brighter future.


My electorate is a narrow strip of coastal North Queensland. It is about 400 kilometres that stretches from Mackay through to Townsville. It is a very agricultural electorate, taking in the largest sugar-producing region in the country. But it also has other agricultural, pastoral and horticultural industries; in fact, would you believe that Bowen—so famous for its mangoes—also produces two-thirds of Australia's winter tomato crop? That is the kind of electorate I come from—a very, very strong agricultural electorate. I have to say that, being on the coastline, my electorate enjoys a higher and more consistent rainfall—particularly after a cyclone comes along. But we have been in drought before. Coastal areas also suffer drought, but not for long, and not as harsh as those who are out in western Queensland and north-western New South Wales have had to go through. Our hearts go out to people who battle those dry conditions, day in and day out, sometimes for years on end. Australia has always held very romantic notions of the bush and the battler, despite the fact that most of us now live in urban area, probably just a few minutes walk from a local cafe, or a hairdresser, or a hardware store. However, the strong connection and affection for farmers and rural communities comes to the fore whenever our sunburnt country is in the grip of droughts, flooding rains, or bushfires.


When times are tough, people stretch out their hand and offer help. We like to think we all do—but in some cases we see situations where people are kicked when they are down. I have to note once more my disbelief that the green movement is coming together next week—in the middle of the harshest drought we have seen in a long time, while farmers are reeling from it, and from government policies—to promote vegetarianism and veganism to the entire nation with Meat Free Week. They want to encourage people not to eat meat for a week. That is why I have launched my counter proposal, the 'free meat week', where I am encouraging Aussies—and the member for Wright might get into it—to support Aussie farmers by putting on a barbie and shouting some free meat to their neighbours and mates. We need to stand up to this green movement, which kicks our farmers while they are down.


When times are tough, people who are real, genuine and compassionate stretch out their hand. Right now, times are very tough for our farmers. It is time for this government, in a bipartisan manner, to reach out a hand and deliver fairness, equity and a fair go to the people who put food on our tables. With those words I commend the bill to the House.

"Pasin, Tony, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (17:39):  I rise today to speak on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. I do so as a proud representative of the farming communities in Barker. I was privileged to have a rural upbringing, and I continue to take an active interest in my families farming enterprise around Mount Gambier. That is a part of the south-east of South Australia that, thankfully, enjoys some of the most reliable seasons of any agricultural district in the nation—although, as we saw cruelly in years like 2006, we are far from immune to drought.


Barker, however, is a diverse electorate—64,000 square kilometres of diversity. Today in my electorate we are experiencing extremely dry conditions throughout the Mallee. So, while, thankfully, the current situation seems confined, tragically, the spectre of drought for those in Northern Queensland and New South Wales—just as it is in areas such as my electorate.


When financial hardship can strike more assured farm communities such as those in my electorate, as it has done in recent years—especially among local dairy farmers—we are reminded of the threat of more widespread drought in other areas of Australia. I have always believed that it is the responsibility of a good government to strike the right balance when it comes to exceptional circumstances. I think it is important to have a system in place to support those farmers who are experiencing extraordinary hardship, and provides them with the assistance they require for their livelihoods to be sustained with dignity and into the future.


I am proud to represent an electorate that makes a significant contribution to Australia's agricultural industry each year. It is a sector that, as other speakers have pointed out, generates over $47 billion of revenue nationally, in terms of gross value of production. Farmers throughout Barker contribute disproportionately to the nation's farm exports, amounting to total sales of approximately $38 billion in the last year alone. This income is absolutely vital to our entire economy, but particularly in regional communities such as those throughout Barker. When those sales literally dry up, due to tough seasonal conditions, our farmers need the support of the Australian government to ensure they survive the bad times, so that they can quickly thrive and capitalise when seasonal and market conditions improve.


Like others in this House, I have a bullish view of the future of the agricultural sector in Australia, and particularly for the agricultural sector in Barker. But one of the greats risks is the concept of generational farming. We need to ensure that farming is both profitable and attractive for the next generation of farmers that I hope, as I am sure the member for Mallee hopes, will come along with us on the extraordinary journey we are on in this place. I am very pleased that the coalition, through these measures, are doing everything that they can to encourage and assist farmers to adopt best practise farm management techniques and smarter business management strategies, so they can grow and adapt in the face of uncertain seasons and ongoing economic challenges.


We must also acknowledge that periods of extreme difficulty can be caused by a number of different factors and, importantly, this bill confirms the coalition's commitment to introducing a new Farm Household Support Payment to those in need of financial assistance. That is an important point. This is a needs based system. In the absence of the member for Grey, I must say as a regional representative from South Australia that, contrary to some of the media speculation early in this debate, this is a measure that will address the hardship being experienced by those farmers in northern South Australia. The member for Grey represents South Australia's pastoralists, in particular the ones who produce livestock in those areas, and this measure is available to them. That was done in response to approaches to myself, the member for Grey, and the Minister of Agriculture, by organisations including Livestock SA.


It is important to acknowledge the bipartisan way in which these changes have been supported thus far. I commend the members on the other side of the chamber for working with the government to implement these important changes. Nonetheless, I know there are those that have been critical of the coalition's commitment to provide this kind of assistance to farming families in need. To be honest, I think anyone who does not support this kind of package either is trying to play politics with this very important issue or has a shameful lack of appreciation for the agricultural sector and food production in particular.


I think it is clear that these measures will address many issues faced by farmers in drought, including rising debt levels, the capacity to make household payments, limited water for livestock, personal stress and the management of pest animals. This is reflected in the way that industry has welcomed these changes since they were announced in February.


In looking for a moment at the bill in more detail, I note that the farm household allowance provides: three cumulative years of income support for farmers and their partners in hardship without the need for a climatic trigger; a $2.55 million net farm assets test where the principal home is excluded; an income test consistent with Newstart allowance but with a provision that will allow off-farm income to be disregarded as income where it is used to pay interest to a commercial lender; automatic entitlement to a healthcare card; waiting periods consistent with social security payments; support from a Department of Human Services case manager to help assess a recipient's situation, develop financial improvement agreements and then fund activities set out in the agreement; and a compliance framework to ensure obligations are met to address fraudulent activity. Of course, it is important not to lose in this debate the very significant stress placed on farmers in drought conditions. As someone who has worked with a disproportionate number of people in my previous professional life who suffered mental health conditions, can I say we must never forget that at these times of high stress.


I know that the relief package was a major topic for discussion when I hosted the Minister for Agriculture in my electorate of Barker on 18 and 19 February in advance of this announcement. We met with a number of livestock producers and mixed with farmers from throughout the south-east and even parts of western Victoria, represented so well by the member for Wannon. The late Tuesday afternoon at the Mt Gambier saleyards, where preparations were being made for the following morning's weekly prime cattle, sheep and lamb market, was a very suitable backdrop for a discussion about the relief package, which had only just come to significant media attention. We know that the physical markets are nearly always still the best barometer for how the livestock industry is travelling during these tough times of drought. Even though the seasonal conditions that we speak of are far away in northern New South Wales and Queensland, they still impact on the markets in the south. It is a consistent reminder of how all Australian farmers are so closely linked together within this industry, no matter how many thousands of kilometres separate us.


At that gathering we had members of a number of significant primary industry organisations, including Mr Andrew Ogilvie, who is President of the Cattle Council of Australia and a local beef producer. We also had in attendance the President of Livestock SA, Mr Richard Halliday, and the Vice President, Mr Jack England—both of whom are also south-east farmers. I was also pleased to welcome the Mackillop Farm Management Group Chairman, Mr Duan Williams, and his deputy, Mr David Farley. The Mackillop group is an exceptional regional-based producer network that is independent and proactive, and develops innovative and sustainable farming practices through research and extension for the benefit of primary producers in the south-east. They are very much a can-do organisation.


The relief package was also of interest the following day when the minister and I travelled to Renmark in the northern parts of my electorate. There we met with the Riverland wine grape and citrus growers, who know, unfortunately all too well, about drought. It was an interesting discussion regarding the government's relief package. With such informed groups, I know the minister enjoyed the positive feedback he received during his time in Barker. I was very pleased to help facilitate these discussions because I think it is important that primary producers in my electorate know that Australia has a federal agriculture minister who knows his way around a set of cattle yards and is at ease surrounded by farmers. What a welcome change it is to those of us in rural Australia with an interest in farming that we have a minister who is actually passionate about agriculture. The feedback we received on our tour was positive. Just as encouraging has been the ongoing discussion that I have been having with primary producers in Barker about the government relief package.


Farming families and industry groups are grateful that the federal government is genuinely committed to ensuring regional communities are not    abandoned at this time of crisis. I, too, am grateful that our Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture have put a suite of measures on the table which offer an updated financial, social and mental health support framework for those in greatest need. I echo the sentiments of the National Farmers' Federation President, Brett Finlay, who I understand was in the building earlier today. He has said that the government's relief package announced demonstrates that the coalition government is listening to the farming community. I think Mr Finlay was spot-on when he described the package as being both fiscally responsible and considerate of circumstances suffered by rural communities in many parts of Australia. I also concur with Mr Finlay's commendation of the minister for his continued efforts as a champion for Australian agriculture.


I believe this bill is the cornerstone of the coalition's commitment to supporting family families through difficult times and investing in the growth of a profitable and globally competitive agricultural sector. This is important because, as others have said in this place, it will rain again; and, when it does, we need to be ready to take advantage of that situation.


That is why I am proud to be a member of the coalition government and proud that we have introduced this bill into the parliament. This bill reinforces the federal government's support for the Australian food and fibre producers and, more broadly, for our nation's rural and regional economies. As such, I commend it to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (17:52):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Bill 2014 and Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014 this evening in the chamber. Before I speak directly to the bill, it would be remiss of me not to take charge of some of the comments that came from the other side of the House during this debate.


Members opposite took the opportunity to burnish their credentials, claiming that pricing carbon was a good thing for our farming sector. I was speaking with an irrigator only last Saturday, and when he opened his power bill he was physically sick as he looked at the escalating cost of him doing business in the agriculture sector. Can you imagine what stress that has on a family's mindset? Can you imagine what pressure it puts on the family budget? I challenge anyone in this place to think of the last time they opened a bill and their immediate response was to be violently ill. To come to this place and claim that pricing carbon is a wonderful aspiration for the agriculture sector is fundamentally flawed. It is playing a crippling role.


We heard comments from the crossbench that it was ridiculous that Australia could be the food bowl for Asia. Members from the crossbench, who have spent more than 27 years in parliament, whether it be in state parliament or in this place, are part of the problem. It is those who sit on the crossbench who decide. Go back and look at their years of experience. When they came to the parliament, state or federal, farm input costs were up to six times lower. When those members of the crossbench came in here and said there was not a future in agriculture and scoffed at the coalition when we said that there was, the average cattle property in his electorate would have had 10 full-time workers on it. Today in his electorate, the average workforce on a property would be mum, dad and the odd contractor that would come in on an annual basis.


Input costs are crippling our sector, whether it be through petroleum costs, labour costs or seed costs. We say that we are a smart nation, but a John Deere harvester in America is $400,000. We were at parity with the US dollar not too long ago, and the exact same machine here was $800,000. Why? It is the crossbenchers who have overseen that and then dared to come in and criticise the coalition when we came in and put up packages to assist this sector.


I am proud of the sector in my electorate. We have the Lockyer Valley with Gatton, Laidley and Forest Hill. In addition we have Beaudesert, the Fassifern Valley with Boonah, Harrisville and Peak Crossing, and, to the south-east, Canungra and Beechmont. Each one of those communities relies heavily on the success of the agriculture sector, whether it be beef, dairy or horticulture. When one of my farmers is doing well, they are in town buying new stock or product.


A typical farming business in my electorate is a family business by the name of Dovers and Son. They are third generation and openly saying it is as tough as they have ever seen. And it is tough. We were affected by the live cattle export trade debacle that we saw introduced by the other side of the House and supported by the Greens; but, as a result, when those northern cattle no longer had an export market, they were forced into our southern markets, so our traditional prices that we would have got took a beating.


Our dairy industry is on its knees at the hands of the duopolies of the processors that they sell their milk to. When you go to the processors and put them under the pump, they will make it absolutely clear that the pressure is being screwed on them on the back of dollar-milk processing. In Queensland I now have less than 500 dairy farmers when 10 years ago there were 2,500. It is a bleak future. I have stood in this place and spoken about the dairy industry many times before, saying that I cannot fix this industry with a single piece of legislation for a mandatory code of conduct. There needs to be in the dairy sector in my electorate a muscling up on the processors and demanding a better price for the product at the farm gate. The retailers understand the value of the price of milk; they strategically place it at the back of the store so that you have to walk past all their other product lines to go and get it. They understand the value of milk. They use it as a cost leader to get people in the door so they can take advantage of the market.


I have the seventh-most-fertile valley in the world in the Lockyer Valley, which is situated right next door to the Fassifern Valley. The Lockyer Valley produce is sent to vegetable markets in all major cities and contributes around $250 million worth of product each year just from that area. Next-door, still within my electorate, the Scenic Rim is dominated by agriculture, contributing about $196 million and $13.6 million of the gross regional product of the Scenic Rim. Agriculture is also the largest employer within the Scenic Rim, employing a total of about 1,400 people, or 13.7 per cent of the region's workforce.


The thing that unites my agricultural sector, whether it be dairy, beef or horticulture, is rising debt. A quick synopsis: roughly, if you bought a place in the electorate about 10 years ago you would have paid around $5 million for it. Your debt ratio would have always been skewed at around 50 per cent. Over the last 10 years, the value of your property would have gone from $5 million to $10,000,000. So as a result, your debt ratio at 50 per cent went from $2½ million to $5 million as the price escalated. You have a debt of $5 million on a valuation of $10 million.


In recent years, on the back of the drought and the poor policy decisions by the previous government, the value of land has come back. We have properties now that were worth $10 million but, if pushed for a fire sale, today they would be worth around $6 million—but they are still carrying a $5 million debt. So they are way outside their 50 per cent loan ratio and that is why we as a government are here today introducing the Farm Household Support Bill 2014. We are doing our share in lifting up and trying to help this sector back to prosperity.


There is a responsibility for our banks, who rode the wave of prosperity, who saw the opportunity to lend to the market, who saw the opportunity with rising valuations and who saw that it was a safe bet with security if things went sour, that their money would be secure. So I say that there is a role for our major banks in being part of the solution. There is a future in the agricultural sector in Australia; there is a future in the dairy industry, there is a future in the beef industry and there is a future in the horticulture industry. If you listen to the crossbenchers they will tell you that there is not. Evidence to support my case, that there is a future in this sector, is that when a place worth over $200 million wants to get sold there is a kilometre-long line of international buyers standing and waiting to come to Australia to invest into this sector because they see the future benefit. Why do they see the future benefit and why do they see Australia as a safe bet to invest in? Because we are the smartest in the world. We are the most efficient farmers in the world. We have the most initiative, and we are the most intuitive farmers in the world. We will continue to be because we have to be.


I have a local family in the dairy industry, the Dennis family. They said, 'No more, I am not accepting the processors price.' They pulled a couple of million dollars and did a partnership deal with some friends, some family and some banks. They set up their own bottling plant and they are now distributing their milk, Scenic Rim 4Real Milk brand, to over 200 outlets in the south-east corner. That is the initiative. That is the intuition that inspires us as a nation—that singular type of operator.


As a government, the producers are not looking to us for a handout. They just want us to get out of their way. These are our people; the agriculture sector are our people. Just as the unions are linked at the hip to the Australian Labor Party, the agriculture sector are our people. When we cut ourselves they bleed. The agricultural sector believes in the same political ideologies of freedom, of free market, the values of family and the values of Christianity. These people are the true quintessentials who have made Australia what it is. They need to be looked after—they are our future.


At lunch on Saturday, again, I was disappointed when I heard a grown man tell me that he is spending nearly $20,000 a week on feed to keep his stock alive at his property west of Longreach. He has three kids coming through and I said, 'Do you want the kids to take over the place?' He said, 'Not a chance. This is killing me. There is no way I want my kids to do that.' And he said, 'Do you know what? However tough it is, I will get out of this. I will be better for it.' Then he said, 'I know it is not the right thing. I do not want to push my kids into it. But I know that they will live here. My parents lived here. I lived here. My kids will live on this place.'


There is a sense of pride in the bush. There is a sense of achievement. As a coalition government we need to lock arms with this sector and ride with them for the next 10 years, in conjunction with the banks; by writing good policy and by making sure that we do everything in our power to reduce these horrific input costs. Every day that we have breath in ourselves, we should remember that there are people out there at the moment opening their energy bills and who are being physically sick—ill—because they have no idea how they are going to meet those costs. I thank you for your indulgence, and I commend the bill.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-03-18,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (18:06):  It is a great privilege to speak on the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014 today. Almost 10 per cent of my electorate work directly in agriculture, and many more work indirectly in the sector, so any legislation impacting on agriculture is of great interest to me. It is also of interest to me as a fifth-generation farmer myself.


A traditional feature of agriculture, and indeed small business more generally, is that the household and the business are often one and the same. To understand how we might best help farm households we need to talk first about farm businesses and how we might support them in the coming years.


It is unfortunate that the last government never understood agriculture, the opportunities it presents and the policy framework we need to put in place to make it succeed. We saw a raft of policy failures, and more about that in a moment. On this side of the House we understand—and many other speakers who have come before me have said the same thing—that agriculture stands on the edge of the greatest opportunity we have seen in decades and perhaps even centuries. Many seem to not understand this point. Yes, this opportunity is not getting through to the bottom line for many farmers for reasons that I will explain, but some other members, like the member for Kennedy, need to get out a bit more into our export markets to see what is really happening out there. These are strong words, but let me explain.


In 2005 I began work on a project in Western Australia. I was working with the largest iron ore producer in Australia trying to understand the impact that Asian demand was having and was going to have on its business. The results of the work were absolutely staggering. China had suddenly realised that self-sufficiency in iron ore was no longer realistic. Its thirst for our exports that followed was growing by the day and prices began their extraordinary journey from $20 a tonne to $200 a tonne. We talk now about how terrible it is that the iron ore price has got to $100 a tonne, but it is still five times higher than it was before the Chinese surge began. Meanwhile it became clear in this case that a business producing just over 100 million tonnes a year could be producing over 300 million tonnes in 10 years time. Most of the management team of this organisation fell over laughing, but the prediction proved correct.


Then in 2008 many, including me, began to apply the same approach to understand agricultural demand. The results were similarly staggering. Not only would population drive growth in demand for our food and fibre but far more importantly rising income would change diets in the most fundamental ways. As people get wealthier their calorie consumption rises—sometimes to their great regret—and, more importantly, the make-up of those calories changes too. As we get wealthier we eat fewer carbohydrates and more proteins, fruit, vegetables, oils and sugars. That in itself is interesting, but the story gets better for our farmers.


The land and water required for those calories is increasing at a remarkable pace as more and more people enter the global middle class and as the land and water requirements for more intensive proteins increase. To put this in perspective: two-thirds of the growth in the world is now in poorer, developing countries, as against just one-third a decade ago. So where is that land and water coming from to meet this need? The clear answer is: nowhere. For all practical purposes there is no new land and water to access and we will probably lose a lot of it to agriculture in the coming years. So the problem can be solved only by producing more with less—higher productivity—and not just more of anything but more of the right foods and the right fibre. Oilseeds, fresh fruit and veg, proteins and even sugar are the foods that will see the greatest gains.


Already this is having a big impact on global prices for many products. In the summer season just passed we saw extraordinary prices for fresh fruit and veg in countries to our north. They are prices that we are not yet accessing but they are extraordinary prices and markets nonetheless. Global dairy prices, not local ones, have reached new highs in recent years and oilseeds are being imported into China at unprecedented rates. The global markets for lamb and even beef have never looked so good, despite what is happening locally. Despite all this good news, only last week I hosted a forum for farmers in Goulburn and heard about the continuing cost-price squeeze that our farmers face.


So with all this good news why aren't we seeing greater farm profitability and greater farm prosperity? The answer is sobering. For a start, our competitiveness has suffered badly from a high dollar that has been exacerbated by extraordinary public spending in recent years. Any resource economist will tell you that the first thing you should do when you have a resources boom is save government money to take pressure off interest rates and take pressure off the currency, but our Treasurer at the time, the member for Lilley, decided to run a grand experiment by doing the exact opposite and spending money as fast as he could. At the end of the day who can stand between the Labor Party and a wasteful public spending agenda?


But the problem was worse. When a great opportunity in the marketplace presents itself, the key is to get access to new markets. So the government did the opposite again. They started shutting down export markets. The most successful agricultural market in the last 20 years was the live export market. The former government, in its infinite wisdom, decided to shut the market down. We have to remember that, despite what the member for Kennedy would have us believe, the bulk of our agricultural sectors are export focused and have been for almost 200 years. To make matters worse the last government made no progress on accessing new valuable markets. While the Kiwis managed to get a free trade agreement with China, which is now powering their economy through dairy exports, we got nothing. That is why we announced within months of getting into government an agreement with Korea and why we will continue to work hard on Japan and, perhaps most importantly, China.


But agriculture needs more than just markets; it needs secure access to water and land. The Labor Party got to work on this one with its appalling Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Instead of looking at innovations to save water and use it better for environmental purposes, the ALP went for the lazy answer of taking water from agriculture. Meanwhile, agricultural education and R&D have suffered badly. We saw a reallocation of money to green research and education. The focus was taken away from productivity. But I guess when you are married to the Greens that is what you do. Farm extension services, the lifeblood of farm productivity, have gone the same way, with a shift from a productivity focus to an environmental focus. All farmers understand sustainability and understand that profitability is a prerequisite for sustainability. Throughout all of this, our supply chains had suffered from a policy vacuum. We stepped in to deal with the proposed Archer Daniels Midland purchase because there is limited competition in our grain ports and an ineffective regulatory framework. Grain is not the only industry where this is true. We know there are problems to solve in the sugar industry and in parts of the meat and dairy industries. 


Farm finance has also suffered from a policy vacuum. As farm debt levels climbed from $30 billion to over $70 billion, there was no debate in this country about how we would finance the next generation of farmers into this wonderful industry. These younger farmers should not just be the sons and daughters of current landowners. Instead, we want to follow the New Zealand example of finding ways to bring new blood into our industries. At the end of the day, the owner-operator, the family farm, will remain the heart of our farming industries; but that owner-operator will need to have its business partners to succeed. 


Into this context, the coalition is determined to take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities we currently face in agriculture, opportunities that others dismiss. We are re-establishing the live export trade. We are opening up new markets in Asia, both through increased market access and also through enhanced biosecurity. We are focusing on delivering more water in the Murray-Darling Basin for both agriculture and the environment. We are putting more money into R&D. We are focused on helping farmers to reduce their costs through reduced energy prices, reduced red tape and less government borrowings to take pressure off interest rates and our currency. Our agricultural white paper is the first serious look at the broader policy framework for agriculture for many years. The paper will look hard at many of the issues I have already talked about, including agricultural finance, education, R&D and supply chains.


But we also need to support those suffering from the ravages of years of poor policy combined with harsh seasons. Coalition policy will never focus on propping up failing businesses, but it will focus on helping out households facing impossible circumstances. My first significant memories of drought were in the early 1980s. When lying on the ground, I could shoot rabbits hundreds of metres away without a blade of grass between me and the rabbit. That was bad news for the rabbit but worse news for us as farmers. The stress on families in these periods of drought is enormous, and I saw it in my own family. I prayed for rain constantly, if only to relieve those family pressures, let alone the business pressures.


I am pleased that both sides of the House support this legislation. I acknowledge the commitment of the member for Hunter for supporting many of our agricultural policies. He understands the flaws of past policies, and the serious need to move away from the mistakes of recent years. There are many aspects of this legislation before the House that show a deep insight into modern agriculture, farming businesses and farm households. We understand that the asset threshold that would trigger this assistance needs to be relatively high, and exclude the family home. That is why we have set the asset trigger at over $2.5 million and rising with the CPI. Selling down a farm business in a drought is a disastrous financial outcome, and a policy that forces such a sale would be poor policy indeed. We also recognise that off-farm income is often used to keep farm businesses going, but we should not discriminate against those who are earning that off-farm income. The legislation recognises this.


While my electorate is not suffering from drought in the way that many other regions are, there are areas of great hardship. This legislation recognises that farmers can face this hardship, even in areas that are not in what we might traditionally call drought-declared. Our agricultural policy is focused on helping farmers to be self-reliant, including in drought. Farmers want their businesses to succeed without government support. That is our focus, and the focus of this legislation. Only when self-reliance is impossible should the government step in. That is also the focus of this legislation.


This is an extraordinary time for agriculture. In 1788, when Europeans first arrived in Australia, they could not have known that in a few short decades this new country would become an agricultural powerhouse, building enormous prosperity on the back of exports to England. We currently face an opportunity of similar magnitude. We will not get there unless we provide the right policy framework and the right support to our farmers, in their times of greatest need. I commend this legislation to the House.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2014-03-18,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (18:19):  Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak on the Farm Household Support (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. This becomes the second iteration of a drought policy. I took the first part through the cabinet and the parliament at the end of last year. That allowed the movement of tens of millions of dollars into drought affected areas and also allocated $10 million towards water infrastructure. At that point, we hoped and prayed that we would get rain and the issues would be alleviated. Of course, that was not the case. This brought us to the position where we had the second iteration, of which this is a crucial part. 


Prior to this, we had the transitional farm family payment. The trouble with that transitional farm family payment was that it was not accessible to enough people to deal with their financial trauma. In many instances we had people who had no access to money whatsoever, none. They were actually ruled out from having access to social security by reason of the asset test. When the asset test comes to a position of $1.5 million and you have a property worth $3 million, which is not unusual nowadays, with debts of $1 million without any real desire for the bank to go any further than that—they actually were outside the assets test. What does this mean? The differentiation for them is that we had houses with no money going into them at all. They did not get Newstart; they were not allowed to get Newstart. They had no access to income from the farm because they were in drought. They could not just close the gate and walk out the door because you are actually bound by law for the maintenance of your stock and other vital components of the farm. 


No matter which side of the chamber you are on and who you are, there is something inside you that says something has to happen, that this is not right; that our fellow Australians and fellow Australian families should not be put in this sort of condition. When you get to an area you can see that sort of pall of depression and darkness that falls over people as they say: 'Well I cannot see a way out. I cannot even clean up the accounts in town. I cannot go to town because I am a bad debt. If I go to town, how do I pay for my fuel? How do I clear the chemist account? How do I deal with all these other things about which people say, 'That doesn't happen in Australia'. Well it does. There is no more vital sign of misery in our nation that we refuse to see than rural misery, where people live in a diminished condition. Not only that, these people live in a diminished condition miles away from the benevolence of the government that is apparent in the multiple hospitals and schools that you would see in larger urban settings. 


I said that at the start because it is very important that people clearly identify the difference between doing it tough in the country and doing it tough in other parts. I am not saying for one moment that there are not people in  the western suburbs of the major cities, or in other areas, who are doing it tough as well. This is a particularly cruel form where not only are you without your regular income stream, which is tenuous on many occasions by reason of the fact that is it is related to the vagaries of the weather, but also you are taken away from any social security settings. It is vitally important that we immediately change this. 


I commend the support of the coalition and the Prime Minister and the support of the opposition in saying that, on this occasion, people on either side of the political divide are not going to let this human misery continue. So what this legislation allows people to take the limit from 1.5 to 2.55 million and their house is exempt as well. Exempting your house, your primary domicile, probably gets you close to a $3 million net asset limit. If you go away contract harvesting, if you go away working on the road or if you go doing some work in one of the mines, it allows you to earn up to $80,000, provided that your interest bill is bigger than that because we know that, when the money turns up, the banks will just hoover it up and send it straight off to fix them up. At least, it allows you some sort of mechanism to earn some external income. This allows off-farm assets for a couple, for partners, of about  $280,000 as well. All in all, it is a good outcome.


I have had some people say it was rushed. The member for Moreton said it was rushed. It was not actually. He should be aware of his own government's position. The first time we started reviewing this was in 2008. On this issue, we are bringing forward and adjusting the settings, but the overall scheme is something that we have been looking at for some time. It is part of a process of dealing with the issues of drought into the future. We will have other settings in other parts, to which we wish to ensure people will get access. We will make sure that people will get access to $280 million at four per cent, or a million dollars or 50 per cent of the facility, whichever is the lesser, so that people can have access to money. It is not part of these bills but, in similar settings, is part of the drought package. That gives people access to money to replant, to restock, to try to get cash flows moving again. 


I will be happy to say the interim farm household allowance is currently working under executive orders. What we are talking about is the settings as of 1 July. I suppose people are wondering, if we are talking about this legislation now, how on earth are people are getting access to it? It is happening under executive orders. I want to remind people that we already have about 83 claims that are true. So 83 families now have access to this scheme, which is uncapped. Whoever is out there in need and is listening, this scheme is uncapped. You will get access to it if you fit the criteria. We are seeing right now that people are doing precisely that—they are fitting the criteria. Before with the interim farm family payment, when I went to some towns only one person in the whole town it. It was not really ticking the box.


We have also had some other discussions. With the greatest respect, there was one where the member for  Hunter asked for clarification about the costs associated with the farm household allowance and the $99.4 million that was agreed to by the Labor government in 20013-14 as the cost of the allowance over the forward estimates. This included $37.3 million for the Department of Human Services to administer the allowance. Of this 30 million was set aside in 2013-14 to build a dedicated IT system to support the payment and for case management of the allowance. Again, this was the setting put in place by the former Labor government. The member for Hotham brought up that her husband's family was associated with the dairy industry and noted that the scoping meetings—they are not happening any more—would bring an end to civilisation as we know it. We will still have as required—




Mr Albanese:
  Move on, Senator!




Mr JOYCE:
  It is good to see the member for Grayndler, from the large rural seat of Grayndler! I noticed that St Mary's Cathedral is right next to Hyde Park.




Mr Albanese:
  Libya Hill—say thank you and move on, Senator!




Mr JOYCE:
  Lucky we got the money back for that. 




Mr Albanese:
  Just say thank you and move on.




Mr JOYCE:
  I would say thank you if you had left any money in the bank, but you did not; we had to go and find it.




Mr Albanese:
  That is nonsense and you know.




Mr JOYCE:
  You should ask me more questions. Why don't you ask me some more questions? It was very important that we recognised that we can actually have meetings, if people want them. We will be having meetings from time to time and I envisage that we will be having a meeting in the very near future to deal with, among other things, working out a national approach for fruit fly.


Agriculture in Australia is vitally important. There is no better example than what happened in January. This nation thought we were going to have a $100 million loss for the month but we ended up with a $1.4 billion surplus. The member for Hunter, who is sitting beside the member for Grayndler, will be able to tell him exactly where that came from. Predominantly it was driven by agriculture. This goes to show that agriculture puts money on the table to pay its way. How did we get that money on the table? We harvested $17.2 million worth of wheat in Western Australia—we got in excess of six million tonnes of wheat onto boats—and we had the live cattle trade, with those terrible people in the live cattle trade putting all that cattle onto boats, getting paid for it and helping our nation get back into profit. We also had all those terrible people in the live sheep trade, getting paid for putting sheep on boats and bringing money back into the country. It is great when we get these trades going again because that is how we turn a buck. When you are making a buck you do not need the Farm Household Support Bill, because you are making money. But, if you have got a drought and you are doing it tough, these are the sorts of policy settings you need. Our minds are always directed towards how we can turn a profit and how we can take the agricultural future of our nation forward. That is why I am also very encouraged by the support we are getting for the white paper. 


The white paper is going to be a seminal document. It is going to increase the capacity of all those people throughout the agricultural sector to have their say in where our nation is going. It will make sure those people will be able to make their contribution on how we get a fair return back to the farm gate; how we can get a better return back to the mums and dads, back to the kitchen table, back to the people who are putting the cattle on the boats and paying their way in our nation, back to the people putting the wheat on the boats and paying their way in our nation, back to the people who are working under the belief that, even with the vagaries of the weather, they are doing the right and proper thing by creating the food and creating the fibre which feeds people and which clothes people—I cannot think of a more honourable life; that would have to be one of the best. These people deserve our support and I hope that will stem from the white paper. I think that this hope is not in vain. There will be a good sense of bipartisanship as we try to make sure that we create settings ensuring that long after I have gone, the member for Hunter has gone and other people have left there is a document that can be taken forward—




Mr Albanese:
  Who do you reckon will be here the longest?




Mr JOYCE:
  I do not know. The way I am going, probably you. We will have a document that can be taken forward. It is something similar to a defence policy, so people know roughly where you are coming from and how it is going to work. I know that this is basically non-contro apart from the expected couple of jibes that you always get on an issue like this. We have something later on that is going to be slightly more contro—we will see how it goes—and that concerns the re-registration of chemicals. Maybe that will liven the place up a bit. I thank those in the chamber for their attention.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:49):  Australia has a second-to-none record of aviation safety of which we as a nation should be proud. That record is the envy of the rest of the world. It is mainly due to the diligence of the nation's airlines and the professionalism of the men and women who are responsible for aviation safety in all sections of the aviation industry, including our engineers, our air traffic controllers and all those who work in the aviation sector in Australia. This record also says something about the mature approach taken by both sides of politics to aviation safety and regulations.


Governments of either political persuasion have always taken a non-partisan approach to aviation safety, and that is entirely appropriate. In fact, it is something that we should be proud of. We will have our arguments over many issues in this chamber, but when it comes to regulatory standards in the aviation sector—which injects about $7 billion into the national economy and is a critical part of the success of our tourism industry—it is important that we engage in mature debate on those issues. Hence, Labor will support this legislation on the basis that the government is essentially putting forward an expansion of the CASA board by two members. The opposition does not necessarily see the need to increase the size of the CASA board; however, given the minister has asked for this to happen, because it is an issue related to aviation safety it is something that we will give the minister the benefit of the doubt on.


The Minister for Transport says that he wishes to increase the breadth of expertise on the board, and I would certainly encourage him to ensure that the appointments to the board are made on that basis rather than on any political considerations. The Minister for Transport says that this will allow the government to implement its vision for CASA. It is important that the opposition of the day supports the government wherever it can in areas of aviation safety, and I certainly intend to do so, as does the Australian Labor Party in this parliament.


We live on an island continent. We rely upon aviation to connect Australians with each other and to connect us with the world. We need to make sure that we continue to have a strong aviation safety record, and the previous government certainly put the highest priority on aviation safety. In 2009, we embarked on a process of developing a green paper and a white paper on aviation that were directed towards how we would see aviation not just a year in advance but for decades ahead. We strengthened CASA's independence by establishing the board in its current form. We did so to ensure that high-level-expert oversight of the authority's operations was in place. That was a part of the first national aviation policy statement in December 2009. There was extensive consultation with over 530 submissions from the industry, state and local governments and the community. The white paper process laid out a clear course for addressing the economic, security and environmental challenges facing aviation safety. That paper confirmed that safety and security was the number one concern. That should be the case for all governments of whatever political persuasion and I certainly believe that that will continue to be something that has bipartisan support in this parliament.


As a result of the aviation white paper, Labor strengthened baggage- and passenger-screening requirements. We tightened the Aviation Security Identification Card scheme. We improved security-screening standards and training programs. We modernised air traffic management, including the use of satellite technology. Importantly, we boosted CASA funding by $90 million. This additional funding over four years from 2010 provided it with certainty. I would say to the government, as it undertakes its budget deliberations, that it needs to ensure that that funding certainty continues into the future, because it provides organisation with the security to able to undertake its tasks in a manner that is appropriate, since aviation safety and security is the No. 1 priority. I acknowledge that the reforms arising from the aviation white paper were supported by the coalition.


The thing about aviation safety, though, is that the job is never finished. There is always something changing, whether it is due to technology, the international security environment or changing travel patterns. Indeed, it is vital that legislators and regulators keep abreast of the changes and act where necessary. You get a sense of the scale of the challenge when you consider the changes that have happened in this sector in the last couple of decades. As a result of aviation deregulation, airfares are now five times more affordable than they were 20 years ago and the number of Australians who fly has tripled. The emergence of low-cost carriers has opened the skies to many people who previously would not have travelled by air. Whereas decades ago air travel was a luxury, many Australians can now afford to fly interstate for the weekend to see a football match or a concert. So passenger volume is a challenge. The industry predicts that over the next two decades, passenger numbers will double to 72.9 million trips a year.


Then there is security. It is not so long ago that people could board aircraft without consideration to measures that had been put in place, such as going through a body scanner. When the government received the recommendations about the introduction of body scanners, it was seen, in some circles, as a controversial decision. It is a good example of bipartisan support securing the introduction of body scanners in a way that ensures civil liberties concerns were taken into account. The bipartisan support also ensured that the type of body scanner introduced was one that took into account health concerns relating to new technology that had been used in other parts of the world. Body scanners are now operating at our international gateway airports. They are operating efficiently. They are improving the security at those gateway airports. I acknowledge the fact that parliamentarians here did not play politics with the issue. We had a trial of the scanners up on the second floor of Parliament House so that members of parliament could go through a scanner themselves to experience it and see that there was no threat to people's dignity, no threat to safety and no threat to their health. Indeed, it is much safer than the time we spend on mobile phones in terms of the risk factors involved, with the analysis that had been undertaken by health experts.


The September 11 attacks in the United States changed the aviation landscape forever. They added a new layer of complexity to aircraft regulation. Another challenge is the extraordinary growth that we have seen of fly-in fly-out employment, particularly in the resources sector. Tourism, which employs half a million Australians and is the sector most reliant upon aviation, is also in a state of constant change. Because of international competition and the fact that tourism destinations go in and out of fashion frequently, we need our carriers to be nimble enough to be flexible while also maintaining the highest levels of passenger safety. Change is the only constant in aviation. CASA's emphasis on constant vigilance and continuous improvement has allowed it to meet the emerging challenges of the past, and I am confident that it will continue to do so in the future. As I mentioned earlier, Labor supports a bipartisan approach to aviation safety. It is too important to be a political battleground. However, there is a role for an opposition to raise concerns about the direction of some government policy, and earlier this month there were reports that the government was considering staff cuts of up to 20 per cent in the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The ATSB employs 110 people. They investigate accidents, safety concerns and near misses in air, sea and rail transport.


These cuts should not be considered by government. There is a need to quarantine ATSB—just like CASA and other safety organisations, like the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Their task is simply too important to cut corners by cutting costs and cutting staff, and I would hope that the government maintains at least the support that is there for these agencies.


Of course, the financial implications of this legislation—appointing two extra board members—will be $160,000 per year or thereabouts. If the government can find $160,000 per year to appoint two new board members, it should also find the resources to make sure that our transport safety authorities are quarantined from cuts for their own sake. I would urge the minister for transport, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, to make sure that these agencies are not subject to budget cuts.


In making these changes, the government says it is part of their policy. We are supporting it. However, when it comes to the potential for cuts in this area, there is a very simple, old-fashioned saying: it is better to be safe than sorry. And when considering the aviation sector, you cannot afford to be in the situation whereby you look back with regret at decisions made that may have been short-sighted. So I am confident that the government will reject the suggestion of making cuts to the agency's staff.


In conclusion, CASA has always done an excellent job over the years, including in its current configuration with its board, a product of the former Labor government's 2009 reforms. This bill does not change that structure; it simply increases the size of the board. In that context the bill is a continuation of the parliament's bipartisan approach to aviation safety—an approach that has served us well over the years—and I commend the bill to the House.

"Palmer, Clive, MP",PUP,2014-03-18,"



Mr PALMER
 (Fairfax) (21:00):  The Senate election in Western Australia is of prime importance not just to the nation but to Western Australia. Over the years, successive Australian governments have relied on the wealth generation capacity of Western Australia to carry the nation on its back. There has always been the assumption that Western Australia can manage, that 'they'll be right'. But things in Western Australia are not right. The mining tax has destroyed the investment and prosperity that Western Australia once enjoyed, and the carbon tax has pushed the cost of electricity up to the stage where the average family in Perth cannot manage their household budget. Despite all of that, Western Australia still does not receive the GST receipts it should be entitled to. How long will it be until Western Australians get a fair share? How long will it be until the state governments and the Australian government correct the injustice and allow Western Australians to receive their fair share of GST? Unemployment is increasing, living standards are declining and people's lives are getting worse, not better.


It has now been six months since the government was sworn in and it has still not been able to get the mining tax and the carbon tax repealed in the Senate. These taxes should have been repealed from the day the government was elected—from the day the Australian people voted overwhelmingly for them to be abolished. Labor and the Greens have blocked the repeal in the Senate, and the government remains impotent to do anything about it. The government cannot do it; they cannot remove the carbon and mining taxes. The Greens and Labor will not allow them to do it—they are the nay-sayers who gave us the mining tax and the carbon tax and brought to Australia a government that wreaked havoc on our economy.


The fact of the matter is that only the senators who control the balance of power in the Senate after the next Senate election and their alliance can remove the mining and carbon taxes and set Australia on the right path. The Senate election will not change anything in Western Australia. We know who the Prime Minister is; we know who the Leader of the Opposition is. But the Western Australian election is an opportunity for Western Australians to join the balance of power in the Senate. If Senate candidates elected at that election are elected in Western Australia they will be able to join the balance of power in the Senate and make sure the mining tax and the carbon tax are repealed.


The Western Australian economy needs more jobs and investment. Now is not the time for the government not to follow through on its commitment to Western Australia. All Australians, wherever they live, owe a debt of gratitude to the people of Western Australia for all they have done for this country. I have a strong personal commitment to Western Australia, having worked and lived in the Pilbara for many years. I was successful in capturing billions of dollars that have now been invested in Western Australia creating many thousands of jobs in the state—investment which created a new port at Cape Preston and one of Australia's largest industrial enterprises.


Western Australians are not afraid of hard work or a challenge but, if the government fails to act, they cannot accept that they should be forever sentenced to a lesser role because their politicians do not live in Sydney or Melbourne. What about them? It is just not fair that Western Australia is not treated fairly and that it is burdened with the carbon and mining taxes; that Western Australia is taken for granted in the good times and forgotten when the times get tough. Western Australia deserves to be in the balance of power in the Senate. Only then can Western Australia make the politicians who rule this country from Sydney and Melbourne take notice of their fair demands.
