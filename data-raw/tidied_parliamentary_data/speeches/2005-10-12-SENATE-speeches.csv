"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-12,"—The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 represents an overhaul of the federal legislative regime for drug related offences. The bill migrates some offences from the Customs Act 1901 to the Criminal Code while introducing new anti-drug offences in line with chapter 6 of the Model Criminal Code. Offences that have been migrated from the Customs Act include but are not limited to the importation and exportation of commercial or marketable quantities of border controlled drugs or plants, the possession of commercial or marketable quantities of unlawfully imported border controlled plants, and possession of commercial or marketable quantities of border controlled drugs or plants that are or are suspected of being unlawfully imported.
The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General developed chapter 6 offences in 1998 after nationwide consultation. The chapter takes into account the 1980 report by the Hon. Mr Justice E. S. Williams, who called for greater consistency in Australian drug laws. Since then, the pattern of drug use in Australia has changed and chapter 6 has been appropriately modified to take into account developments that have occurred over the last few years.
One of the most significant changes is the increased trade in manufactured drugs and chemical substances used to make those drugs. The bill will preserve the existing regulatory offences involving controlled substances, such as the scheme in place for the issuing of licences for the manufacture of controlled substances under the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. However, for the purposes of replacing other offences, the bill proposes to streamline the terms which refer to illicit drugs, as current federal drug offences employ a number of different terms. For offences relating to import and export, ‘border controlled drugs’, ‘border controlled plants’ and ‘border controlled precursors’ would be used. For the other offences with broader domestic application, the terms ‘controlled drugs’, ‘controlled plants’ and ‘controlled precursors’ would be used.
Existing state and territory regulatory schemes will continue to operate, and it will be a defence to the offences in the bill if the relevant conduct is justified or excused under a law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory. Significant new offences that are proposed for introduction into the Criminal Code include—and this list is not exhaustive—the trafficking of controlled drugs, the cultivation of controlled plants, the selling of controlled plants, manufacturing controlled drugs, pretrafficking controlled precursors, possessing controlled drugs, supplying controlled drugs to children, and procuring children for pretrafficking controlled precursors. To increase the enforceability of the precursor offences, the bill includes a presumption of intent to manufacture an illicit drug where a person is illegally selling, manufacturing or possessing prescribed precursors.
Labor recognises that drugs and serious drug offences have a major detrimental effect on society, and that is why we support this bill. Harm minimisation is the ultimate goal in drug policy and law enforcement does play a vital role. Federal Labor supports an evidence based approach to drugs. These drugs are proven to be harmful. That is why they are controlled substances. Law enforcement by Australia’s major anti-drug agencies in the Federal Police, Customs and the Australian Crime Commission is the appropriate method of stopping drugs at the border. They in turn must work with the states to disrupt criminal networks operating within Australia and minimise the supply of harmful drugs in the community. Labor is in total support of our national law enforcement efforts in fighting the scourge of drugs.
Labor referred the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for detailed scrutiny. Thirteen submissions were received by the committee in relation to the bill. In addition, 11 witnesses were heard in the committee’s public hearing in Canberra on 3 August 2005. There were some areas of concern to federal Labor, including the extent to which the bill complies with the Model Criminal Code and the suitability of new penalties under the bill. Where the offences deviate from those of the code we think the onus is on the government to offer a complete rationale for doing so.
In future, it would it would be a wise path for the government, when dealing with potentially contentious legislation, to take this advice so it is apparent to legislators, lawyers and the wider community that the offences have not been pulled from thin air. The committee only made one substantive recommendation and that was not in relation to the drugs provisions but instead directed towards the mutual assistance provisions, which I will refer to later.
Labor recognises the need for the overhaul of the legislative regime regarding drug related offences. The drug problem, especially the trafficking and supply of drugs to minors, is of great concern and not something that can be tackled half-heartedly. Since originally viewing the bill, the government supplied additional information and only 11 of the offences proposed are derived outside of the Model Criminal Code or the Customs Act 1901. According to the government, the proposed new offences are principally targeted at organised illicit drug traders and commercially motivated crime. The aim of the proposed new offences is to remove the legal loopholes being exploited by drug traders who structure the illegal trafficking of serious drugs in a way which means they avoid the consequences of their conduct under the existing law.
The penalty regime contained in the bill includes greater penalties where commercial or marketable quantities of a controlled or border controlled substance are involved. The new offences provide an avenue for accumulating the amount of drugs traded on multiple occasions within a specific period into a single offence to avoid traffickers escaping liability by manipulating the amount of drugs traded on each occasion. Of those 11 offences, nine extend additional protection to children to ensure they are safe from criminal activity involved with drug and precursor trafficking. Labor gives its full support to these measures to protect kids from drugs.
The remaining two new offences are proposed section 308.1, Possessing controlled drugs, and proposed section 308.2, Possessing controlled precursors. These offences exist to cover quantities less than the proscribed trafficable quantities. There are good reasons for making laws on basic possession. However, Labor does have some questions as to how expiation as practiced in a minority of states and territories will interact with the new Commonwealth regime and on the apparent lack of consultation involved. Specifically, Labor is interested in just outcomes from the justice system. It is a matter of historical and legal reality that we have eight state and territory jurisdictions, each with their own drug legislation that have developed under governments of all political colours. The differential treatment of offenders for the same crime across the states is not an ideal outcome and, in Labor’s view, does not reflect a just one.
After scrutinizing these offences in their context very carefully, Labor offers its support for the provisions of proposed sections 308.1 and 308.2, but we ask the government to commit to reporting on the operation of the bill 18 months from the date these provisions take effect. The reason Labor is prepared to offer its support for these provisions is based on the following: firstly, Labor has a great respect for the professionalism of the officers of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service; secondly, as the authority that decides whether or not a charge is to be pursued, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is independent from both the Federal Police and the government and has discretion on whether or not to pursue a minor possession charge. They have a significant policy that they are required to adhere to in dealing with these matters or with charges that have been referred to them. Labor similarly has a great deal of confidence in the professionalism and competence of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.
The extensive protections under the sentencing provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 allow a sentencing judge wide latitude to ensure a just outcome from sentencing. That includes, but is not limited to: the judge satisfying himself or herself that no other sentence but a term of imprisonment is appropriate and making a statement as to those reasons—section 17A; the judge taking into account relevant circumstances, including the likely effect of a sentence upon the defendant—section 16A; before imposing a fine, the judge can take into account the defendant’s ability to pay—section 16C; the court may immediately release the defendant under a good behaviour bond without passing a sentence—section 20; where under the law of a participating state or territory, the court is empowered in particular cases to pass a sentence or make an order known as a community service order, a work order, a sentence of periodic detention, an attendance centre order, a sentence of weekend detention or an attendance order, the court may impose a similar sentence or order—section 20AB; and a child convicted of a federal offence may be tried, punished or otherwise dealt with as if the offence were an offence against a law of the state or territory—section 20C. In addition, there are wide powers for the court to supervise offenders and over what sentences will in fact be imposed. An additional final safeguard is that the Attorney-General also has the power to order the release of a federal prisoner under section 19AP. Labor believes there are sufficient safeguards for this legislation to be supported.
We have every confidence in our Commonwealth officers, the office of the DPP and our judiciary to get it right. But, as an additional check, we ask the government to report on the operation of the anti-drug provisions contained within this bill 18 months from commencement. As an example of how important this area of law is and what we are doing here today in dealing with this legislation, let us remember that illicit drugs kill far too many people world wide and ruin far too many lives—those of both users and their families.
Other matters that Labor sought to resolve through the scrutiny of the bill by the committee are the extent to which the new federal offences complement state offences—with regard to definitions and punishments—and whether the state and territory jurisdictions have been adequately consulted on the bill. Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT have already implemented many of the provisions contained within chapter 6 of the Model Criminal Code. In response to questions on notice, the Attorney-General’s Department stated that no consultation had been undertaken together with states or territories regarding this bill as they would have been aware of the model offences since the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee completed its report on serious drug offences in 1998.
However, in the same set of responses, the Attorney-General’s Department also listed each offence within the bill and the corresponding offence from the Model Criminal Code. There were almost a dozen offences that had no corresponding offence within the code. The question is: how then were the states and territories consulted on these offences? The answer is, of course, they could not have been. That is just not good enough when you look at the Commonwealth’s stretch in dealing with this legislation. It is a pattern oft repeated by a federal government that is unable to manage consultation because it is out of touch. However, of themselves, the new offences do not have sufficient purpose to hold up the passage of the bill. Labor is disappointed that the government is not able to offer an exposure draft of the regulations as well, as that may have gone some way to mitigate its failure to consult adequately before this bill was brought forward.
I will now briefly outline some of the other non-drug related provisions of the bill. Most important to Labor is the schedule 4 amendment to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. The bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to clarify that the functions of the Australian Federal Police extend to providing assistance to and cooperating with foreign law enforcement agencies. The explanatory memorandum states:
Such activities are not expressly covered by any of the specific functions in section 8 of the AFP Act, but generally fall within the incidental category of the provision of police services in relation to the laws of the Commonwealth and the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests.
Because the Attorney-General’s Department have identified a need to clarify the law in this regard, there is also a need to clarify the policy and the procedures of the AFP in international police assistance. In addition, the Attorney-General’s Department’s Mutual Assistance Manual of 2000, if it has not fallen into disuse, has certainly not been found or recently used and is no longer referred to, as I understand it, and has not been updated since that time. The Attorney-General’s Department advised that they now interpret the legislation without reference to the manual.
Finally, recommendation 1 of the Senate committee’s report into the bill recommends:
... the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police and other stakeholders, review its policy and procedures on international police assistance. In particular, the Australian Government should ensure appropriate ministerial supervision of assistance provided to overseas jurisdictions by Australian law enforcement agencies, where that assistance may expose Australians overseas to cruel, harsh or inhumane treatment or punishment, including the death penalty.
That was the recommendation made by the committee. Being a responsible party, Labor have been trying to work constructively with the government on this issue, and the government, through the Attorney-General’s Department, are conducting a review into Australia’s extradition and mutual assistance arrangements. The report on extradition is expected to be handed down before the end of the year—unless they are going to tell me otherwise—while the report on mutual assistance is to be handed down at an as yet to be determined date within the next year. Labor welcome those reviews, but this morning on Channel 9’s Today show, Minister Ellison made it clear that the mutual assistance review would not cover police to police assistance as specifically requested by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. So now it seems apparent that the government are backtracking to try and hide themselves from scrutiny. This is completely unacceptable to Labor.
Police to police cooperation in circumstances where that assistance may expose Australians overseas to cruel, harsh or inhumane treatment or punishment, including the death penalty, is a legitimate ethical concern and a legitimate area of review, especially in light of the recent Corby and Bali Nine cases. Labor will therefore move an amendment along those lines, and I foreshadow that now.
Schedule 2, regarding other measures contained within the bill, would ensure that Australia complies with the optional protocol that states that the recruitment or use of persons under the age of 18 in hostilities by armed groups not part of the state should be criminalised. The bill would comply with this obligation by amending the Criminal Code to provide that these activities constitute federal offences and would be punishable by imprisonment for up to 17 years.
Schedule 5 seeks to amend the mutual assistance in the Business Regulation Act 1992 to facilitate the transfer of responsibility from the Attorney-General to the Treasurer for the consideration of requests received from foreign regulators for information, documents or evidence relating to the foreign enforcement of business law. Similarly, Schedule 6 amends the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 to clarify that cash dealers are not required to obtain multiple identification references from a person who is a signatory to different accounts with the cash dealer.
Schedule 7 repeals the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1950, which no longer has any legal effect, while Schedule 9 exempts AUSTRAC from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in relation to documents concerning information communicated to it under section 16 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988.
In conclusion, Labor support the intent of this bill, but we make two additional demands of the government in relation to it: firstly, a review into the policy and procedures on international police assistance; and, secondly, a report examining the operation of the anti-drug trafficking provisions to be brought before the parliament after three years of operation. Labor are pleased to say that we have worked with the government to get the latter report up, but we are disappointed the government have tried to squib on the former. We will be holding them to the recommendation of the Senate committee. With those comments, and foreshadowing our intention to move amendments, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUG OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-12,"—Senator Stott Despoja is the Democrat senator who has responsibility for Attorney-General and justice issues and she has examined this legislation from when it was introduced, through the relevant Senate committee inquiry. Whilst supporting the bill, she raises a number of issues in her speech, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-10-12,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise to speak on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005.
The Democrats recognise the adverse impact that drug abuse and related crimes have on all levels of society, and also recognise that a significant part of this bill is appropriately aimed at addressing this problem. For this reason, the Democrats support this bill.
There are a number of aspects of this bill that deserve attention, in particular, the operation of the presumptions and absolute liability that effectively shifts the burden from proving guilt to establishing innocence. This represents a marked departure from current practice and would appear to dramatically undermine the presumption of innocence as set out in article 14(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
Appearing before the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s inquiry into this bill, Law Council President John North stated that “after hundreds of years of trial and effort … we have reached the presumption that you are innocent and the crown should prove matters beyond reasonable doubt. We should not give this away lightly…”
Mr North also added that “no senate and no government should walk away from that just because we currently have a … serious problem of drug use in our community.”
This is not about making it easier for criminals to escape justice, it is about ensuring that no one is convicted of a crime they did not commit. For this reason, the Democrats believe that the burden of proof should remain with the Crown.
During the inquiry, there were also a number of concerns raised that this bill, particularly in relation to section 308.1, will characterise all drug users as guilty of “serious drug offences” for possession of even a small quantity of drugs. The Democrats note that the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee’s (MCOCC) 1998 report on Serious Drug Offences did not contain a simple possession offence.
The Committee also heard from Families and Friends for Drug Reform who argued that the bulk of the “grass roots distribution of drugs is in the hands of user-dealers.” And that this bill “transforms all these into very serious criminals.” The Committee also heard that the illicit drug market is organised as a “pyramid selling system with those higher up the pyramid using the desperation of dependent users and venality of young people to sell to other young people.”
The bill characterises a number of activities, involving possession and dealing in small quantities among users at the bottom of the “drug distribution pyramid,” as “serious drug offences.” While the Democrats recognise that these may be classified as drug offences, we also recognise that during the Committee inquiry, there were a number of questions raised in relation to the appropriateness of labelling them “serious” drug offences—particularly in light of the harsh penalties that this would impose.
I acknowledge this is a troubling issue that requires careful consideration.
However, it is worrying and possible that this bill will adversely and disproportionately target young people.
The MCOCC makes the point that chapter 6 is “entitled Serious Drug Offences to emphasis the point that not all drug offences are appropriately located in the Model Criminal Code.” The central theme of the chapter is that “the serious offences should focus on individuals who make a business out of drug trafficking.”
Furthermore, while there are provisions for the continued operation of State
and Territory laws, in proposed sections 308.1 and 300.4, there appears to be no guarantee that an individual who commits an offence in a jurisdiction that allows for such an offence to be expiated on payment of a fine will not be proceeded against under Commonwealth law.
The Democrats believe there must be more emphasis placed on the treatment of drug abuse as a health and social problem with much more effort put into currently under-funded prevention and treatment services.
There also needs to be greater research into the medium to long term effects of designer drugs and treatment options; an expansion of detox facilities and greater investment and support for rehabilitation programs—particularly, those that cater for drug dependent adults with children.
There should also be an expansion of drug diversion programs that offer an alternative to the traditional criminal justice system. While I acknowledge the attempt to address this in the bill, the provisions appear limited.
I would also like to raise concerns in relation to Schedule 4, which amends the Australian Federal Police Act 1979—the purpose of which is to clarify that the functions of the Australian Federal Police extend to providing assistance to, and cooperating with, Australian and foreign law enforcement agencies, intelligence or security agencies and government regulatory agencies, and establishing, developing and monitoring peace, stability and security in other countries.
While the Democrats offer in principle support to this amendment, we believe, in accordance with the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s recommendation, that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police, “review its policy and procedures on international police to police assistance. In particular, the Australian Government should ensure appropriate ministerial supervision of assistance provided to overseas jurisdictions by Australian law enforcement agencies, where that assistance may expose Australians overseas to cruel, harsh or inhumane treatment or punishment, including the death penalty.”
The case of the Bali nine is perhaps the most significant and most recent example of the problems that may arise in such situations. Furthermore, I note the recent claims that Mr Lee Rush, the father of 19-year-old alleged drug smuggler Scott Rush, contacted the Australian Federal Police to inform them that his son may be involved in drug smuggling. Mr Rush has also alleged that he was assured that his son would be warned.
President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties Terry O’Gorman commented on ABC radio on the 22 September that “we've had a bipartisan policy in this country that we will not be party to Australians being put to death for alleged criminal offences in other countries. In this instance this policy has been seriously and significantly deviated from.”
While Senator Ellison has commented that he does not “think the Australian Federal Police have contravened Australian law in any way,” surely this situation clearly highlights the need for clarification of when police to police assistance should be provided. In respect to assisting Indonesian authorities in this case, there is obviously a significant risk that a person who is convicted of a drug offence could be sentenced to death.
During the inquiry into the bill, the Committee received a submission from the Law Council proposing that such assistance should only be provided where there is a memorandum of understanding between Australia and the foreign jurisdiction. The Law Council proposed that such a memorandum should state that “cruel, harsh or inhumane treatment or punishment, such as the death penalty, would not be applied where the Australian Federal Police assisted in the process of conviction.” I would urge the Government to consider the implementation of such a proposal.
The Democrats recognise the positive aspects of this bill and the need to address the problems associated with drug abuse. In relation to Schedule 4, I acknowledge that cooperation at an international level is an essential element of modern law enforcement and support such cooperation. However, we must also ensure that laws do not adversely target the vulnerable and that we provide alternative measures to deal with drug abuse. We must also ensure that the provision of assistance to overseas jurisdictions does not expose Australians to cruel, harsh or inhumane treatment or punishment.”",SENATE,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUG OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-10-12,"—I too wish to make a few remarks on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This bill is an important part of the coalition government’s Tough on Drugs strategy. There is nothing more important than protecting our children from the dangers of drugs and the criminals who supply them. I notice some young people up there in the gallery today. It is their welfare that the government and indeed all honourable senators wish to protect. When I visit schools in Queensland, one of the issues always raised by students and indeed by the parents of students is the problem of drugs. It is an issue that confronts us every day, and the cost to young people’s lives and to communities is vast. Indeed, drugs can certainly poison community life.
The $1 billion Tough on Drugs program was launched by the Prime Minister in 1997. It is based on three elements: law enforcement, education and rehabilitation. This bill builds on the law enforcement aspect of that program. It is the largest single initiative ever undertaken in this country to combat illicit drugs.
Is the government’s Tough on Drugs strategy working? It is. Fewer people are engaging in drug abuse—down from 22 per cent in 1998 to 15.3 per cent in 2003; fewer people are dying of drug overdoses—down from 1,100 in 1999 to under 400 in 2002; and more parents are talking to their children about drugs—78 per cent of parents spoke to their children about drugs as part of the 2001 illicit drugs campaign. All of us have seen those ads on television where parents speak to their children, and young people speak to other young people about the dangers of drugs. It is a very important part of the government’s Tough on Drugs strategy. Law enforcement efforts continue to disrupt criminal drug importation following the coalition’s increased assistance to Customs and the Australian Federal Police. There have been record seizures, with over 11 tonnes of illicit drugs seized since late 1997.
One of the marvellous aspects of being a senator is being involved in very interesting committees. Two of the committees I am involved in have touched on this particular bill. I want to say a couple of words about issues those committees have raised about this bill. First of all, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in its seventh report of 2005 raised a couple of issues. This bill:
... inserts new serious drug offences into the Criminal Code.
It does some really important things. Among the provisions are measures dealing with:
•   trade in ‘precursor’ chemicals—
which is becoming a much larger issue—
•   increased penalties, including heavier penalties for people who use children to traffic in drugs ...
Those penalties have increased markedly and, we think, appropriately, and with the support of all parties. There are provisions dealing with:
•   offences aimed at those who harm or endanger children by exposing them to the manufacture of drugs; and
•  adding new drugs to the list of illicit substances.
Schedule 2 of the bill also makes amendments to the Criminal Code to criminalise the recruitment by armed groups (not part of the State) of persons under 18 years of age, an obligation under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.

There are also seven further schedules to the bill, and my friend Senator Ludwig mentioned those earlier. There are provisions:
•   clarifying the functions of the Australian Federal Police in assisting other agencies and in operations in other countries ...; and
•   clarifying the application of the power which allows Customs officers to detain a person in breach of a bail condition intended to prevent that person leaving Australia ...
The one issue that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised in relation to this bill was the uncertainty of the commencement date of the bill:
By virtue of item 3 in the table in subclause 2(1) of this bill, the amendments proposed by Schedule 2 may commence on the day on which the Optional Protocol enters into force for Australia, but do not commence at all if the Optional Protocol does not come into force. However, the item does not provide any fixed date by which it can be finally determined that the Optional Protocol will not come into force.
The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has always taken the view that parliament is responsible for determining when laws are to come into effect. I am happy to note that the minister agreed that the bill should be amended to provide certainty of commencement of the optional protocol. He did that appropriately.
Finally, my friend Senator Ludwig mentioned also the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s report on this bill. The report of the committee was unanimous, although there were some comments by Senator Stott Despoja from the Australian Democrats. They were additional comments rather than a dissenting report. Most of the submissions received by the committee were in favour of and supported the bill. In particular, the committee supported the need for greater national consistency in Australian drug law. I can remember, many years ago when I was a Commonwealth prosecutor, one of the difficulties in prosecuting—
—I did not know that.
—It was a long time ago, Senator Macdonald. I recall one of the great difficulties was prosecuting drug criminals because of the multiplicity of applicable laws, both state and federal. What this report has done and what this bill continues to do in a slow and methodical way is to streamline and harmonise state and federal drug laws. It is a long process. It started in the 1990s with Sir Harry Gibbs and the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, which is part of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. This is a long process and there is still a way to go but it will facilitate the prosecution of drug criminals.
In relation to the concerns raised about the use of presumptions and absolute liability in the bill, the committee considered that these provisions have been adequately justified in the explanatory memorandum and by departmental representatives. I note that, in her additional comments, Senator Stott Despoja raises concerns that that can impinge upon the presumption of innocence. Of course, in a sense, she is right. But, given the nature of these offences and the difficulty at times of proving drug offences, to facilitate that, it has been common in recent times to use and change the presumptions relating to strict and absolute liability.
The committee also received evidence of concerns about the potential impact of the bill, particularly on smaller scale drug crime. I recall the Families and Friends for Drug Law Reform giving evidence to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee saying that, in effect, this bill may criminalise activity that otherwise would not be criminalised and that the umbrella of Commonwealth criminal law is becoming too large. The committee rejected that overwhelmingly. The committee noted that many of the offences in the bill already exist at the state and territory level. The committee took the view that prosecutorial discretion would be the best avenue for addressing any inconsistencies in state and federal prosecutions.
One issue that my friend Senator Ludwig did mention—and it is a legitimate issue—was in relation to schedule 4 of the bill. The committee acknowledged concerns that the Australian Federal Police is providing assistance in matters in foreign countries which may result in Australians facing the death penalty. This issue, of course, raised its head recently in relation to the Bali Nine—and we saw today on the front pages of all the newspapers around the country pictures of young Australians being prosecuted and charged in Balinese courts.
This is an issue that will not go away, and I know the government is addressing it. It was an issue of concern to the committee, and I know that the minister and his department are looking at it. We certainly need sophisticated protocols so that, when the Australian Federal Police does assist overseas law enforcement agencies, that assistance does not place Australians under threat of the death penalty. In the current context, it is a difficult debate and a difficult time, but I know it is an issue that the government is addressing and will be doing so in the future. With those comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUG OFFENCES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-10-12,"—I thank those senators who have participated in the debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I particularly thank Senator Mason for a very thoughtful contribution. It is interesting for me as a fellow Queenslander to know, for the first time, that Senator Mason was once a Commonwealth prosecutor. It does demonstrate that on this side of the chamber we do have a number of people with an expertise in various matters. Senator Mason’s expertise in the criminal prosecution area is very useful and gratefully received by the government in relation to this particular bill.
Senator Mason has clearly and succinctly emphasised what this bill is all about—that is, consolidating a lot of views and bits of legislation and making it consistent with state approaches—and I thank Senator Mason for his contribution. Unfortunately, I was not in the chamber to hear Senator Ludwig speak, but I would expect that his view would have also been thoughtful. I do thank the Labor Party generally for its support for this bill. I have not read Senator Stott Despoja’s tabled speech, but I assume the Democrats are also supporting this bill—and Senator Bartlett has indicated that that is the case.
This bill continues the government’s efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs by strengthening anti-drug laws. There has been quite significant progress in combating the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs since the government announced in November 1997 a $1 billion package of measures under the Tough on Drugs National Illicit Drug Strategy. In the last financial year over 11 tonnes of illicit drugs were seized by Australian law enforcement agencies, preventing a huge amount of dangerous drugs from reaching the community and also disrupting drug-trafficking cartels. This bill strengthens our nation’s legislative response and forms an integral part of that multifaceted package of measures aimed at reducing the demand for, the supply of and the harms caused by illicit drugs in our community.
The bill will promote national consistency by implementing model drug offences that were developed after nationwide consultation. A list of controlled substances that are covered by the offences in the bill and the threshold quantities that relate to different penalty levels will be reviewed next year, following consideration by a national committee of experts. The aim is for the model list developed by that committee to be adopted by all jurisdictions. The bill will also simplify drug prosecutions, as Senator Mason mentioned, by expanding the scope of existing federal laws to apply to drug dealings within Australia.
The offences in this bill will operate alongside state and territory offences to give more flexibility to law enforcement agencies in identifying and pursuing charges against drug dealers. The approach of having overlapping federal and state offences will ensure that there are no gaps between federal and state laws that can be exploited by drug cartels. I know all senators will be very supportive of that general approach in the bill. The offences in the bill will operate alongside state and territory offences to give more flexibility to law enforcement agencies, as I have indicated.
The bill will introduce a new range of pre-trafficking offences which focus specifically on dealings in precursor chemicals—that is, the substances that can be used to manufacture pills and what is called designer drugs. In addition, it will protect children by increasing penalties for people who use children to traffic in drugs and by targeting people who expose children to the dangers of illicit drugs manufacture in backyard, clandestine drug laboratories.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has considered the drug offences in the bill and has given its support. At the request of Senator Ludwig, the government has agreed to report on the operation of the new drugs offences. The report will be made after three years, by which time there should be a sufficient number of cases to make a worthwhile report. Senator Ludwig, I think you might have mentioned two different figures.
—Yes. I agree with three years, but I tried for 18 months.
—Okay. I appreciate your approach to have an earlier review, but, as has been explained, it will need some time for a sufficient number of cases to come forward to make a report worth while. I accept that you accept that the three-year review is appropriate. The report would not cover existing offences that have been transferred over to the Criminal Code in this bill, such as the import and export offences currently in the Customs Act. The bill does ensure that drug users who are charged with relatively minor federal offences of drug possession will be able, at the direction of the court, to participate in state and territory drug diversion schemes. Another issue that Senator Ludwig has raised with the minister is whether the Australian Federal Police should be able to directly refer an offender to a drug diversion scheme without the offender having to attend court. This mechanism is available to police in some state jurisdictions.
At the outset I want to emphasise that, in practice, drug possession offences within Australia will continue to be the responsibility of state and territory police. It is not the intention of this bill to increase the jurisdiction of the Australian Federal Police to compete with or take over the role of state and territory police. However, I have no objection to this issue being considered as part of the report on the new offences in three years time, once we have had some practical experience with the operations of this bill. As well as strengthening anti-drug laws, the bill will give effect to an international obligation under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict by criminalising the recruitment of children by non-government armed groups and their use of children in hostilities.
The bill also clarifies the scope of the functions of the Australian Federal Police in the current environment of increasingly globalised criminal activity and law enforcement responses. I understand that Senator Ludwig, in his speech on the second reading, has flagged a committee stage amendment to the bill requiring the government to review guidelines on police-to-police assistance. It is a matter that Senator Mason also mentioned. The government notes that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee also recommended that police guidelines be reviewed. However, the government considers that the current policy is appropriate in the circumstances. The police-to-police guidelines have in fact stood the test of time over a substantial period, and the government at this stage sees no reason to change those guidelines. The Australian Federal Police are currently assisting the Indonesian authorities in investigating the tragic Bali bombings of recent times and, of course, the original Bali bombings. It is vital that this police cooperation is able to continue into the future. Bearing all of this in mind, as I have mentioned, the government does not accept the opposition’s amendment.
As with all these issues, the government will keep this bill and how it operates—and, indeed, all policies in relation to the police-to-police guidelines—under constant review. It does that as a matter of course, as a government that is able to move with the times and to review policies as situations change. That issue is one that will continue to be kept under review, but for the time being the government does not see the need to change those guidelines. I am pleased to advise that the government has already agreed to conduct policy reviews of extradition and mutual assistance, and it is committed to public consultation as part of that process. In addition to a major program of expedited treaty negotiations, the Attorney-General’s Department has been working on these reviews since April 2005. I expect that an extradition discussion paper will be released for public comment later this year and a mutual assistance discussion paper will be released for public comment next year.
As all senators have indicated, this bill will make a crucial contribution to reducing the demand for, the supply of and the harms caused by illicit drugs in our community. It will send a clear message that exposing people to these dangers will not be accepted by the Australian community, the Australian parliament and, indeed, the Australian government. I commend this bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-10-12,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005, which has taken a while to get into this chamber for us to deal with. It has certainly been sitting on the Notice Paper for some time now, and I am pleased to be able to rise and speak on it. Labor supports much of the intent of the bill. Labor supports the object of the bill, which is to improve the efficiency and general operation of the legal process in migration matters. Labor believes in, and has always supported, the proper and just operation of the way migration litigation works, in order to facilitate the more speedy operation of the migration litigation process.
In relation to this legislation, some concerns have arisen. I will begin by renoting several concerns that Mr Laurie Ferguson announced way back in March—some time ago now—about the government not making the report of the Penfold inquiry available to the public. Labor urgently requested that the government make that report available and continues to make that request. In fact, I have made that request probably more times than I need to recall, at estimates and post that. The department has a new secretary, Mr Metcalfe, who is trying to turn a battleship around in a creek. The culture is one area where the government could make a positive commitment, and it could release that report. It could indicate that in fact it has changed its ways, does not operate in a culture of concealment any longer and wants to bring forward the Penfold report and make it available to the public. That would be a positive contribution to changing the culture within the department. But I doubt that DIMIA will in fact do that. I doubt Senator Ian Macdonald has a copy of the Penfold report on his table and is prepared to table it today so that we can have a look at it.
In relation to the view, which Mr Laurie Ferguson raised, that the time limit provisions contained in this bill are similar to the ones in the previous bill, we still consider that they may be unconstitutional. He also made the point that the imposition of time limits had the potential to effectively give some applicants only an illusory right to judicial review, and that is of itself a concern. These were among a number of concerns that were announced.
I take the opportunity to reiterate Labor’s commitment to the principles of this bill and to raise some of Labor’s concerns about how the bill will operate in practice, especially with DIMIA. You might be persuaded to adopt it in other circumstances—I am not sure after my experience with the Cornelia Rau matter, the Alvarez matter and the range of other matters. If we look at some of these issues in the light of, say, the matter where a number of detainees were locked up in a van for a significant time during transportation, together with the detention centre regime, the Senate may forgive me for looking through a slightly jaded prism at how this bill might be chosen to be implemented by DIMIA. That is where, in part, the concerns lie about the practical way that these things will sometimes be progressed.
I have not yet experienced sufficient time with Mr Metcalfe in control of the ship, so to speak, to know whether he can in fact turn the battleship around in the creek, but it is reasonable to give him an opportunity to try to do so. I have said occasionally before this that I do not think it will be an easy task with the current minister and the culture of the department. Mr Comrie hit the nail on the head when he said that the culture of the department commenced—if he did not quite say ‘commenced’ then I think you could infer it from his report—in about 2001 or could at least be identified from that point and moved forward through Mr Ruddock’s time as minister to the current minister, Senator Vanstone.
Before I talk about some of the substantive issues, I would like to note some comments from Mr Ruddock in 1992, when he was the then opposition spokesperson for immigration. When discussing what he then described as a crisis in assessing refugees, a crisis which can easily claim to have been caused by thousands of claims of Chinese nationals seeking to stay in Australia, Mr Ruddock attacked the Keating government for seeking to blame lawyers and refugee organisations. Specifically, he said:
I want to make it clear that I do not put the blame on the legal profession. I do not find it in the least surprising that those in the legal profession—given their duties and responsibilities, given the nature of the training that they receive and given the employment difficulties that so many of them have in this recession, also a Government creation—use their creative endeavours to find their way through the system that the Government puts in place. That does not surprise me in the least. The lawyers have to be sufficiently adroit and flexible to be able to make the changes to deal with that situation. The Government cannot bleat about the fact that they find ways through the system. It also cannot complain that the refugee organisations would seek to offer advice and assistance because that is exactly what I would expect them to do.
So we have a situation in which the then shadow Attorney-General in 1992, who became the current Attorney-General, criticised the Keating government for attempting to apportion some of the blame for the crisis to the lawyers and advocates. I have to say, reflecting upon what he said then and what he has done since then in the immigration portfolio and as Attorney-General leaves me somewhat stunned sometimes that it is the same person—maybe he had a brother at that time!
The ALP congratulates the government on its change of policy on this front and for its eventual realisation that the activities of such advocates could indeed have the—intended or not—effect of prolonging the process and preventing a streamlined system from operating. That is a view he also criticised. You have to reflect on that in the light of the current circumstances, but he is entitled to change his view, I suspect. Labor has previously supported reforms for improved efficiency and speed of migration litigation. Indeed, our 2002 policy, Protecting Australia and Protecting the Australian Way, contains a number of proposals that are consistent with although not necessarily identical to the reforms outlined in this bill. Some of those are worth repeating here. For example, they include inserting a provision that limits the conduct of review of refugee decisions to the Federal Magistrates Court and removing the right of appeal to the Federal Court, a proposal that the legislation should encourage the High Court to remit applications relating to the review of these matters to the Federal Magistrates Court, and provision for cost orders against lawyers and migration agents who encourage litigation with no reasonable prospects of success. All of these points are present in the bill to some extent, either in principle or with minor changes.
The first and second points I have just mentioned include the streamlining of relationships between the courts. The bill adopts the position of simultaneously allowing for the High Court to remit matters to the Federal Magistrates Court and widening the jurisdiction of that court to more closely match the jurisdiction in this area which the High Court is afforded by the Constitution. Labor believes that this reform would accomplish the task of streamlining the interaction of those courts on migration, immigration and refugee matters by reducing the overflow of refugee appeal cases to the High Court instead of having them dealt with in a lower court. As also mentioned, this is consistent with the ALP policy on this issue. The ALP believes that the streamlining of the appeal process is well served by the removal of the right of review of refugee decisions.
Going to the third point I mentioned, the bill provides power to the courts to summarily dismiss a case where there is no reasonable chance or prospect of success. This is a broadening of the power that the courts currently possess in this area. At the moment the courts possess the power to dismiss a case on the grounds of whether or not the case is fit to go to trial. The bill would significantly broaden the scope of this power. In this way Labor believes that there are several reforms that have much merit, are well designed and will go a long way to achieving their stated goal, that being the improvement of the efficiency of the court and the migration process generally.
Many of the reforms, as I have said, do have merit. For instance, some examples of reform in this bill will include streamlining the relationship between the courts to encourage applicants towards the FMC, the Federal Magistrates Court, and away from the High Court and Federal Court; reapplying time limits on applications for judicial review; and reforms to the management of the Federal Magistrates Service. Labor supports the goal of streamlining the process of judicial review and the reform of unnecessary delays in these matters. Everyone should be expected to have a speedy result, a determination without undue delay, and a streamlined process that is reasonably easy to follow through. Labor believes that people deserve to be given certainty about the outcome of their applications, and many of the provisions contained in the bill do go a long way towards providing that certainty.
Labor also recognises that there is a distinct possibility that some departmental officers might take advantage of the provisions allowed by the act. This is always a difficult area to go to in a speech such as this. You should always be in a position to guard against circumstances—you would expect reasonable legislation to also guard against such circumstances—where officers within the department may act fraudulently or maliciously. That is not to smear the department or its officers—and I have to temper this again. Notwithstanding the Comrie and Palmer reports, I am sure the vast majority of officers work competently, diligently and in accordance with the legislation. My beef in this area is as much with the minister as with anyone else. These sorts of safeguards should also be included to ensure that where there might be a slip then that can also be dealt with in the legislation in a sensible way.
As we have seen too often recently in the cases of Alvarez and Rau, amongst others, there are significant concerns about the exercise of the discretionary power of migration officers and the culture of the department in general. I will not revisit that; I think I said enough of that in my opening remarks and probably elsewhere as well. Labor is justifiably wary of the manner in which certain DIMIA officers may choose to conduct themselves under the provisions of this new bill. Ultimately, Labor’s view is that in any instance where an incorrect decision has been reached due to malice or fraud on the part of a DIMIA officer it is unjust that that decision be allowed to stand. It is certainly true that we have already seen many examples that could amount to that behaviour and it is also true that we know from these examples that the uncovering of these instances can take some time to occur. It can certainly take more than the 28 days afforded in this bill. Because of this, Labor is concerned that the imposition of arbitrary time limits will be seen as, and indeed will become, a de facto award for those perpetrating the unjust behaviours that I have mentioned, or they may do so.
In terms of the other areas, I reiterate Labor’s concern regarding the 84-day time limit imposed by the bill. In Labor’s view this time limit has a very distinct possibility of being seen as offering only an illusory right of judicial review, which would not be consistent with the Constitution. In that way the imposition of artificial time limits on the bill, in Labor’s view, raises serious constitutional issues which need to be addressed. Does the time limit provide a real right of judicial review or does it strip back the right and so become largely illusory? It is a question that, in the summing-up speech, the minister may also wish to tackle. In other words, there is not a real and substantive right of judicial review. A question that the High Court may eventually have to determine in relation to this legislation is whether it provides for a right of judicial review in an illusory sense, and in the summing-up speech the minister may want to give us some guarantees. But no guarantees can in truth be given when it comes to the High Court, and that also raises the question of whether this legislation, as it is currently drafted, is as tight as it could otherwise be.
I reiterate the ALP’s longstanding commitment to look at serious and genuine reform of the operation of the migration litigation process. We have looked very hard at the Cornelia Rau and Alvarez matters and other matters that are raised. We have now got the Ombudsman coming forward with another 221 cases for examination. Not all of them will be bad, I am sure, for Senator Vanstone but I suspect that some will be. She should take significant cognisance of those cases and do what I have often called for her to do—and I will not call again to frighten her into another refrain from her famous song. In terms of the process, Labor has maintained a consistent approach to this. We will look at serious reform. We will look at ensuring that anything that can be done to improve the process will be done.
I know that Senator Bartlett will contribute to this debate also. The Democrats have been there with Labor on migration matters for some time. Senator Bartlett has been on numerous committees with me since early 2000, when we did A sanctuary under review, which was my first examination into DIMIA. When I recall it, I do not know whether much has changed—certainly a lot more has come out about DIMIA. So the task for DIMIA is to go right back, in Labor’s view, and have a look at all of those matters. Maybe the new DIMIA officers have forgotten some of the issues that were raised back then—I do not know. I would certainly point them back to have a look at those issues and to have a look at the ministerial discretion inquiry that I chaired and some of the recommendations that came out of that as serious issues that should be taken into consideration in this area. They should also look at reform more broadly than, as they are doing now, simply taking the Comrie and Palmer reports and the following Ombudsman’s reports, to ensure that there is a better outcome in this determination process that they undertake on behalf of the Commonwealth. The ALP supports any attempt to address these concerns but at the same time we note the problems in the current bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-12,"—The Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 is another piece of legislation aimed at amending the Migration Act. The stated intent of the government is to try to improve the overall efficiency of migration litigation because of concerns about the high volume of migration cases, so-called unmeritorious litigation and delays impacting on the Federal Court, the court system as a whole and the migration system as a whole. There are a number of different facets to this legislation, and I could say a lot about it. I will not get to conclude my remarks before we hit the lunchbreak at a quarter to one.
In summary terms, to put it very simply, the vast bulk of this legislation and the measures within it, I think, are just plain stupid. This bill, inasmuch as it will have any effect on the amount of legal action, will lead to more legal action, not less. Surely, after all the shambles in the migration area, it is about time that we took a step back and said: ‘Maybe we’ve been going in the wrong direction. Maybe we should look at the other end of the process rather than continue to perpetuate the myth that somehow the burden on the courts is all the fault of people abusing the system, encouraged by a bunch of so-called dodgy and greedy lawyers.’ Maybe we need to go back and ask, ‘Why is it that these cases are before the court?’ I would say that it is because of badly thought out, politically motivated legislation like this and a range of other bills as stupid, as counterproductive and as politically motivated as this one that have been put forward time and again in the past.
I draw attention to the committee report on this legislation. The legislation, as Senator Ludwig said, has been around for a while. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee reported on it back in May this year. It is quite a good report, and I would urge people to read it. As part of that inquiry process evidence was given by an acknowledged expert in this area of law, Dr Mary Crock, who stated that Australia has one of the smallest bodies of refugee claims in the world and that the number of people seeking asylum on Australian soil is lower than in most other developed countries in the world. Despite this, we have proportionally one of the most astonishing loads of cases in the courts.
Why is it so? It is certainly not because the people who seek asylum in Australia are much more prone to so-called abuse of the system than they are in other countries or that we have a whole bunch of lawyers in Australia who just love taking unmeritorious cases to court. Surely now the evidence is clear: it is because the decision-making and determination process at the start is so flawed. We hardly need any more evidence publicly of the wide-ranging flaws found throughout DIMIA in the initial decision-making process in many cases. How about we look at why that is rather than continue to strangle more and more the neck of the court system? It will not work. All the different legislative changes in the past have also not worked.
We need to step back, cut the myth making and look at what is going wrong. We all now acknowledge—and even the government acknowledge in large part—that a lot has gone wrong in DIMIA and in the administration of our migration system. The only part where the government do not concede that anything has gone wrong is with themselves, with their own policies and their own law. Until we get that acknowledgment—that it is the law and the policy that drive the culture of the department—then we will continue to fall short of the significant change that needs to happen. The fact that this legislation is still being pursued after the Palmer report, after the Comrie report into the Vivian Solon debacle and after a range of other cases that have now become public suggests that all the talk of culture change that the government is going on with is, if not a con or a facade, certainly only partial and very much inadequate and incomplete. The culture change in the government’s and the minister’s attitude is clearly still lacking.
There are a couple of okay parts to this bill. I should emphasise that the Democrats are not opposed to directing migration cases to the Federal Magistrates Court. It is a fair enough measure and should alleviate the burden on the High Court. It has to be said that the reason the High Court is so burdened with migration cases is specifically that Labor and the Liberals in this place combined to pass a law that forced all the migration cases to go to the High Court. And then they wonder why the High Court is burdened with migration cases. Extraordinary! This legislation enables cases to be directed to the Federal Magistrates Court. As long as that court is adequately resourced and has the adequate expertise—and I think it will have to develop that a bit over time—that is okay. Ensuring identical grounds for review as a follow-on from that is okay. I think that about dispenses with the good bits.
The other much more significant and key measures in the legislation are of major concern. It should be emphasised that the overwhelming majority of evidence that was presented to the committee inquiry expressed strong opposition to key aspects of the bill. That evidence was from the people who deal with this area day after day. Yes, a lot of them are lawyers, but the idea that there are all these dodgy lawyers out there pushing unmeritorious claims through the courts is just a joke. If you want to make money in the law you certainly do not run pro bono migration cases in the courts. That is a sure-fire way to bankruptcy, frankly.
This government should be down on its knees giving thanks to the lawyers and migration agents who, time after time, have fixed up the messes, the debacles and the shambles caused by poor decision making at the primary level. We have a Senate inquiry under way at the moment into the administration of the Migration Act. We know that there are hundreds and hundreds of problem cases. You cannot get away with the myth that says, ‘It was just Cornelia Rau,’ or ‘It was just Vivian Solon,’ or ‘It was only a couple; everyone makes a few mistakes.’ There are hundreds of them. There are 220 cases before the Ombudsman just of people who may have been wrongfully detained. There are hundreds and hundreds of cases of hopeless mistakes at the initial decision-making stage.
Let us also look at the impact of some of the other measures that have been taken over the years. Because of this bizarre fixation on the idea that lawyers or migration agents trying to advise people of their rights under law are somehow up to no good and that we have to stop people finding out about this stuff, we have had laws passed—again, by both major parties—that prevent people from being given information about what their legal rights are unless they specifically ask for it. People in detention, people locked up indefinitely without trial or charge, cannot be informed of their legal rights unless they know to ask.
Evidence has come through, time and time again, that in many cases mistakes have been made in the early stage or mistakes have been made at the tribunal because the initial information, the initial presentation of the case, was not put forward properly. It was not put forward properly for people—and not just asylum seekers—because those people had not had proper advice at the start. They had had somebody giving them a bit of bush lawyer information, or they had had people saying, ‘Oh, you’d better do this,’ or they had been getting nods and winks from people all over the place. If things go wrong at the initial stage, it can take years to unpick it all when people who have the expertise actually get involved. If people were given enough assistance through increased funding for legal aid and increased encouragement to provide that advice, whether pro bono or otherwise, all the information would be properly presented at the start and a proper decision would be made at the start. That would save everybody an enormous amount of stress, heartache and expense, and it would alleviate the burden on the courts.
Migration agents, lawyers and people who are having problems with the Migration Act are people who hate the courts being clogged up more than anybody else. They do not like unmeritorious claims. They do not like having delays. It is about time there was recognition that everybody wants things to work better. There is not a bunch of people out there trying to dodge the system all the time. If we could get rid of this culture of automatic suspicion and negativity about everybody who puts in a claim, we would go a long way to reversing the problem.
There is a section in the committee report that does provide some suggestions about other ways to fix the problem, and they inevitably go back to the consistency, quality and transparency of decision making at the tribunal level and at the department level, and improving the availability of legal advice with assistance before the tribunals. What we have instead in this bill are extraordinary measures that send a signal to people that discourages them from providing advice.
We have a measure in this bill that raises the prospect of people being fined for encouraging people to engage in unmeritorious claims. This measure, apart from sending a very bad signal to people who may be considering providing advice, inasmuch as it will have any effect if it ever does get used, will lead to more litigation. It moves on from the tried and tested, carefully constructed common law test that currently exists. That allows cases to be summarily dismissed if they are manifestly groundless, hopeless or bound to fail, and it introduces a new one. It introduces a new, lower threshold of a case having ‘no reasonable prospect of success’, but it does not define that.
We have terms that everybody understands that have been built up over years and years of common law practice of something being ‘hopeless’ or ‘bound to fail’, and we are putting that to one side and saying: ‘Well, now you can toss it out if it has no reasonable prospect of success.’ But nobody knows what that means, and they will not know what that means until a whole bunch of people take a whole bunch of court cases to find out what it means. In the meantime, we have a section in the bill that says no person—not just a lawyer or a migration agent—can encourage another person to commence or continue migration litigation if it has no reasonable prospect of success.
Theoretically—and who knows how it will apply, because nobody knows for sure how laws will be interpreted—even electorate officers and staff of parliamentarians who say to somebody, ‘I think you should put in a court case or a claim, just to be safe,’ or anybody who says anything at any stage that could be interpreted as encouraging a person to continue litigation, could come under this provision. That might not happen, but nobody knows. If, in particular, you are providing pro bono assistance or if you are a vastly overstretched community legal centre and your people are already putting themselves out to provide assistance, to have this extra, unknown, undefined, uncertain provision inserted in the law, saying that you will be breaching the act if you encourage somebody to continue litigation, is a clear disincentive.
I can say quite clearly that the South Brisbane Immigration and Community Legal Service, for example, provides an enormous service and great assistance. It does a lot of work fixing up DIMIA’s mistakes. People there are now already less inclined to provide advice because of this provision. It might never be used or people might never be caught by it, but they do not know. When they are already in a position where they are not flush with funds then they do not need an extra disincentive. So these sorts of measures not only are not going to work but are counterproductive. They undermine long-established legal principles across the entire Migration Act, which deals with millions of cases and visa applications each year, and they potentially undermine principles across broader areas of the law as well.
The Senate committee report clearly identifies the strong concerns that a range of people have with that particular aspect of the legislation. It clearly identifies concerns with putting in rigid and inflexible time limits, as well as raising question marks about whether that will be found to be constitutional when it comes to the High Court. That again shows that this is not well thought through. It is knee-jerk stuff that perpetuates the continuation of a culture that has been shown to have failed.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-10-12,"—I have spoken many times in this chamber about the significant failings of the Left in the 20th century. You will recall that some of my colleagues believe that economic mismanagement and the lunacy of socialist economics in impoverishing thousands of millions of people last century were the greatest failings of the Left. As you know, I disagree with that. The Left’s greatest failing was, as I term it, their belief in moral equivalence: the implicit assumption that all political systems are basically equal and that all political systems are equally legitimate expressions of a political culture—that liberal democracy in Australia is not inherently superior to, say, communism in the People’s Republic of China. This explains the silence of the Left in criticising Maoist China between 1949 and 1976—a period of perhaps the largest loss of life through crimes of commission and omission in the course of human history. This is the Left’s greatest failing.
But today, you will be pleased to know, I want to talk about moral equivalence with a twist. Whereas in the 20th century the debate was about the moral equivalence of the political ideologies of nation states, moral equivalence is invoked in far more sensitive and difficult contexts today. In particular, moral equivalence is invoked in issues relating not to the nation state but to the individual—the moral equivalence of values and of culture. These are enormously sensitive issues. It is no longer about a nation’s political ideology but matters of an individual’s heart and soul.
Are all values and cultures morally equal? That is a difficult and very sensitive question. If they are not, how does a multicultural nation manage the inevitable tension between different values and different cultures? The challenge we face now is even more formidable, and the stakes of adopting a morally equivalent approach perhaps even greater, than during the great political clashes in the 20th century.
At the heart of liberal democracy is the Lockean social contract, in which the citizens grant the state the right to govern in exchange for security and other social benefits. During the Cold War, some commentators adopted a morally equivalent approach, but this did not fundamentally endanger Australian society. The state remained to protect its citizens from external threat. But the question today is: can we afford to resort to such equivalency when challenges to Australian democratic values emerge from within the state and undermine the very basis of that Lockean social contract that so legitimises democratic governance? What happens when the dangers posed to our society emerge from one of our fellow citizens?
Considerable attention has already been devoted to the implications of transnational terrorism, but too often our political sensitivities cause us to view this phenomenon through a traditionalist lens. We continue to see the state as a self-contained unit threatened by an external threat, rather than boldly confronting political realities. What the London bombings strikingly demonstrated was that terrorism is as much a product of dynamics within the state as of dynamics outside the state. The youths who instigated the London attacks were not transnational agents but second-generation, soccer-playing Britons indoctrinated by religious fanaticism. The London bombings prompted British commentators to openly debate and fundamentally re-evaluate the ways in which Britain managed ethnic diversity through policies promoting multiculturalism.
Britain is an open and pluralist society that embraces freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion. It sponsors diversity and supports a wide array of ethnic communities. But to what extent are these democratic rights unconditional? What obligations does multiculturalism presuppose to ensure an integrated national community instead of a polarised one, fractured along lines of ethnic division and hatred? These questions are no less pertinent to our own society. Australians have not yet been forced to endure a terrorist attack on our own shores. But the tyranny of distance has not protected us from political and religious extremism that, over time, could potentially erode the basis of a multicultural and tolerant Australian society.
Over the past few months, a number of Melbourne based radical Islamic clerics have made claims opposing the idea of democracy and advocating that sharia law transcend law forged by national legislators. In one 60 Minutes interview a radical Islamic cleric argued that Australia should become a Muslim society. Some religious extremists have even also made statements that if women are dressed provocatively they have only themselves to blame if they are raped, and that homosexuality is a crime deserving death.
Such statements and practices directly contravene the very basis of liberty that lies at the heart of our Western democratic system. Freedom of speech is a prerogative of Australian democracy, but how do we deal with situations in which this right is used to advocate the spread of illiberal practices? If we are to accept such statements and practices, how are we then to protect and assuage the fears of Australia’s citizens? Our concern for cultural sensitivity and political correctness should not be allowed to render our own domestic political traditions and our own commitments to human rights meaningless. To accept such practices in the name of multiculturalism would be to erode the fundamental underpinnings of the modern liberal state—an aim consistent with that of the terrorists and exponents of political and religious extremism.
Tolerating the intolerant no matter what the price is a mistaken strategy. We are not obliged to tolerate certain practices that go against what our society fundamentally stands for, nor can we expect people to be tolerant towards other members of society if at the same time they are denigrated. Tolerance has to be bounded and reciprocated if it is to be enduring.
Those who advocate tolerance at all costs so as to protect Australia’s image as a multicultural nation fundamentally misinterpret the concept of multiculturalism and what it entails. Multicultural policies have been implemented to foster respect for ethnic diversity, and that is a good thing. But diversity is not an end in itself. Diversity has been the means by which we have sought to build a better Australia, but diversity of itself was never the aim. To emphasise diversity is to perpetuate difference. Our aim surely was always to have a country where citizens, whatever their origin, came together as one. A unified country reflecting common values is a much stronger nation than one that simply celebrates diversity. Multiculturalism is fundamentally about the celebration of many cultures coming together as one and providing support for the special needs of ethnic and migrant groups as they continue to integrate into Australian society.
The coalition has been active in promoting multicultural policies through such measures as the Living in Harmony initiative. The Howard government’s commitment to multiculturalism is evident in the National Multicultural Advisory Council’s 1999 report A new agenda for multicultural Australia. This report advocates respect for:
... the right of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage within an overriding commitment to Australia.
Yet it notes simultaneously that multiculturalism:
... is not an ‘anything goes’ concept since it is built on core societal values of mutual respect, tolerance and harmony, the rule of law and our democratic principles and institutions ...
The 2003 update to this report states:
The freedom of all Australians to express and share their cultural values is dependent on their abiding by mutual civic obligations. All Australians are expected to have an overriding loyalty to Australia and its people, and to respect the basic structures and principles underwriting our democratic society.
Conditions of Australian citizenship entail rights and privileges but also assume obligations and responsibilities. Australia should therefore pursue multicultural policies but should not, at the same time, sacrifice its own character for the sake of excessive political correctness. As John Roskam from the Institute of Public Affairs recently commented:
Democracy is not a suicide pact ... There’s no obligation for those who believe in a healthy, vibrant, liberal democracy to tolerate intolerance.
Social liberty is mixed with responsibility. It represents a process of give and take. It is not absolute.
These realisations, during a time in which radicalism is escalating in the West, prompt us to fundamentally revise Australia’s own multicultural policies. As the government instigates its review of these policies, it is important to recognise that multiculturalism must be based on a commitment to shared Australian values and democratic principles in addition to a commitment to respect diversity. This is not to advocate an assimilationist approach. I for one do not want an Australian society homogenised without any regard to the cultural traditions of its citizens. Neither should we deny funding to those services that provide migrants with language or other forms of social or economic support. However, whatever approach the government adopts should be based on pursuing social integration and interaction. It should not weaken that state by purposefully perpetuating and accentuating social division. The idea of coexistence is too easy and obscures more serious social difficulties.
So how are these problems to be resolved? On surveying recent legislation in both Britain and the United States, a number of possibilities come to mind. Firstly, it is important to maintain, and to further consolidate, existing links with the Australian Islamic community. This community has been integral in assisting the Australian government to dampen religious and political extremism through direct communications with radical Islamic clerics and by liaising with the Australian government in the summit that took place last August. Cooperation with the Islamic community is integral if we are to prevent alienation of second generation Islamic youths. It is important, too, that the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils continues to adopt a consistent approach on this issue and reinforces messages about the importance of shared Australian values and the authority of Australia’s liberal democratic institutions.
Secondly, a number of commentators have recently pointed to the comparative advantages of the American model of multiculturalism vis-a-vis the British model. The American model emphasises the importance of a sense of shared national identity that must exist concomitantly with loyalties to other ethnic groups. It has emphasised the shared glue that exists between different ethnic communities. This is encapsulated by the United States’ motto ‘E pluribus unum’—in many, one. However, emphasis on unity in and of itself is not necessarily enough to provide the sense of belonging necessary for immigrants—and, indeed, for all Australians. More viable long-term options might include integrating to a greater extent knowledge of Australian history, government and civic values into the Australian high school curriculum. Providing greater encouragement for permanent residents to take up citizenship, but also strengthening tests that candidates take to acquire that citizenship, might be another avenue through which a more integrationist multicultural society might develop.
All of these measures are important to ensuring long-term solutions to Australia’s multicultural dilemmas, but they are not sufficient. What we really need to do is to ask the really hard questions and not shy away from them under the cloak of political correctness. How do we include those individuals who do not want to be included? And to what extent should tolerance prevail? For too long these questions have been avoided for fear of further alienating individuals. But doing nothing will also alienate people.
Samuel Huntington wrote about the inevitability of the clash of civilisations. He depicts a world which is increasingly divided along cultural and religious fault lines and argues that globalisation has only exacerbated the divide. Yet he underrepresents the human capacity to overcome this divide. In the domestic context, the key to doing so is to forge multicultural policies based on respect for difference and civic obligation. We must not allow cultural pluralism free rein, to the extent that it erodes the very civil liberties we seek to protect. I believe that the words Winston Churchill once used during the Second World War are equally applicable to our circumstances today:
We do not war primarily with races as such. Tyranny is our foe, whatever trappings or disguise it wears, whatever language it speaks, be it external or internal, we must forever be on our guard, ever mobilised, ever vigilant, always ready to spring at its throat. In all this, we march together.
The famous song I am Australian got it wrong. It is not quite right to say, as the song does, ‘We are one, but we are many.’ It should instead say, ‘We are many, but we are one.’ When all Australians come to share this understanding we will be a greater nation still.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Moral Equivalence and Multiculturalism</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2005-10-12,"—My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer the minister to his answer to my question yesterday when he said that the new minimum standards did not need to include redundancy pay because it was protected by state legislation. Is the minister aware that on page 11 of the government’s information booklet it specifically lists only five aspects of state employment law that may continue to apply under the new system? Can the minister confirm that redundancy pay is not included in that list? Is this yet another aspect of the government’s plans that the minister does not understand or was he deliberately seeking to mislead the Senate? Given that the government’s own literature confirms that the minister got it wrong yesterday, can the minister now indicate once and for all why redundancy pay was not included in the new minimum standards?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2005-10-12,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that a national minimum standard for redundancy pay has been in place since 1984? Wasn’t that national standard enhanced by the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission on 26 March 2004, which provided workers with a minimum right to redundancy pay of up to 16 weeks pay? Why has the Howard government ignored existing minimum standards by refusing to include any protection for redundancy pay under its new system?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-10-12,"—There was no misleading of the Senate, but I will get onto the subject of misleading the Senate after I have answered the specific matters of the honourable senator’s question. Under WorkChoices, where an employee has been made redundant on the basis of operational requirements or on grounds which include this reason, the employee will be excluded from making an unfair dismissal claim. However, WorkChoices will guarantee that such employees will continue to be able to access unlawful termination provisions.
—What about redundancy?
—Just wait, would you? This means that an employee would be able to seek redress if the employee was made redundant for operational reasons and he or she was terminated for discriminatory reasons—for example, because of race or age. In addition, the employer must give the required period of notice of termination or else compensate the employee as prescribed by the legislation.
Under WorkChoices the Australian government will ensure that employees covered by relevant awards made redundant as a result of operational requirements are entitled to redundancy and termination payments. The government will also be reinstating an exemption from the requirement to provide redundancy pay for small businesses of fewer than 15 employees. This exemption had previously existed in the federal system since 1984 and similar provisions also exist in state systems. This will not prevent small businesses from reaching agreement with their employees to make redundancy payments.
I was also asked about misleading statements to the Senate. Indeed, Senator Hurley asserted in one of her questions that there was a specific employee under an AWA at Banjo’s bakery. When confronted with the fact that this was not the case, Senator Marshall got up during the take note of questions debate yesterday to try to fudge and say that Senator Hurley—it was Senator Wortley, I am sorry—was talking about 50. They cannot have it both ways. Just imagine if Senator Marshall went to Aussies and asked for a cup of coffee then, when confronted with one cup of coffee, said, ‘And where are the other 49?’ Come on—you know that you were dissembling yesterday, Senator Marshall. I apologise for talking across the chamber, Mr President. Somebody with a modicum of intelligence must acknowledge that he was seeking to dissemble and reconstruct for the honourable senator a situation from which he had no escape—
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I would ask you to call the minister to the question. He is seeking to debate yesterday’s taking note debate. He was free to join in if he wanted to on that occasion. Now it is question time. He was asked whether or not his answer yesterday regarding redundancy pay was wrong. I think the answer to that is yes. But can you call him back to the question about whether workers will be entitled under state legislation to redundancy pay as he claimed yesterday or whether that is wrong?
—Senator Evans, I believe Senator Abetz has been answering the question, but I would remind him that he still has a minute left to complete his answer.
—The problem with Senator Evans and the opposition at the moment is that they are trying to put a whole load of questions into the one question and then they want to cherry-pick and demand that I only answer one question. I was specifically asked about the misleading of the Senate and I have been answering that specifically, exposing that sort of conduct by the Australian Labor Party. They put a horrific story into the media. When that is exposed as being wrong, they then dissemble and try to reconstruct to make it sound good. It was like Tancred Fresh with Mr Stephen Smith.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-10-12,"—My question is to the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister outline to the Senate why the government is reforming Australia’s so-called unfair dismissal laws? Will the minister also outline how workers will continue to be protected from unfair dismissal under WorkChoices, and is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-10-12,"—I thank Senator Troeth for her question and note that she is the distinguished chair of the Senate’s Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. The government is reforming Australia’s so-called unfair dismissal laws because they are a disincentive for job creation. They are a failed experiment of the Keating government that are holding back employment growth in this country. They are a failed social experiment which are not necessary to protect the workers of this country from unfair dismissals because, even after these laws are removed, Australian workers will continue to be protected from unlawful dismissals on grounds including trade union membership—those opposite will be pleased—family responsibilities, pregnancy, temporary absence from work due to illness or injury, religion, gender et cetera. Further, for the first time ever, the Howard government will make legal advice to the value of $4,000 available to assist workers in pursuing such cases of unlawful dismissal.
Those on the other side like to pretend that there is no evidence of the job destroying nature of these unfair laws, but the fact is, indeed all the evidence shows, quite the contrary. Indeed, a survey by Dun and Bradstreet shows that 18 per cent of employers, that is only 200,000 employers, would be likely to employ more people if unfair dismissal laws were removed. It seems like a no-brainer to me.
—You should know!
—Even Labor knows it, as Senator Hutchins interjects. It is time for today’s ‘who said it?’, Senator Hutchins. I ask those opposite to listen very carefully. Who said this about the Keating government’s unfair dismissal laws: ‘We were very careful in releasing our industrial relations policy to say we would not reflect in New South Wales’ industrial law the so-called unfair dismissal provision that is in the federal act. I happen to believe after talking to the business community—I am in touch with the business community. I’m interested in them making investment decisions to generate jobs in this state—I happen to believe that the provision in the federal act is a disincentive to take on workers. We are careful to delineate in the policy we are putting forward that there be nothing that echoes that unfair dismissal provision. I’ve got to say that the unions in this state have accepted that position as well. It is something that has united both them and employer opinion.’ Who said this? Those opposite know. It was a former Labor leader. It was a former Labor opposition leader who, being desperate to get into government, knew that he could not reflect the federal unfair dismissal laws in the state of New South Wales. Those words were spoken in 1995 by the then Leader of the Opposition from the Labor Party, Bob Carr, who went on to become Premier. We have a situation whereby a premier like Bob Carr knew the facts. Even the unions in New South Wales cooperated because they knew the laws were job destroying. Mr Beazley must know it. Everybody knows it, and it is about time the Labor Party recognised the wisdom of what Bob Carr said in 1995.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-10-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked today relating to proposed changes to industrial relations.
Firstly, I note the time it took and the great difficulty which my colleague Senator Conroy had in asking a question—indeed, that was denied leave by the Leader of the Government in the Senate—and making a reasonable point of order. However, that is not the subject of my taking note. What an appalling performance that was today. Let us get back to the issue of industrial relations. Senator Abetz was up there like a schoolboy in a sweat today, pretending that he knew what the government IR package is about but, being so high on rhetoric and so low on actual facts, he could not explain it to save himself. The bottom line with the government’s industrial relations changes—the so-called WorkChoices—is that they absolutely show that this government is pursuing an ideological vendetta against Australia’s trade unions and against working people throughout this nation.
Senator Abetz was not able to answer basic questions about the provisions of their industrial relations package. He was not able to explain what would happen to redundancy entitlements under awards. In fact, he read the wrong brief—the unfair dismissal brief. He was not able to answer questions about the hotline or the reference material that the people servicing the hotline are using. In answering Senator Wong’s question—a very specific question about whether penalty rates, allowances and overtime loading can be removed in an AWA—Senator Abetz misled this chamber. He stood up and said, ‘What you have, you keep.’ That is not true. If it were true, the Prime Minister would be able to say that no worker will be worse off. The Prime Minister is not saying that no worker will be worse off, because workers will be worse off, and what workers have under their awards is able to be taken away from them. Public holidays, rest breaks, incentive based payments, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates, and shift and overtime loadings are up for grabs. Senator Abetz chose to be selective in what he read from the WorkChoices booklet, but the document says:
A Collective Agreement or AWA under WorkChoices need simply set out how the new agreement will either change or remove these matters in that agreement.
The agreement will need to identify the particular award conditions that are being removed. Senator Abetz misled the chamber on that point this afternoon. What workers have they will not be able to keep if the employer chooses to remove those provisions, and there is nothing that anyone from the Howard government can say to deny that, because it is there in black and white in their booklet.
It is also worth while reflecting on some of the comments made by Senator Abetz to the question Senator Murray asked. Senator Murray asked a question about the effect on the Australian economy, and I think it is quite extraordinary that Senator Abetz implied that this is somehow the only way that Australians will have access to work. How does that work, when unemployment has dropped and the minimum wage has risen—albeit more than I think the Howard government would have liked it to? In a growing economy, unemployment has dropped, wages have risen and the government is trying to mount an argument that downward pressure on wages will help unemployment. It actually does not stack up. The Howard government cannot use economic arguments to justify this particular package. How can you, when the facts and experience show that, even over the last nine long years of the Howard government, their own arguments have been undermined by the reality and trends in the workplace with wages and economic growth?
What we are actually seeing here is an ideological vendetta. The Howard government have pursued this. They get excited about VSU and industrial relations. We know they have no practical knowledge of workplace reality. You only need to turn to the example of a young person who is in the workplace for the first time. Do they have any power in negotiating an agreement with their employer? Absolutely not. I speak of my own experience as a 16-year-old, when I became a builder’s labourer. Did my boss tell me to put on that safety mask because I was working with asbestos? No, they did not. It was the union that told me that. It was the union that enforced the safety regulations in the workplace. It was the union that got superannuation and dignity for retirement for transient workers like building workers. It was the union that made it possible to earn a living wage from that type of work. This legislation is nothing more than an attack on trade unions and workers. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-10-12,"—What I think this debate on workplace relations has lacked is a sense of context and history. In Paul Kelly’s book The End of Certainty, he talks about the five pillars of Federation in 1901—pillars that were, in a sense, agreed to by all sides of politics. They were: imperial benevolence, White Australia, high tariffs, state paternalism and wage arbitration. Imperial benevolence has gone—we no longer rely, and can no longer rely, on the United Kingdom. White Australia, thankfully, has also gone. High tariffs have gone. State paternalism has also gone. The last one left—the last part of the settlement that Mr Kelly talks about—is wage arbitration.
The fact is that the tide of history is against the Labor Party. Wage arbitration, as it was constructed 100 years ago, is on the way out. Indeed, the role of trade unions in civil society is far less than it once was. One hundred years ago, wage arbitration was used as a form of wealth redistribution. Rather than talking about increasing the size of the cake, the trade unions spoke about cutting up the cake. I have noticed in my lifetime that the role of trade unions in civil society and in the community is diminishing. If people want to make a contribution to their community these days, they do not do it through the trade union movement. They do it through other forms of community involvement. It could be through charities, or through the church or other sorts of community consultation and obligation. That is how people do it. The role of trade unions is diminishing, and that is why, in the end, the Labor Party is on the wrong side of history.
You might ask: why has that happened? Not only has civil society changed but, as John Button said so eloquently in that famous Quarterly Essay article ‘Beyond belief: what future for Labor?’:
In August 2001 unions made up less than 25 per cent of the total workforce and only 19.2 per cent of the private sector workforce. (Compare this to 1978 when union membership made up 57 per cent of the workforce.) Unions affiliated with the ALP represent less than 15 per cent of the workforce.
So another reason is that the Labor Party does not even represent the labour movement anymore. Finally, the real reason why the Labor Party is on the wrong side of history—and the Rt Hon. Tony Blair understood this; the Australian Labor Party is yet to understand it, but the English Labour Party accepted it—is that job security is derived not from a form of wage arbitration or industrial regulation but from a strong economy, pure and simple. All the regulation of wages and labour in the world will not save jobs. It did not save jobs during the Great Depression. It did not save jobs during the ‘recession we had to have’.
Why is unemployment so low today? Why is it at five per cent? I will tell you why. It is because the economy is so strong. Any system of arbitration or industrial relations regulation that is not conducive to flexibility and a growing economy is a system that does not work, will force employers to lay people off and costs jobs. The English Labour Party understood this. This is one thing that the Australian Labor Party are going to have to come to terms with over the next few years, whether they like it or not. The English Labour Party understood that the only way to secure good jobs for the future in a globalised economy is through a strong economy. No system of industrial arbitration or wage regulation will solve that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,11,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-10-12,"—If there is one thing that is clear from the contribution by Senator Mason it is that he knows absolutely nothing about industrial relations and industrial relations issues.
—I know about history, George.
—We are not talking about history.
—Yes, we are.
—We are talking about the current environment. We are talking about the future that you are trying to create, not the history that we have come from. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about a government that is hell-bent on using its powers to create a set of circumstances in this country where workers will be oppressed and suppressed and where the balance of power in the workplace will be shifted to employers.
You have only to look at what happened with the question asked by Senator Marshall of Senator Abetz—which Senator Abetz could not answer—about the application of the code of conduct in the building industry in Victoria. You introduced legislation in the building industry and made it retrospective so that unions and employers or companies in Victoria could not do certain things. They accepted that situation and sat down and negotiated amongst themselves arrangements for their industry into the future. What did you do as a government? You moved in in the middle of it, after they negotiated the agreements and registered the agreements legally, under the laws that stood at the time, and arbitrarily changed the regulations. You changed the rules. You shifted the goalposts. You changed the goalposts from AFL to Rugby League. You changed the nature of the game and penalised them as a result of it.
Is that what we can expect under the new laws that you are introducing if they do not get the outcomes that you expect to get and you do not get the cut in wages of workers that you expect to get? Will you keep shifting the goalposts on the AWAs? Will you keep shifting the goalposts on the powers you give to the Office of the Employment Advocate? Will you keep shifting the goalposts on the restrictions you put upon unions and their capacity to operate in the work force? If you have done this in respect of the building industry then we can expect you to do it in the rest of industry.
I found it interesting on opening the papers this morning to see, in every newspaper I opened, four pages of intense propaganda on behalf of the government, selling the government’s message about its industrial reform. It was not informing the Australian public about the IR changes. It was nothing more than propaganda. Again, it was full of this government’s Orwellian doublespeak—say one thing, mean another. Tell people you are good, but at the end the reality is that you are bad. It was full of it.
Senator Abetz was asked a question about the expenditure on this campaign. He said he did not know. He is the minister responsible for it. He is the minister who sits down and chairs the meetings with the cabinet, ministers or whomever his meetings are with. He determines the government’s spend on advertising, yet he has the cheek to come into this chamber and say that he does not know, not even within a ballpark figure, how much money they are spending on the advertising campaign. You would not have to be a genius to know that a very significant amount of Australia’s tax dollar is going into this campaign. It is money that could be going to creating jobs. It could be invested in training in skills, hospitals and a whole range of other services that the Australian community is crying out for.
This government has no difficulty finding money to promote its own ideological agendas when it suits it, but when it comes to finding money to deal with some of the social problems we have in this country, that is a totally different matter. You are sitting on a $13 billion surplus at the moment, yet you will do nothing about trying to remove the burden of increased petrol costs and charges on the businesses of this country.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2005-10-12,"—I want to continue where my colleague Senator Brett Mason left off—although I will perhaps not be as eloquent as he was. Firstly, I have lived and worked on both sides of politics. I have been a member of five unions—obviously, in my younger days. I have been a member of the Waterside Workers Federation, when at 14 years of age I was working on the wharves in Port Lincoln in South Australia assisting in loading wheat boats. Wheat boat loads in those days were made up of bags. I was a 14-year-old working on a ship in the middle of summer.
—Don’t worry about it. I worked on them too.
—It did me good, but it was not the unions that did me good. I soon recognised where my fortunes lay and it was not in being a unionist. Then I was an apprentice plasterer and the union secretary was Jimmy Cavanagh, who became a minister in the Whitlam government. Jim was a nice little fellow, innocuous—would not set the world on fire—and trustworthy, but Jim never got me a job. The union secretary of the plasterers society never got me a single job. The union never did anything for me. All I did when I was 16 was work like a man and get paid like a boy. That is what the union did for me—nothing at all.
I joined the police union when I came out of national service and that was a little better. They seemed to be a lot more in touch with the idea of a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. There was nothing of the Arthur Scargills about the police union in South Australia or the one which I forgot to name and have never been a part of in Western Australia either. Not surprisingly, I was part of Actors Equity. Some people say I should still be part of it, but, in fact, I am not. Actors Equity was never meant for anyone who was used to hard work. But the union did put pressure on. You did not have to work in Actors Equity; it was a slothful sort of union. One union that I did have some time for, 40 years ago, was the Australian Workers Union. It used to be a decent union. I understand that Senator Ludwig’s father was a great mover and shaker in the Australian Workers Union in Queensland. He was a decent bloke by all standards. The Australian Workers Union throughout Australia was quite a decent union. I do not mean that in an oxymoronic sense. I got to know that my future, and the future of any children I was likely to have, and did have, was not through the union movement or organised labour. My future was through an organisation that allowed reward for effort. My future was through an organisation that allowed me to pursue excellence. You cannot pursue excellence in a unionised organisation. You do not necessarily get reward for effort in a union organisation.
What about the ALP and the Australian labour movement? Who wants to be a member of a labour organisation? It sounds like you should be wearing crosses or something on white uniforms. It seems like something is amiss in the third millennium when the only alternative to the conservative movement is a labour movement. It does not seem to right to me. Arthur Scargill confirmed for me that the union organisation throughout the world—as the Anglo-Saxon world knew it, anyway—was at an end when, in his selfishness, he brought the coalmines in England, Scotland and Wales to a halt. He brought about their demise with a little assistance from the now Baroness Thatcher. The labour movement is finished in Australia, and thank the Lord for that. It is finished here. Not much more than 10 per cent of the private sector are unionised. Fifty-odd per cent were unionised after the First World War. What is it today that drives people to do it?
The Australian Labor Party keeps on saying that we are going to cut wages and minimum awards. We will not cut minimum and award classified wages. With over 4,000 different awards, no doubt they will be organised or reorganised. The $450 minimum legal wage for a 21-year-old will stay. We will not remove protection from unlawful termination. Unfair dismissal remains illegal. We will not abolish awards. Some awards that ought to be abolished are for those people who want to get into the top end of town. I am only sorry that I have not got 10 minutes, 15 minutes or even half an hour to speak here today. Coming from both sides of the working spectrum, I can tell you that I know what you are about and you are on the wrong track. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-10-12,"—What a difference a day makes in this place. Yesterday we had Senator Abetz extolling the virtues of the hotline, referring us and everyone else in Australia to the magical hotline if we wanted further information about this supposed reform package. Today we learned that it is not actually a hotline that will answer your questions; it is just a hotline that will give you a bit of information and basically acts as a clearing house for sending out the glossy brochure—the one that you cannot download from the computer. As I learned when I rang the hotline, down there in Tasmania—I have to congratulate Senator Abetz on making sure that the hotline people are based in Tasmania—they do not even know what a collective agreement is. So they cannot even answer the most fundamental questions on this reform package.
While Senator Lightfoot’s contributions may be amusing as always, in Western Australia you can have all the glossy booklets and television and newspaper ads that you like, full of smiling, singing and happy faces with all the slogans and rhetoric—and precious little in the way of detail—but it just will not work. This is the same system that the people of Western Australia have rejected. It will not work. This advertising campaign, that is costing so much money that the government will not tell us how much, will use our money, taxpayers’ money, to attempt to convince people that they can apparently rely on the government to look after their interests—but only by removing their rights, as far as I can work out. The government is saying, ‘You can rely on us’ but you cannot rely on the hotline.
As I was saying, it is not going to work in Western Australia because those of us who have lived through this have experienced what these so-called WorkChoices deliver. We have seen the cases of people, especially those in low skilled occupations, who have engaged in a race to the bottom through insidious workplace agreements. We have seen cases like the one that was recently drawn to the attention of the Office of the Employment Advocate of an AWA that had a proposed hourly rate of $6.90. It was a flat rate, no matter what hour of the day you were forced to work and no matter how many hours you worked in the week. It stripped away all other conditions. What was the Office of the Employment Advocate’s concern for those employees? They said, ‘That agreement looks okay, as long as the rate is upped to $7.15 an hour. We do not care about anything else.’ This $7.15 an hour is an all-up rate. It includes sick pay, public holiday pay, weekend and late penalty shifts, split shift allowance—the full conditions for someone working in the hospitality industry.
When you look at the terms of the AWA for the employee that I am talking about you will see that, before her trade union took up the matter with the Office of the Employment Advocate, she was paid $472.38 less than the award would have given her for the same period. This is so-called reform; this is the so-called ‘we’re going to create jobs and look after people and nobody is going to be worse off’ reform. This is an example of what happened in Western Australia and what the rest of Australia can now look forward to thanks to those opposite.
As I said, you were paid a flat $7.15 an hour, no matter what hour of the day or night you were required to work in the hospitality industry, as opposed to the normal hourly rate between Monday and Friday. On Saturdays and Sundays, under the award you should have been paid $8.99 an hour. It should have been $14.98 per hour on a public holiday. And there should have been sick leave, leave loading and a whole lot of other conditions that help to make life on a family budget a lot easier for an apprentice or a low-income earner. There were additional rates on ordinary hours for things like overtime. What was in the agreement? Nothing. What should have been under the award? It should have been $1.35 or $1.41 per hour, depending on whether the extra hours were worked before or after 7 pm. There was the split shift allowance. What was in the agreement? Nothing. What should have been there? It should have been $2.22 per day. As we know, split shifts are quite common in the hospitality industry. Hours of work were 40 hours a week, weren’t they? The award said it should have been 76 hours per fortnight. Overtime, if you were lucky to get it, was a flat 1.5 times the hourly rate for the first 104 hours of overtime you worked. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-12,"—What we have seen today in question time and particularly from the quite extraordinary performances of the Liberal Party contributors to this debate, Senators Mason and Lightfoot, is what this whole issue is really about. It is really just about Liberal Party ideologues finally having the chance to win their ideological wars. We had a version of the history wars from Senator Mason; we had Senator Lightfoot giving his life story and his disdain for unions and the union movement. If Senator Lightfoot or anyone else does not want to join a union, they do not have to. We do not have compulsory unionism in this country, and that is a good thing. But to prevent people who wish to be part of a union from doing so is abhorrent; it is against freedom of choice. In this chamber just last night legislation was passed that contained a clause which invalidated any collective-bargaining agreement that was put forward by a union. That is grotesque, pointless, counterproductive, ideologically driven and sticking it in the neck of the unions just because you can. That is what this government is doing now that it has the power in the Senate.
The simple fact is that this is not, and should not be, about the government seizing its chance to finally win its century-long ideological battle and sticking it in the neck of the trade unions. This is not about business versus unions. This is about the people and what is best for the people. It is not a battle between government and unions or business and unions. What this government is proposing to do with its extremist, ideologically driven industrial relations changes will impact negatively on many Australians. Sure, they will help some. It is a workers market for some people in some areas, as the Prime Minister said, and they may well do better out of it, but it is quite clear that many people will do worse. Certainly, the Democrats believe that we have an obligation to ensure that some people are not left worse off, particularly because they will almost inevitably be those who are already on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum.
These changes will make things more complicated for small businesses. Big business will be fine—that is what last night’s legislation was about, as far as most in the government are concerned—but small business will find it more difficult. It may be hard for some people in the coalition to believe it, but doing things collectively, whether through a union or anything else, can be quite efficient sometimes. That is why you have things like political parties rather than a whole bunch of Independents. You all come to a collective decision and then you all vote for it. The Liberal Party does that as much as anyone else, and that is rather more efficient. It might have its downsides but it is more efficient. Similarly, when people have to determine employment agreements, workplace situations and all sorts of arrangements in the employment market, doing it collectively can be far more efficient for the employer, for the business, as well as for the employee.
On this issue Mr Howard has said, ‘Just trust me.’ He says that he is running on his record and that his record in the industrial relations area has delivered certain things, so just trust him on the changes he wants to make now. But the fact is that the record of the Howard government, in terms of legislation in the industrial relations area over the last nine years, is not Mr Howard’s record; it is, quite frankly, the Democrats’ record. It is the Democrats who have chosen what has passed through the Senate in the industrial relations area. We have been able to take off the ideological extremism of what the Howard government has continually put forward and we have still delivered many pieces of amended legislation that have been responsible for some of the significant economic improvements that have provided some of the gains that have occurred, but with significant protections that have delivered good results for many people. They could still do with some tweaking, as they always do, but this government wants to take away those protections. This is the first time that John Howard has had a chance to implement his agenda without those protections, without the safeguards of the Senate and what the Democrats have been able to provide. So there is nothing to go by on the basis of Mr Howard’s record, because he has had to temper that record on the basis of the rational and constructive approach of the Democrats in the Senate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-10-12,"—As we all know, this week is National Mental Health Week, a time when carers, sufferers, advocates, academics, policy makers, communities and indeed politicians promote greater awareness and understanding of mental illness. Mental illness will affect about one in five Australians, or 20 per cent, at some stage in their lives, so everyone in this chamber is going to be affected in some way at some time. For those aged between 18 and 24 the figure skyrockets to 27 per cent, or close to one in three. As Dr Pat McGorry from ORYGEN in Melbourne told many of us yesterday:
For those in this age group, mental illness is by far their most serious health issue.
Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness, with one in 10 adults being affected. Half of those experience anxiety so crippling it will affect every aspect of their lives. This is followed by affective disorders at 5.8 per cent, of which depression is 5.1 per cent, and substance abuse disorders, at 7.7 per cent, of which 6½ per cent are alcohol related. Each year a further 20,000 Australians are found to have a mental illness. With only about half of those with a mental illness actually receiving treatment, this figure is only half the story.
Mental illness in all its forms places enormous and growing burdens on Australia. There are social and family burdens on communities, carers, families and sufferers of mental illness. There are economic burdens—both the cost of caring for and treating those in our society who suffer from mental illness and, very importantly, the lost opportunity costs for those people who, through mental illness, withdraw or are withdrawn from an active working life because the stresses they are trying to deal with mean that they cannot cope with work for long periods of time. What is often forgotten is the cost to civil society of mental illness—that, by not giving priority to supporting those with mental illness in practical ways, we confine them to a life of exclusion. Nothing could describe that better than the words of distraught mother Tilly Brasche, who yesterday told the Parliamentary Friends of Schizophrenia about her son Riley. In her speech she said:
... because of the stigma associated with mental illness in our society and the lack of citizenship opportunities provided for mentally ill people, Riley became an isolated individual—when it was his simple desire to be an independent useful member of society.
He wanted to be independent and enjoy the normal relationships that we all take for granted in our mentally well lives.
He wanted employment that would have given him a sense of achievement and self-esteem; and he wanted to live with dignity in safe accommodation—and none of these things happened for him.
How frustrating and distressing it was for carers, advocates and people like Tilly and Riley—God rest his poor soul—to hear Minister Abbott’s Mental Health Week announcement that $63 million had been sent back to Treasury because this government was not able to spend the money on addressing mental health issues in our communities. It is a national disgrace. The minister and every senator opposite should hang their heads in shame.
I have here the Howard government’s mental health policy from the last election. The 2001 budget promise was $120 million. The 2004 election promise was to:
... provide a funding increase of $30 million over 4 years to enable an expansion of the Initiative to address new issues such as the need for better integration of mental health, drug and alcohol and suicide prevention activities and additional support for GPs and their patients in rural and remote communities.
It was a $150 million gold plated promise. As we have seen so often with this government and a mental health minister that gave new meaning to ‘rock solid’ and ‘ironclad’, this promise lasted only until the votes were counted. First there was a budget announcement that revised the $120 million to $102 million—that is $18 million that disappeared—then there was no evidence of the promised additional $30 million funding, and now we have a revelation that they could not even spend $63 million of the downgraded $102 million. Here we are halfway through National Mental Health Week and I have the inglorious task of informing the Senate and all of those Australians listening that, instead of the $150 million promised, mental health services have been short-changed by $63 million.
Christopher Pyne, the person to whom health minister Tony Abbott fobbed off his mental health responsibilities, has tried to say that some of this $63 million has been moved to chronic disease management items, but he fails to say how much of this actually went into mental health services. In many ways, that is beside the point. What is the greatest shame is the need to send back money to Treasury in the first place, when mental health services in this country are so stretched and many who need them cannot access them.
Professor Ian Hickie, the clinical adviser to beyondblue, recently said that the 4,000 GPs involved in Better Outcomes for Mental Health was double the 1,500 to 2,000 that the health department budgeted for when the program was introduced in 2001. GPs are still joining the program at an average rate of 54 a month, yet this government still could not find a way to spend the money. Dr Julie Thompson, chairwoman of the Better Outcomes Implementation Advisory Group, has said that because of this budget cut they:
... certainly will now struggle to improve the access of consumers—particularly in rural areas—to quality, community-based mental health care, which we were doing by linking GPs and allied health professionals, particularly psychologists, through this program.
Yet they still could not find some way to spend this money. Mental health services in rural and regional Australia are critical to community wellbeing, an issue highlighted so starkly at the drought summit in Parkes earlier this year. I know we are going to hear from the government that this is a state responsibility but, according to the national mental health report for 2004:
The main driver of growth in Commonwealth spending on mental health since 1992-93 has been ... increases in the cost of psychiatric drugs provided through the PBS. This accounted for 68% of the increase in Commonwealth spending on mental health ...
Only 7.9 per cent of Commonwealth expenditure on mental health was directed towards the National Mental Health Strategy. According to the recent national mental health report, the Commonwealth government spent just over $9 million on mental health research in the form of research grants in 2001-02. That equals 0.008 per cent—less than one-hundredth of one per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure on mental health research. This government has no excuse for breaking its promise on mental health funding and, as we know now, has no commitment to funding a comprehensive, effective national mental health strategy.
Let me now tell you about one serious incident that happened yesterday. It is about the plight of dNet, a unique online peer support and referral service for Australians living with depression. Thanks to this government, it will effectively close down on Saturday. So effective has the service been that not only has the number of users grown by 20 per cent per year, with more than one million people being assisted since 2000, but also it is used in Canada and Sweden as a model for services there. Respected mental health advocates and professionals, including Gordon Parker, the head of the Black Dog Institute, and Michael Carr-Gregg, founder of CanTeen and one of Australia’s respected psychologists, have gone on record to say that it is a great service. But this government will not fund it any more. They offered a paltry $300,000 over two years—Chris Pyne did it as a stunt on Sunrise this morning. dNet have said they simply cannot continue. So, what do we have? We have Christopher Pyne who said today that the point about dNet ‘is that they are a centre for people with depression, helping other people with depression’ and ‘it is run by volunteers’. That is a line that has come out of the minister’s office and is a disgrace. It is tacky, tasteless and dismissive. We know that it is an indictment on Christopher Pyne—and the Minister for Health and Ageing—that he should think about and treat people involved in mental health this way.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Mental Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,19,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-10-12,"—I welcome the fact that the Senate has embarked on a debate about mental health at the onset of Mental Health Week. I think it is an extremely important issue to be discussing. As Senator Stephens noted, mental illness, in any given year, will affect almost one in five Australians. Of course, over a lifetime, it impacts on many more than that; indeed, nobody’s life remains untouched by mental illness. Mental illness is a particularly social illness. What I mean by that is, if you have cancer, diabetes or some other disease, generally speaking, you will deal with it yourself, it is between you and your doctor or other health professional; if you are mentally ill, you are very likely to ensure that the impact of that illness is felt by many people around you—your family, your workmates and many other people.
It is a disease, an illness, which needs to be addressed in a better way in the future than it has been in the past. The fact that supports that statement is that, today in Australia, only something in the order of 38 per cent of those people who are mentally ill in any given year have their illness diagnosed and treated. The majority of Australians suffering mental illness remain untreated. Indeed, that enormous burden of ill health is borne by individuals and the people around them. There is no doubt that the greatest mismatch between size of problem and size of response to it occurs in the area of mental illness in this country. Despite the fact that about 30 per cent of the disease burden is borne by mental illness in this country, we only spend something in the order of 6.4 per cent of our gross health expenditure on addressing mental illness.
All that is true and, therefore, I welcome a debate about mental illness. What I do not welcome, however, is the unfortunate decision by the Labor Party to attempt to use this important opportunity for community debate about mental illness as a chance to bash the Australian government over the head for its performance on mental illness. If you were genuinely concerned about mental illness and the lack of services for mentally ill people in Australia today, Senator Stephens, you would talk about the inadequacy of the response by governments at the state and territory level in this country. That is where the greatest disservice has been done to the mentally ill in this country. That is where the most foot dragging has occurred and where, at the moment, the services available to mentally ill people are most in need.
Senator Stephens, you can shake your head about that, but that is the truth. I know it is the truth because I have been part of the Senate select committee inquiring into mental health, along with Senator Scullion and Senator Troeth. I have been travelling the length and breadth of this country hearing evidence from people. Their message is almost always the same: services at the state level—and we know which governments run those services at the moment—are sorely missing their mark. They are sorely inadequate for the size of the problem they are addressing. We know that a generation or so ago Australian mental institutions were closed down, that deinstitutionalisation was seen as a great step towards better treatment of mentally ill people—and perhaps, conceptually, it was. But the fact is that the level of spending on mental illness fell as a result of that decision and it has only recently begun to be restored by governments across Australia.
The most urgent and acute services required by mentally ill people in this country are services required at the state and territory level. They are the services in public and psychiatric hospitals, the services in the community in the nature of support services, the early diagnosis services and the services offering employment and other things like that to people with mental illness—those services which generally fall under the umbrella of state and territory government and which have not been adequately funded. I will not exempt the Commonwealth from the charge that more could be done and should have been done in the past. We have a challenge as a community, but to isolate the Howard federal government in this exercise is to take the opportunity of Mental Health Week in this country and to twist it for political purposes. It is political myopia to look at the shortcomings in Commonwealth responses to mental illness and ignore, as Senator Stephens comprehensively did in her speech, the inadequacy of services at the state and territory level.
Earlier today, Senator McLucas bemoaned the fact that there is not enough support for carers of mentally ill people and, indeed, carers of people generally in this country. We all recognise the need to more greatly support those in the community who are taking the decision on a day-to-day basis to care for people, particularly those with mental illness. But the fact also remains that we have never provided better support services through income support and other means to carers in this country than we do today. The support for carers in this community has never been at such a high level. Carer payments are at an unprecedented level, the acknowledgement and support for people in a range of ways—directly and indirectly—by the Commonwealth government is of a higher order than we have previously seen in this country. It is churlishness and selective analysis in the extreme to argue that those services are inadequate. Nothing that was done when Senator McLucas was last in government matches what is happening today in that field.
Senator Stephens bemoaned the fact that most of the increase in Commonwealth spending in mental health comes in the form of pharmaceuticals. I acknowledge that point. It is true that a very large part of the increased expenditure by the Commonwealth has been in the area of drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. But let us not forget that at the moment, with the present state of knowledge, pharmaceuticals are the most significant treatment option available for many people suffering from mental illness. We do not have a sophisticated armoury of treatments available for many mental illnesses, as we do for other forms of illness. Wish as we might, we do not have them. It has been made clear in evidence to the committee inquiry that I have been a part of that support for people through the availability of affordable pharmaceuticals is an extremely important part of our response to mental illness. As a community, we might wish that there was less reliance on drugs. But the fact is that in many respects they are the chief form of treatment that many psychiatrists and doctors turn to.
The remarks made about depressioNet by Senator Stephens were, frankly, beneath contempt. It is simply not true to say that, thanks to this government, depressioNet will close down. This government has not been depressioNet’s principal source of funding to date. It has had other sources of funding, and those other sources of funding have apparently dried up. The Commonwealth government has offered to come to the party to the tune of $300,000. Apparently, that is not enough for depressioNet. I am sorry to hear that, for depressioNet’s sake, but to blame the Commonwealth because it is not prepared to step in and fund depressioNet to the level it now demands is slightly absurd. We have not withdrawn funding from depressioNet. In fact, we have increased the level of support we have offered to depressioNet, and it is simply political game playing to pretend that we are somehow to blame for that fact.
What has the Commonwealth done to support mental illness in this country? Its increase in mental health expenditure since 1995-96 has been in the order of 47 per cent in real terms, from $777 million to $1.145 billion. Bear in mind, it does not provide direct services to those people with mental illness for the most part; the services provided are of an indirect nature. The Commonwealth has funded mental illness much better through the Australian healthcare agreements—providing $331 million more to states and territories to facilitate mental health reform. It has funded the Youth Mental Health Foundation. It has significantly improved funding to doctors and their capacity to deal with mental illness in their patients through the Better Outcomes in Mental Health program, with $120 million over four years. It has funded initiatives like beyondblue very significantly in recent years. MindMatters, Mindframe resources and suicide prevention programs all receive funding from the Commonwealth.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-10-12,"—I rise to join this debate with some trepidation. As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health, I am not altogether sure that it is useful. However, perhaps it is time for us to talk about some of the findings of that inquiry. We have received 550 submissions and have held some 13 days of hearings so far, with site visits taken on other days. We have three more days of hearings planned and we have been right around the country, other than Tasmania, where we plan to go in a week or so.
The committee is dealing with dozens of profoundly important and serious issues as part of this inquiry. The National Mental Health Strategy is being examined, as are the inadequacy of funding across the board and human rights to do with restraint and access to services. We are dealing with discrimination and with stigma. There is a great focus on deinstitutionalisation, the failure to support and care for people now out of hospitals, and the shocking understanding that our jails are full of people for whom the current system has been an utter failure. There are the people identified in the HREOC report as being labelled in hospitals as ‘not for service’. This is not to their knowledge, of course, but those people were rejected as not being sick enough or dangerous enough to themselves to warrant admission. Imagine labelling people with heart or lung disease as ‘not for service’. It simply would not be tolerated.
The inadequacy of state governments in dealing with the acutely ill is seriously problematic and results in what has been commonly referred to as the ‘revolving door syndrome’. That is a costly fault in our system, in both monetary and human terms. The committee visited Baxter detention centre, where there is, belatedly, a new environment for dealing with people with a mental illness. Previously people were severely punished for difficult behaviour and put into seclusion—the worst possible treatment for such people. The committee has also heard evidence that the PBS has delivered a medical model to the exclusion of therapies with longer term benefits.
There are hundreds of other things I could say about what the committee has heard, but I have drawn attention to those few issues because I want to convey a very important message—that is, there is no one government we can point a finger at and say, ‘It is your fault.’ Good, appropriate mental health services are the responsibility of all levels of government, including local government—less so than state and federal governments, but I think that level of government must also be included. Rather than blaming other governments, we should all be taking responsibility for a decade or more of neglect and a decade of reform that has been too slow and inadequately funded.
We all have a responsibility to solve work force problems and to see that there is far more prevention and early intervention. We have a responsibility to make sure that consumers are consulted much more than they currently are. We have a responsibility to ensure that mental health services for Aboriginal people and other groups, like the aged, are much better delivered. We all have a responsibility to remove the stigma of mental illness. And we all have a responsibility to remind our members of parliament that mental health has been the poor cousin of health for many years and it urgently needs our efforts.
Not only do those who deliver mental health services need a culture change; the culture of blame also needs to be addressed. We heard just last week that blame is one of the reasons why the National Mental Health Strategy has taken so long to deliver change. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Christopher Pyne, blames the states. The state ministers have not turned up to the inquiry—presumably because they expect to be blamed. The federal minister has not appeared, probably for the same reason. I have great hopes for this inquiry, and those are: that we will reach consensus, that we will not look for blame, and that we will make good recommendations which are informed by very sound advice and evidence to the committee.
I hope our committee will be persuasive. I want our recommendations to be adopted at some stage. We are not there yet; we have not even written the recommendations. But that is my aim for this committee, and I am expecting that we will get there. We will identify good practice, because there is plenty of it around the country. The problem is that it is not made more widely available. (Time expired)

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-10-12,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance proposed by Senator Stephens. In the time I have available to me today, I would like to focus on one most unfortunate aspect of mental health care in this country, and that is mental health services—or the lack thereof—in immigration detention centres.
The recently released reports of Mr Palmer and Mr Comrie make it very clear that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, and the department over which she presides have simply failed in their duty of care for the mentally ill in immigration detention centres throughout this country. In these places, mental illness is systematically overlooked, ignored and even exacerbated by a system which is structured so that people who are unfortunate enough to come into contact with it are treated with suspicion and disdain rather than as human beings. It is no wonder that the mental health problems of Cornelia Rau and many other detainees have been neglected. It is a negative, punitive environment that is designed to catch people out.
The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs fails on every level in its duty of care with regard to mental illness. People who arrive with a mental illness, often as a result of the traumatic conditions they have fled, find that their condition is discounted and ignored by an uncaring immigration system. Worse still, once these people are in detention, their mental health often deteriorates. This is often because of the environment and the lack of adequate, independent mental health care. Then there are people who, when they arrive in this country, are perfectly fine in terms of their mental health but then develop mental health problems as a result of being detained in a prison-like environment where they are faced with indefinite detention and the possibility of forced deportation.
The system of contracting out the management of detention centres enables the government to bypass its duty of care for the mentally ill because the provision of mental health services is also contracted out. Mental health care simply cannot be contracted out. A conflict of interest is inevitable when the system that employs the mental health providers is itself damaging the mental health of the patients the health professionals are treating. The result of this absurd arrangement is that the overall care and support of detainees is callously neglected. In the world of private contracting, everything happens behind closed doors, and visiting professionals are treated with suspicion rather than as valuable resources. So you have the ridiculous situation where independent social workers, lawyers and doctors are not allowed to visit a detainee unless a detainee actually asks for their help. Clearly this is a problem for those who are suffering from a mental illness.
Recently, in a Senate inquiry into the administration of the Migration Act 1958, we had before us an eminent psychiatrist, Dr Louise Newman, who is with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. She told us that when she visited Baxter she asked to see a particularly ill patient. She had been told by other detainees that they were very concerned about a particular individual who was in detention and who was acting in a most unusual manner. Dr Newman was denied access to that detainee by those running the centre. The reason was that the detainee, who turned out to be Cornelia Rau, had not herself requested an independent specialist assessment. The mentally ill who need help the most are those who are least able to ask for it. That simply would not have happened in our state prison system, where there are appropriate standards of accountability and independent review. Yet the government continues to deny proper mental health care to people who have committed no crime but who have had the misfortune to end up in its immigration system. The response of the minister is to announce upgrades to Baxter— (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-10-12,"—I am pleased to stand here to speak to this matter of public importance, which was proposed by Senator Ursula Stephens. I acknowledge the interest and common objectives of the many senators in this place standing to speak on this particular issue. However, I take issue with some of the comments made and objectives expressed by some of the speakers on the other side, in particular the Labor senators. Before I comment on or respond to them, I want to say that this is a matter that affects us all. In any 12-month period, one in five adult Australians experiences some form of mental illness. I am sure that just about everybody in this place knows, and has a personal relationship with, a person with a mental illness. It is a very important issue and it is great that it has been raised. In past decades, across the length and breadth of this country, not enough attention has been given to mental health issues and the lack of mental health services being delivered in this country. So it is excellent that we are having a debate and discussing some of these issues so that we can get the focus right.
In terms of the areas of responsibility, I want to say at the outset that, yes, the Australian government have a very important role to play. They have been taking a leadership position, primarily through the Hon. Christopher Pyne, who, as the parliamentary secretary responsible for health, has demonstrated excellent credentials and leadership skills in that role. But let us accept right up front the fact that this is primarily a responsibility of the state governments of Australia. That point seems to have been omitted. Not a word has been expressed on the other side by Labor senators about the important and primary role of the state governments. They are all Labor governments, and they have been lacking in their ability to address this issue, to the great annoyance and disappointment of people across the country. People do not want governments whingeing and moaning about who is responsible, but this is an important issue and we want the state governments to face up to the fact that they have a responsibility.
I want to also acknowledge the important work of the non-government organisations which represent people with mental illnesses. Of course, 10 October marked 2005 World Mental Health Day. That was an important point acknowledged in an announcement made by the parliamentary secretary for health, Christopher Pyne, and I congratulate him on his leadership on that. The key message that he shared with us was the importance, for all Australians, of getting physical to improve our total wellbeing, which includes mental wellbeing. He said that physical and mental health are the two inseparable aspects of wellbeing. I think most people in this place would be aware of my interest in the importance of a healthy lifestyle and, in particular, addressing the obesity epidemic. There are two sides to that. You have to have a balance—a balance of regular exercise and a balanced diet. In the same way, in terms of mental health, there is physical and mental health. The two are inseparable. On 10 October, World Mental Health Day was acknowledged. It is an initiative of the World Federation for Mental Health, and it coincided with Australia’s Mental Health Week. The theme, as Christopher Pyne mentioned, was mental and physical health across the span of our lives.
So I want to acknowledge non-government organisations and their role with and advocacy for those people throughout Australia with a mental illness. The Mental Health Council of Australia, for example, raise community awareness and have an important role to play. I want to acknowledge the important investment that the Australian government have made in giving the council $80,000 to promote the importance and awareness of mental health in the community through the promotion of World Mental Health Day. That was on the back of the $116 million the Australian government committed to addressing the childhood obesity epidemic in this country through the Building a Healthy, Active Australia program. Ninety million dollars of that went to the Active After-School Communities campaign, which is intended to encourage more physical activity by children in schools across the country. By 2007, 50 per cent of all schools, we hope, will have been targeted. Again, even in that regard, the states had to be made to get on board. They were pulled kicking and screaming to admit, ‘Yes, two hours of physical activity in schools is the way to go.’ They did not want to do it. We took a leadership role and said, ‘You must act in the best interests of children.’ And that is exactly what happened.
In terms of the leadership role of the Australian government, Senator Gary Humphries has made some excellent points in this debate already. He is the deputy chairman of the Senate inquiry that is already travelling the breadth and length of this country. Senator Lyn Allison is the chairperson. On the government side, Senator Nigel Scullion is a member of that committee, as is Senator Judith Troeth. They have already made valuable contributions on this important issue. Senator Humphries has highlighted the important role of the Australian government through our contribution to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Remember that, back in 1990, that was about $1 billion. The contribution by the government has increased to $5 billion, going up to $6 billion. In a few years time it will be closer to $8 billion. What an investment! We know that that is a key role in terms of GPs treating mental illnesses—in fact, one of the most important contributions that a government can make. Seemingly, the Labor opposition in this chamber have omitted to even acknowledge the importance of that contribution.
In terms of the government’s contribution, I am proud of the record of the Howard government and the 47 per cent increase since 1995-96, when the government came into power. It has gone from $777 million to $1.145 billion. That is a big increase. We negotiate with the state ministers over the Australian health care agreements. Yes, they finally came on board, but it was reluctantly and they fought kicking and screaming. Even today they complain about the funding being cut. We know that is nonsense. In Tasmania, for example, they have had an increase from some $700 million to $922 million—a $222 million increase over that five-year period. (Time expired)

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-10-12,"—The Greens support this motion to reprioritise the neglected mental health care services sector. We are also supportive of National Mental Health Week. This initiative aims to increase knowledge about mental health issues, to foster more supportive and informed attitudes to those who live with mental illness and to encourage participation in healthy lifestyle strategies.
Increasing public knowledge about this issue is critical at a time when the AMA tells us that over two million people in Australia experience a mental illness of some degree each year. Yet, according to the Mental Health Council of Australia, 62 per cent of people suffering with mental disorders fail to access any mental health services. This is for reasons such as the stigma associated with mental disorders or fear of medical treatment. While the remaining 38 per cent do manage to access care, that care is largely provided by general practitioners. The long-term decline in bulk-billing places further pressure on this very limited access to basic primary health services. This is further compounded by the rapid increases in out-of-pocket medical costs, up to an average of just under $25 per medical visit. The Howard government simply does not give mental health care services the priority they deserve, and this is well illustrated by the fact that Australia spends only seven per cent of its health budget on mental health issues while the OECD average is 12 per cent. Meanwhile, mental health accounts for at least 20 per cent of total health costs in Australia due to death and disability.
Deinstitutionalisation, combined with inadequate funding for community based services, has meant the overflow for mental health services has fallen onto charities and non-government organisations as well as the police and corrective services. People with mental health problems have inadequate access to primary care, emergency care and specialist care and rehabilitation services. There are also reports of ongoing discrimination in the areas of employment and insurance, as well as restricted access to basic welfare services and support.
The Greens believe that we must ensure that people with mental health issues are treated with dignity and respect and afforded their human rights. One area in which mental health issues have been highlighted recently is immigration detention. The Federal Court recently concluded that mental health services in immigration detention centres were woefully inadequate and that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs had breached its duty of care in respect of two particular detainees by not providing adequate mental health services for them. Most long-term detainees in immigration detention centres suffer at least one form of mental illness, such as major depression or engaging in numerous suicide attempts.
The department of immigration has responded to criticism by employing more mental health staff, but several psychiatrists have commented that it does not matter how many extra mental health workers are put into immigration detention centres, because that environment is itself a contributing factor to mental illness. So we will not be able to fix the problems unless we deal with the central issue of mandatory detention and the impact that those immigration detention facilities have on people’s mental health. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has recommended to its members that they should not be employed by a detention service provider, because they face an inherent ethical dilemma. They do not want psychiatrists to be caught in a situation where they are employed by the company detaining people, whilst the best medical advice those psychiatrists can give is that particular people should not be detained.
The Greens believe a significant increase in funding to all mental health services is urgently required. We need to allocate appropriate resources not only to directly support those with mental health issues but also to assist and support the families and carers. We also need to address the social conditions that contribute to mental health problems in the first place, including social isolation, exclusion, bullying and violence in homes, schools and workplaces, as well as discrimination and employment insecurity—something that is clearly not addressed by the latest industrial relations changes proposed by this government. There is also a serious need to address the high rate of homelessness amongst people who experience mental illness. We support this motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Mental Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,19,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2005-10-12,"—It is certainly a pleasure to support Senator Stephens and her motion concerning mental illness. Senator Stephens has a very passionate approach to this issue. Indeed, over the last few weeks, as she was preparing for this debate today, she was canvassing her colleagues to raise the awareness of mental health and Mental Health Week and to make us conscious that there is a difficulty at the moment and that it needs to be addressed—not by shifting the blame, as we have heard from coalition senators, but by fixing the problems.
I am disturbed that there has been a decrease in funding for one of the programs that should be available for mental health and, in particular, that it was announced this week. In the last few years I have had the duty of chairing three Senate inquiries that dealt with aspects of people’s mental and psychiatric state. The first dealt with poverty and financial injustice, the second was about children in institutions and the third was an inquiry into military justice, which we reported on in June this year.
The inquiry into poverty highlighted the fact that an overwhelming number of people on the streets suffer from mental illness. The inquiry into children in institutions clearly identified that ongoing support is required for those men and women who were raised in Dickensian institutions right up until the 1960s. They will require assistance, help, aid and comfort from a federal or state government for some time.
Only recently we had an inquiry that dealt with suicides in the Australian Defence Force, how they should be dealt with and discussed and how we should as a nation seek to prevent them. It is surprising that we have this level of mental disorder in the defence forces because, when men and women sign up with the forces, they are required to see a psychologist. They have to fill out a questionnaire and identify family mental illness, if there is any, and they have to talk to a doctor regarding any mental health issues. However, the mental health issues within the Australian Defence Force are no different from anywhere else in the country, which in itself is a problem. The reasons identified for mental health issues are sudden and prolonged isolation from family, restriction of choice and freedom, discipline, interstate moves and performance anxiety.
But unstated in all that is the practice of bastardisation and victimisation that occurred, and probably still does occur to a degree, within the Australian defence forces. Indeed, the Commonwealth and the defence forces have sought to stamp out those areas of bastardisation and victimisation. But that, unfortunately, has not prevented high-profile suicides over the last few years, which accounted for the nature of the inquiry that I chaired. Young men and women were put under such pressure—indeed, were humiliated on occasions—by people in authority and felt so distressed, so isolated and so abandoned that they took their own lives. The committee spoke to their families, and often we ended those inquiries in tears because those young men and women were driven to the brink and to a mental breakdown which led them to take their own lives. This is an ongoing problem that has been addressed by the ADF and is still being addressed. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2005-10-12,"—I am very pleased to be able to stand here today and talk to this MPI on mental health. I am a little perplexed by the senator putting forward this MPI on the need for the Howard government to treat mental illness as a national health priority. We do. That already happens. The government recognises this, and mental health is a designated national health priority area. While I do recognise the senator’s interest in this particular area, it is something that this government already does. Indeed, in 1996 the state and territory governments agreed with this government to give mental health that priority status.
I would also remind the Senate that it is the state and territory governments who are responsible for the specialist public mental health services. They are responsible for the planning, delivery, management and statutory regulation of public mental health services. To follow on from my colleague Senator Humphries: it is a bit disingenuous to try to lump all the problems we see in mental health with the Australian government. I believe we need to look at all the governments and all the roles they play in this very important matter.
I believe that the issue of mental health is an extremely important one. I know that my colleagues agree with me on that point. Indeed, in my first speech I referred to this issue of mental health, how important it is and particularly its impact on regional communities. I recognise, as do my colleagues on both sides of the chamber, that there are many people who suffer depression in this nation. As has been commented on earlier, one in five people in Australia will experience depression at some point in their lives. We know that it is inescapable that we all will be touched by mental illness at some point.
Around one million adults and 100,000 young people live with depression each year. Living in a regional community, I am very aware of the factors particular to a rural lifestyle that can contribute to depression. Issues such as isolation, difficult financial circumstances and social difficulty contribute to depression in those areas. In spite of what those opposite have said today, this government has a real commitment to addressing the problem of mental health in this nation. We are addressing this problem. We do realise that it has a very serious impact on our society, on our families, on our friends and on all of our communities right across this nation. It has a devastating impact. This government is taking real and solid steps to address this very important issue. Certainly there has been a very significant increase in funding since 1996. That has been very important in terms of mental health care delivery in this nation. We have seen the Australian health care agreements, up to $331 million to all states and territories, to bring about further mental health reform under the National Mental Health Strategy.
I think it is important to run through some of the programs that are in place that address this issue and show what a very, very high priority this is for this government. The government, of course, has a leading role, through the National Mental Health Strategy, which was endorsed by all health ministers in 1992 and reaffirmed in 1998 and 2003. Indeed, in July this year, all health ministers agreed to undertake a revision of the national mental health policy. I think it is important to point out that there are things that we can do better, but certainly we need to acknowledge the work that the government has done to date in addressing this very serious issue.
Youth mental health is a very important area and we have seen $69 million delivered to help young people with their mental health problems. Funding was announced to assist in countering mental illness and associated drug and alcohol problems faced by young people. I think it is very important that we recognise the impact this has on young people. It is important to look at the drug and alcohol problems that are often associated with mental illness in our young people. Being a mother in a regional area, I am very aware of how important it is that we do focus on the young people in our communities suffering from this very serious disease.
We have seen the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program—$263 million for education and training for GPs. Over 4,000 GPs are participating in that program, increasing their mental health skills and their knowledge. We have seen a three-step mental health process and focused psychological strategies put in place, and there is access to allied psychological services and to psychiatrist support. I think it is important that we recognise the work that is being done in all these areas.
One other area I would like to just touch on is beyondblue and the additional $39 million, to 2009, that has gone in to continue the important work that started with this program in 2000. It is going to be building on its school and youth depression activities, and developing prevention programs for men, the elderly and Indigenous Australians.
Another initiative which I think is particularly important is the establishment of a national preventative postnatal depression screening and follow-up program for new mothers. Again, I believe it is very important that we focus on that, particularly in our regional areas, and that we do address and recognise the very real problems in that area.
We are also seeing promotion, prevention and early intervention for mental health. We have also seen suicide prevention programs and, while we have seen a downward trend in the number of people dying as a result of suicide, we still need to do more work in this area and the government has been providing around $10 million a year to address this particular mental health illness issue.
In summary, the government does have a plan to address mental health, in contrast to Labor who really appear to have nothing—nishta, actually. In summary, we have seen a great deal of funding by this government: Australian health care agreements, the National Mental Health Strategy, youth mental health funding, the Better Outcomes in Mental Health— (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2005-10-12,"—I rise to speak today in support of the matter of public importance raised by Senator Stephens. With a health minister who can trivialise a suicide attempt, the future of mental health in Australia is itself plagued by the black dog. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Minister Abbott, thinks so little of the issue that he has handed responsibility to his parliamentary secretary, Christopher Pyne. Just to correct the record, dNet will be closing on Saturday. But in what will surely be the final insult for those staff of depressioNet, after being forced out of their jobs and going home to turn on the television, they will have to watch endless taxpayer funded industrial relations commercials and reflect on Chris Pyne’s comments this morning: ‘We are spending taxpayers’ money, so we want to make sure it is spent properly.’
Good old-fashioned denial will get you nowhere, Mr Abbott. We need national leadership to drive a realistic national mental health strategy. Here is another comment from this caring government, from the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, who is on record as saying that it is not possible to meet the health needs of Australians without self-help and preventative mechanisms. Yet, here they are now, turning their backs on essential services like dNet.
One in five of us will be challenged by mental illness during our lifetime and nearly 10 per cent of us will be left with a long-term mental or behavioural problem. Heaven forbid you live in regional Australia when your nervous breakdown strikes. Because of the extreme shortage of general practitioners, the mentally ill are not receiving the help they require. According to a report submitted by the Australian Medical Association to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health, the problems in rural and regional Australia are chronic. They say the patterns of mental illness in the country are different; there is a well-documented increase in suicide among young men compared to their city counterparts.
Mental health issues should be treated as mainstream issues. It is well documented that poor mental or emotional health leads to a range of physical ailments. Cancer and heart disease are regularly linked to stress and emotional health. The conditions are linked and should be treated as such across the health system, not isolated and treated on the fringe.
The state governments, who are being blamed endlessly today by the coalition government in this chamber, are expected to carry the burden of providing long-term mental health services. Of the $2.56 billion spent on mental health, just $928 million comes from the out-of-touch Howard government’s coffers. What a sham!
This is more denial from Minister Abbott. What does he hope to achieve, locking away the mental health issue with his parliamentary secretary? Did you see Mr Pyne arrogantly politicising mental illness on national television last night? What a disgrace to use flim-flam budget figures among an audience of family, friends and professionals working hard to bring light into the lives of the mentally ill. He was shown for what he is: an arrogant and out-of-touch Liberal. What message is he sending the families and partners of people with a mental illness? Does he seriously still attach shame to mental illness? Is that why he is trying to lock the issue away? There must be community, school and workplace programs to take away that stigma. There must be access to training for GPs to ease the workload and facilitate early diagnosis.
The National Rural Health Alliance has called for an increased national expenditure on mental health of 12 per cent of national health expenditure. Maybe some of the money could come from this arrogant government’s advertising campaigns. The alliance calls for formalised support for the carers of people with mental illness and stronger professional mental health work forces in rural and remote areas. Why can’t Tony Abbott face up to the truth? Why won’t he admit, as Tasmanian health minister David Llewellyn has admitted, that mental health systems remain under pressure? Why won’t he make the improvements to services that mental health advocates are pleading for?
There is no shame in mental illness, just as there is no shame attached to having diabetes or heart disease. The government owes it to the community to openly tackle the mental health issues of Australians in the same way we have embraced dealing with breast cancer and heart disease. Much mental illness can be prevented, like its physical counterparts. Australia deserves a health minister who can speak openly and intelligently about mental health. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-10-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In speaking to the Australian Electoral Commission’s funding and disclosure report on the 2004 election, I would like to take the opportunity to note just how fundamental the notion of transparency in the funding of political parties and associated entities is to the integrity of our democratic system. There are a whole range of different underpinnings that impact very significantly on the overall strength of our democracy and I think Australians are sometimes a little bit too blase about just how fragile democracy can be. It is a lot more than being able to put a piece of paper in a ballot box every three years or so; there are a whole lot of other aspects that also need to work to even provide a basic degree of integrity for an electoral system, let alone everything that happens in between elections.
One of the issues that we need to make sure is not degraded is the funding of political parties and associated entitles. Senators and many members of the Australian public would be aware of the significant damage that has been done to the integrity of the United States political system because of the excessive role of money in their electoral system. When it gets to the situation where you simply cannot afford to run for office unless you are able to raise absurdly large amounts of money then, clearly, it significantly compromises the basic integrity of your democracy.
I have met a number of people from the US congress and various state congresses, as I am sure many, if not all, senators in this place have. Without fail, they will talk about how much time they have to spend on fundraising. It is not uncommon for members of the congress, or people wanting to run for office in the US, to say that they have to spend 50 per cent of their time on fundraising from the minute they get elected. That to me suggests a gross distortion of the nature of the work that elected officials have to do, let alone what it means to the inevitable compromises—even subconscious compromises—that you have to make when you rely on substantial donations from particular sectors or people.
In saying that, I am not trying to paint myself or the Democrats as holier than thou; we all have to rely on money to some extent to campaign and, certainly, I make no secret of the fact that I would like to have more money to spend on campaigning. Those of us who are not in the government do not have the luxury of stealing money directly from the taxpayer to pay for advertising their own party political policies, as this government does. That is a good thing, because I do not think the rest of us should be engaged in the wholesale theft that this government is committing in relation to the advertising campaigns for its party political policies.
But, as this report shows, there are significant amounts of money that are donated to political parties and through associated entities, and those are just the amounts that are disclosed. There are certainly legitimate questions about the role of associated entities in being able to, if you like, launder money from donations or in effect campaign for particular parties or candidates without having to go through some of the administrative requirements that political candidates have to go through, and I fully support examining those.
There is also, as we have seen just this week with the tabling of a committee report, a clear-cut desire on the part of this government to dramatically increase the amount of money that can be donated to a political party before it has to be declared. Of course, when you have political parties that are incorporated in a state or run on a state-by-state basis, then you can donate right up to $1 below that threshold in each of the different states and territories and basically multiply the maximum anonymous donation by seven or eight. They add up to very significant donations that can be hidden and create a significant threat to the integrity of our democracy.
The Democrats are proud of our record throughout the eighties and nineties of driving a significant increase in the amount of disclosure and transparency in political parties, political activities and their funding. We still have a long way to go, but we certainly do not want to be going backwards or we will be like the United States. There are a lot of good things we can learn from the US, but that is one aspect we do not want to learn. We do not want to go any further down that road. It is bad enough that the government can steal taxpayers’ money for its own campaigns; we certainly do not want a higher level for anonymous donations as well. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Electoral Commission</title>,Documents,26,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-10-12,"—Tonight I rise to talk about the need for deductibility for taxation purposes where people make contributions to a regulated superannuation fund. In earlier times, in my capacity as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation I was deeply concerned that in the past most people have not taken seriously the need to save over a lifetime for their retirement. Generally, at approximately 50 years of age people begin to seriously consider the need for an adequate income in retirement. The purpose of my contribution tonight is to say they should be starting a lot earlier.
Retirement planning is particularly important and in undertaking that planning one should recognise that there are a number of inherent risks. You have to take into account risk factors such as longevity, inflation and investment returns as well as health. One disturbing study some time ago showed that many young executives under 27 tended to be ultraconservative in their investment choice allocations for savings with listed fund managers. This policy would be very prudent for those approaching retirement, but younger people should be encouraged to invest in more aggressive or growth type investments. Savings should be commenced early in one’s working life to enable the full benefit of compounding over a 30- to 40-year earning cycle. For most people the nine per cent employer contribution will not be adequate, but it could be very useful as a top-up to the age pension.
While the level of employee contributions in Australia is rising, I believe that further initiatives are necessary. Australians respond well to initiatives, particularly where those initiatives change the attractiveness of the relationship between work and leisure. I commend the government on a great initiative—that is, where it initially provided $1 for $1 of investment in a superannuation fund. More recently, it increased that attractiveness for a return of $1.50 by the government where a person put at least $1 in a superannuation fund.
There were limits. It was limited to $1,000 per annum and there were income limits as well, but this co-contribution scheme was a great initiative—and I would like to commend the minister, Senator Coonan, who is in the chamber tonight, for that initiative. For young and low-income people, it has been so successful that a great number of industry superannuation funds have focused a great deal of their advertising on this particular issue to enable such people to take advantage of what I believe was a very generous budget measure. Research submitted to the IFSA conference several years ago in Queensland showed that a government co-contribution as low as 50c in the dollar—not $1.50—could really be quite attractive. In a tight budgetary situation, there is therefore room for some scaling back if the need so arises, so it does have a degree of flexibility.
Another interesting idea which followed on from the recent discussions about the new industrial relations legislation would be, rather than allowing people to cash in two weeks of their annual leave, they could be offered the choice of transferring that amount to a superannuation fund if they so wished.
Around the world, people are unfortunately becoming increasingly cynical of the ability of governments to ensure that in the future their retirees will have a secure retirement. In fact, many defined benefit government funds are now ailing, and this is leading to public protest and unrest, particularly in certain European countries such as France. While the majority of people clamour for more government support, most taxpayers are reluctant to take control of their own financial destiny.
In the United Kingdom, a radical overhaul of the pension system is required in order to avert a crisis which could see millions of pensioners living in poverty in years to come. However, according to the World Bank, Australia has a sound retirement framework, particularly with its three-pillar approach: age pension, concessional tax and compulsory employer support through the nine per cent superannuation scheme. In fact, when I was in England recently, I was asked to make a contribution to the Turner Commission on pensions, because that country has some major problems.
Some commentators believe the Australian system does suffer some impediments such as high taxation and inadequate support for a pension or income stream compared with the taking of lump sums. But the situation is changing gradually. Unlike most other countries, tax in Australia is levied at three points: on entry with a contributions tax, on earnings and on retirement. Together with a significant concession on capital gains, tax is also levied on exit. Most other countries tax at maybe up to two levels. Many believe that taxation reform in the superannuation industry needs to go further and that taxes applying to superannuation really should be reduced. The introduction of concepts such as the allocated pension was a good start, being a halfway house between a lump sum and an annuity. In Australia, we have higher reasonable benefit limits, which favour those taking annuities or pensions. The government will legislate shortly to permit splitting of superannuation contributions on an annual basis from 1 July 2006. This measure will provide access to a non-working spouse’s tax free threshold and RBL that could not previously be utilised. That is another good measure.
Young people should be encouraged to seek total retirement solutions from one provider. The superannuation choice legislation provides the means to save from multiple fees and charges. There are also advantages in the single point of contact, together with a consolidated view of the level and adequacy of the funds set aside for retirement. People are increasingly becoming concerned about outliving their retirement savings. I believe education programs should focus on helping people take greater control of their financial futures. However, for those on middle to low incomes, the cost of obtaining financial advice is becoming prohibitively high because of the new FSR regime, which requires a complete status report when buying even a regular type of product. I believe this does need to be looked at. The widening of the definition of education advisor is also a necessary move for the future, particularly in relation to what I call regular products, so that the larger funds can be encouraged to help people adjust their investment strategies through life.
Moneys must be set aside not only for retirement expenditure but also I believe to provide a nest egg to cover some escalating health costs. Much of the recent advertising in Australia has focused on fees and charges and the impact that these will have on the final retirement package. An equally important but neglected area is the need for a fund to have consistently high returns, quality administration, good government reporting, governance compliance and state of the art technology capable of delivering timely communications and education. These are important. I think it is a tragedy that there has been so much focus just on one issue, albeit an important one.
Young people, especially those with family commitments, I believe must not apply all of their savings just to retirement. Part of their after-tax income should be diverted to disability income insurance as well as maintaining an adequate life insurance policy as a precaution in the event of severe accident or premature death.
Both Canada and the USA provide tax deductibility for payments to approved retirement funds. In the USA, the most popular vehicle is the 401K plan. Canada has similar arrangements. In Australia, I believe we should also be moving to allow for tax deductibility. (Time expired)
