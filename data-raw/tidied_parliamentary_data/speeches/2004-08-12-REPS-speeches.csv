That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Provision of Facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command, NSW.
The Department of Defence proposes to construct a co-located operational level Headquarters Joint Operations Command on a portion of the Woodlands property near Bungendore in New South Wales, in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Headquarters Joint Operations Command is critical to the ability of the Australian Defence Force to concurrently conduct a range of war-fighting, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations and support to the civil community, and to synchronise military and non-military efforts to meet national objectives. The major advantage of co-location is enhanced operational effectiveness, compared with the current dispersed configuration, facilitating superior decision making and increased operational effectiveness.
The headquarters will be a low-rise military facility within a secure fenced compound. The main headquarters building will accommodate personnel in a combination of standard office environments and specialised operations areas. It will consist of a high-security inner area and an outer area of lower security office space. The provision of command, control, communications and information systems is a key component in delivering effective theatre level command and control. Communications with deployed forces will be via already established defence communications facilities. 
Access to the headquarters will be provided along a dual-lane sealed road from the Kings Highway, which will be owned and maintained by Defence. It will be fenced to curtail stock movements, and a dedicated intersection at the Kings Highway will facilitate safe access to the facilities. A secondary road will provide alternative access for emergency services.
The buildings and infrastructure, ongoing maintenance and ancillary support services component of the project will be procured under private financing arrangements, provided that tenders demonstrate value for money. A traditional, or direct, procurement strategy will be used to acquire and install the command, control, communications and information systems component of the project. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works is $318.08 million at 2003-04 prices, which includes the provision of preliminary engineering studies; design; professional fees; construction of the buildings and infrastructure; acquisition and installation of the command, control, communication and information systems; and acquisition and workplace relocation costs.
In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed subject to its recommendations. The Department of Defence accepts the recommendations of the committee. I would like to place on the public record the very strong support my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has given this project. The government very much appreciates his input. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence mid next year and will be completed by late 2007. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and also the member for Eden-Monaro for backing the project. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,13,1
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I rise to support this motion very strongly and to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration for his words. This project is a key project for our region—not only the Queanbeyan-Bungendore region in my electorate but also the ACT in a general sense. It will be the largest capital works project since new Parliament House was built. At $318.08 million, it certainly will be a major project.
I see great potential beyond the project, not just in the construction and the ongoing operation of the headquarters but in the opportunities that will arise for our region to attract defence related industries because this particular facility will be located here. With regard to the work done so far, this has been an excellent process since it was first announced in 2001. Clearly, with a project of this size, everything has to be done absolutely properly and in line with all the various requirements. The draft environmental impact statement was released to the public late last year, but also right through and beyond that process Defence have provided excellent consultation opportunities for the general community. They have held numerous meetings in the small rural communities around Bungendore, Queanbeyan et cetera to make sure everybody knows just what this project is all about and has been able to have input into it.
I also congratulate Defence on the work that they have done with the Molonglo radio telescope, which is about five kilometres away from the site that has been chosen for this project. The Molonglo radio telescope is a key facility. I have been a great supporter of it, and I went in to bat on its behalf a few years ago, when the University of Sydney was reducing funding to it, to help the researchers get some funding from the federal government so that they could continue doing the great work they do. 
I also want to mention the owners of the Woodlands property, the Hyles family. It is never easy when a project like this is occurring. A lot of people have had to access their property to do various geotechnical studies, environmental studies and all those sorts of things. They have cooperated superbly, and I thank the Hyles family for the cooperation they have shown and continue to show as we get this project going.
The Public Works Committee held a full-day hearing in Queanbeyan. I know you took part in that, Deputy Speaker Jenkins. I thank the Public Works Committee for having that hearing there and for hearing from the various people who are interested in the project. I spent the day there as well, hearing submissions from Defence and other people and also the questions and answers between those people and the Public Works Committee. That resulted in the report that the member for Pearce tabled in the parliament yesterday, with five recommendations. I am pleased to hear from the parliamentary secretary today that all of those recommendations have been accepted by Defence. Now, with this motion, the project is basically going full steam ahead and, from a parliamentary point of view, it really has the tick.
Tenderers were called for some months ago, and I know that Defence are very close to finalising the short list of those tenderers. The short-listed tenderers will then be asked to prepare detailed design and construction tenders. We expect that will be finalised later this year, with cabinet probably making a decision early in 2005 so that construction can commence on time. That has always been scheduled, from right back when the project was first announced in 2001, for the middle of next year. It is scheduled for completion in 2007.
This is a great project for the region, and it certainly is an excellent project for Defence. I know Defence have been working on this co-location for some time. From a number of instances that have occurred right throughout the world, we have seen the need to have a proper joint facility like this for the operation of Defence's projects. When it is completed in 2007, this will be state of the art in every possible way and will bring together those elements of Defence that need to work together during operations. I thank the parliamentary secretary and the Public Works Committee for this aspect of the project. As I have said, it is a great project for the region, and I look forward to it continuing on from here.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,13,1

As the timetable has been outlined, whenever the Prime Minister calls the election, some of the key decisions that need to be made will be made after the election by whoever the new government will be, and I want to make it crystal clear that, whoever wins the next election, this project will continue to have the bipartisan support it has had and that it will proceed.

"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which were presented to the House on 11 August 2004, namely: Construction of permanent access ramps to the rear entrance of Old Parliament House.
This motion proposes the construction of permanent access ramps at the rear entrance of the Old Parliament House building. Old Parliament House have advised the National Capital Authority that they have canvassed a wide range of options to minimise any intrusion on the Parliament House vista, whilst meeting their statutory obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.
The proposed work involves the installation of two identical ramps, each running parallel to the rear of the Old Parliament House building, to meet the existing bridges. The materials for the ramps consist of solid blackbutt timber boarding, satin stainless steel handrails and steel flats to the balustrade. 
The National Capital Authority has advised that it is prepared to grant works approval to the proposal, pursuant to section 12(1)(b) of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988. Old Parliament House sought approval for the proposed ramps from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage under sections 26 and 28 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Department of the Environment and Heritage has advised that this action does not require any further approval. The approval of both houses is sought under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974 for the permanent access ramps to the rear entrance of Old Parliament House. I commend the motion to the House.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—What we have before us today is a piece of cynical political camouflage. It is the government's cover for its failure to respond to the real and pressing needs of small business. Since 1996, the government has been making attempts under various guises to change the unfair dismissal provisions, and it has in recent times resorted to this crude misnomer whereby it calls this the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill. It is a terrible misnomer. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 in no way deals with `fair dismissals'. It explicitly authorises unfair dismissals. That is what this bill is designed to do. It is designed to enable people to be dismissed unfairly, and I will subsequently come to the substance of that and why it is so significant.
The government needs political camouflage in the area of small business because, during this term of the Howard government, it has become clear to many small business organisations and their members that, as issues have been building up—issues about concerns with the Trade Practices Act, issues about concerns with the business activity statement and issues about red tape—the Howard government has not been responding. It has been saying to small business: `Don't you worry about that. We'll take care of your interests. We'll deal with unfair dismissals.' The government is talking up the unfair dismissals problem instead of looking at ways in which it can be made easier for small business to deal with the existing legislation, because the government does not want it to be easy for small business to deal with the existing legislation; it wants it to be hard. The government wants them to find it difficult, because this is the only action the government is initiating that presents itself as being in the interests of small business—and I will come to the significance of that in a moment.
There has been a series of contests about policy as it relates to small business, and the Howard government has been marked as a failure on every one. There has been pressure from two directions for reform to the Trade Practices Act. The pressure from big business, which has mainly been through the Business Council of Australia but also to a lesser extent the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has been about issues to do with the Trade Practices Act which adversely affect the interests of bigger businesses—or at least are perceived to, and have been examined in that light. I do not want to refer to the merits of that at the moment. That is before the parliament in another bill, and I have spoken on it. There have also been continuing and increasing demands from small business—and in that category of small business I include small farmers who are suppliers to bigger businesses. Everybody highlights the issue as it relates to supplying the big retail chains of Coles and Woolworths, but it does not just apply to them. It is a bit unfair to them that they are singled out as much as they are, as they are just the tip of a very substantial iceberg, but they are the element of it that people see. 
There has been pressure for change, but the government stalled and set up an inquiry with very limited terms of reference that recommended nothing should happen, and that is exactly what did happen—nothing. The other bill that is before the parliament at the moment—Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2]—does the absolute minimum. It does not in any way go to the substance of real concern for small business. That became clear when the opposition and minor parties took the initiative to set up a Senate committee to look into issues relating to the Trade Practices Act and its protection for small business and there was an eruption of concern. Industry associations, traditionally associated with support for the conservative parties, came forward and demanded action. Their members spoke out.
Go to any small town in Australia and you will find businesses with concerns. The towns do not even have to be small. They can include regional cities, such as Canberra—our largest regional city—right through to places like Townsville, Newcastle and Hobart. There are also big problems affecting small businesses in Sydney and Melbourne, although they tend to get muffled by the concern of other businesses in those communities. But I have certainly had small businesses in Melbourne coming to me and raising concerns about the Trade Practices Act. Those concerns came forward and the committee in majority made a sweeping series of recommendations, but the government once again stepped back and did the absolute minimum. The opposition has committed to implementing all those recommendations.
It is very interesting. We now find that at venues like the small business summit there is a serious policy contest in an area which the government has regarded as its own since 1996—small business—because the agenda has been taken out of its hands. People are not just sitting back and saying, `Golly, what about this unfair dismissal?' They are saying: `What about amendments to the Trade Practices Act? What about a bit of reform to the business activity statement that affects the day-to-day life of the sorts of businesses this bill is designed to affect?' The government's attempt to reform the business activity statement will not assist any business big enough to be affected by this bill. You have to be much smaller to get any benefit. There is a simple, serious reform of the business activity statement that could be undertaken, but the government will not do it.
The government is very embarrassed to deal with the issue of red tape, because it made that bizarre promise before the 1996 election about a 50 per cent cut in red tape. I will say this for the Minister for Small Business and Tourism: he was honest enough to say that the failure to implement that promise is an embarrassment to the government in dealing with small business. That is true, and I congratulate him on his candour, but it means that no action is taking place on the issue of red tape and its impact on small business, and it is time it was. Various leading industry associations, like the Certified Practising Accountants, have been putting pressure on to say that there should be some voice—some advocate—for small business inside the government, but the government has not responded.
The opposition will respond to all of those demands. That is why we are putting forward a comprehensive program of assistance to small business and the government is putting forward this bit of camouflage. Every small business in Australia knows that, whoever wins the next election, this provision will not change. If the Howard government is re-elected, there will not be a Senate majority to pass this proposal—as there has not been since 1996—and, if a Latham government is elected, this proposal will not proceed. So this provision will not change. It is just a bit of political camouflage. Every time the government is in trouble with small business, it drags this bill in. It knows it will never pass. It does not even particularly want it to pass, because then it would have no camouflage. It would not even have a fig leaf to cover its embarrassment. It is a large embarrassment and a small fig leaf, but nevertheless the government would not even have that. 
Because this issue has been running for a long time, finally there has been a bit of research done. All sorts of ludicrous statements have been made about the extent to which new jobs would be created were this unfair dismissal proposition to be passed. I have to say that, when you look at the pattern of employment creation in small business prior to the introduction of unfair dismissal provisions and subsequent to that, there is no discernible impact. You cannot see a change in the shape of small business job creation that says it slowed suddenly after the unfair dismissal provisions were brought in. That always suggested that there was no significant employment impact whatsoever. Finally, Robbins and Voll at Charles Sturt University based in Albury-Wodonga conducted research into unfair dismissal with small businesses in that region. I have spoken about that research before in the parliament and I will not take up the parliament's time by repeating all those things, but it did go a long way in terms of rebutting a lot of the allegations and assertions that have been made. It certainly put into the laughable category claims about the creation of 50,000 jobs and 75,000 jobs. Any rational person has always fallen down laughing at those sorts of silly propositions and finally we have some research that shows them to be ridiculous.
The survey found that, interestingly, more small businesses in the Albury-Wodonga region felt they should not be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws than felt they should be; they did not like them but they felt it was not fair that they should be exempt. I think that is a very interesting point that the government fails to take note of. The survey showed that only three per cent of the small businesses surveyed—and the survey is publicly available; it is quite substantial—nominated changes to unfair dismissal laws as something that would encourage them to employ more staff. By contrast, 25 per cent of small businesses nominated the lack of skilled or experienced applicants as the main impediment to hiring new staff. I find that, as I travel Australia talking to small businesses, it is the crisis in skills that is central to frustrating the growth plans of many small businesses—this is true also of big businesses, but it is the small business employment issue that we are debating here today. There are still hundreds of thousands of Australians unemployed and we should be talking about programs to enhance the capacity of the technical and further education system to train those people to have the skills, and to train young Australians to have the skills, to meet the requirements of small business. That is the secret to employment creation in small business and not these bizarre unfair dismissal propositions.
I also want to talk about what the government is failing to do in this area. I accept that the process that lies behind the operation of the unfair dismissal laws does not operate fairly for small businesses, and I would like to see that process changed. But we will never get a focus on that process while the government continues with the charade that it is going to be able to change the law itself. Every member of the cabinet from the Prime Minister down knows that these laws will not change: they will not change as a result of this bill and they will not change after the election. They have not been changed in eight years and nothing has been done to make the processes—that are not designed to reflect the needs and concerns of small businesses—more adaptive, more responsive and more appropriate. Nothing has been done because the government wants it to be hard so that people will complain. But, as part of overall review of the regulatory impact of government activities on small businesses, attention must be given to the question of changing the processes for the operation of the unfair dismissal laws. That is something that, on a change of government, I intend to make a priority. Let us wash away the illusion that these laws are going to change and find ways to make them work better so that small businesses have a more reasonable capacity to cope and can deal with the unreasonable demands, which are sometimes put upon them, that make them feel it is easier to pay up than meet. I know that happens. It is unfair, it is not what the laws are designed to do and I want to stop that happening. But you will not get rid of it by making it possible to sack people unfairly. 
I am determined that the needs of small business owners in that manner should be addressed, but I am not going to do it by ignoring or acting against the interests of the employees of small businesses. As the shadow minister for small business, I feel I represent both: the owners and the employees of small businesses. For most Australian families, the most important asset they own is the job of the principal breadwinner. People talk about the importance of people owning houses, and that is fundamental. People spoke yesterday about the second biggest financial asset most people own perhaps being the family car. But the most important asset for most Australian families is the job of the principal breadwinner. The Labor Party, either as an opposition or as a government, will not agree to laws which say that asset can unreasonably be taken away. We will not agree to that. That is neither fair nor reasonable. What we will do is look at ways to make these laws work better, and we are determined to do that. I accept there is some unfairness with them, but we cannot fix them until we wash away this charade that the government wishes to use to create an illusion that at some time in the unforeseeable future these unfair dismissal laws will be removed so that small businesses can sack people unfairly.
Most of small businesses do not sack people unfairly; most do not dismiss anybody. That is one of the things the survey showed. All the evidence shows that most of the best industrial relations in Australia happen in small businesses, but it also shows that some of the worst industrial relations in Australia happen in small business. We are not going to stand idly by and have this fundamental right of working Australians taken away just by the coincidence of the size of their employer. We are not going to have A grade citizens with one set of rights and B grade citizens with another. We are not going to do that; the parliament will not do it. The government know that the parliament will not do it and, the sooner they stop reintroducing this bill and trying to create an illusion, which they know is false, that one day this law will change, the sooner we will get attention focused on improving the way this law works and giving small business a real improved operation instead of merely some camouflage to cover the government's inadequacy in its agenda for small business. That is why we oppose this bill and it is why it will be defeated again. The sooner it is put in the dustbin of history, the better.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am not as pessimistic as the member for Fraser, because the Howard government have a track record in persisting with difficult issues and ultimately getting a successful outcome. I draw the parliament's attention to matters such as the A New Tax System for Australia, which the Labor Party opposed all of the way and said, `No, this is not going to happen.' Of course, the Labor Party now recognises and agrees that the new tax system has been very good for our country. It underpins the very sound economic conditions that we have in this country and it is widely supported by all Labor state premiers. We got that through in the face of tremendous opposition.
I also draw the attention of the parliament to the time when the government embarked on workplace reform of the Australian waterfront. Again, the Labor Party opposed it tooth and nail, but we got it through and Australia's waterfront now is as competitive as any in the world. We see an improved ship turnaround rate and the ability of shipping owners to say with confidence that they can bring a ship in, turn it around and send it on its way within a certain period of time. That now works. It was done through a process that did not see workers on the waterfront lose the remuneration that they were receiving, but it did address the terrible inefficiencies and the union domination there that were holding Australia back in its export industries. But we did it, and we did it in the face of very difficult opposition from the Australian Labor Party. With this Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004, we are seeing once again the Labor Party standing in the way of reform that will help the economy of this country.
Nobody wants to see employees unfairly dismissed. We would all reject that notion. But, when you have been a small business owner and operator as I have for 25 years, you know from the coalface the difficulties that small business owners face due to the current legislation that the government want to scrap and replace with the bill we are debating today. I have seen a business in my home city of Townsville put out of business because of an unfair dismissal claim. In the instance concerned, an employee was stealing from the company; they stole $93,000. The employee was sacked by the management and took the management to court under the unfair dismissal provisions. The loss of the money and the cost of the court case crippled the business and it went bankrupt. How fair is that? By opposing this legislation today, the Australian Labor Party is allowing small businesses to continue to face that situation.
The Australian Labor Party, by opposing this legislation, is basically saying, `We don't want more people to have jobs.' As I know from first-hand experience, it is clear that businesses avoid employing extra people because of the provisions of the current unfair dismissals law. What the Australian Labor Party does not seem to understand is what the best asset of a business is. The best asset is of course its staff. And why would you unfairly dismiss a staff member if they are doing a good job? There is no threat to a person's job if they are doing a good job for the business. It is the staff who generate goodwill for the business. It is the staff who generate the income for the business. Why would you unfairly dismiss a staff member who is working well? The response to the Australian Labor Party is simply that no-one is going to lose their job unfairly if they are doing a good job.
The Labor Party's position does not surprise me because, when you look at its record, it is out there to hurt business. I would refer you to a number of instances, of which the unfair dismissal burden is one. First of all, if the Australian Labor Party is elected at the next election, business will cop a new federal payroll tax. I can tell you that the state payroll tax is one of the most objectionable taxes that businesses face, because it is a tax on employment. Now we have the Australian Labor Party, under its policy, indicating that Labor will impose the first federal payroll tax since 1971. It is frightening. 
Look at the case of unions and small business. It is Labor's policy to allow union officials right of entry into any small business at any time. This includes home based businesses and applies regardless of whether there are any union members employed. So a small business operating from home could find a union official demanding to come in and have access to their business records even though they have no union employees—scary stuff. Secondary boycotts are going to be returned. We all know what that means: industry-wide wildcat strikes which will cripple small business by abolishing the coalition's secondary boycott protection.
Regarding the workplace agreements act, the AWAs in this country have been outstandingly successful because they have allowed employees and employers to talk to each other and not be governed by the arrangements of a third party in Melbourne. Surely it is sensible for somebody in the Pilbara or on Cape York to be able to negotiate with their boss and say, `This is how we work up here. We don't want to work on Friday afternoon' or, `We do want to work on Sunday' or whatever. If they both agree under a workplace agreement, what is wrong with that? But Labor want to abolish that. They want the rules and the conditions set in Melbourne to apply to Cape York or the Pilbara. That is a nonsense.
Labor wants to give casual employees the right to demand to be made permanent. Well, a casual is not a casual if they are given the right to be made permanent. It actually suits a lot of employees to be casuals. I do not understand why the Labor Party would be so anti jobs as to adopt these sorts of policies. The Labor policy to abolish junior wage rates would cost 200,000 jobs, according to the Australian Retailers Association. You can plainly see that if you had to employ a junior at an adult wage then you would employ an adult. Our young people will not get the start in life that they need by having their little local jobs at junior rates of pay.
Labor wants to impose a long service leave burden. It wants to facilitate schemes that provide portability of leave entitlements between employers. This includes entitlements such as holiday and leave loading, sick pay and long service leave. That is in the national platform of the ALP. Labor wants to introduce a new entitlement burden. It wants to drag independent contractors into the industrial relations system. This would reduce the flexibility for both independent contractors and small business and would have the bottom line effect of forcing costs up. Labor wants to force small business to make redundancy payments for the first time ever. Labor has also flagged making small business pay redundancy pay to casual workers for the first time ever. What a nonsense.
Finally, on the unfair dismissal burden, Labor wants to make it easier for disgruntled former employees to make frivolous unfair dismissal claims. Labor has blocked the government's attempts to improve unfair dismissal laws for small business on more than 40 occasions. It is going to happen again on this occasion with this bill. How sad it is when you talk to an employer who tells you that an employee has said, `You can't dismiss me; if you do, I'll take you to court, it'll cost you thousands upon thousands of dollars and I'm going to win.' How hard is that? When those stories circulate through the business community, the bottom line is that businesses may choose not to employ an extra person. It is very difficult. 
I appeal to the Labor Party to get out there into small business and see how the real world works. It is fine and laudable for parliaments to protect the interests of Australians, but it has to be done in a context of making sure that the economy is strong, that all people have their rights protected and that business is able to get on with offering more people jobs without having disincentives put in their way. I am very concerned about Mark Latham's 10 promises to hurt small business, and I will certainly be making sure that my electorate knows what the Australian Labor Party stands for at the time of the coming election. I think that when they see this array of promises that will hurt small business, the electorate will make the appropriate decision some time later this year.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—As I listened to the member for Herbert, I wondered when he was actually going to get to the content of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 before this House. It seems to be a fairly common pattern for members of the government to avoid putting up the argument for a bill which they have entitled `fair dismissal'. It is no wonder they do not say much about the content of this bill, because the bill is anything but fair; it is very discriminatory. It would discriminate against a whole class of small business employees. The bill says that, if you happen to strike a lottery where you are employed in a business of fewer than 20 people, under federal law you will have no protection against unfair or unjust dismissal.
The reason Labor continues to oppose this measure is that it offends against very basic principles. The government keeps returning the bill to the House knowing that you cannot make compromises which offend against these basic principles. Furthermore, the last time that I spoke in the debate on this bill, I recall spending some time outlining the kind of constructive amendments and proposals that Labor was suggesting to make the system operate in a more streamlined manner, to take into account some of the concerns that had been raised by employers, to try and reduce the costs of the system and to make the processes more amenable to people using the system. If the minister and the government were really serious about addressing the concerns that have been raised by small business and by employers, why don't they accept the proposals that Labor has put on the table as a means of making the system operate better in the future? Labor cannot accept a bill which, as I said, would institute a general form of discrimination against Australian workers just on the basis of where they happen to work.
I think every Australian believes that, firstly, people ought to have some remedy or recourse in the event of their being dismissed unfairly or capriciously and, secondly, we all accept that there has to be a fair go all round. The member for Herbert this morning actually trotted out the kind of nonsense that is being promoted by members of the government to try to scare employers into believing that the only alternative is one where the doors of the commission are closed to small businesses. He said words to the effect of `Every employer knows that if a worker takes them to the commission for an unfair dismissal claim, the worker will succeed' and that it is really all about trying to get money from the employer.' That is absolutely not the case. The system operates on the basis of procedural fairness, and employers have rights in the system—but so do employees.
The third reason why we continue to oppose this bill as a matter of principle is that we on this side of the House believe that all Australian citizens are equal before the law. That is, you cannot have laws that exclude categories of people from the coverage of those laws. In the event that the government had its way on this bill, you could have the absurd situation where you had people working side by side at, say, a manufacturing plant. Some of the workers in the office would be covered by a state award which would give them rights of redress in the event of unfair dismissal; and yet, if they had been previously covered by a federal award —as say, the metal workers at a plant would be—they would have no rights. Where is the fairness and the justice in a law which creates two classes of citizens, working at the same plant, with different obligations and different rights depending on whether they were covered by a federal or a state award? 
There are basic principles that, from our point of view, are not negotiable. Those principles are that people are entitled to the protection of law if they are unfairly dismissed, and they are entitled to a remedy or a recourse; the system should provide a fair go all round; and all Australians are equal before the law. This bill offends against those basis tenets and principles. There is nothing fair in this bill. It just points to the kind of doublespeak that one gets from the government when they bring a bill into this House with the intention of denying people in small business the right of redress against unfair dismissal. And they want to call that a fair bill.
We have estimated that, if the government had its way, about 700,000 employees would be affected—those covered by federal awards. So about 27 per cent of businesses where the employer was respondent to a federal award would have these basic rights denied them. Very importantly, as I indicated earlier, it would begin the process of creating two classes of citizens at the one workplace. Furthermore, it would be a matter of lottery too. The absurdity of this is that if you happen to be in a business where there are 18 people on the payroll, you have got no rights; but if you are in a business with 22 people on the payroll, you would have all the rights. It just does not make sense. It is not fair because it erodes job security in a very important area for the economy. I know that in my own region in the Illawarra, 91 per cent of businesses employ fewer than 20 people. I care about their wellbeing because I know that small business is the driver of job creation and employment growth. I want to make sure, as we all do, that the small business sector survives and thrives. But you cannot do when you are denying a whole lot of people basic rights under the law.
In the context of the enormous changes that are occurring in the workplace, the issues of job security and protection are very important. There is nothing worse for a family than for someone to lose their job. Under this system, if someone loses their job unfairly, we would even deny them the right of redress under law. It would leave open the possibility of capricious sacking. I think that the argument that people advance—that most employers look after their staff and want to ensure a good relationship with their staff—holds true; but we also know that there are cases where capricious sacking does occur. I think it would be quite unjust not to acknowledge that and not to ensure that there were some protections.
I think that this bill comes back to this House for purely political reasons. We do not have a major problem in the federal jurisdiction. In fact, fewer than 0.3 per cent of small businesses experience a federal unfair dismissal claim in the federal jurisdiction. So it is not as if this is a widespread problem for small businesses with federal award coverage. It is a minuscule number of businesses that are involved, and to those businesses that are involved in such claims, Labor has come forward with a range of constructive proposals. A lot of them have been discussed with small business and with representatives of business organisations. I saw down with a number of people from the Illawarra Business Chamber and went through some of the constructive suggestions they had about how the system could be improved, how it could be made easier to access and less costly, and how, at the end of the day, it could be a system where there might be some measure of harmonisation and streamlining between the federal and state systems. 
But all those attempts to try to improve the system have come to nothing, because the government is not really interested in improving the system; it is interested in pursuing an ideological crusade. What it tries to do is to exaggerate the reasons why this is necessary. I have just indicated that there are very small numbers of claims in the federal jurisdiction involving small business. The one argument that we constantly hear trotted out by government members is that, if we could get rid of these laws, somehow there would be an employment bonanza. Figures of 50,000 to 53,000 extra jobs are often bandied around.
In his second reading speech the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, sought to justify this employment claim. He said:
If one in 20 small business employers in Australia took on an additional employee because of a changed legislative framework for unfair dismissal, then an extra 53,000 jobs would result.
The government keeps repeating this claim that small businesses would create vast numbers of jobs if they were exempted from unfair dismissal laws. However, just repeating this claim, as we have heard this morning, does not convert a bald assertion into a fact. Small businesses are vital to our economy and to employment growth and it is the task of the government to address the factors that might prevent small businesses from growing and prospering. But to do that you have to work with facts and not just put your faith in hypothetical situations that are not backed up by any hard evidence.
The government has never bothered to present evidence to this parliament or to the public to support its promise of job creation. The reason for this is very clear: it is because none exists. If you do not believe what I am saying, listen to the evidence of the full bench of the Federal Court in the Hamzy case. In that case, the government tried to persuade the Federal Court that unfair dismissal laws in this country were inhibiting employment growth. After it had heard all the government's evidence the court was forced to conclude:
It seems unfortunate that nobody has investigated whether there is any relationship between unfair dismissal legislation and employment growth. There has been much assertion on this topic during recent years, but apparently no effort to ascertain the factual situation.
Later in that judgment the full bench had this to say:
... it seems to us that the suggestion of a relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven.
The members on the other side of the chamber can come in here and constantly assert as if it were fact that if these unfair dismissal laws were not there in the federal jurisdiction it would create 50,000 to 53,000 jobs, but I think the full bench of the Federal Court has greater wisdom than the parroting one hears from members of the government about this issue.
I want to go back to the point I made earlier. There are legitimate concerns about the operation of the system, and there are legitimate concerns about costs, processes and procedures. I do not doubt that the arguments advanced by business have weight and merit, but I fail to understand why, having placed before the government a range of constructive alternatives to make the system operate better, we are continually met with rejection. This is not really about improving the system; this is just an ongoing crusade that has been waged by this government, from the time of its election, to try and get rid of unfair dismissal laws. Labor's proposals go to reducing the scope for lawyers and other agents to profit from unfair dismissal claims, they go to reducing costs and delays in proceedings, they go to the improvement of procedures and they go to reducing uncertainty and confusion. I want to spend a bit of time outlining some of these proposals because I have not yet heard an argument from government as to why these suggestions have been dismissed. 
Firstly, Labor has argued that we need to restore the emphasis on reinstatement, rather than financial compensation, as the primary remedy. If we were to do that, I think a lot of the problems we see in the system will be diminished, particularly the ambulance chasers who on many occasions are in there to make money rather than to argue the merits of a reinstatement claim. We believe the commission should not accept an application that seeks only financial compensation, other than in exceptional circumstances such as victimisation or bullying. We believe the commission would have to consider the appropriateness of allowing paid representation in conciliation proceedings, which we believe would significantly reduce the costs in that jurisdiction. We believe that paid industrial agents would have to be registered, meet prescribed conditions in regard to qualifications and experience, and comply with a code of conduct. We believe that, in consultation with the states, we could develop information packages with practical examples to help small business with recruitment issues and procedural fairness issues related to the possibility of termination of employment.
There is no doubt that the government's misinformation campaign is causing widespread confusion. The perception that the employer is always wrong and that it is just about extracting money from the employer is fuelled by the misinformed comments that one hears regularly repeated in this chamber. Labor also believes that the commission ought to be able to operate within an indicative time frame for the resolution of cases. It is absurd that, as we have seen, some cases have dragged on for year after year when often what we need is a speedy resolution. One suggestion raised with me by the Illawarra Business Chamber, which has found its way into our proposed amendments, is that the commission ought to be encouraged to use electronic means of communication, such as videoconferencing, for conciliation proceedings to make it easier for businesses in regional and rural Australia to have cost-effective access to the jurisdiction. We also believe that a single application should be made on behalf of a number of employees where the circumstances of termination occur simultaneously and for related reasons.
So the Labor Party has come up with a range of practical, sensible amendments to the system which would reduce costs, simplify the process and ensure that there was a fair go all round. But, rather than accept this, the government persists in pursuing its ideological agenda in trying to deny those workers who happen by chance to work in a small enterprise the protection that the law should provide to all employees regardless of their particular circumstances. It would be an absurd situation for workers at the one plant to continue to have recourse and remedy under state unfair dismissal laws while those who happen to work in a small enterprise under a federal award are denied any rights at all. It is not the Australian way. Every Australian worker should have equal access and equal rights under Australian law. The government's legislation is motivated by ideology and politics. Its assumption that up to 53,000 additional jobs would be created is mere speculation, as the Federal Court made very clear in its decisions in the Hamzy case. You could be sure that this bill would, however, create greater job insecurity for those workers who by chance work in a small enterprise. It creates different classes of workers, often in the same plant, subject to different rules and different treatments. 
In conclusion, the bill offends against basic principles because it would provide no redress against injustice in the event of capricious sacking, it would provide no protection against unfair or capricious behaviour on the part of those employers who would choose unfairly to dismiss employees and it offends against the fundamental principle of a fair go all round. That is why people on this side of the chamber have continued and will continue to oppose the content of the bill, which is so falsely titled the fair dismissal bill.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—Both coalition and Labor Party members could be forgiven for feeling an inevitable sense of deja vu as we debate the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004. Unfortunately, this is where the common ground ends, because only those of us on this side of the House know the importance of this bill. The member for Throsby stated that we do not have a problem in the federal jurisdiction. Perhaps I could invite her to meet some of my local small business operators in the seat of Indi and she might change in mind. But if there is a genuine belief from the member for Throsby that we do not have a problem in the federal jurisdiction, perhaps she could speak to some of her state Labor colleagues in government right round Australia in all the states to encourage them to reform their industrial relations laws to assist small business instead of being an extreme burden.
By and large, only those of us on this side of the House know how much Australian small business needs this bill. Coming from a small business background, having worked in the family corner milk bar over 15 years, I know personally how much my parents and their small business friends who operated family businesses have suffered from the Labor Party's regulation of the industrial relations system. From one end of the electorate to another, I hear hard-working, entrepreneurial small business people plead with me: `Get rid of the unfair dismissal bogy on my small business. I can employ more people without the hindrance and fear of the Labor Party's agenda stifling my business's competitiveness.' All I can say to them is, `Yes, we understand, and we have tried.' In fact, we have tried more than 40 times.
As recently as last weekend, I was informed by a major employer in my electorate that the cost of unfair dismissal administration had prevented him from hiring the people he actually wanted to hire. This is not an isolated incident. The Labor Party's bureaucrats, perhaps nestled in the confines of Centenary House, have no idea the damage their refusal to listen to the united voice of small businesses has caused. The unfair dismissal regime has placed a huge burden on small business. These are businesses that do not have the luxury of well-read industrial lawyers dealing with the ins and outs of a claim. They do not have the luxury of shutting up shop or clearing the diary to head down to Melbourne for an Industrial Relations Commission hearing. These are people who are the engine room of our economy—the wealth providers on whom our society rests. We have reached a ludicrous point when a recent survey by CPA Australia declared that 27 per cent of small business operators felt they would be unable to get rid of an employee even if they had been caught red-handed stealing from them. 
On this side of the House, the Australian government has an unflinching commitment to improving Australia's unfair dismissal laws. The very best thing a government can do is to create more jobs, and we can do that by taking the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small business. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research found that the cost to small and medium sized business of complying with unfair dismissal laws is at least $1.3 billion a year and that these laws have played a part in the loss of more than 77,000 jobs from small and medium businesses. In addition, other studies have found that 50,000 jobs could be created if the unfair dismissal laws were reformed. Even the member for Hunter understands the burden of the unfair dismissal laws. I am sure you will not need reminding, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, of the member for Hunter's words in 1998 when he said, `Well, my wife constantly tells me she could afford to put on one person or would like to put on one person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals.'
Still we have the Labor Party voting against unfair dismissal improvements 40 times. It was revealed a little while ago, amid much fanfare, that the member for Rankin, the shadow minister for workplace relations, shares the views of the member for Hunter. He did go to extreme lengths, presumably after he was rapped on the knuckles, to deny such a claim, but what we say on the record is on the record, and even in conversations with major industry groups we must be prepared as members of parliament to stand by what we say. We cannot say one thing to one group to ingratiate ourselves with them and then turn around to an opposing group and claim the exact opposite.
The Labor Party's approach shows that, at the end of the day, jobs do not really matter. To the Labor Party, jobs are inferior to maintaining that close connection and that stranglehold that the unions have on them. It is almost like the Stockholm hostage syndrome: you end up sympathising with those who keep you locked up. The Labor Party seem very comfortably ensconced in that small room, controlled and ordered around by the trade union movement of Australia. Not only do the Labor Party not want to reform these laws; what they want to do is worse. They want to take unfair dismissal laws even further. Under the Leader of the Opposition, the plan is to unwind the filing fee, which will be a burden on business. Labor's plan is to give the union movement and labour law firms carte blanche to lodge unfair dismissal claims. It makes no sense to add to this burden by taking the filing fee away.
Rather than joining with the government to fix unfair dismissal laws and create more jobs for Australians, the Australian Labor Party would prefer to reward their union bosses. And why not? It is the union bosses who have donated $40 million since 1996 to the Australian Labor Party. They have bought the right to dictate policy to the Labor Party. My message to the Labor Party is this: remove your servile adherence to the union movement, for the good of Australia. Dissociate yourselves from the Craig Johnstons and Dougie Camerons of this world. Move into the 21st century not only for the good of small businesses but for the good of Australia. Move on so that we can flourish and grow and actually realise the potential of this great nation. Remove yourselves from the arthritic elements of the union style agendas that are stifling and impeding our growth.
The current unfair dismissal laws make the costs just too high for small business to take on new workers. The result is that thousands of Australians are missing out on the opportunity to get a job. The coalition is committed to making unfair dismissal laws fairer for small business. Why aren't the Labor Party? We can only assume that the Labor Party, from their behaviour and past policy, are bad for jobs. They are bad for Australian workers and bad for small business and employers. 
Maybe the answers lie in their industrial relations platform, which amounts to one of the least original and most regressive policy statements of all time. It has all the hallmarks, all the fingerprints, of old style union politics and obviously portrays total union domination. This is not to mention that the Labor Party will introduce a new $220 million federal payroll tax on businesses. Never mind that the Commonwealth abolished the federal payroll tax in 1971; Labor want to wind back the clock to bring it back and slug small businesses again. There is a bit of a deja vu element clouding the Labor Party. They are cocooned back in the early 1970s. We saw that recently with the pamphlet produced by the Leader of the Opposition claiming that it was time. It is not time. Now is not the time to wind back the clock to those disastrous policies. On this side of the House, we believe that payroll tax is a tax on jobs, a tax on employment. Rather than giving people in Australia the opportunity to work, Labor want to slug small business with a new federal payroll tax. So much for new Labor.
We can see the disproportionate influence of unions affecting policy outcomes when we compare the real world, where union membership in the private sector is only 17 per cent, to the old world of Labor, where union membership on the frontbench is over 80 per cent. The Labor Party is nothing more than a political factory where the members are mass-produced. You put in a little bit of party hack, a lot of union power, a liberal sprinkling of tokenism and voila! You have automaton politicians out of touch with mainstream Australia. No wonder small business collectively breathed in when the shadow minister for workplace relations triumphantly declared earlier in the year that the Labor Party and the unions are back in partnership.
The Howard government's success in creating more than one million jobs and supporting our small businesses is a triumph of industrial relations policy. I plead with the Labor Party to fit the final piece of the puzzle into place. I support this bill for the small business sector, and I commend it to the House. I ask only that the Labor Party stop being in business with the trade union movement so that small businesses in Australia can get on with the job of growing and giving more Australians jobs.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-12,"—We have just heard the member for Indi talk about the unfair dismissal, small business bogy and about her 15 years working in her own family's small business. I would like to let the member for Indi know that, prior to coming to this place, I worked for some 30 years as an employee in factories, down coalmines, in the higher education sector and in small business as well, and I have seen the real need for this unfair dismissal legislation.
The purpose of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 is to exempt those small businesses with fewer than 20 employees from the dismissal laws of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The government is proposing that new employees dismissed from federally regulated small businesses be excluded from seeking an unfair dismissal remedy. This bill has been before the House a number of times, and each time it has been rejected by the Senate. The irrational drive to curtail union power has clearly been a major objective of this government since it came to power. What this government does not accept and does not understand is that when you attack unions you are attacking the workers of this country. When you attack unions you are attacking the ability of ordinary Australian workers to access appropriate wages and conditions so that they can put food on the table and a roof over their heads and enjoy an appropriate standard of living. 
Just this morning it has been reported that, according to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the number of low-paid jobs has surged under the Howard government. Almost two out of every three new jobs created in the past three years pay less than $600 a week, according to the ACTU's research. ACTU President Sharan Burrow points out that low-paid and casual work is booming under this government, while permanent full-time work with decent pay and conditions is shrinking. The ACTU's research has found that Australia's job market is splitting in two and that our work force is rapidly changing.
From 2000 to 2003 the Australian work force grew by just over 400,000 new jobs, but nearly two-thirds of those jobs paid less than $600 a week, or less than $31,200 a year. Almost one million Australians were working overtime but were not being paid for it, according to this new research. And there were now more than 2.2 million casual workers in Australian—a 22 per cent increase since 1996. The data shows that part-time jobs have grown by almost a third in the last eight years, outstripping full-time jobs growth by more than three to one. The ACTU's research shows that low-paid, less secure jobs are the major trend of the Australian job market. Ms Burrow said this morning:
In the context of the current debate around industrial relations, people's lives are actually not being focused on. The Howard government's legacy is low-paid, insecure, casual work with increasing hours often unpaid for full time workers.
This bill reflects the government's approach to low-paid and vulnerable workers, and the Australian Greens are firmly opposed to it. Thankfully, a strong Senate has prevented the Howard government from implementing the more extreme end of its ideological agenda. The unfortunately named `fair dismissal' bill before us would be laughable were this government's agenda a little less frightening. As was reported in the Canberra Times midway through last year:
The Howard government certainly couldn't be accused of giving up on pursuing legislative change in the industrial-relations field.
...	...	...
Notions of “fairness” and “protection for employees feature prominently in the colourful and imaginative titles of several current Bills. However, it is necessary to peel back these labels to discover the Government's real intent. The Fair Dismissal Bill is a good example. It seeks to exempt businesses with fewer than 20 employees from federal unfair dismissal laws—a proposition that was recently rejected by the Senate for the seventh time. It is not exactly clear what concept of “fair dismissal” would apply to employees in these small business workplaces if the Bill became law.
As others have mentioned, it should not surprise us then that a bill which targets vulnerable small business workers is named the `fair dismissal' bill. This bill is anything but fair. It tries to create a two-tiered system of employment rights and, in doing so, offends the fundamental legal principle that all people have the right to equal treatment before the law. The government's use of names like this only makes their agenda look more insidious. What can they possibly aim to achieve with names for bills which obviously attempt to make the agenda look less insidious than it actually is? 
As my colleague in the other place Senator Kerry Nettle pointed out, the last time this bill went before the Senate it was noted that it was in fact the 21st attempt by the coalition to strip small business employees of the right to seek reinstatement or compensation in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for being unfairly sacked from their jobs. That is right—21 times. This is the same government that promised that no worker would be worse off under the coalition's industrial relations policies. Arguing in support of its earlier attempts to make this change, the government claimed that the current entitlement to seek reinstatement or compensation was costing jobs, and we heard that from the previous speaker.
The government told us that as many as 50,000 jobs would be created if only employers had more freedom to sack people. The government provided no evidence to support this claim, and departmental officials could offer no evidence to support it when making a submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill last year. The government's own expert witness in a Federal Court case dealing with an unfair dismissal case in late 2001 revealed that the claim was baseless; yet the government still persists in making the argument. For example, when the bill was rejected by the Senate back in March the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, said that the move would deny thousands of people a job. Wrong. Employment growth in the nineties was strongest when unfair dismissal laws were at their strongest. We know that the state of the economy and business confidence are major factors that drive employment growth. The consequence of this bill becoming law would be that employees of small businesses would have no protection from arbitrary sacking. This would further erode the relatively low level of worker protection in Australia. That is what we have to remember here. What the government does not really think about is workers' rights, workers' protection—protection of ordinary Australians.
—How about employers?
—`How about employees?' the member interjects.
—Employers.
—We need to protect employers and employees. There is no doubt about that. That is the role of this government—to be even-handed and to be fair, not to be biased in one direction.
An OECD report entitled Innovations in labour market policies: the Australian way, published in 2001, found that Australia scored at the low end of the scale on dismissal procedures in particular, as well as on severance pay, notice requirements and remedies for unfair dismissal. Exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws would encourage unscrupulous employers—and they do exist—to restructure and rearrange their operations to slip below the 20-employee level.
I note that an Australian Financial Review article on 18 March by Kayoko Tsumori entitled `Dismissal law benefits the long-term unemployed' rather well puts and is obviously very much in support of the government's case. But that reporter notes:
There appears to be a fear that the small business exemption will result in mass arbitrary dismissals. This is unlikely.
That is not good enough. We do not want `mass arbitrary dismissals' taking place as a result of this legislation, if it should happen to pass. It is just not good enough for the workers of Australia to be faced with `mass arbitrary dismissals'. Exempting small business from unfair dismissal laws would encourage, as I said, unscrupulous employers to restructure and rearrange their operations to slip below the 20-employee threshold. We have heard the member for Throsby in this debate talk about some of those possibilities. 
Just as large employers with unionised work forces exploited measures that this government introduced purportedly for non-unionised work forces to drive unions out of their workplace, big businesses could contract out work to small employers or break up their businesses into smaller units to get around unfair dismissal laws if this exemption were to take effect. Far from fostering an environment in which employers would be more likely to hire workers, as the government claims is its intention, this legislation would cause friction and instability, and that is not something we want.
Australians innately understand the idea of giving everyone a fair go, and not just those people who are lucky enough to work for a company employing more than 20 workers. This government clearly does not believe in giving all workers a fair go. This legislation is evidence of that. The government cannot be serious when it argues that making it easier to sack people will help create more jobs. Making it easier to sack people will only exacerbate the job insecurity that millions of Australian now work under, and they should not have to work under such a regime. This is not a serious job-generating measure, and the government has fooled no-one into believing otherwise. It is nothing more than the latest attempt to shift the balance of power towards the powerful—the bosses—and away from the vulnerable—the workers, the very people whom the unfair dismissal laws are designed to protect.
—This is not about class warfare, as the member for Canning is interjecting. It is about taking care of ordinary Australians, whether they be small business owners or workers, employers or employees. This is not about class; this is about taking care of ordinary Australians. This government has not taken the issue of stubbornly high unemployment seriously for the entire time it has been in office. Official unemployment remains stuck at around six per cent, but this figure masks the true extent of joblessness. Many people who have part-time work want more hours, and almost one million more people are discouraged job seekers. The real unemployment rate—the rate of those people who want work, are able to work and need extra work to bring their pay up to a living-wage level—is around the 12 to 13 per cent mark, according to some analysts.
The government's response to this serious problem, which causes great social dislocation and individual distress, is to further weaken the protective mechanisms that mediate the relations between employer and employee. The government describes this as deregulating the industrial relations system. The description belies the intention and the outcome, which is to give more power to the powerful at the expense of working people.
The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in speaking to this bill when it was last before this place, said the government trusted that employers and employees could arrange their working relationship without the need for `excessive regulation'. I am sorry, but the minister is wrong. He fails to acknowledge that the relationship between workers and management and bosses is in most cases an unequal one. That is why unions exist—to protect workers. That is why the industrial relations system in this country has developed the way it has—to protect workers from the abuses of bosses and management, to allow workers to share in the profits of their work, to allow workers to go to work and return home safely, and to develop an egalitarian society where poverty and want is minimised and the prosperity of this nation is shared amongst its people. 
The Australian Greens agree that most people will seek to work cooperatively to establish the best working arrangements for themselves. But laws such as unfair dismissal laws are not made for the majority of employers and employees. They are designed to protect the vulnerable—those with little or no bargaining power in the industrial relations arena. It is not enough, as the minister has argued, simply to have a job. Workers have the right to a safe workplace. They have the right to work with dignity and the right to fair pay and reasonable working conditions. And they have the right not to be sacked from their job without good cause and without the opportunity to discuss their work performance. That is what the present unfair dismissal laws do; they require discussion, negotiation and fairness. What could possibly be unreasonable about that?
The minister has failed to make a case to exempt small businesses. It is not the characteristic of an employer that matters in this circumstance. What matters is ensuring that all workers have the same level of protection. Just why the government has decided to reintroduce this legislation is unclear. It is obviously a double dissolution trigger, but, thankfully, it has no hope of securing Senate support.
The Australian Greens do not believe that this bill is justified or justifiable, and we certainly will not be pressured into supporting legislation that undermines the rights and the protection of working people. For the good of this country, the government must support both employers and employees, and not take sides as it does or as it is doing in this bill. The workers and employers in my electorate of Cunningham have been working together for a long time now—workers, unions, management, bosses, business groups such as the Illawarra Business Chamber and union organisations such as the South Coast Labour Council. The government needs to set in place a level playing field and protective measures for workers and employers. This bill threatens the process of equality and consensus and therefore should not be supported.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—Before I speak to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 and before the member for Cunningham leaves this House, let me say what a bilious diatribe that was. Hearing the ideological claptrap that he just came out with is almost enough to make one want to dry retch. You should be ashamed of yourself! Who wrote your speech for you—Sharan Burrow?
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—The member for Canning will address his remarks to the bill before the parliament.
—He obviously did not write it himself. It is just old-fashioned class warfare stuff; the Trotskyite sort of ideological claptrap you would expect from the member for Cunningham. Thank goodness he probably has only a couple more weeks in this place to bilge that out. Let me get that out of the way in the first place. It is unbelievable that he can stand here and rabbit on like that.
—The member for Canning will bring himself back to the bill before the chamber.
—The purpose of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 is to put in place unfair dismissal laws which will protect the jobs of workers, not protect the situation that the member for Cunningham has been talking about—that is, that this is an unfair, unequal set of laws. This legislation has been to this House more than 40 times now, as has been pointed out by the member for Cunningham. Obviously he does not know how the place works, because he said, `It is obviously a double dissolution trigger.' Let me tell you, it was a double dissolution trigger ages ago—so he is wrong again. It is just unbelievable; it is irrelevant. As I said, 40 times we have tried to bring into this House laws which will see more jobs created in this country. 
Small businesses are very vulnerable to people who, in a capricious sort of way, want to cost the employer his ability to trade or to be in business. I will give you an example. Recently I represented the minister at the business awards in Perth. I actually presented the microbusiness award—for businesses of five or fewer employees—which is sponsored by the federal government. There were some outstanding businesses which were operated largely by people who had taken severance pay or had left their previous jobs. There were some very innovative businesses. An outstanding company won the award and will now be part of the national awards. In their acceptance speech for this award, they pointed out that they had to operate using family members because they were too scared to try out or employ other people because they were worried about the unfair dismissal laws.
It is a rule of thumb in small business that, if you go to an advocate and say, `I've just had an unfair dismissal claim lodged against me,' unofficially they will say, `If you want to get rid of it, just give them three grand to get them out of the way, because it will cost you six grand to go through the legal route. By the time you pay lawyers and take time off from your business to defend an unfair dismissal, you're better off just giving them three grand in cash to get rid of them.' That is what is happening to businesses around Australia. The member for Throsby said that only 0.3 per cent of federal awards resulted in people registering an unfair dismissal. That is because the small business just wants to get rid of it and they pay them out.
There have been cases, which I have mentioned in this House and elsewhere, where people have agreed that they will start their job on Monday and have not turned up and then, in a very disingenuous way, have said they were unfairly dismissed. As a result, one business owner that I know said that he just gave them three grand to get rid of them. He could not stand the thought of having to go to court and engaging all those legal representatives. The fact is that small business needs this protection. There are a multitude of cases. For example, a jeans proprietor that I know had a girl working for them who stole a pair of jeans. She put on a pair of jeans and went home with them and did not bring them back. When they confronted her about it and said that they would have to dismiss her because she was stealing from them, she hit them with an unfair dismissal claim and they had to pay that out.
What do you do in those sorts of cases—people stealing from you, people verballing you et cetera? Small businesses do not have the infrastructure and the economy of scale to afford large-scale representation before industrial courts and courts in general. Small businesses either deal with it themselves by just paying them out or—as I have already pointed out—employ members of their family. One downside is that they quite often do not employ anybody formally and they just pay cash in the black economy, because they do not want to have a formal agreement with someone.
The fact is that it affects young people in particular because you cannot try a range of workers to find out if one will suit your small business—you have to take on the first person that you decide you will try. As we know from our electorate offices, we take on electorate staff and sometimes they do not work out. Thank goodness we have a mechanism whereby there is a three-month period where you can have a look. So you can deal with it that way, and after three months you are going to have some idea what your electorate office is going to be like. But, if you are a small business and you do not have those sorts of mechanisms in place, you are very vulnerable to vexatious claims. That is what we are talking about today—and why shouldn't these people be given protection? 
The member opposite, mouthing the stuff that the Labor Party has given him, and the member for Throsby, an ex-ACTU president, who also went on with this—but you would expect her to take that line because she is an ex-ACTU president—have said that there is no proof that 50,000 jobs or more would be created. The member for Cunningham also said this. He probably got his notes, as I said, from Sharan Burrow. But the fact is that, from chambers of commerce and business surveys around this country, the evidence shows that small businesses—the largest generators of employment in this country—would employ at least one more person if they were not facing these sorts of small business encumbrances. And, as I have already said, it is generally the young people who would be given the opportunity to be employed.
I cannot believe that the member for Cunningham came out with the bizarre statement that, back in the early 1990s, employment was better because you did not have these unfair dismissal laws. Currently in this country we have the lowest unemployment since the sixties. So where did he get that figure from? You would have to ask him, but you would probably have to give him a lie detector test to try to get the truth out of him. He was just mouthing something that somebody else told him.
We have low unemployment in this country because we have a flexible work force. And that is what these laws go towards. Why do we have such a low unemployment level in this country? It is because our industrial relations laws have become more flexible. Because they have become more flexible, the economy is far more productive; because it is productive, it is generating growth; and, when you generate growth, you generate jobs. It is a cyclic thing. As a result all the fundamentals line up.
Australia is currently going through an economic boom. Quite often, you do not know that you have had an economic boom until you have actually been through it. It is like the old saying: you do not know the value of water until the dam dries up. In this case, Australia is going through unprecedented economic times. Jobs growth is high, unemployment is low; interest rates are low, inflation is low; and investment is high. When you have all those things lined up, you have a very good economy. One of the bonuses of a good economy is that low-paid workers actually get jobs.
One of the things that was said in this place by the member for Cunningham—and I did try and write it down—was, `When you attack the unions, you attack the workers of this country.' What a lot of garbage! In this country at the moment 17 per cent of people in the private sector belong to a union. So what about the 83 per cent of people who do not belong to a union? Aren't they workers as well? Can't you call them workers as well—the ones who do not belong to a union? Or is this the deeply entrenched mind-set of the dinosaurs on the other side: that you can only be called a real worker if you belong to a union? I think not; I certainly disagree.
The fact is that the members opposite from the Labor Party in particular owe their place in this House to the union movement. We know—as I have just said—that only 17 per cent of the people belong to a union, yet 78 per cent of the members of the Labor Party in this House and in the Senate have had a union career or working background. How representative is that? How representative can it be for 78 per cent of those people to have a history in the union movement—and we know they all have to belong to a union to be a member of this place, so 100 per cent belong to a union—when only 17 per cent of the Australian work force is actually unionised? They are not representative, unlike those of us on this side of the House. We have people from a vast range of occupations. 
—Small business.
—Small business people; doctors. Teresa Gambaro came from a restaurant background. You could go through everyone. We are very diversified on this side of the House, yet 78 per cent on that side are former union troglodytes. They have to obey the people who put them here because those people control their preselection. We know that the union will determine who comes here. This has become a sheltered workshop for former ACTU presidents. We had the former member for Wills, Bob Hawke; we have Simon Crean, a former ACTU president, now the member for Hotham; we have the member for Batman, a former ACTU president; and the member for Throsby is a former ACTU president. Which seat will Sharan Burrow get?
—Yours!
—I would love her to come to Western Australia and contest Canning, given the fact that they have a problem today with their candidate, I understand, who is trying to resign as the Labor candidate. That is interesting. The people on the other side are laughing. It is nice to see the member for Braddon caucusing with the deeply entrenched left of the Green party. I am sorry, Sid: you will get a bad name if you keep that up. Generally, you are not a bad person.
—Do you think we are talking about you?
—I have a deep affection for the member for Braddon.
—I love you, too.
—Thank you very much. We love each other, then. There might be a bit of levity in this but at the end of the day we are talking about providing better opportunities. If you cannot stay in business, you cannot employ anybody.
It is a courageous thing for people start a business. For example, a lady may start a hairdressing shop on her own, quite often at home, and then decide that she is doing so well that she will shift from home to a shopping centre. She takes on a lot of costs to set up that shop, including third party insurance and all that sort of stuff that you end up with. It is a courageous person who does that. What the people opposite do not understand, because none of them have ever been in small business, is that people have to quite often borrow on their house—capitalise on their home loan—to provide for the operations and cash flow in a small business. Quite often they will tell you that to pay the wages of the people they employ they have to pull it out of their Visa on a weekend. We are saying that these people have put their heads on the line and they cannot afford to have somebody in their business either not working or working against them by doing such things as stealing et cetera.
Those opposite will then tell you: `We've heard a story about someone who was pregnant and they got sacked. That is unfair dismissal at its worst.' The laws of this country do not allow that. That is called—
—Unlawful. 
—Unlawful dismissal. Thank you. There are many areas of unlawful dismissal that you do not enter into, whether it is sex, religion, race et cetera. These are the facts of the matter.
The Labor Party are just so wedded to the union movement. We heard the member for Rankin, their spokesman, say that no matter what we bring into this place regarding industrial relations laws they will oppose. So of course we have no hope. The member for Cunningham said, `Thank goodness we've got a strong Senate'—that is what he called it—`so that when these laws get to the Senate they get knocked off.' Of course they are going to get knocked off, because we know that the fifth faction of the Labor Party is the Greens, and they support everything that Labor does in the Senate and in this House. The member for Cunningham has never come across from that side to this side to vote for us. We never expect the support of the Greens because they have never voted in the House of Representatives for this government, so we know that we will never get the support of the Greens in the Senate. And when they act in concert with the other minor parties, of course we do not get anything through the Senate. That is a disgrace.
This government has been elected three times now with a mandate to govern, and just on this law we have been thwarted 40 times. It has been through this parliament 40 times and been rejected. It is a law that the people of Australia want; it is a law that the businesses of Australia want. But no!
I will give you an example of what would happen if you had wall-to-wall Labor governments in this country. The Labor Party has now said that they and the union movement are one and everything that comes out of their national conference is binding. They have also said at their national conference that they will not allow unfair dismissals to go through. That is binding. That is why they have to do it. At their national conference they said—and it is in their manifesto—`We won't allow the passing of unfair dismissal laws.' As a result of acting as one they have to do as they are told by their conference. It is mandatory.
Just going to my home state of Western Australia, when the Labor Party took over there and the Gallop government got in they began to dismantle the workplace agreements process and develop what they call EEAs, employee-employer arrangements. They are state based awards. They are centrally controlled, which is what federal Labor wants to do: centrally control federal awards. They are done as a package and the individual cannot negotiate a better deal. In other words, they cannot get better wages and conditions. They just have to take the one off-the-rack deal.
I will demonstrate how the workers view the new industrial relations arrangements in Western Australia, which the Labor Party would foist on us if they were to get into government. Since the Gallop government was elected—and that was almost four years ago—there have been 114 individual awards signed under the new WA arrangements. Guess how many have registered with the federal AWAs in that same period of time? Sixty-five thousand. They have voted with their feet. It is just amazing to compare the 114 to the 65,000. The workers of Western Australia have said, `We want a better deal. We are not going to stay with this union-dominated, Labor-confected award system that the Gallop government in Western Australia has cobbled together. We are going to get out of that and transfer to a federal award.' Sixty-five thousand have shifted to federal awards. That is an indictable figure by anyone's imagination, and I am sure the member for Braddon, with his superior intelligence, would appreciate that. We are not so sure about the member for Cunningham, but anyway. 
—I just need to check your figures first.
—They are figures from the chamber of commerce and the industrial relations department of Western Australia. I challenge you to dispute them, because they are correct. I have been following these figures, because I have spoken on every one of these unfair dismissal pieces of legislation. I have spoken on every one of them because I have a passion to support the small businesses in my electorate. They ask me to come in here and help do something about these laws so they can get on and expand their businesses. That is why I am again up here today. I am here for the small businesses of Canning and Australia, because they want a fair go.
The workers do need a fair go. Of course they do. But the best thing you can do for a worker is to give him a job. The member for Cunningham bemoans that people are only getting $600 a week. I tell you what: I know a lot of people who would not mind $600 a week. That is something a lot of people would like to be getting. The member for Cunningham says that is terrible. I think a young person entering into the work force would quite enjoy that. At the end of the day, this bill must be supported. When it gets to the Senate again, surely good people like Senator Murray—a sensible person from the Democrats—will see this and help pass this bill to protect small business in this country.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 is a presentation of the same 2002 bill that was laid aside after rejection by the Senate. As I said in my contribution to that debate in February 2002, I have supported government legislation that excludes small business from the federal unfair dismissal laws, since rebadged `fair dismissal' laws. For the purposes of the original legislation, a small business was defined as one employing fewer than 15 people. This was amended to 20 employees for the 2002 bill and now this one. In continuing to support this legislation, I again put on the record that I want to see fair legislation in the workplace, and that applies to the balance between the rights of employees and the rights of small employers.
I have noted during this protracted and ideological stand-off between a government so often reactionary on industrial legislation and an opposition equally blind at times to the reality of the modern workplace that there is a considerable difference between the ideology of this debate and the reality out there in the marketplace. I fiercely defended the importance of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to a balanced and harmonious workplace, and I firmly believe the Employment Advocate is more akin to an employers advocate. By the same token, I rejected any arguments that secret ballots should not be part of workplace agreements.
This bill extends the definition of a small business to those that employ no more than 20 people, including regular casual employees, and empowers the AIRC to reject applications from employees of so defined small businesses without holding a hearing. I see no overwhelming argument to oppose the extension from 15 to 20 employees. As I have said before, there is a vast difference between these small businesses and an organisation like Electrolux in my own electorate when it comes to laying off employees. Small businesses of the size we are debating cannot bear the cost of protracted unfair dismissal cases.
I have seen enough of small business operations in rural areas over the years to know that small business is based on mutual trust between employer and employee. There are protections against unlawful dismissal based on sex, race or other factors, including union membership or family responsibilities, that will protect workers in any workplace. So too are traineeships and apprenticeships protected. These are not being adjusted in any way in this legislation. 
In a larger workplace—with above 20 employees and into the hundreds, as with Electrolux or Friskies pet food plant—there may well be a trusting relationship between management and workers, but there also may not be. I will not support the extension of these laws above the 20 employees set out in this legislation. The productivity gains expected in larger organisations can quickly translate into employees being regarded simply as units of cost to be added and discarded as market forces fluctuate. Indeed, as we have seen with Electrolux, the need to become globally competitive and follow world's best practice is the basis on which companies are allegedly arranging their processes. We recently saw the shift offshore of the small fridge plant from Orange, and those units will now be imported from South-East Asia—and the obvious reasons for that do not need to be detailed—resulting in the loss of 200 jobs at that particular plant. It is interesting at this point to note that a study shows that the impact of that on the central west economy is two times the impact of the Mitsubishi cutbacks on Adelaide.
It is on the basis of this study, that I had done by the Western Research Institute, that I have again approached the Prime Minister and sought his review of a letter he wrote to me in which he said that the two situations could be compared and that the one in South Australia was state wide. I simply said, on behalf of the Job Network and on behalf of those employees—many of whom are at the end of 20year careers and some at the end of 25-year careers in the white goods industry and these are the only skills they have—that there needs to be urgent consideration of a package of proportional dimensions to that offered to Adelaide because these people are going to need not only new enterprise incentive schemes but also urgent retraining and, in some cases, counselling.
I really worry about them taking their payout and putting it into microbusiness, even given the good work that business enterprise centres may be able to do and, indeed, all of the resources of government advising them with financial counselling and so on of how best to do it. I really do wonder, given the rate at which small businesses go under and with those first two years being so critical, that these people may be setting themselves up for failure by pumping their resources quickly into what they believe may be a microbusiness opportunity. So there are a lot of factors in this. It is not just as simple as arguing that—because we have got the Cadia mine down the road with a huge work force and projections of expansion of that work force, and perhaps because the agri-industry, education and some of the commercial sectors are doing reasonably well—there will be automatic jobs for those Electrolux workers when inevitably they come off the payroll. I also appeal to Eletrolux to soften its attitude to allowing those people to leave early, if necessary, so they can maximise their opportunities of gaining alternative employment.
The Prime Minister wrote and said that Calare has done particularly well since he has taken office, and the electorate is grateful for the $160 million—now about $178 million—worth of assistance to the electorate, with such things recently as the $10 million for Mount Panorama. Any electorate expects matters of national importance, icons like that, to receive funding, whoever its member is. I applaud the government for that level of support. But I do ask the Prime Minister—I have written to him on this, giving him a briefing; in fact, I have given him the full report from the Western Research Institute—to reappraise the assessment of the impact he is being told those cutbacks will have. 
As I said, in a larger work force there are difficulties that arise between the work force and the management and there is not the level of understanding that would exist in a business with 20 or fewer employees. The productivity gains expected in larger organisations can quickly translate into those employees being obliged to step down. There must be a process—and unfair dismissal proceedings are part of that process—for workers to have protection against unfair dismissal. That is why I firmly support the right of workers to collectively bargain and not be forced into a situation where they are the weak party in any negotiation.
I said before in debate on these eight bills—or thereabouts now, I think—that I have wrestled with the possibility that I am helping to enshrine in legislation a denial of an individual's rights. But I have examined this from both perspectives—of the employee and of the employer—and I am convinced that, unless you have a mutually respectful relationship in a business of the size we are talking about, you have no relationship at all and everybody suffers. I say that, mindful of the explosion of casual work in our society and the added stresses that places on individuals who are told by the government they should be relaxed and comfortable, when almost 30 per cent are now employed casually. The male component, the breadwinner component of such casualisation is growing—and again, with those Electrolux workers, I can believe the best that many can expect is an odd assortment of casual and part-time work compared with the full-time employment they have had for many years. Many people simply will have far less work than they need; in fact, that is the case at the moment and it seems to be the increasing trend.
Five per cent unemployment does not mean that 95 per cent of people have as much work as they want. It may once have meant that; it does not now. The recent ACTU report on casual work showed that quite starkly. One hour a week is enough to be regarded as employed, tens of thousands are hidden, those on the disability support pension and youth allowance recipients are not included in the statistics. One in three women is employed on a casual basis and many are not enjoying the amazing flexibility of the new age labour market. They and an increasing number of middle-aged, downsized men desperately want full-time employment.
Having said that, there must be a balance between the rights of the employer and the rights of the employee, especially in small business. A trusting relationship can lead to permanent part-time and full-time positions in rural small business, without the spectre of litigation when an unsatisfactory workplace outcome occurs. It may be and probably is different in the city with a mobile work force; maybe the trust is not there as much as it is in rural small business. But I can only go on what I see and feel in my electorate and from talking to small business operators about their concerns about the ogre of the possibly litigious future they may face in a situation where trust and mutual respect has broken down irreparably.
I see strong support for this legislation amongst my small business constituency and, incidentally, I do not see any significant protest from employees. Lots of figures have been thrown around by the government on the number of jobs this legislation might generate. Those figures have been questioned by no less than the Full High Court in its Hamzy decision. I am not going to go down that route. We cannot accurately put any figure on the job-generating impact of this legislation, but we can put aside ideological stances for a moment and consider whether we want to perpetuate a `them and us' worker-employer relationship or a situation of mutual trust where the need for such legislation as this is superfluous. As I said last time this legislation was debated, figures or not, ideology or not, I stand by my assertion that the small business owner's perception of the unfair dismissal laws is and will continue to be a deciding factor in decisions to employ or not to employ. To that end, I again support this legislation. ",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—Again I rise to speak on this important issue. It seems that we have changed the title of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 several times, and still the Senate fails to recognise how incredibly important this bill is in order to generate further employment opportunities, particularly in rural and regional Australia. That is simply because this bill allows employers who employ fewer than 20 people to feel confident that if they take on an employee and work slows down—particularly in the drought-ravaged areas around my electorate of Riverina—they can decide that they are not able to carry that employee. Hopefully, in order to keep employing the rest of their staff, if they shed one or two people then they can keep operating for a period of time, whereas if they were forced to keep those staff on they would not be able to continue operating at all. The bill before the House amends the Workplace Relations Act to provide security to those small businesses throughout our communities and to encourage those same small businesses to create jobs in our local towns and cities right across this country.
As many people are aware, I am an avid supporter of small business and the numerous benefits that it brings to our communities, particularly, as I said, in rural and regional Australia. I have a small-business background and continue with a family small business, or medium sized enterprise. Having worked in a family business for many years, I do understand, critically, the many difficulties faced by small business operators each and every day. I believe it is important that the members of this House, particularly those in the opposition, understand the daily grind of a small business operator and the sacrifices that they make to keep a business running and their staff employed. All the while, they are doing the community an enormous service: they are hiring staff, contributing to the local economy and supporting local community organisations and groups. The majority of small and medium sized enterprise owners are absolutely committed to their employees. They take huge risks for them and on their behalf.
It is a great pleasure today to follow the member for Calare in speaking, because the last time I followed the member for Calare he was not supporting relief from redundancy pay-outs for employers with fewer than 15 employees; he was not supporting that in the House. But today he has seen fit to support this fair dismissal bill. I congratulate him, because at least he is making some move towards assuring small businesses that they should be able to engage staff without fear or favour of being absolutely stuck with those people when times get very tough.
Many people think that being a small-business operator means you are making a fortune. I recall the speech of the member for Calare when he spoke against relief from redundancy pay-outs for businesses with fewer than 15 employees: he felt that they were continually in the black and were not going broke. I vividly recall being quite upset by the comments he made, because what is the measure of success and fortune for a small business? It perhaps means being a very small amount in the black if you are not in the red, let me tell you. Many of the businesses in the electorate that I represent just survive. They might make a living, they might make a comfortable living, but they certainly do not make a fortune. I do not know of many small businesses in my electorate that make a fortune. But they do, as I said, provide services to their community that otherwise might not exist. 
This bill is about protecting businesses with fewer than 20 employees from unfair dismissal action. Allowing this provision to be passed will encourage the creation of jobs in the critical small business sector. The creation of jobs contributes enormously to our local economies and to Australia's economic wealth and success, and leads to the unemployment figures that we are seeing—a 25-year low. It is an absolute all-time low in my electorate of Riverina. It is primarily because these small businesses are taking the risk with full-time employees, continuing to employ people despite some very significant downturns in their economies through the longstanding drought.
The cost to a small business of defending an unfair dismissal case is an enormous drain on finances—believe you me—as well as being both mentally and emotionally draining. At one stage I had an interlude in small business where one of the staff members I employed had determined that he was not going to work. My other employees were very concerned that they were working and carrying the weight of a nonproductive staff member. He would quite clearly leave the premises for two, three and four hours at a time and then come back in time to go to lunch. It was a concerted effort by him to get sacked so that he could then get a pay-out, because he required some additional money.
Finally, after a period of discussion with this staff member, I resolved that I had no choice but to remove the option of employment from him. Of course, he went to the Industrial Relations Commission. They came back to my work force and said that we had to re-employ this young man. My staff actually said, `Well, if you re-employ this person, we're all leaving, because we're not prepared to carry the weight of a nonproductive person. It's unfair, unproductive and inefficient and we are not prepared to do this.' That was the trial that we endured. Fortunately, the Industrial Relations Commission and the union could see that it was better to have one person unemployed than a whole shop full of workers unemployed due to the actions of one selfish young man.
This can happen because employers are generally very committed to their employees and take enormous risks in their employment. We do have protection in unfair dismissal laws. Why can't the Labor Party and the Senate, after 40 unsuccessful attempts to introduce this legislation, see that unfair dismissal laws are there to protect the people that they are seeking to protect?
To defend an unfair dismissal claim, many small business operators are forced to spend a day or more away from their businesses. This results in a loss of income and productivity and also means that small business operators may be forced to close their business while they are attending a hearing. If the owner of a one-man business has taken the giant leap of faith and employed somebody and their circumstances do not allow them to continue that employment, they might then find themselves having to close their business to go and defend the action. This is in addition to the cost of hiring a solicitor to defend the claim.
With small business operators too wary to employ additional staff in busy periods or to expand, the opportunity for jobs is lost. Thousands of jobs in my electorate of Riverina alone go begging each and every year, with businesses too scared to hire additional staff. Opportunities for workers, including our young people, do not come to fruition and many are forced to leave our region—which is an absolute crying shame and a sin—to seek employment in metropolitan centres, never to return. Thus we see our country members having to cope with larger and larger electorates while city electorates get smaller and smaller, yet the remuneration is the same for members in very small city seats as for those in very large country seats. There is quite a significant difference in the way the country seats are having to be managed due to many of our people having to move to cities to gain employment. Unfair dismissal laws are one reason why they have to do that. 
This amendment will require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order an unfair dismissal application invalid if it involves a small business with fewer than 20 people. This will apply only to new employees of a small business. The bill will not exclude employees of small businesses from the unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. As I have said before, it will continue to be illegal for any business, regardless of its size, to dismiss an employee for a discriminatory reason such as their age, gender or religion. Employers will only be able to dismiss employees if they are not fulfilling their work role or if the employer's circumstances are so dire and difficult that they are cannot afford to continue paying them. All businesses will also continue to be required to give appropriate notice of termination—which they do, because, as I said, owners of small businesses and medium enterprises are absolutely committed to their work force.
As a member of this government I am extremely proud of what we have achieved for the Australian people. We have the lowest unemployment rate in a generation due to the delivery of responsible economic policies. When we came to government in 1996, unemployment was at about 8.2 per cent. Today it is at 5.6 per cent, and it is lower in some places, such as Riverina. There are some conflicting figures around, but one of my local councils, Wagga Wagga City Council, indicated that unemployment in Wagga Wagga was at around 3.9 per cent and at times lower—which is pretty extraordinary when you consider that it is an inland area. The unemployment rate has been below six per cent for 10 consecutive months, an achievement which has occurred only one other time in 25 years. We have seen the creation of 1.3 million jobs since this government came to this House under the leadership of John Howard and John Anderson in 1996. We are a long way from the sky-high interest rates and unemployment figures that we all had to endure during the last years of the Labor government.
In areas like workplace reform, where this government has strived to make changes—and has been elected to implement these reforms—we have continually been frustrated, as the member for Canning said, by the Labor Party and opposition parties in the Senate. As a result, the current unfair dismissal laws place a burden on our small businesses. Unlike large companies, small businesses do not have dedicated employees to deal with paperwork and compliance issues. These issues are dealt with by the small business operator-owners and are often carried out after long hours at work and on weekends. Long after the doors have been shut after the day's trade and the employees have gone home, the employer is still there doing the paperwork, complying with the system and determining just how much he or she might be able to withstand from the banks in order to continue running their business so that they may perform the very fulfilling role of employing Australian people. 
With the enormous burden of compliance issues, many small business operators have little understanding of unfair dismissal laws, because they are out there doing the job, working on the floor. They are trying their best and they have undertaken an enormous risk to start their business. They have paperwork coming across their desks every day from state and Commonwealth governments describing changes to different agreements, tax changes and different compliance rules, which are very significant. They find it very difficult to understand the rules that they have to comply with respect to unfair dismissal laws.
As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations explained in his second reading speech on this bill, a survey by CPA Australia indicated that 27 per cent of small business owners believed that they were unable to dismiss an employee even if the employee was stealing from them. That is the perception out there. Employers think, `I can't do anything about this. I'm going to be sued. I can't afford to be sued and I can't afford the time off work. Then I've got to put the person back on, and it makes an untenable situation on our workplace floor.' According to the survey, 30 per cent of small business owners believed that employers always lost unfair dismissal cases. These are real obstacles and fears for small business owners who are thinking about employing people. Some of them are doing it tough and are very concerned about how they are going to get out of their financial fix if they are not able to reduce their work force—if that is going to assist them to keep other people employed. I would like to quote from an article that appeared on 21 July 2004 in one of my local newspapers, The Riverina Leader.
—One of the great country papers.
—Absolutely—and Greg Conkey is one of the greatest editors in our free newspaper area. The article states:
Pre-election surveys conducted by Australian Business Limited (ABL) should leave no doubt in the mind of the Labor Party and Australian Democrats that small business wants current unfair dismissal laws changed, said the Riverina Business Development Manager, Stephen Joyce.
The article goes on to say that 75 per cent of those who responded to the Business Priorities 2004 pre-election study identified unfair dismissal laws as either a major or a moderate concern. That is very different from what we hear touted across the floor by the Labor Party when they are arguing against this legislation. They say that it is not an issue out there, it is not a barrier, and it is not a blockage to employment. Let me tell you: they are absolutely uninformed—as you would expect they would be, having very limited, very rare experience in employing anybody.
The article says that 73 per cent of respondents believed that unfair dismissal laws affect small business productivity. The article also refers to figures from the Commonwealth Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, which state that 7,000 unfair dismissal applications were filed with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission at the end of 2003. That is absolutely appalling. According to the figures, small business makes up 34 per cent of these applications—yet the Labor Party say there is no problem. Of course there is a problem; it is just very difficult for the Labor Party to see it, because they generally have very limited involvement with small to medium business enterprises. The figures do not include the percentage of small businesses which may settle prior to reaching the commission, in an effort to save themselves time and money. That is the fear of most small business employers, so they will settle and they will agree to take somebody back on, even if it is proven that the person might be misappropriating funds. They will take them back on simply because they have this enormous fear of having to attend hearings and spend more time and money. 
According to the newspaper article, Australian Business Limited state that many small businesses are intimidated because they do not understand the complex nature of the current unfair dismissal laws. As I said before, this is something that the opposition has absolutely no understanding of. This fear and misunderstanding about unfair dismissal legislation is only exacerbated by the opposition's determination to intimidate our hardworking small businesses and to put them all in that one basket because of the actions of a very limited number of employers. It is very few employers who are not committed to their staff. Small business operators work hard to build and maintain a successful business and provide valuable employment to their communities. The stubborn attitude of the Labor Party in refusing to support the government's reforms reflects their ignorance of small to medium businesses and the valuable contribution that they make to our communities and to Australia as a whole.
The government, of which I am very proud to be a part, is committed to the small and medium business sector and the important role it has in job creation for our communities. I call on the opposition to support these reforms and recognise the burden that is placed on small business due to your refusal to support the government on this bill. I urge you to rethink your stance and support the government's attempt to ensure small business can continue to employ Australians, particularly rural and regional Australians.
 (Mr Wilkie)—Before I call the honourable member for New England, I would remind the member for Riverina that her remarks need to be made through the chair, not directed at the chair.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—I would like to speak briefly to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004, as I have on a number of other occasions when this bill has been presented to the House in its various shapes and forms. I say at the outset that I support the government in relation to this legislation. Seeing that it has come before the parliament on so many occasions, this is an area where the philosophical differences between the two sides of the parliament really should be set aside. It is becoming almost farcical—and each side is as guilty as the other. The member for Riverina made some important points. What is important here are the people who operate these small businesses and the people who work for them.
Irrespective of people's philosophical and ideological views on this, and despite the history of the Liberal Party versus the Labor Party over industrial relations—particularly back in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s—I think it is time we moved on. In this particular case we are talking about people who risk their own capital to start up businesses, employ people in growing numbers, and generate more income in the economies that they live in. It is time that we recognised that the current arrangements are working against employment. I am disappointed in the Labor Party on this issue, because I have always believed that the Labor Party stood for trying to create more jobs to encourage more employment. By continually voting against this legislation I think it is creating a definite blockage to employment.
So I am supportive of the government's view on this. I thought the member for Riverina made some very clear statements on the particular issues for country small businesses. There are concerns out there in the business community, particularly for people who are employing five, six, seven, eight or 20 people. They do not have time. They are busy running their businesses and making sure there is a margin for profit left in their operation. They do not want to become industrial relations lawyers. The member for Riverina expressed the concerns they have about the legal actions that can take place if they want to lay off someone who is not performing very well. I will not go back through all those issues. I just want to put it on record that I am supportive. 
In terms of the broader picture for business, employment and industrial relations, we are talking about the cost impediments that various changes can have on small business operators. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on a couple of the other issues that are very important for small businesses and their operation. There is obviously the burden of costs. One of the things we are looking at now is the cost of fuel escalating at an enormous rate. Very grave concerns are being expressed by various international players as to what could be happening with the price of fuel over the coming months and years. A number of people in this parliament have raised issues relating to this from time to time. One issue is the taxation levels on fuel. I think most people know that the Commonwealth government did cap the indexation rates on fuel excise, but there is still a non-capped GST express train occurring as fuel prices escalate. At some stage, whether it be through the Council of Australian Governments processes or other processes, we are going to have to look very closely at that. If we do have this enormous escalation occurring in fuel prices, we cannot have that burden passed back through the system—
—You have got to get the states to agree on that.
—particularly to country people. The minister says that you have to get the states to agree on that—and that is quite right. One thing the states did not do is remove the fuel sales grant scheme; the Commonwealth government removed the fuel sales grant scheme. That scheme was put in place, quite rightly, by the Commonwealth government—and I applauded the government of the time, even though I was a member of the state parliament when that occurred. Quite rightly the Prime Minister and the cabinet agreed that, because there was going to be an inequitable application of the goods and services tax for country people—because they were paying a different bowser price for fuel—the government would put in place what was called the fuel sales grant scheme so that people who lived in the country would not be disadvantaged. I think it was last October that the leader of The Nationals gave an ironclad guarantee that that would be maintained into the future and the government would not have a dual tax system with one GST for country people and another for city people. I think it was in February that that all turned around again, and obviously the Liberals once again told The Nationals what they had to do. That all turned around, and the fuel sales grant scheme has been removed. So now we have a system in which country people pay more in goods and services tax than their city counterparts. So I ask the minister to look seriously at that issue. The unfair dismissals bill has implications, but so does the inequity in the application of the goods and services tax.
The other issue I would like to raise briefly is the cost of doing business in country Australia and how we can do something about some of these things internally rather than always trying to blame someone else in terms of free trade agreements et cetera. Why don't we look internally at the things that we can do? An obvious example is the further promotion of ethanol as part of our fuel mix. I suggest that we should look seriously at mandating 10 per cent ethanol in our petrol and phasing that in over a period of time. I thought the government was moving in that direction a few years ago, but the oil companies and other players in the global conglomeration of business seem to be calling the tune and the government has moved away from its own renewable energy legislation. If our petrol contained 10 per cent ethanol it would have an enormous impact on country businesses—the small businesses we are all talking about. The flow-on effects would be extraordinary. It would replace imports. It would take away the dependence of a lot of our grain exports on the vagaries of international grain markets. It would have an enormous impact on employment in country communities. It would underwrite the price of grain. There are a whole range of things that would occur. 
If the government is serious about being fair to people and trying to generate business activity within our own borders, it should revisit the ethanol arrangements it has put in place. There is no doubt that there is going to be an escalation in the price of petrol and, at some stage, we have to recognise that we cannot keep using that as a revenue source. We have to recognise that we may gain internationally some comparative advantage if we take advantage of agriculture, the efficiency of our farmers and the potential to grow some of our own fuel here. That could apply to the sugar industry as well. Those communities are having enormous problems at the moment. The small businesses up there are under enormous pressure because of the collapse of the sugar industry and the rather cavalier fashion in which sugar was left out of the free trade agreement. Everybody seemed to say: `That's okay. We'll just throw a few dollars at them, and they will eventually go away.
I do not think that is good enough. We have got a circumstance now with ethanol and renewable energy where we are exporting our grain at a world price that is corrupt and then using some of the money we get from the export of that grain to go and buy oil at a price that suffers the vagaries of international trade and that is in a sense a corrupt price too. Then we have the hide to talk about free markets within this building and how we should enter into a whole range of free trade agreements. I suggest we should do things that we have some control over internally and look at the possibility of escalating the mandating of ethanol in our fuels. In my view, that will have a much more significant impact on the profitability of many small businesses right across Australia than this legislation.
As I said, I am a supporter of this legislation. I think the Labor Party philosophically have to get off an old treadmill they have been on for many years and get this legislation through the House. But if the government had put as much energy into renewable energy, the ethanol related energy sources that we could be producing in Australia, as they put into this legislation, bringing this bill back 40 times, it could have been more productive expenditure of energy for country people and small business than continually rotating this particular bill.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am very pleased to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004. As the member for New England acknowledged, it has been before the House numerous times. In fact, the other night here in the House when one of my colleagues from the class of '96 was celebrating a birthday, one of the other members put on, for nostalgia reasons, a video covering the 1996 campaign. In that 1996 campaign one of the key elements the coalition raised was that we would get rid of the unfair dismissal laws for small business. So we were campaigning on that before we were elected to government in 1996 and we have been trying to get it through ever since. This is yet another attempt to do that. It is particularly important for an electorate like mine. Eden-Monaro does not have huge businesses throughout the electorate; they are overwhelmingly small businesses, whether they be in the agriculture, tourism or service industry. Even in manufacturing and other things, there are predominantly small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. The legislation that currently exists is bad legislation which impacts adversely on all of those businesses. 
You wonder why the Labor Party oppose the changes that we are proposing. I think there are two main reasons for that opposition from the Labor Party. Firstly, there really is not any sort of small business culture within the Labor Party. That is pretty apparent. You only have to look at the backgrounds of the people within the Labor Party in this House to see that it is pretty hard to find any sort of link to small business. I know that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, often talks about this in answering questions in question time and laments the loss of Senator Barney Cooney, who at least had some connections with small business.
—He was the only one, wasn't he?
—I think he was virtually the only one. It is understandable that there is not that sort of culture there when overwhelmingly the background of Labor Party members is the unions and, increasingly, being political apparatchiks—people who have only worked in politics and then become a politician.
It is very different on this side. Many more members on this side of the House have real life experience of small business, myself included. The member for Dobell, who has just come into the House, is another one of our members with a very strong small business background. In my case I had only ever worked in small business before being elected to parliament: for 25 years, and for the 13 years prior to being elected to parliament that was in my own small business. I think you have to go through the experiences to understand why the very existence of this law has a negative impact on the way in which small businesses operate and the way in which small businesses employ or, more to the point, do not employ. You have to have gone through those hard yards of starting the business and putting everything on the line, having everything mortgaged to the hilt to be able to employ a couple of people and to buy the equipment that you might need for your business. I am sure just about every small business operator has been through those experiences where you write out the pay cheques for your staff for a week but there is not one for the boss. We have all been through that. I went through it too many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I have to say. We had huge interest rates: 21.75 per cent was the highest business overdraft that I ran at the time. At the same time I was keeping 25 people employed in my business. I guess with 25 employees I was not going to be exempted, at the stage the business was at, from what we are proposing here. That was a difficult period, particularly through the recession at the same time, in keeping those people employed. So too many times the weekly wages were paid but there was not a cheque for the boss.
We have developed that culture here. We understand the impact that the unfair dismissal laws have when you are going to employ someone. We have all heard the stories. We all know somebody in small business who has been through the experience of somebody being sacked, often for doing something quite illegal, but then challenging their dismissal through the existing laws and, nine times out of 10, winning. Often businesses would just pay, because that was the easiest thing to do. It was easier to pay some compensation and be done with it than be dragged through the courts. Numerous times the employee would have the backing of a union or something like that to pay their way, but the small business operator would not have that backing. Their hard-earned money, which should have been going back into the business to keep the business going and grow the business, would have to be used to defend an action. 
That has a huge impact on people; it really does. Small businesses are certainly very tentative about employing people. As a result, there is a lot of casual employment so that people are covered and so that, if businesses get to the point where they have to move somebody on, they will not get caught up in the unfair dismissal laws. We want to change that. We want to see small business feeling confident about employing people, not having the idea hanging over their heads that if it is the wrong person they may not be able to get rid of them or that to get rid of them will cost a hell of a lot of money.
Another reason that I suspect the Labor Party opposes the legislation is that the Labor Party is controlled by the unions. The unions are very much big business orientated. That is where most of the unionisation takes place in the private sector. Outside the public sector, most people who are members of a union are involved in big business. They are able to control things much more easily, which is why they do not have that small business culture.
I was talking about my own experiences in small business and years of running my own business. Shortly after I was elected to this place, my former business went through the drama of somebody claiming unfair dismissal. The firm did everything according to the law, but still the employee went through the process of claiming unfair dismissal. That was very costly from a legal point of view. In fact, the employee did not win in the end. That was one case where they did not win. But it was at a cost. It cost my old business quite a lot in legal advice and unbelievable time going through it all—all for nothing. So I am well aware of experiences in this regard.
The reason that our amending legislation talks about small business with fewer than 20 employees is that there is a big difference between small and large businesses. Irrespective of the circumstances, under our amendments employees are still protected from illegal actions—and so they should be. You cannot have businesses acting illegally. There is absolutely no question about that. But when it comes to other matters, this is where you get into grey areas. Big business is in a much better position and has many more resources to run human relations departments and things like that to ensure that things are handled correctly. When somebody does take some action, big businesses usually have in-house resources to deal with it. They often have the financial resources as well to clear the matter up quickly. If they believe that they are in the right, small businesses are faced with either a legal cost in fighting a claim—which they do not get back—or spending money anyway to deal with it immediately, without going through the legal process. So they lose out both ways.
As I said, this is important legislation for an electorate like Eden-Monaro because of our huge numbers of small businesses. The largest percentage of business in Eden-Monaro is on the small side. Increasingly, those businesses are in the tourism area, which is interesting. Some figures were released only in the last couple of weeks by the Tourism and Transport Forum, in a very detailed analysis of employment in the workplace. Eden-Monaro had the highest percentage of its work force employed in the tourism industry of any federal electorate in New South Wales. It was the fourth highest in Australia after the two Gold Coast seats and Far North Queensland. It demonstrates the importance of that industry. 
The tourism industry is a prime example of where businesses have to be so careful under existing laws with respect to employment, because it is an industry that can change. In the mountains the tourism industry very much dominates during wintertime—and increasingly in summertime—but there are periods of low activity during the year when there is this problem with employees. Similarly, down on the coast, the high activity time is summertime and there is less activity in winter. So there are fluctuations. Therefore, increasingly, businesses will stick with casual employment because they do not want the problems of having to put staff off in the low times of the year. This legislation is even more important in Eden-Monaro, given the high proportion of people in the tourism industry and therefore the number of businesses that are faced with that.
I fully support this amending legislation. It should have happened seven or eight years ago, after we came to government. We have been elected and re-elected three times all up, with this amendment to the legislation as an absolute priority. It continues to be a priority. I wish the Labor Party would look beyond the control by the unions and look at the real benefit that could arise from getting rid of bad legislation and making the amendment that we propose. We could see in excess of 50,000 new jobs across Australia if this amendment bill goes through. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—As the member for Eden-Monaro said, many members on this side of the House have had direct experience with both small businesses and larger businesses. The release of the Australian Labor Party's industrial relations policy last week has confirmed the government's worst fears: that the member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, is ignorant of the fact that re-regulating the economy will destroy the backbone of our economy, small business, and will cost jobs—with regional areas like my electorate on the Central Coast being the first to suffer. Seventy-eight per cent of current federal Labor MPs and senators are trade union members, yet only 17½ per cent of the private sector work force are members of unions. It should be remembered that the building industry has compulsory union membership—no ticket, no start on most sites.
Unions are about increasing membership and forcing employers to extract fees from workers' pay. We do not need more union members in federal parliament; we need fewer. As Barry Cohen, a former Labor government minister, says, the problem with current Labor federal MPs is that they are ex-union, ex-staffers or ex-lawyers. How can they contribute to policy? We certainly do not need to put this Liverpool kiss on small business.
In Dobell, the trade union movement has done very little for local jobs and workers. Its only achievement is to frustrate business and precipitate a Labor candidate to try to join the 78 per cent of existing union Labor MPs. Recently I held a small business forum in my electorate to allow local small business owners the opportunity to raise issues affecting their business operations with me and the Hon. Kevin Andrews, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I thank the minister for taking time out of his busy schedule to meet and discuss these issues with Dobell small business owners. On the Central Coast, small business employs a whopping 90 per cent of the private sector work force; hence, to maximise employment opportunities in my electorate, including opportunities for new apprentices and disadvantaged people, it is vital that the Australian government deliver laws that support small business. 
One of the most concerning issues that was raised at the forum, and this issue seems to follow me everywhere I go, is the need for small business to have the flexibility to employ people without having to face the risk of an unfair dismissal claim. Unfair dismissal laws place a burden on the thousands of employers who can create new jobs. A less complex system would mean more jobs. Unfortunately, Labor's policy would return Australia to the industrial dark ages, when unemployment soared and real wages fell, and would keep the burden of frivolous unfair dismissal claims on the backs of small business.
For the sake of job opportunities, all levels of government must be responsive to the needs of small business. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004 is intended to exempt small businesses from unfair dismissal laws which reduce job creation by discouraging employers from employing full-time workers whose performance may be unsatisfactory. Research shows that unfair dismissal laws cost small and medium sized businesses $1.3 billion a year and were responsible for over 77,000 job losses in small and medium sized businesses. The bill proposes to prevent employees of small businesses, other than apprentices and trainees, applying under the Workplace Relations Act for a remedy in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment and requires the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order that an unfair dismissal application made by a small business employee is invalid if the commission is satisfied that the application is outside the commission's jurisdiction because of the small business exemption. The commission would have the power to make such an order without holding a hearing.
The bill will not exclude employees of small businesses from the unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It will remain unlawful for any business in Australia, regardless of its size, to dismiss any employee for a discriminatory reason—for example, because of their age, gender or religion. In addition, all businesses in Australia will continue to be required to give employees appropriate notice of termination. The legislation defines a `small business employer' as an employer of fewer than 20 people, including the employee who was terminated and any long-term casuals with 12 months service or more but not short-term casuals.
While it is appropriate that workers' rights are always protected, the current unfair dismissal laws simply go too far. People looking for work need to be given a chance to prove themselves, but it is difficult to provide that opportunity when there is a risk that you could face a costly unfair dismissal claim. Tim Fordham, proprietor of AMK Auto Repairs in my electorate, is one of many businesspeople to express to me his concern about a possible unfair dismissal claim. Mr Fordham told me:
When you're running a small business you carry all the risk and no one else seems to care. The current unfair dismissal laws are too one-sided and there is little protection for the employer. It's not a question of fairness because if I give someone a chance to do the job and it doesn't work out I will pay for it one way or another and under those circumstances employing anyone is just too risky. 
Most small business operators believe that they are more likely to lose when faced with an unfair dismissal claim even if a claim arises simply because the person they employed proves to be incapable of performing the required job. This was confirmed by another Central Coast proprietor who has experienced problems with unfair dismissal laws in his medium sized computer business. While he requested that his name be withheld, he told of how, having trained a new employee to perform a particular task, the person still could not do the job and eventually he had no choice but to terminate their employment. He was then faced with an unfair dismissal claim, and the procedure became extremely time consuming and very costly. He said:
That experience taught me a lesson and as far as expanding my employee base goes I am very reluctant to embark on that process until the unfair dismissal laws are changed.
With a background in small business, I understand that without good staff a business does not run well. A business owner should not invoke legislation to remove a member of staff who is doing a good job; however, the same business owner may give careful consideration to employing people because of the ramifications of the current law. Running a small business can be tough for small business operators, who are ordinary, everyday people. Often they are juggling up to 70 hours a week at work and family life. They do not sit all day within the confines of luxurious offices, earning a set wage or salary. They run a small business, and their livelihood is dependent on the success of that small business. They do not hire and fire workers as they please, because they themselves are workers. They are plumbers, they are bus drivers, they are mechanics—they are people who have been prepared to take risks and to make an opportunity to create some wealth for themselves and their families.
The current unfair dismissal laws place a disproportionate burden on small businesses. They do not have human resource managers to deal with an unfair dismissal claim. Attending a commission hearing alone can require a small business operator to close shop for a day. Small business operators often risk everything in their efforts to survive and prosper, and they need to be supported and encouraged to expand for the benefit and future prosperity of our region.
Not surprisingly, the Labor Party continues to argue that the government is trying to take away the rights of workers. It is all very well to talk about workers' rights, but the fact of the matter is that unless there are jobs there will be no workers' rights to protect. The Central Coast thrives on the efforts of small business operators, and they represent our greatest hope for an increase in employment opportunities. But, as long as the Labor Party refuses to accept the Howard government's changes to unfair dismissal laws in relation to small business, employment opportunities will be severely restricted on the Central Coast.
Labor are blatantly refusing to acknowledge the facts. They have voted against the unfair dismissal legislation 40 times. Their tactics revolve around obstruction rather than constructive policy development. Labor are about building union membership. Union organisers use the guise of wanting to inform staff of their rights to drum up new members. I have heard this complaint from a number of small business operators in my area.
Reforms to the workplace relations system since the Howard government came into office in 1996 have assisted in the creation of more than 1.3 million jobs and an increase in real wages of more than 13 per cent for ordinary Australians. I am pleased to say that in my electorate of Dobell the unemployment rate has dropped from double digits some years ago to 7.6 per cent now. If we remove the unfair dismissal legislation and adopt the amendments that the government are proposing, I am sure we can get that figure of 7.6 down even lower. 
The Howard government's workplace relations reform is about lessening complexity, lowering costs and providing certainty and balance for both employers and employees. With this legislation the government seeks to redress a burdensome and complex law that is destructive of employment growth. This bill is about encouraging an abundance of business opportunities and creating sustainable employment.
The Howard government does not let politics get in the way of legislation that is in the best interests of Australian workers and will promote job creation. If Labor care at all about sustaining local jobs and building opportunities for families in my electorate, they will do the same and abandon their blatant buttering up to Labor's union bosses. Sustainable employment does not result from quick-fix measures, and I am proud to be a member of a coalition government that is committed to continuing the workplace reform process.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am surprised that there are no members of the opposition speaking on the bill before the chamber today. That gives you an indication of their commitment to small business. It is with pleasure that I rise to support the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004. The bill, as members of the House would know, seeks to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to prevent unfair dismissal provisions from applying to businesses with fewer than 20 employees.
I have listened to some of the debate here today, and it is interesting that a significant number of the positive comments have come from members on this side of the House who have been, in their own right, members of small businesses. Therefore, they understand how small businesses operate and how legislation, coupled with impositions put on them by trade unions, influences them to the extent where they are either able to survive as free enterprise businesses significantly contributing to the employment of people in this country—and also to the economy—or not. There are in the vicinity of 1.3 million small businesses in this country and, as elected representatives, we have a responsibility to support and protect each and every one of them.
In its submission to a Senate inquiry in 2002, the Small Business Coalition said there were two distinct but interrelated issues in relation to unfair dismissals: the time, inconvenience and cost of responding to a claim for unfair dismissal and the uncertainty created by the possibility of attracting an unfair dismissal claim which inhibits employers from taking on staff at a time when their businesses may be capable of expanding and increasing employment. I know a bit about that because, apart from managing large businesses, my wife had a small business for a significant number of years. When the demands perpetrated by previous Labor governments were put on her, I advised her to get out of the business—to sell it, get what she could out of it and move away from it.
I also know a significant number of small business people who are at the stage now where they are reticent about employing people in their businesses because of the pressures that are placed on them with regard to issues such as unfair dismissals and all of the other things that make it difficult for them to continue to operate viably. So what do they do? They carry the workload or they employ some of their own family members to ensure that their business continues to operate. Unfortunately, that restricts their ability to expand and do more business. They get themselves into a position—and justifiably so—of being in what I refer to as the small business comfort zone, where they can safely operate a business at a given level to give them a small profit, comfortable enough for them to continue to operate as a business person and to make some money for their family and get on with life. 
Getting back to the Small Business Coalition submission to the Senate inquiry and the two points that I raised, in support of what they said, the Small Business Coalition cited results of a survey conducted in 1999 by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In that survey, they asked more than 2,300 employers: `Has unfair dismissals legislation had any effect on employment decisions in your business during the past 12 months?' Members of this place will not be surprised to know that this survey revealed that 39.7 per cent of employers had employed fewer people as a result of unfair dismissal laws. I repeat: 39.7 per cent of 1.3 million small businesses.
Similarly, Restaurant and Catering Australia completed a survey asking six questions in relation to unfair dismissals. In summary, the findings were that, in 100 per cent of cases, the threat of unfair dismissal had changed the way in which operators managed staff; 46 per cent said that it had stopped them hiring staff; 70 per cent said it had encouraged them to hire casuals over permanent staff; and 38 per cent had defended an unfair dismissal claim in the past three years—and, in those cases, the defence was at an average cost of $3,675 and 63 hours away from their business. How can a small business sustain a business with those sorts of financial and workplace pressures put on them?
The survey also found that 49 per cent had a staff member threaten to take unfair dismissal action—of which, in the view of the restaurateurs, only 44 per cent would have reasonably thought that they had been unfairly dismissed. So the unfair dismissal law not only creates a financial imposition on the small business but also allows people to take action against small businesses when, in reality, they were not unfairly dismissed. That contributes to the waste of the 63 hours quoted when small businesses are defending those unfair dismissals.
Finally, the survey found that, on average, of those businesses that had been threatened with a claim for unfair dismissal, 2.7 employees—keep in mind that these are businesses with an average of 16 employees—had threatened to take action in a three-year period. To me that is alarming but not surprising. Only recently the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry reinforced that its business surveys had consistently found that unfair dismissal laws were a major concern for all employers, and particularly for Australia's small businesses. It said that there was no doubt whatsoever that the present laws hindered job creation.
I heard the contribution to this debate from the Green member—the oncer—in this chamber today, the member for Cunningham. I can understand my parliamentary colleagues on the opposite side—my Labor Party colleagues—and the attitude that they have to unfair dismissal laws, because they are predominantly influenced and represented by members of the trade union movement. I know that because I was once in a trade union. But, like my political aspirations in those days, I got over my sickness and I joined the free enterprise system and became a member of the Liberal Party over on this side.
But let me get back to the Greens candidate. It would be interesting for the community to know what the Greens' policies are in relation to industrial relations—although they have copied and airbrushed some of the Labor Party's policies on their web site. I happen to have the August 2004 edition of their policies on industrial relations. Among other things in their industrial relations policy, their goals are, under 2.2, `reduced working hours without loss of pay or conditions' and, under 2.6, `balance between the obligations of work and time for family, social and community involvement'. I am selectively picking these. When you go down to section 3, under the heading `Short Term Targets', it says that the Australian Greens will work to: 
3.2 abolish Australian workplace agreements and non-union collective agreements, and encourage the making of multi-employer agreements
3.3 legislate to require that employers recognise and negotiate in good faith with the relevant unions, and to allow unions access to all relevant workplaces.
So they have borrowed some of the Australian Labor Party's policies. At point 3.5, the Greens are looking to remove sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act 1974, because that is the only implement within that act that employers have to protect themselves in relation to unauthorised stoppages which affect their businesses to the extent that they have imposed on them severe financial penalties, among other things. At 3.8 they say:
... support moves towards a shorter working week, without loss of pay or conditions, that will create jobs, redistribute employment, and improve the quality of personal, family, community and social life;
So they want people to work fewer hours but get the same pay—great for small business! At 3.9 they want to:
... provide a national parental leave scheme paid at replacement earnings up to the average federal wage but no less than the federal minimum for 18 weeks, with a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave and a right to return to work part-time.
They even want people to be paid not to work. That is how ridiculous their attitude is to free enterprise and small businesses.
As I said before, small business is the engine room of our economy. Small business owners deserve more than to be punished with threats of unfair dismissal claims for acting in the best interests of their business. Why should a fish and chip shop owner or a retailer in downtown Crookwell in the electorate of Hume have to shut up shop and travel to a commission hearing at significant expense just to defend a frivolous claim or to justify his or her decision to terminate the employment of a difficult and disruptive employee?
I have been in the business of dismissing employees for being disruptive in the past and I can assure you that as an employer in a large company I did not do that just to be vindictive; I did it because it was justifiably responsible to do so. Admittedly—and this is the point that I tried to make with those comments—there may be examples where a person has been unfairly dismissed for discriminatory reasons. However, this legislation will not change that. Employees will still be able to pursue their claims through the appropriate channels. That is a key issue. The bill will also exclude apprentices and trainees, and so it should.
Critics of this bill have claimed its effect on employment will be minimal. However, if only five per cent of Australian small businesses—that is five per cent of 1.3 million—employed an additional staff member as a result of the bill, that would create 65,000 jobs. In the electorate of Hume on some occasions I have been criticised by my political opponents for not doing enough to generate and protect employment. These are people like the current candidates, who do not even know the difference between local, state and federal government; they do not even know where the responsibilities lie. That is understandable, because some of them come—with all due respect to the Australian Capital Territory and the Public Service sector—out of the Public Service sector and have been working in Canberra all their lives. 
But for many years—and I have been with them since 1998—the Howard government has been trying to clear a path for small business through the quagmire that is our workplace relations system. It has been regularly and consistently disrupted from doing that by the Australian Labor Party and the minor parties, which include the Greens and the Democrats, in the Senate in this place.
I do not want to repeat the words of a former Labor Party Prime Minister. I do not want to cast aspersions on my colleagues in the upper house. But, quite frankly, the Senate has gone far outside its original charter, which was to review legislation. It has become a house of non-elected legislators. It has not allowed the lower house of our great nation to carry out the role that it was elected to do by the Australian people. Nothing changes around the country because that is exactly what happens in the upper houses of those states that are unfortunate enough to have legislative councils, which are similar to the Senate in this place.
I have to say that the Australian people expect us as parliamentarians when we are in this place to at least have a commonsense approach to the role of the democratically elected government. That role is to introduce policies through legislation, and the Senate's role is to go through that legislation. While we may from time to time have strong ideological views about what we are doing, we have to admit that it is our role as parliamentarians—regardless of what side we are on—to ensure that the democratic process is undertaken. The democratic process involves letting a government govern. That is the mechanism that allows the Australian people to make a judgment on the government of the day when polling time comes around. We are getting to that stage now, and I hope the Australian people look at some of the things that have been held up in this particular parliament by the Australian Labor Party, particularly in the upper house, with the support of the Leader of the Opposition. These are policies that quite frankly should be getting up and running out there in the community.
I really do get a little bit concerned as a member of parliament when people out there in the public arena say to me that their impression of parliamentarians is that on a negative scale of one to 10 we are about an 11. The reason for that is not because we are that way; it is because the mindless ideological views of members in the lower house and the upper house of this parliament make people disgusted with what they see and hear. That is one of the reasons why we as parliamentarians have that negative image.
In closing, I call upon the opposition and the minor parties—and I know I am wasting my time totally on this—to support this bill without amendment for the sake of our 1.3 million small businesses. The debate on this issue has dragged on for far too long. Let us get on with the process of the Australian people judging the government on its performance. Let us stop the politicking that holds up legitimate legislation in this place and in the upper house and let people have the democratic right of making a choice based on the performance of the government. Let us prove to people, if that is possible, that there are some forward-thinking Australians who are prepared to work in a bipartisan way on both sides of this House on issues that affect the Australian people and that are in the best interests of the economy of the country, and of young people in particular.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—We are here today to debate a bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004, that will enable small businesses to grow and strengthen. It will give small businesses the confidence to employ staff and has the potential to create an extra 50,000 jobs. Like payroll tax, unfair dismissals are a monkey on the back of small business. These are the greatest inhibitors to jobs growth in this country, and it is a pity that the ALP cannot see that.
The majority of the business community agree with this government on this matter. In fact, the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce agrees. The New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce found in its own study that 79 per cent of businesses surveyed said they would like to see small business exempt from unfair dismissal laws. A survey from the Certified Practicing Accountants on small business attitudes to unfair dismissals found that 42 per cent of small business say they do not know how to properly comply with unfair dismissal laws. Seventy-six per cent of accountants dealing with small businesses think that those businesses are confused about how to cope with unfair dismissal laws, and 62 per cent of small businesses and 81 per cent of accountants think the unfair dismissal process is complex.
Unfair dismissals are an important issue for small business, and they are also an important issue when it comes to the creation of employment. Small businesses in Australia produce about one-third of this country's GDP. They produce 15 per cent of Australia's exports. They account for more than 95 per cent of all businesses. They provide jobs for over 40 per cent of our work force. It is very clear to any rational thinking person that unfair dismissal laws are a handbrake to job creation by small business. The Howard government knows this. Small business knows this. The only group that does not seem to be interested in or understand the concerns of small business is the ALP.
The ALP are not interested in how the Howard government has created a stable economy, where the unemployment rate in Paterson has fallen from 15.4 per cent in 1994 to 7.4 per cent today. Nationally, the Howard government has created over 1.3 million jobs, and the national unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent, the lowest in 23 years. Labor talk about reducing unemployment in the area but, when it comes to action, the Labor Party are all talk. Labor are not interested in bringing unemployment down even further by supporting the government's changes to unfair dismissal laws. That is very clear, because each and every time the government puts up provisions to change unfair dismissals the Labor Party oppose them. There is no rhyme or reason; it is simple opposition for opposition's sake.
Labor's opposition to employment growth has become very clear, and it was clear and obvious when they put out their industrial relations policy last week. It was like a big, black cloud went over Australia on that day, and small business has been shuddering ever since. As a former small business operator, I can understand why. Labor's record of managing the economy in government puts shivers up and down the backbone of small business. Labor have a record of raising interest rates into double digit figures and driving unemployment rates up into double digit figures, but all the time they steer clear of talking about financially responsible management of Australia's $800 billion economy. Their track record is something that can be seen and judged. They know that, if they lined up the government's record against the Labor Party's record in government, everyone would see very clearly that Labor cannot be trusted to manage our economy or help small business. It is almost as though small business is the enemy of the ALP. 
Let us have a look at the policy they released last week. Labor want to abolish AWAs; introduce a national payroll tax that will cost more than $270 million and 5,000 jobs; mandate compulsory union bargaining and interference in the workplace; empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to be involved in every step of the enterprise bargaining process; and abolish the building industry task force. But there is one thing that Labor refuse to do: they do not want to change unfair dismissal laws. They do not care about winding Australia back into the dark old days when unemployment and interest rates were in double digit figures. They do not care about helping small business reach its potential. For example, the Labor Party are ignoring the advice from the restaurant and catering industry which indicates that it costs, on average, around $3,600 and 63 hours to defend unfair dismissal claims. In fact, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research found that the cost to small and medium sized businesses of complying with unfair dismissal laws is about $1.3 billion every year. How can small business possibly sustain this level of cost? The fact is that small business does not need to be bogged down by excessive workplace regulation, but that is something that the ALP do not understand.
This legislation is about providing the foundation for a stable economy, and that means providing jobs. This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to protect small business from the costs and administrative burden of unfair dismissals and therefore increase employment opportunities in the small business sector. It will exempt small businesses with fewer than 20 employees from unfair dismissal provisions in the act so that an unfair dismissal application is not valid if it relates to a small business employer. This is all about balancing the needs of the workers and the needs of business.
Workers need dismissal laws, which have an important role in providing a safety net, but these laws need to be made fairer. At the moment, small businesses are scared to put on more staff. If a small business makes repeated warnings to an employee about poor performance on the job and eventually lets them go, it can face thousands of dollars in unfair dismissal claims. Many businesses decide to opt out of ongoing legal costs by agreeing to settle, with the bills being in the thousands of dollars. Who was right there? Was it the employer who repeatedly told the employee that they were not doing their job and has since been slogged with a lawsuit, or the employee who did not respond to the repeated warnings? Why should the small business be penalised for wanting to hire an employee who will do the job? These are the very issues that need to be ironed out.
There are a number of matters that affect small business, and I am deeply concerned about taxation in New South Wales. New South Wales is the highest taxing state in Australia and, as I travel around my electorate, small businesses are always telling me about their loathing for payroll tax. Businesses whose annual payroll exceeds $600,000 pay a payroll tax rate of 6.6 per cent in New South Wales. In contrast, businesses in Queensland with payrolls above $850,000 only pay 4.8 per cent in payroll tax. It is these problems that make it difficult to attract projects into New South Wales, as Queensland offers a far better deal.
However, the Commonwealth has to focus on matters that it has control of under the Constitution and that it can change in legislation. Making unfair dismissals fairer for small business is one giant leap forward for the sector and eases burdens placed on one of our key employment providers. We need to provide a framework that gives small business the confidence to create jobs and that, in turn, will help the unemployed. This legislation will do just that. Labor do not seem to understand that it is business that creates the employment, not government. The government needs to provide the framework of confidence and security for business to provide the jobs but, judging by the talk of the Labor Party, they think that they create jobs as though there were some magic pudding of employment—as though they can keep pulling jobs out of the hat. They do not understand that small business needs to provide the employment and to have the growth to provide the jobs. What it does not need are inhibitors. 
A report from Australian Business Ltd had this to say about this legislation:
Unfair dismissal laws inhibit job growth, particularly among small to medium sized businesses.
Employers fear that they could face unfair dismissal proceedings and the risk of the heavy financial penalties for dismissing poor performance employees.
Employers are intimidated because they do not understand the rules.
A total of 67% of businesses surveyed by ABL said the impact of unfair dismissal legislation was either important or very important to their business operation.
Employers accepted that employees should have protection against arbitrary and unfair dismissal, but feel that the laws do not operate with fairness or balance.
If you consider the small businesses that operate in my electorate of Paterson, there is great potential to bring down unemployment even further by changing unfair dismissal laws. We have numerous businesses based around tourism, such as restaurants, holiday accommodation, hotels, adventure tourism operators, whale and dolphin watching businesses, fishing businesses and cafes, and those businesses are supporting other small businesses like corner shops, bakeries, butchers, newsagents, video shops, accountants, solicitors, clothes shops, sports shops and hairdressers—in fact, the list goes on and on. If only five per cent of the small businesses in Australia each hired one extra employee it would create 50,000 jobs. Isn't that a realistic and achievable outcome?
The government have worked very hard to create new opportunities in employment. You only have to look at the increases in apprenticeships in Paterson to see that. The number of new apprentices in training in Paterson has increased from 761 in 1996, under Labor, to 2,483 today. That is a great achievement in our local area by developing and supplying the skill base needed. But, again, if we could get Labor's support in changing unfair dismissal provisions we would have the potential to create more apprenticeships and more jobs.
The ALP talk the talk on unemployment, but they refuse to walk the walk. Who do they think employs people? It is small business. But small business needs to have confidence. Small business at the moment has deep reservations about expanding and growing the opportunities, and these reservations are based on the unfair dismissal provisions. We have put up changes to the industrial relations legislation 40 times, and each and every step of the way Labor have opposed them. They are also concerned about interest rates and the economy. A return to a Labor government will destroy business confidence because there will be a fear that interest rates will go up and the economy will stall.
There is a key and very important sector of the small business market, and that is the family business. This is where mum and dad have created a small business in, say, plumbing, and they might employ one or two people. This is the sort of business that has their assets on the line—the house that they own or partly own is actually the backing for their business, and the office is quite often their kitchen table. That is where the whole thing is run, in conjunction with a cordless phone and a fax machine. Mum is usually the receptionist, the accountant and the manager, whilst dad is often the tradesman, the estimator and the quality controller, and they might have one or two employees. Under Labor Party policy and direction, such people fear expanding their business. They see these unfair dismissal provisions as an inhibitor to growing their business. What the Labor Party need to understand is that the sum of money that is at risk in going to court and, indeed, the time spent away from their business, when these people need to be earning money, are inhibitors to the growth of their business. They know that if the Labor Party come to government this is exactly the challenge they will face. 
On top of that, the other challenge that they will face under a Labor government is the unfettered access that will be provided to the union. So, in the evening, while mum and dad are sitting at the kitchen table, going through the accounts of the day and working out who is to be billed for the work that they have done, in marches the union, going straight up to the kitchen table and sitting down to demand their place. They cannot be refused, because it is the place of employment. Is this the sort of invasion that we want, where the union movement is unwelcome in aspects of small business? Why can't the Labor Party see clearly that we need to provide opportunity, hope and encouragement for the small business sector to grow and create jobs?
I have worked hard and well with my people in Paterson in small business. We have created the opportunity to develop jobs, which is reflected in the reduction in the unemployment figure. I hear Labor members in the Hunter saying, `We need to do more,' but every time they are given the opportunity—such as today, when we vote on this bill—to vote for a bill that will encourage job opportunities by removing the restraints on small business, what do they do? Let me tell you. I can guarantee—I would even go to the bookie and make a bet, and I am not a betting man—that they will vote down these provisions. Why? Because they have a pure objection to small business. They do not want to see growth in employment. In fact, they feel quite confident that the more unemployment we have the better they are positioned.
If those opposite were concerned for the unemployed in our community they would support these changes. They would not only support but champion these changes. It is one thing to stand up and say to the local community, `We want to reduce unemployment. The figure is too high'—and I agree; while ever one person is out of a job, it is one person too many—but each and every time they are given the opportunity they do everything they can to stop employment growth. As we have heard from the opposition, they think that they can just pull employment numbers out of the air. They think there is some magic way of creating jobs. The people who create the jobs are the very people who put their money and assets on the line to grow business. They are the people who take the risks, and it is a shame that the Labor Party cannot see that. The reason they cannot see and understand that is that none of them have been in small business. They have never had their assets on the line. They come from relatively protected industries, in a protected environment from within the trade union movement.
Life is about risk. When people go into business, they take a risk. What we need to do for small business to make it grow is reduce the amount of risk so there can be confidence. Labor just do not seem to get it. They will continue on, because they are the slaves of the trade union movement. They are not interested in opportunity and hope for their fellow Australians. It is quite clear that business needs this legislation to be changed. If Labor had any interest at all in reducing unemployment and providing opportunities for people in all age groups to get back into the work force, they would support this bill. But, as I said, I know what the outcome will be. The outcome will be that Labor will vote down this bill. I just wish they took time at rational thinking. I commend this bill to the House.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—In wrapping up this debate, I would like to thank the members of the House who have spoken on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004. There were the well-constructed, thoughtful and constructive comments of members of the coalition: the member for O'Connor; you, Mr Deputy Speaker—the member for Herbert; the members for Canning, Indi, Riverina, Eden-Monaro, Dobell, and Hume; and, of course, the member for Paterson, who has now left the chamber. Other contributions were made by members of the opposition, which unfortunately highlighted the animosity that Labor feels towards small business. The members for Rankin, Fraser, Throsby, Cunningham, Burke and Calare all made contributions, but they would be well advised to read the speeches of the members of the coalition. They might learn something about small business and how small business operates, particularly if they read the very thoughtful contribution that I have just heard from the member for Paterson.
This bill would require the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to order that an unfair dismissal claim is not valid if it involves a small business with fewer than 20 employees. As the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said when he was introducing the bill, the government firmly believes that preventing unfair dismissal laws from applying to small businesses would encourage job creation in the small business sector. The time and cost of defending an unfair dismissal claim, even one without merit, can be substantial, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, as a former businessman yourself. In evidence to the Senate committee inquiring into the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, the restaurant and catering industry indicated that it costs, on average, $3,600 and around 63 hours of management time to defend an unfair dismissal claim. This is time and money no small business can afford to lose. This is time and money that discourages small businesses from employing more people, as the member for Rankin knows, of course, having indicated to the Australian earlier this year how his business did not employ an extra person because of the unfair dismissal laws.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In accordance with the standing orders and parliamentary practice I made very clear in a personal explanation that I did not make that statement. It is therefore not available for the minister or the parliamentary secretary to repeat that line.
 (Mr Lindsay)—Order! There is no point of order. The member for Rankin will resume his seat.
—Goodness gracious! He is very sensitive. Small business employers would be willing and able to hire extra staff on a needs basis because they would not have to worry about the potential cost of defending unfair dismissal claims later on down the track if this bill were passed. The government have introduced this bill because we recognise the substantial benefits that would come from the new jobs it would create. The wealth generated would flow through to all Australians. 
As members are aware, the government have tried to achieve these reforms before. We tried with the introduction of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. However, both of those bills were blocked by the Senate. This bill largely replicates those bills. However, this bill clarifies which employees are to be counted when determining how many employees an employer has. It does so by adopting a definition of `casual employee' that is consistent with the definition contained in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004. This improved definition provides greater certainty for all parties.
By introducing this bill, the government have yet again demonstrated our firm commitment to giving small businesses a fair go and creating more jobs for Australians. If the opposition vote against this bill, they will demonstrate precisely the opposite, and we expect them to do just that. The government have now introduced measures that would exempt small business employers from unfair dismissal laws on 10 separate occasions. If the Labor Party vote against this bill, it will be the 14th time they have voted against a small business exemption in either chamber. It will be the 41st time Labor have voted against government attempts to reform federal unfair dismissal laws more generally. I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 is the second of two bills that have flowed from the review of the livestock export sector undertaken by Dr John Keniry. The report from that review contained a number of recommendations that focused on strengthening the regulatory framework for this sector. Most of those changes were contained in the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment (Export Control) Bill 2004. Labor amended that bill to strengthen the accountability of the industry through the minister to the parliament and the community. This bill is designed to give effect to the second aspect of recommendation 2 of the Keniry review, which is:
Industry should be responsible for research and development and management of quality assurance systems to support its members translate best practice standards into outcomes consistent with best practice:
- its activities should be funded by compulsory levies.
According to the memorandum, this bill provides the basis for introducing greater flexibility for the disbursement of funds derived from the collection of compulsory levies by, firstly, allowing for an industry organisation representing livestock exporters to be determined as a marketing body and as a research body for the purpose of receiving revenues derived from a compulsory levy applied to the live export sector and, secondly, enabling the matching funds provided by the Commonwealth for research and development to continue to be provided to the industry research body.
Since 1996, the Howard government has privatised the research and development functions of key rural sectors, including the meat, horticulture, wool, pork, egg and dairy industries. Labor has not opposed privatisation but has objected to the minimal accountability arrangements that have been proposed by the government in those measures. These accountability arrangements are contained in the statutory funding agreements between the service body and the Commonwealth. Labor amendments have strengthened the accountability arrangements, as enabling legislation has progressed through this place. In relation to the statutory funding agreement with Dairy Australia, Labor did force changes that require the tabling of the company's annual report, as well as financial statements related to levy and matching payments expenditure. These service bodies are directly accountable to industry members under Corporations Law and, as I said, there is accountability to government through the funding contract.
Labor were prepared to deal with this bill in a proper and timely fashion, but we sought to satisfy ourselves and the parliament that the statutory funding agreement provided adequate protection for both levy payers and taxpayers. I had this legislation referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for that purpose. The bill was considered by that committee last evening, and I have to say to this House that the truth of the matter is that the whole process has turned into high farce. First, evidence to a Senate inquiry has revealed that the federal minister's strategy to put in place this levy has actually breached a longstanding memorandum of understanding with Australia's red meat sector, and that is quite a serious matter not only for the minister and the government but for this parliament and the relationship of the executive particularly with industry bodies and industries such as the red meat industry.
The memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the red meat sector is a legally binding document. It is not something that can be changed at the whim of the minister at the eleventh hour, at five minutes to midnight, before this parliament closes down and goes into election mode. It is a legally binding agreement. It defines the roles and responsibilities of all parties to the agreement; it details funding arrangements; it details planning and service delivery arrangements; and, it sets out industry reserves and research and development arrangements. In relation to the introduction of industry levies, that memorandum of understanding provides for an orderly process of implementation and consultation with signatories to the agreement. I think it is worth while for the members of this House to reflect on those particular words and to understand what actually transpired in the Senate last night. I will repeat those words: the MOU provides for an orderly process of implementation and consultation with signatories to the agreement. That process is contained in annexure D to the memorandum of understanding. I want to go to the details of that agreed process that has now been absolutely abandoned by the minister in the death throes of the Howard government.
There is a requirement that the minister write to all the peak industry councils, affected companies, Meat and Livestock Australia and the Red Meat Advisory Council and advise them of his intention to introduce a new levy. That is a requirement of the legally binding agreement—that is, the memorandum of understanding—between the minister and the sector. Within 30 days, unless those groups can satisfy him that a levy is not required, the minister can then set levy rates that will appropriately fund industry programs as required by the memorandum of understanding. 
Annexure D then requires the Red Meat Advisory Council to commence a review of the memorandum of understanding and the meat industry strategic plan, or MISP, to identify any changes that might be required as a result. So here we have a process that is to be followed in accordance with the legally binding agreement between the minister and the industry. But as we found out in the Senate last night, it would appear that it is process overboard. We know this government are keen to throw things overboard. They really distorted the children overboard issue. That saga did not reflect very well on the government and this process certainly does not reflect well on the minister or the government.
Officers from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry told the Senate hearing last night that this process would not be followed because the minister was not operating within the terms of the memorandum of understanding on the LiveCorp levy process. I find this to be an extraordinary revelation. He is not operating within the terms of the memorandum of understanding that he has with the red meat sector. The minister is ignoring the interests of the red meat sector and its right to be properly consulted in these matters. It is not as if, under these arrangements, bodies that were nominated in the memorandum of understanding as bodies that ought to be consulted will become players once this levy receives the sanction of the parliament.
The second matter exposed during last night's hearing was the failure of the minister to progress consideration of this levy proposal in a timely manner. The minister was told of LiveCorp's financial problems in February this year. He was formally advised by LiveCorp in March that a levy would be required. Here we are in August at five minutes to midnight, in the death throes of a government that has passed its use-by date, participating in the second reading debate on this legislation in the chamber. This legislation is not even through the House, let alone having progressed through the other place. This delay puts at risk the future of the company and potentially a number of research programs it currently funds through Meat and Livestock Australia. That could mean that one of the other industries has to foot the bill.
Last night's hearing exposed significant failings in the statutory funding agreement drafted by the minister and largely agreed with LiveCorp. It is instructive to compare the detail of the LiveCorp statutory funding agreement with the agreement that is in place with the dairy industry, for example. They are like chalk and cheese. Labor worked hard on the statutory funding agreement for the dairy industry to make sure that there were proper accountability and reporting mechanisms in place to the parliament and to the taxpayers of Australia, yet many of the sensible reporting requirements required of Dairy Australia will not be imposed on LiveCorp if this minister has his way.
We know what an absolute and utter mess the minister created in the live export area because of his incompetence and failure to act in the face of the mounting evidence before him. His failure to act in the face of those reports put in jeopardy not only the live export trade but also the livelihoods of farmers involved in the red meat industry and all farmers concerned with the issue of animal welfare. That particular charge can be laid squarely at the feet of the minister. He failed to act in the face of mounting evidence presented to him by his own eminent advisory committee, which indicated that this trade had to be cleaned up or else it would put in jeopardy the reputation of the whole red meat industry sector. Now he comes into this parliament, as I have said before, at five minutes to midnight, with the Howard government on its last legs wanting to ram through a piece of legislation dealing with matters that should have been dealt with much earlier than this. That is a failure on the part of the minister. It is his responsibility that we are in this position today. 
We on this side of the House will brook no criticism on this matter because we have done the right thing in referring this bill to the Senate rural and regional affairs committee to have the measures in it reviewed. That is the proper function of that body, and what it unearthed last night was a mess—another mess of this minister's creation. I think it is reasonable for people in this industry and for members of this House to ask the very simple question as to why there seems to be this discrepancy between the standards that the minister seeks to apply to the live export industry and those that now apply to the dairy industry. I would have thought that there would have been some consistency in this matter.
I can understand a process over time where a government seeks to privatise these entities and agencies, and on the first attempt it does not get it right. But over time with the full power of the parliament, with its review processes and its debates in this chamber and the other place, it should manage to get better reporting and accountability mechanisms in place for these entities that now stand at arm's length from the parliament. I think that in the dairy example we achieved that over time. We—I use the royal `we', taking in the government and the opposition in both houses of this parliament—moved amendments to various pieces of legislation that tightened up the reporting and accountability mechanisms for these entities. So the question has to be asked: why on this occasion has this minister put on the table a set of legislative arrangements that go soft on those reporting and accountability arrangements, or do not go as far as those that are now in place for the dairy industry?
This agreement states that LiveCorp must not engage in agri-political activity. That has been a feature of all such agreements, and it is entirely proper. However, there is a potential problem for this sector—that is, the board of LiveCorp and the industry's agri-political wing, the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, or ALEC, share a number of directors. Under such arrangements being proposed by the minister, the Chinese Wall between the two boards would be so thin as to be virtually nonexistent.
I want to go to the sections in the dairy statutory funding agreement and the LiveCorp statutory funding agreement that relate to reports and meetings. First, I will go to the dairy statutory funding agreement. Section 12.1 requires that the company comply with schedule 4. Schedule 4 requires the company to comply with the Corporations Act and, in addition, a number of other reporting obligations which I assume, at least in part, relate to the Corporations Act. Section 12.2 requires that for each 12-month period ending on 30 June a statement of the company's financial performance, a statement of the company's financial position, an auditor's report on the financial statements and notes, and a director's declaration about the financial statements and notes, as required under the Corporations Act 2001, must be given before the company reports for the relevant period are lodged under the Corporations Act. Under section 12.2 the reports must be certified as being complete and accurate by the chair or managing director or equivalent officer in the company.
Section 12.4 of the dairy statutory funding agreement requires that, for each of the three-month periods ending 31 March, 30 September or 31 December, the company must give the minister within 45 days of the end of that period (a) a statement of the company's financial performance and (b) a statement of the company's financial position. These statements do not need to be audited. Section 12.5 requires that the company advise the minister within 30 days of it coming to the company's notice of any matters that will or may materially impact on its ability to achieve the objectives stated in its operational plan. Section 12.7 requires an appropriate person to meet with the minister or his representative every six months to report on the company's performance. Section 12.8 requires annual reports to be tabled and section 12.9 requires reports provided in accordance with section 12.2 to be tabled as well. Section 12.10, the last section in that area, provides for a director who considers that there has been a breach of the constitution, the deed or the Dairy Produce Act to declare these matters to the Commonwealth. We can see that these are stringent but sensible measures to protect the interests of the Australian taxpayer, the public interest and the interests of this parliament. 
Section 12.1 in the LiveCorp statutory funding agreement, however, requires provision of three copies of the annual report to the minister, and a copy must be given to stakeholders and members. It states that a copy of the annual report may be provided by the minister to the parliament. Once again, this minister is seeking to put in place a set of measures that would enable him, if he were elected after the next election and therefore to occupy the portfolio, to weasel out yet again from his responsibility to this parliament. If it is good enough for the dairy statutory funding agreement, why is it not good enough for this one?
I go back to the fact that the minister had on his plate, over a long period of time, several reports that rang the bell on the problems in the live export area and he did nothing. I would have thought he would have acted, having already been confronted with that situation, with the evidence and with the political fallout from it—and I note that in Roma and in Taree over 2,000 farmers, many of them beef farmers, have passed votes of no confidence in the minister. I cannot recall too many instances where Labor agriculture ministers have suffered the ignominy of having those sorts of resolutions passed in coalition seats where these meetings have been held. Something is amiss. I am not a Shakespearean, but something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
We on this side of the House are asking legitimate questions about why the minister has not, in the context of this statutory funding arrangement, put in place reporting mechanisms and accountability requirements of the type that are in the dairy statutory funding agreement—an agreement passed and accepted by both chambers and by all parties in the parliament. There is no compulsory requirement—and I go back to section 12.1 of the LiveCorp statutory funding agreement, which says that a copy of the annual report may be provided by the minister to the parliament. So there is no compulsion to table the report; it is at the discretion of the minister. Section 12.2 requires an appropriate person to meet with the minister only once a year to brief the minister on the performance of the company.
No wonder the industry went down the drain! No wonder the industry came under attack from the Australian public and from the animal welfare lobby! The minister refused, in the face of mounting evidence, to do anything about the problems in the industry. That is why we are debating this bill. That is why this bill is on the table here now. I would have thought that, having been burnt once, the minister would have availed himself of the opportunity to get people in from the industry more than once a year to brief him on the performance of the company. There is a much lesser reporting obligation to be imposed on LiveCorp compared with the tough but appropriate reporting obligations that are placed on the dairy industry. You have to ask why there is such a significant watering down in this agreement of the reporting obligations that apply to dairy in their statutory funding agreements. 
I want to go to the section covering the review of performance and access to records and information. In the dairy statutory funding agreement, premises can be inspected at any time outside business hours and on 48 hours notice at any other time. That is a fairly stringent but necessary part of the statutory funding agreement as it relates to the dairy industry. In contrast, in the LiveCorp statutory funding agreement, inspection must take place in business hours, and the period of notice that an inspection is to take place is no less than five days, with written notice to the company secretary and a separate notice addressed to the chief executive officer.
This is an interesting requirement. We know the coalition's history in the taxation area. You have all heard of `bottom of the harbour'. That is where company records find their way to the bottom of the harbour so that taxation liability and responsibilities can be evaded. And of course we know under whose watch that particular situation occurred. It was the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, who is now the Prime Minister. Some of the greatest rorting in Australia's taxation history occurred because company records found their way to the bottom of the harbour.
I am suggesting here that this provision is just a little too generous compared to the standards which apply to the dairy industry. The LiveCorp statutory funding agreement inspection regime must take place in business hours, and the period of notice that an inspection is to take place is no less than five days, with a written notice to the company secretary and a separate notice addressed to the chief executive officer. I assume the Commonwealth would only take this sort of action if there was considered to be a major problem within the company, so getting immediate access in such circumstances would be essential. And that was the conclusion that was reached in the dairy industry statutory funding agreement. If things go really bad in a corporation or a company, if the Commonwealth feels there is a problem of this dimension, and it requires Commonwealth intervention and scrutiny according to the laws of the land—Corporations Law—and in accordance with the statutory funding agree-ments, I would have thought it would be imperative that the Commonwealth get immediate access, not access on five days notice.
The dairy clause, if inserted in this statutory funding agreement, would facilitate that timely access and give the Commonwealth the opportunity that it has taken in other agreements, with regard to other industries, of initiating a timely intervention in the face of overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing within the company. But, for LiveCorp, there is five days written notice to two separate company officers and access only in business hours. What is the point of that?
I say to the minister: why not simply apply the standards in the dairy statutory funding agreement to this one? The dairy statutory funding agreement is one in a series of agreements that have been negotiated through the parliament and with industry. This House and the other place have agreed on those sorts of provisions, so why would you not introduce those provisions to this one? This is a mess, a real mess. LiveCorp is running out of money. The minister, through either incompetence or a deliberate act, has breached his own longstanding, formal agreement with the red meat sector. He has known about this brewing problem but all year, as he has done on other issues, he has sat on his hands and failed to act. We now have a statutory funding agreement that is just short of useless. So I say to the minister: lift the standard in this statutory funding agreement to that which applies to the dairy industry. Let us have real reporting and accountability to this parliament. And, when you have done that, the opposition will sit down and pass this legislation in the interests of the red meat sector.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004, of course, had its genesis in the terrible events surrounding the Cormo Express. Many people looked on, deeply affected by the plight of live animals on board a ship without any place to land. But, contrary to the previous speaker, the member for Corio, I acknowledge the work of our federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Warren Truss, in his efforts to bring about an end to this event, which was certainly not of the minister's making. No-one could have foreseen the events that led to this horrible episode. But the minister took control and a satisfactory solution was found. Then, following on from that event, the minister showed considerable leadership in establishing a review of the livestock export industry, which has become known as the Keniry review.
In my electorate, opinion was clearly divided on the issue of the livestock trade and whether it should continue. I think we all acknowledge that the future of the livestock trade in Australia really does depend on better protocols, appropriate treatment of animals and minimisation of harm and suffering of animals if it is to continue and be publicly acceptable. I know I have many constituents who have called on the government to place a total ban on the live animal export trade. They are offended, to put it mildly, by the past practices and treatment of animals. It is admirable, really, that we have people who care so deeply about the humane treatment of animals and I can understand their concerns—as I am sure can many in this place.
However, at the other end of the spectrum, I, like many others in this place, have a large constituency that relies on the live animal trade—the live sheep trade, in particular, in Western Australia—for its livelihood. Western Australia is a major exporter of live sheep. In 2002, six million sheep and one million cattle left Australia. The sheep were primarily going to the Middle East and the cattle to South-East Asia. Fifty-five per cent of the sheep trade operated out of the port of Fremantle in Western Australia. Many farmers have had a very difficult time in Western Australia and other areas, and they have turned almost solely to meeting the demands for live animal trade. They and their families, as I have said, are reliant on this business for their livelihood. To highlight the importance of the livestock export industry and the meat trade—the figures speak for themselves—for the five years to 2002, total red meat exports came to about $5 billion a year on average and the livestock trade represented about one-fifth of that, or about $1 billion each year on average. Around 9,000 Australians rely on this trade for their jobs.
I have made many representations for those concerned about the live export trade and for farmers in the Pearce electorate, who were very concerned about the Cormo episode. They were concerned that they might lose their livelihood if the problems inherent in the trade were not fixed. I think it is fair to say that the whole industry are committed to trying to fix these problems, recognising that they must do so if the trade is to continue. These are never easy matters to manage but manage them we must. So I am grateful to the minister for recognising the need to improve the management of the live animal trade and, in particular, to ensure that animals are well treated during those long journeys and that any suffering is minimised. 
Contrary again to what the member for Corio said, a great deal of consultation took place in determining a policy to move forward in this area. There were 248 submissions received during the course of the inquiry and the particular issues that were identified included the ineffectiveness of industry self-regulation and enforcement of codes of practice and livestock export standards by LiveCorp. That was one of the key areas identified in the submissions. Others included the separation of the legislation for export licensing from export permits—another key issue—the third-party veterinarian system for the pre-export preparation of livestock and the reporting arrangements for veterinarians and stockmen on board livestock vessels. The community expects that strict standards of animal welfare will be adhered to, and the government has done a great deal to ensure that there are appropriate controls on export licensing and that breaches of the new standards result in the loss of an exporter's licence.
The Keniry review examined a number of issues. These included the adequacy of welfare model codes of practice, the adequacy of regulatory arrangements, the types of livestock suitable for export, the supervision of voyages to ensure accurate reporting and the factors that contributed to excess mortalities on the MV Cormo Express. Dr Keniry's report was very thorough indeed, and it made a number of recommendations which the Australian government and the minister, in particular, have implemented in a bid to take control of export licensing and serial breaches of the new standards. These include increased government involvement in regulatory control, including surprise audits—

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—This parliamentary week has given us the perfect case study of a government in decline—a government that tries to deceive the Australian people on the great national issues of war and peace; a government that always puts its own political interests ahead of the Australian national interest; and a government in denial about the impact of its unfair school funding and health policies. It is a government led by a man who can barely lie straight in bed—a man who has become so dishonest, so addicted to the deception of the Australian people that it has become a way of political life.
—Order! The Leader of the Opposition will temper his language.
—For example, it is a Prime Minister misleading the Australian people by saying we would never, ever have a GST. It is a Prime Minister misleading the Australian people with the dishonesty of core and non-core promises. It is the dishonesty and deception of the kids overboard scandal, the dishonesty of the Manildra ethanol scandal and the dishonesty of the Herron appointment. It is the dishonesty of saying that, under this government, there would be no $100,000 university degrees. It is the dishonesty of turning the government's ministerial code of conduct into a pathetic joke. Worst of all, it is the dishonesty of taking this country to war for a purpose that was not true—committing the lives of young Australians to the risks of a war for a purpose that was not valid. It is the worst thing, the most reprehensible thing that a political leader can do. What sort of Prime Minister is it who takes a country to war on the basis of thin, ambiguous and incomplete intelligence? What sort of leader would do that to the nation? On nothing more substantial than thin, ambiguous and incomplete intelligence, how could you ever commit this country to war? How could you ever commit this country to war and put at risk Australians lives on something as flimsy as that?
Of course, it is a Prime Minister who has not got the character, the decency or the integrity to own up to his error. It is an indication of how badly the standards of integrity and honesty have fallen within the Howard government that we have seen people take action. So serious is the problem and so badly has public confidence been eroded by this government that we saw earlier this week 43 apolitical, eminent Australians feel compelled to step forward and set out the truth. These are 43 people who have served their nation with distinction: 43 eminent Australians, former defence chiefs, ambassadors and senior public servants, who know that the standards of this government have so eroded public trust and confidence and have fallen away so badly that they needed to step forward—people who come from all parts of the political spectrum, serving governments from different parts of the political spectrum—and set out the truth. In a document headed `Time for honest, considered and balanced foreign and security policies' they stated:
We believe that a reelected Howard Government or an elected Latham Government must give priority to truth in Government ... Australians must be able to believe they are being told the truth by our leaders, especially in situations as grave as committing our forces to war. 
We are concerned that Australia was committed to join the invasion of Iraq on the basis of false assumptions and the deception of the Australian people.
Then, with even greater gravity and concern, they stated:
Terrorist activity, instead of being contained, has increased. Australia has not become safer by invading and occupying Iraq and now has a higher profile as a terrorist target.
So they set out the fundamental truth that this government, through the adventurism and errors of its foreign policy, has not made Australia a safer place. This government, through the errors and adventurism of its failed foreign policy, has not made the world a safer place. In fact, our country has become a higher profile terrorist target. This is the truth that the head of the Federal Police, Mick Keelty, set out some months ago. Unhappily, these 43 eminent Australians, people who have served our nation well, have been treated the same way as Mick Keelty by this government—it is the bullying and the disparaging of these individuals. The Prime Minister says that he would not attack them or address them personally. Instead he sends members of the executive out on the doors—the goons out on the doors—to run these 43 eminent Australians down, just as Mick Keelty was bullied and disparaged and forced into another statement later that week. It is the same tactic by the Howard government—not addressing the truth of the arguments against it, not owning up to the truth that Australia has become a bigger terrorist target, but rather trying to criticise and attack these individuals: 43 eminent Australians who have done nothing more serious or extraordinary than set out the truth of the failures of the Howard government's foreign policy.
Of course, the Prime Minister lacks the character to take responsibility. This is the other habit that he has. It is not only the misleading, the deception and the dishonesty with the Australian people. The other great habit that he has adopted over the years is the failure to take responsibility. He has become the great blame shifter of Australian politics. He always has someone else to blame—blame the public servants, blame the intelligence agencies, claim that nobody had told him. He is always shifting the blame onto someone else. If he had the character and the integrity of a true political leader, he would step forward and take responsibility. He would fess up to his errors. The Prime Minister would not leave it just to the Liberal candidate in Wentworth to point out that the war in Iraq was an error but step forward himself and have the character to say that Iraq had no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, that Australia went to war for a purpose that was not true and that the invasion of Iraq was an error. But instead he just leaves it to the candidate in Wentworth. The Prime Minister himself has not got the character; he has not got the integrity. He is always shifting the blame. He never takes responsibility. He never faces up to the fundamental truth of his government's failings.
We have seen it again this week in relation to the free trade agreement and the PBS. Here he is, trying to walk both sides of the street. He has been forced into adopting sound Labor policy, adopting Labor's amendments. But at the last moment he tries to walk both sides of the street, saying that he is adopting Labor's amendments on the trade agreement—knowing full well that he has the advice that our amendments are good policy, good at law and consistent with the text of the FTA. But he tries to put the question mark out there about the spirit of the agreement somehow being infringed. 
What is this `spirit' of the agreement? How can the spirit of the agreement be dif-ferent from the text of the agreement unless the government has in the negotiations with the United States said things across the negotiating table that have not been included in the text of the FTA and have not been reported honestly to the Australian people? Either this `spirit' of the FTA is another act of deception of the Australian people or it is an absolute joke. It is a fig leaf designed to try to cover the Prime Minister's political embarrassment about adopting the sound amendments of the Australian Labor Party.
We know the reason he is embarrassed. It is because week after week, month after month, he was saying to the Labor Party, `Just rubber-stamp the FTA and rubber-stamp the enabling legislation.' He said, `You don't need to have a Senate committee to look at the detail of this 1,100-page document; you don't need to go to the trouble, out of consideration for the Australian people, of looking at all the detail and seeing if it's adequate, seeing if there are ways in which the enabling legislation could be improved.' He said, `Just rubber-stamp it', just as he rubber-stamped the agreement back in February, leaving out sugar and leaving Australia with an agreement that could have been so much better if the government had stayed at the negotiating table.
The Prime Minister demonstrated then that leadership does not mean you rush in and rubber-stamp things; real leadership comes from getting it right for Australia, and that is what the Australian Labor Party have done over the past fortnight. We took the time and effort, through the Senate process, to get this right and ultimately to pass into law two vital guarantees for the benefit of the Australian people: one is that the local content rules will be protected by both houses of this parliament and the other is that we are not going to see the erosion of affordable medicines in Australia. We are not going to have the practice of evergreening. We are going to have effective penalties and deterrents in place to stop the pharmaceutical companies delaying the entry of affordable generic products onto the market.
The Labor Party have done the right thing. The Labor Party have demonstrated the true, honest leadership that comes from getting it right for our country and giving the Australian people effective guarantees. All we have got from this Prime Minister is the fig leaf of saying, `Oh, somehow there might be a problem with the spirit or atmospherics of the agreement'—the spirit and the atmospherics of the agreement? It sounds like an episode of The X-Files, so we are thinking, `The truth must be out there.' The truth must be out there when the Prime Minister talks about spirits and atmospherics. It makes you wonder, when they were doing these negotiations across the table, were these hard-nosed negotiations or some kind of seance where the atmospherics and the spirits were floating around the room?
The truth is that the Labor Party have nailed this government flat to the floor. The Labor Party have caught out the government rushing into an agreement, rushing into enabling legislation, wanting to rubber-stamp this, while leaving the Australian people stripped bare and vulnerable on two important fronts. We were not going to have the nonsense of atmospherics and spirits in the room; we wanted to look at the actual substance and detail of this enabling legislation and look at the ways in which it could be improved for the benefit of the Australian people. That is what we have done through the course of this week, with amendments that are sound, amendments that defend the national interest and amendments that are consistent with the text of the FTA. 
This week there is another area in which the government has been denying the truth. It has been in a state of denial about the reality and the injustice of its unfair school funding system. Earlier this week we had the absurd proposition of the minister for health invoking the names of Chifley and Curtin. I said, `Let's have a look at one of these schools, and the treatment of that school, in the electorate of Chifley.' If this government wants to give the Labor Party lectures about fairness and social justice, let us have a look at the impact of its unfair school funding system.
So I compared the circumstances of the Bethel Christian School in Mount Druitt, in the seat of Chifley in Sydney's west, where the young Christian children there are being taught in demountable classrooms, with the circumstances of the King's School. These days the King's School say they are going to take the Labor Party on; they are going to take us on. Well, haven't they got the resources to do it! They have an annual budget of $26 million, vast playing fields, an indoor rifle range, a swimming pool, a boatshed, a museum, a full-time archivist, a recent $16 million capital upgrade and on top of that, apparently, the political resources to engage in the next election campaign. What we say to the King's School is that parents have the right to choose—parents should have freedom of choice—but we should also have fair funding policies that encourage that choice right around the country.
The Prime Minister is engaged in another act of dishonesty when he tries to say to the Australian people that choice in schooling and fair funding in schooling are mutually exclusive. We in the Labor Party know that those two things go together: fair funding means that more parents have a choice. Labor have a commitment to maintain the overall funding of non-government schools but the social justice approach of saying that that funding should be distributed fairly within the non-government school sector. So we will maintain the overall funding, but we will get the resources out to the schools that need it.
We will get the resources to the Bethel Christian schools in suburbs like Mount Druitt. We do not want Australia's next generation being schooled indefinitely in demountable classrooms—not when other schools have had outrageous funding increases and can afford boatsheds, museums and full-time archivists. I know what I would like to do with the museum at the King's School; I want to put the Prime Minister in it. I want to put the Prime Minister in it and give it a useful deployment in the school system! But I also want to improve the fairness of the school funding system, because a school like King's should not be receiving a 215 per cent increase in funding while a Bethel Christian school in a suburb like Mount Druitt gets just one-third of that amount—one-third of that funding for the demountables but a huge 215 per cent increase in funding for the boatshed, the museum and the full-time archivist.
So do not lecture the Labor Party about the legacy of Curtin and Chifley. Fair funding and social justice means we have got to have needs based funding right around the country. We are going to give the parents in this nation the most important guarantee—that no matter where they send their children to school they should have the choice, based on fair funding. We should have an acceptable national standard for all our schools, and the schools below that standard should be funded up. We will have decent provision for the neighbourhood government school down the end of the street as well as for the Christian schools, the needy Catholic schools and the needy independent schools. We need to give parents the most important guarantee in life—that no matter where they choose to send their children there is going to be adequate funding, fair funding, for the next generation of young Australians. 
That is the big policy difference on schools. It is about fairness, it is about equity, it is about decency and it is also about a government that has the integrity to face up to the facts. Do not deny the reality of what has gone wrong in the school funding system; the government should face up to it.
The problem with this Prime Minister is he will not be honest with the Australian people about his own future. People might be voting for him but they are going to end up with the Treasurer if the coalition wins the next election. He does not have the commitment to stay through the next term. He does not have the honesty and the integrity to face up to the many policy failings of his government. Unfortunately, for this Prime Minister deceit and dishonesty have become a way of public life, and that is why he must go. That is why he must go at the next election—to restore some decency, some fairness and some honesty to Australian government, because that is what the Australian people long for: social justice commitments, fair funding policies and services and opportunities for all, instead of the deceit and failure of the Howard government.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—There is an old cliche about the pot calling the kettle black. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this House and, with all the pomposity he can muster, moves a motion about the need to restore public trust and confidence in the integrity of the Australian government. Is the Leader of the Opposition a man of integrity? Is the Leader of the Opposition somebody honest? To start with, the Leader of the Opposition said when he became the Leader of the Opposition that he was going to be positive. `I'm going to be positive; I'm going to be positive,' he kept saying. He gets these cliches, we know, from Hawker Britton. He kept saying, `I'm just going to be positive about the people of Australia,' and so on. He just spent 15 minutes denigrating the Prime Minister and other people in the government. It was 15 solid minutes of abuse and denigration. He has so much respect for the parliament that he moves a motion and does not even bother to stay for it!
The Leader of the Opposition, as the member for Werriwa, signed a pledge which was published in the Macarthur Chronicle on Tuesday, 16 October 2001. I think it is important that the House take note of this pledge. The article says:
The federal member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, has released a charter of campaign honesty to promote a higher standard of debate during the election campaign. Mr Latham said he was calling on the other Werriwa candidates to back the charter. “The public has had enough of name-calling and mindless point scoring in Australian politics”. Mr Latham's pledges include `concentrate on the issues rather than making personal attacks on your opponents'.
This was a promise, a pledge, the Leader of the Opposition made before the last election. In the nearly three years since then we have had a fusillade of personal abuse; we have had denigration of good Australians; we have had people described as `skanky ho' and `corporate crook'. Is this consistent with the charter?
—What about the 43 good Australians this week?
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—If the member for Lalor wants to stay in the House, she will refrain from interjecting.
—Is this consistent with the charter of campaign honesty, may I ask? Is it all right to call a woman `skanky ho' publicly? Does the shouting shadow minister at the table think it is all right to refer to women in that way? She is silent because she thinks it is all wrong. The member for Lalor is backing Mark Latham to be the Prime Minister—somebody who uses language like that and who says other people are dishonest but who promised, in a charter of campaign honesty at the last election, not to do that sort of thing. 
The Leader of the Opposition, since he has been the Leader of the Opposition, has proved himself to be an extraordinarily dishonest man. The things he has said about his record on the Liverpool council have been proven by others to be manifestly untrue. He said when he left the Liverpool council that it was in surplus. `At the end of 1994, the budget surplus was $1.6 million,' he claimed in a personal explanation. Actually, as the mayor, he went on a spending spree of $36 million, which apparently was going to be funded somehow through unspecified savings, but the Liverpool council's auditors stated publicly that those savings never eventuated, leaving the council with significant spending obligations and a rapidly deteriorating financial position. The Leader of the Opposition, this pillar of integrity, claims that he left the Liverpool City Council with a surplus. Quite contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition claims, in his last year as the Mayor of the Liverpool City Council, it reported a $2.7 million working capital deficit. That is a fact borne out by the audited financial statements for that year.
You cannot move a motion in this chamber accusing other people of being dishonest and yourself have such a black record in terms of integrity. The Leader of the Opposition has been grossly dishonest. He has misled the people of Werriwa by promising them through a charter that he would behave in a manner in which he has never behaved since he was elected and he has, worse than that, misled the people of Australia over his record in the Liverpool City Council.
When it gets to some of the more current issues, instead of making positive comments about the future, which he is supposed to do, he decides that he will just embark on a campaign of denigration and abuse, which is what he has been doing during this MPI. When it comes to the issue of Iraq, the Leader of the Opposition repeats the lie that the Australian government went to war on a lie and that the Australian government misled the Australian people. That is a blatant lie, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it. You must not, of course, criticise the Leader of the Opposition.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think we are allowing a bit of licence in this debate. There are matters being said now that (a) are unparliamentary and (b) should only be raised by way of a substantive motion.
—The member for Lalor should remember that I was in the House when the Leader of the Opposition started his speech and was fairly free.
—It is the old story with the Labor Party—they can dish it out; they can call people liars, abuse people and criticise them personally on the way they dress and the way they look, but if you criticise anyone in the Labor Party it is an absolute outrage. Fancy criticising the Australian Labor Party! The Leader of the Opposition said that the government sent troops based on a purpose that was not true, in search of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist. We commissioned Philip Flood on the advice of a parliamentary committee, including Labor members, as an entirely appropriate person to produce a report. Of the assessments done before the Iraq war, he said: 
... they reflected reasonably the available evidence and—
—the government—
used intelligence sources with appropriate caution ...
He said that the obverse conclusion, that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, `would have been a much more difficult conclusion to substantiate'.
The Leader of the Opposition should reflect on the fact that, before the Iraq war, everybody in the opposition was saying that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Everybody was. No doubt the member for Lalor was. On the basis of all of the information available from the United Nations, from Richard Butler—one of the Labor Party's favourite sons and now one of their richest sons, since they have just enriched him by $650,000—and from the 15 Security Council members, every government on earth except Saddam Hussein's government said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. After all, this is somebody who used them against his own people. It is hardly surprising that they would come to that conclusion.
The Leader of the Opposition wants to try to convince the Australian public that somehow the government lied about this. That is, of course, manifestly untrue and has been proven to be untrue on many occasions. This is just another example of the complete failure of character on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. This is the problem: this is a Leader of the Opposition without substance, without conviction and without character. That he lacks substance is clearly demonstrated by the chopping and changing of his positions on policies for the future. It is not just an argument about the past. What about the future? His off-the-top-of-the-head `troops out by Christmas' 2UE policy was not considered by the shadow cabinet before he announced it. He said it was, but that was not true. Remember? He claimed he had briefings on Iraq and that he made the decision on the basis of briefings. That was untrue. He did not have briefings on this issue. Why tell the public you did when you did not? Why tell the public that the shadow cabinet considered the policy when they did not? Is that honest? Is that true?
The Leader of the Opposition has had nine policies now, as of today, 12 August 2004, on troops out by Christmas. We have had one policy in all of that period. Why? Because we have conviction. We believe we are right. We do not believe that everyone agrees with us; we do not expect everyone in the opposition to agree with us, and all of the people in the gallery may not agree with us, but that is not the point. We have conviction. We believe that what we are doing is right. The Leader of the Opposition has had nine positions and, of course, he has been utterly dishonest in the articulation of those positions. Oh, no, you cannot say he is dishonest; you can only say John Howard is dishonest. Is that right? That is all right, but you must not say that Mark Latham is dishonest. Oh dear, it is a little pathetic.
The fact is: on the free trade agreement it is the same thing. If you were a leader with conviction and character but you were not quite sure of the details, what would you do when the government announced that it had concluded the negotiations on the free trade agreement? You would say, `I'm not sure about this; I would like to know more about the details.' And you would sit down with officials. The government would have to make the officials available to you. That would be the reasonable thing for any government to do. And you would be briefed about the issues and you would find out what the issues were yourself. The Leader of the Opposition has never been briefed, to the best of my knowledge, by government officials on the free trade agreement. He set up a Senate committee, and there was a joint standing committee as well. The Senate committee was a good idea because the Labor Party and its fellow travellers have a majority in the Senate, so they can dominate the Senate committee. Of course, all of this time they are trying to work out how to reconcile the factions within the Labor Party, which was what that was all about. This is not something that I would have thought the Labor Party would want to make a political issue out of; they just want to do the right thing by Australians, surely, and do something in Australia's national interest. In those circumstances you would get a briefing, but no, the Leader of the Opposition did not do that. 
On the same day that the agreement was announced, the Leader of the Opposition said, `If we had to vote on it today we would be voting against it.' So he was against it. There is a man of conviction; he says he is against it. He has not ever read the text, he did not know what it said, but he was against it. Today the Leader of the Opposition is going to vote for it. On 9 February the opposition was against the free trade agreement with the United States, and on 12 August the opposition supports the free trade agreement with the United States.
The opposition have a stunt in relation to amendments to this legislation and, of course, we cannot vote down those amendments without voting down the whole of the free trade agreement. So we are required to accept the amendments. The first amendment is merely superfluous; it does not cause any problems. We have gone to the opposition in relation to the second amendment and said, `We have concerns about this, on the basis of advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that if we push through this amendment the Americans could argue that this is contrary to the terms of the free trade agreement. The Americans would then have the capacity to refuse to exchange letters, and the free trade agreement would not come into force. We have gone to the opposition privately, and we have not made a public issue out of it. We went to them privately and asked them if they would not mind making a few changes. But they would not make any changes—not at all. They decided that, just for the sake of face, they were going to stick with the latest changes that they proposed. They abandoned the changes they originally proposed within two days. They proposed some changes last Tuesday; by Thursday those changes were gone.
The latest round of changes will have to go through; otherwise we will have to scuttle the whole of the free trade agreement. But reckless, unpredictable, ill-considered Mark Latham has left Australia in a situation where we will have the free trade agreement through the parliament today, but we will enter a new period of uncertainty as we wait to see whether it will be possible to exchange the letters. We will just have to wait to see whether the Americans are going to jack up on these amendments or whether they will not. We will obviously do our best, since the parliament has passed the amendments, to try to persuade them to accept the amendments. But why is the Leader of the Opposition risking the free trade agreement on the back of a political stunt? The free trade agreement is worth a great deal to our farmers, our miners, our services sector and our manufacturers. It is worth tens of thousands of jobs to this country. It is about the future of this country, and it is now tottering on the edge because of a political stunt by the Leader of the Opposition. He believes in nothing, he has no integrity at all, he has failed to live up to his pledge. Two years ago he called the Liberal candidate for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, a corporate crook. Now he is quoting him. This is a very weak and a very sad Leader of the Opposition.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—The Leader of the Opposition has quite adequately exposed the very many problems this government has with issues like trust, integrity and honesty. I think we have to ask why the government has these problems. Is it something inherent in conservative governments? It is very tempting for those of us on this side of the House to suspect that it is a generic problem with conservative governments. It is tempting for those of us in the Labor Party—on the progressive side of politics—to conclude that this is an inherent fault in conservative governments. But I ask my colleagues to refrain from coming to this `generic' conclusion. Let us say for the sake of democracy that it is not the case. I think we have to avoid this general conclusion, for the sake of the future of democracy in Australia. I ask my colleagues to refrain from this kind of conclusion, because I think it is a fault that is specific to this government and particularly this Prime Minister.
If we look at the Prime Minister's history we will come to understand why that might be the case. As we know, this is the 30th anniversary of the Prime Minister's election in 1974. Since his election in 1974, he has been elected a further 11 times, including in 1975, 1977, 1998 and 2001. Although he is under some pressure this time around—despite the people who will be working against him in the seat of Bennelong even as we speak—he may be elected a 13th time. Apart from his election to the seat of Bennelong, at various times since 1975 he has been Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Minister of State for Special Trade Negotiations, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Finance. As we know, and to our cost, since 1996 he has been Prime Minister. In opposition, he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 1983 to 1985 and Leader of the Opposition from 1985 to 1989 and again from 1995 to 1996. He has held numerous shadow portfolios in opposition at various times over those two periods of office, and ministry portfolios when the Liberal Party was in office at various times.
So, over those 30 years, if I may paraphrase the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister has been climbing the `ladder of political opportunism'. In the period since 1996, when he became leader of this government—a limited period in those 30 years—the agenda that he and his government have pursued has not really been their own. It has always been someone else's agenda. It has been the agenda of failed Liberal leaders of their own ilk such as Mr Hewson, who was the most recent architect of the GST in modern conservative party history. It was John Hewson who originally proposed Fightback; it was John Hewson who brought that onto the modern political stage. At the time, the current Prime Minister said of the GST: `There is no way the GST will ever be part of our policy. Never, ever. It is dead. It was killed by the voters in the last election. Any suggestion that I left the door open is absolute nonsense. I didn't. I never will. The last election killed the GST. It is not part of our policy.' I think we have all heard that quote time and time again, but it is worth remembering in this context. This was a policy he was never going to have. The agenda was never his agenda.
The Prime Minister has repeatedly condemned Medicare over most of the 30-year course of his political life. Medicare was something he was going to remove from the Australian political scene. If I may put words in his mouth, it was something that he saw as a socialist plot against medicine in Australia. If you look at the earlier part of his political career—the vast majority of his political career—it was something he very much opposed. Yet for political opportunist reasons—to seek government—he reversed that very fundamental part of his political agenda. To become Prime Minister and remain Prime Minister, he effectively adopted Medicare. He foresaw that, to become and remain a political leader in this country, he would have to adopt what is fundamentally a Labor policy and maintain Medicare. And that was something he subsequently committed himself to do. Back in February 1996, he said: 
... Medicare will be retained in its entirety.
Of course, the Prime Minister has not lived up to that promise. So we have had a failure to maintain both of those commitments. He has not been honest to himself. He has not been honest to his own political commitment, to his conservative political credo that he maintained for some 20 or so years of his political life. He has never been committed to Medicare. But, in order to seize political office in this country, he had to be committed to Medicare, so he gave that commitment in February 1996. It was not a commitment he believed in, and he has never believed in it. But he understood that, to retain political office in this country, you needed to believe in Medicare, so he said he did. He won office on that promise. Although he has publicly maintained his commitment since, he has never lived up to it privately. Therefore we have not seen the achievements that a person who really believed in Medicare—such as the current Leader of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Werriwa, Mark Latham—would deliver.
We have a Prime Minister in this country who has repeatedly adopted the policies of others, be they failed Liberal leaders or the past and current generation of Labor leaders who do believe in policies like Medicare. You would have to expect that the coalition would ultimately fail to deliver on trust, integrity and honesty in this country because they do not believe in these policies or alternatively because they are the policies of others. If you do not actually believe in the policy, or if it is not really your ideology or policy that you are delivering on, ultimately you cannot be expected to produce a successful outcome for those policies. That is why this government has always had such problems in delivering on trust, integrity and honesty.
Even with the GST, which was ultimately a conservative policy, even if it was of a failed former Liberal leader, John Hewson, they called it a new, simpler taxation policy. We even saw it on the title of the act itself: a new, simpler taxation policy. Yet we know as a reality that the new, simpler taxation act stands over a metre tall, probably double the height of the former taxation legislation in this country. So even the title of the bill is a dishonest measure in itself—something that they knew when they brought it into this House and promulgated it.
In conclusion, what I want to bring to the attention of the House is the charade we have seen today on the FTA. The history here is that, while all of us in the Labor Party would well believe and every member of this House would well believe that trade is good and more trade is better, we all understand that things like the FTA are very important and serious documents. Few of us on this side of the House would seek to trade on these things as political opportunistic documents. We know that trade is useful and important for this country and vital for our future, but we also know that the American alliance is not something to be toyed with as a political opportunistic thing. We know it is a serious document. The American alliance is something this party brought into being over 50 years ago, so we know how vital it is to our future. We know how important trade is to the future of this country and we would not play with it in the way that the Prime Minister has, merely for political opportunism. We also know how important things like the PBS are to this country and to the people of this country and how vital cheap medical drugs and generic drugs are to the people of this country and to the people of my electorate in particular. So we would not play with these things as cheap political opportunistic points in the way that the Prime Minister has today. 
When we put these things before the Australian people, we do so in all seriousness and we would not use them as cheap political opportunistic points simply to score another political point with the people of Australia. We do so in seriousness. We guarantee that we will put these things forward with a serious point to put before the people, and so we ensure that we do it with the guarantee that we have put before the people not merely to trade press conferences one after the other with a guarantee that rings hollow to people and does not protect their medicine, does not protect their cultural interests and does not secure their long-term trade interest. That will be secured by the Labor Party. That will not be secured by the government, because they are only advancing FTA in the course of this year as a political point, not a trade point.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—Someone making claims of integrity and honesty and accusing others of lacking those attributes should first of all be examined to see whether or not those claims can be justified in relation to their own conduct. I expected that the Leader of the Opposition would have some grounds to be able to make the claims that he has in this matter of public importance debate today. I found very quickly that the Leader of the Opposition has no basis for making claims that he accuses the government of. Firstly, I came across an interview that the Leader of the Opposition had recently when he was asked about the Treasury audit for the calculations of policies for the upcoming elections, the so-called budget honesty that is required prior to an election. Mr Latham said:
We are on the job now and of course we are doing so much more than the Howard government in releasing funding plans and costings. We have been doing that consistently in the past and of course that process continues—albeit under a different format with PricewaterhouseCoopers.
When he was asked would all policies be audited, he said:
All our policies, come election day, people will know the full funding and costings that go with them.
That is a pretty positive sort of statement. It was unfortunate for the Leader of the Opposition that he was not telling the truth. The fact is that the senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers had to correct the Leader of the Opposition by saying that they would be doing little more than adding up the sums, the calculations of the Australian Labor Party, to see whether the total at the bottom of page was consistent and accurate. They were not testing the valuations, they were not testing the pricing of the policies; they were doing nothing more than a simple mathematical sum to make sure that the figures added up. I would have thought anybody with a simple desk calculator could have done that, but the Leader of the Opposition made an outrageous attempt to pass off Labor's bodgie figures—and they must be considered bodgie if they were not prepared to put them through a full audit. Mr Latham claimed they had been fully audited. In his statement he says, `We are on the job now and of course we are doing so much more.'
He said they were doing consistently what they had done in the past. But I went back and looked at what the Labor Party has done in the past about budget honesty. I found that in the 1998 elections the ALP made 319 spending commitments, submitted 28 on the Tuesday before the election day and submitted a further 87 two days before the election, too late to have them costed. I would have thought that the criticism that was aimed at the Australian Labor Party for dishonesty at that point would have caused it to be rectified by the 2001 elections. It was not. In 2001 the Labor Party did not begin submitting its policies until the Monday before the election. Only about half of its election commitments were submitted, most of them two or three days before the election, again too late for costing. So much for budget honesty. So much for honesty of the leader and his claim for the honesty of his party. Both he and his party have demonstrated in the very basic thing of wanting to govern that they are dishonest. 
I found that that was further endorsed when I looked at Western Sydney. Being a member from Western Sydney, as the member for Macquarie is, I am conscious of the activities of fellow members and local government representatives in Western Sydney. We have watched for some time the progress of Liverpool council and the Leader of the Opposition's role in the management of that outfit. We have found that, despite his claims, an inquiry found that he is responsible for jacking up by $40 a year the rates that are being paid by every person living in that council area. That was $40 a year out of the mouths of the children, the people in the Liverpool area, because he went on a spending spree which he subsequently claimed was good management. He said that the clerks and the people employed by the council did not understand his intention, his good management, and that they got it wrong rather than it being his direction and his management that caused the disaster. There again, I am sad to say that a person making a statement of integrity has been proved to be absolutely unreliable.
Another claim that has been made by the Australian Labor Party and by the Leader of the Opposition is that they are committed to producing in government budget surpluses in each year, reducing the net debt, reducing Commonwealth spending as a proportion of GDP and reducing Commonwealth taxation as a proportion of GDP. They are almost impossible goals, but the claim is made time and time again. They are goals that I believe cannot be borne out when they come to submit the figures to the budget audit process—the honesty of budget that is required before the election.
That would not be so bad, but then the Leader of the Opposition gets down to people who are battling. He ought to know about battlers. The Leader of the Opposition feels he knows about battlers, but just recently when he was critical of the government for not being able to give tax concessions to people with incomes of less than $52,000 he had to admit two or three days later that he was not even considering giving concessions to people with incomes of less than $30,000 a year. They are the very battlers he claims to represent. He had to admit that he had misled people by saying that our budget was terrible but he admits that he is unlikely to give any sustenance or relief to those with an income of less than $30,000.
I point out to the House that with that sort of record, and with the claims that are being made about changes to industrial relations that are supposed to improve things, it is time that we looked at what this government has been able to achieve in the period that it has been in office and compared it with the massive unemployment created by the Hawke-Keating governments. The fact is that they put over 320,000 people out of work in just two years, from 1990 to 1992. In the six years from 1990 to 1996 they did not create more than 8,000 jobs. It is a shameful record when you compare it with what this government has been able to achieve in its period in office. There are an extra 1.3 million jobs. The unemployment rate is at a 23-year low. This government has provided savings of more than $500 a month in interest repayments alone for every home buyer. That is a wonderful record that goes home to the very people this government represents. 
We understand what the electorate is on about. We have made the commitments and we have fulfilled the commitments. That is $500 less per month on interest repayments than people were paying when we came to office in 1996. Home loan interest rates have fallen from a peak of 17 per cent under Labor to just 7.05 per cent today. Eighty per cent of taxpayers are now paying a top rate of only 30c in the dollar. Small business overdrafts are 8.8 per cent, well below the peak under Labor of 20.5 per cent. We remember those days of closed and vacant shops. The retailers had gone bust and the small contractors had gone out of business.
Despite the claims that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition, real wages over this period have risen by 13.2 per cent compared with just 2.4 per cent under Labor. There was a 2.4 per cent increase over 13 years. That was 0.2 per cent per year. You cannot even measure it. I do not know if there is a coin that could be used to pay that amount per week to Australian workers. That is the penalty under Labor. The figure was 2.4 per cent under Labor, over 13 years. It is 13.2 per cent since the current government has been in office. There are now 406,000 people in apprenticeships and traineeships compared with just 142,000 in March 1996. That is looking after young people. I believe this man is dangerous. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition will do anything to achieve office. I believe that the way he treated that cab driver shows an inbuilt and burning hatred for people he distrusts or dislikes. If he were to become Prime Minister he would carry on those characteristics.

These include increased government involvement in regulatory control, including surprise audits, improved industry quality assurance procedures, improved risk management and systems management, $1 million a year investment in improving animal welfare outcomes in the Middle East, and establishing new export protocols with Middle East destinations.
Since we came to government, reforms implemented have ensured a significant decline in the mortality rates of animals on voyages, and these additional measures should further improve these figures and improve the conditions on board livestock ships. Further key changes agreed to include a new Australian livestock export code, which will be referenced in the legislation and which exporters will need to meet before shipments can be cleared; new annual licensing arrangements for livestock exporters; and inspection and registration of export feedlots, including increased inspection items in the feedlot before issuing of final exports permits.
The industry, concerned about the future of livestock trade, has demonstrated a great willingness to do more to enhance the skill levels of members handling livestock. Under the new arrangements, Australian veterinarians will be required on voyages to the Middle East and will report directly to the Australian government's Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and will be personally sanctionable for false reporting. I understand that a delegation of Australian officials has visited the Middle East live animal importing countries in an effort to improve the conditions of trade.
These changes have to be funded, and I understand that the government has contributed $11 million to implement the changes recommended by the Keniry report. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004 is part of that process of change and implements another of the Keniry recommendations to ensure that the industry is responsible for research and development and management of quality assurance systems to support its members and translate current practice into outcomes consistent with best practice.
Funding these changes will be by way of a compulsory customs charge. The livestock industry submitted that the best way to achieve these and other changes was to ensure funding went directly to its service delivery body to enable the industry to carry out marketing and research and development activities and improvements to animal welfare practices in a clearly accountable and transparent manner. It is necessary therefore to change the existing Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to achieve this outcome, and this is what this bill seeks to do.
Amending the act will allow the minister to determine more than one red meat industry organisation to be a marketing body and a research body and to receive revenue derived from compulsory levies and charges. The intention of the act to have a single body—that is, Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd—remaining as the main industry research and marketing entity for the whole of the red meat industry remains intact, and the government will continue its dollar-for-dollar funding arrangements. This bill is aligned with other amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 and the Export Control Act 1982 which relate to ensuring a much tighter regulatory system across all aspects of the livestock export trade. 
Together, these bills represent a very significant change to the reform and improved management of the livestock export industry, with particular emphasis on achieving best practice in animal welfare. These reforms are very necessary if there is to be a reasonable acceptance by the Australian public of the live animal trade. Without these changes, the longer term viability of the industry would be seriously compromised.
I can understand that this bill will not satisfy those people—and there are many in my electorate—who feel very strongly about the livestock trade and deeply about the suffering of animals and who will not under any circumstances be satisfied with anything other than a total ban on the livestock export trade. Clearly, this bill will not satisfy them. However, with this amendment greater attention is being paid to animal welfare, and the bill puts in place measures that reduce the suffering of animals. As I said earlier, the rate of mortality has dropped quite dramatically, and under these measures we would expect that to continue, to make sure that the deaths on board these live sheep carriers are minimal and that the animals are well cared for. This bill will bring a very welcome improvement for many who share a concern about the past treatment of animals in the livestock export trade.",REPS,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—in reply—I thank honourable members who contributed to the debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004, particularly the honourable member for Pearce, who has outlined the challenges that are being met through this legislation as well as the importance of ensuring good standards of animal welfare and good animal welfare outcomes in association with the live animal trade. This is the second part of legislation being brought to the parliament on this issue. The first part dealt more with the standard-setting initiatives. This bill deals with the arrangements to ensure that those mechanisms and the industry structures can be effectively paid for.
In October 2003 the government commissioned a broad-ranging review of Australia's livestock export industry after the Cormo Express incident. The report of the Keniry review recommended that industry should be responsible for research and development and management of enhanced quality assurance systems. The bill before us will allow for the declaration of a livestock export marketing body and a livestock export research body. This is necessary under the Constitution's appropriation provisions in order for the body to receive compulsory funding, as recommended in the Keniry report and agreed to by the government. The industry body will be receiving compulsory funding by way of appropriations from consolidated revenue equal to the amount of the customs charge raised from livestock exporters and, as such, will be subject to strictly accountable measures through a funding agreement with the Commonwealth.
The main function of the body will be to provide its members with marketing and research outcomes consistent with best practice in animal health and welfare. The government has worked in good faith with industry and the opposition to get bipartisan support for this important legislation—and we thought that had been forthcoming, until we heard the comments today by the shadow minister. There has been a range of issues that needed to be addressed, and the drafting of this legislation was a more complex process than was first anticipated. The government remains committed to the passage of the legislation in a timely manner. 
The government moved quickly to put in place the legislation that supports an increased level of regulation for the trade. We moved promptly to deal with that important issue because we were aware of the public concerns on the matter. The measures already passed by the parliament will ensure that the animal health and welfare outcomes that are expected by the Australian people are met and that the industry builds on the improvements in animal welfare that it has achieved.
A draft statutory funding agreement has been developed and has been provided to the opposition in good faith so as to smooth the passage of this legislation. If there are specific issues that need to be clarified, the government stands ready to look at them in the interests of securing the future of this vital industry. We remain in consultation with industry leaders in that regard.
The bill complements other amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 and the Export Control Act 1982 that provide for the introduction of tighter regulation across all elements of the livestock export trade. The intention remains, under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997, for Meat and Livestock Australia to continue as the main industry research provider for the whole of the red meat industry. Extensive consultation with a range of industry bodies, including the Cattle Council, has led to the development of this model. While this model diverges from the current industry arrangements, the government has worked hard to accommodate all industry views.
The industry research body, the MLA, alone will be eligible for dollar-for-dollar government matching funding. There are some small details that need to be finalised in relation to how the LiveCorp and MLA boards interact, and it is my expectation that these can be adequately addressed through an agreement between the two boards for the funding of joint programs. I make the point that there is a significant incentive for LiveCorp to work with the MLA board, as the government matching R&D dollars are only available to MLA.
There have been no moves to sidestep the existing MOU. This bill will allow for consistent funding of a livestock export industry body that will serve the specific needs of the livestock export industry in line with the findings of the Keniry report. The comment by the shadow minister in respect of a breach of the red meat industry memorandum of understanding through this legislation is simply incorrect—there has been no breach of the MOU. The memorandum, signed in 1998, refers only to statutory levies to be paid to MLA in the event that voluntary contributions were not considered sufficient. The MOU does not and could not refer to the statutory levy proposed in the current bill before parliament, as this is an entirely new levy being contemplated and one that will not be paid to MLA.
 In essence, post 1998 the live export industry has changed significantly, as have community views. This was reflected in the findings of the Keniry review, in which it was recommended that a statutory levy be established to fund R&D services to the live export industry. The government considered this recommendation and took the view that this new levy should be passed directly to LiveCorp in the interests of ensuring ownership and control over this levy. Importantly, this was not contemplated at the time of the MOU and thus did not form a part of the MOU agreement. 
I should emphasise that there is still every incentive for LiveCorp to utilise the R&D and marketing services of MLA, given that matching government R&D contributions will stay with the MLA. We seek to preserve an overall integrated industry architecture, whilst assigning greater ownership of and responsibility for its own industry to the live export sector. I commend the bill to the House. I thank those members who have contributed, and I urge the opposition to give this bill speedy passage so that the full suite of measures to ensure that we have the appropriate standards to underpin the live export trade can be implemented forthwith.
Question agreed to.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—It is my pleasure to talk today about a person who has become one of the great leaders of his generation in the fight for Indigenous rights. I speak of Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Chairman of the Northern Land Council for more than 20 years, who on Monday this week announced his retirement. Incidentally, that day was also the International Day of the World's Indigenous People, so it was perhaps propitious that he should do so on that day. This is certainly a timely chance to recognise the strong, committed role Galarrwuy has played and the life that he has devoted to Indigenous issues.
Galarrwuy's involvement in standing up for his people goes back to the early 1960s, when as a teenager he joined his father, Mungurrawuy, as one of the Yolngu leaders fighting in court to stop a bauxite mine from operating on his land in the Gove land rights case—a historic and monumental case in which he played a pivotal role as an interpreter. The Gove land rights case was a battle that was lost but it led to the enactment of the Northern Territory land rights act, and the Mabo decision that came later was built upon that act and other judgments.
In 1975 Galarrwuy joined the Northern Land Council and represented traditional Aboriginal landowners and Aboriginal people in the Top End of the Northern Territory. He became the Chairman of the Northern Land Council in 1977 at a very young age. It was at about that time that I first met Galarrwuy. He left the position in 1980 but retained an executive role at the Northern Land Council. He returned as chairman in 1983 and was re-elected to the position a further six times. His work with the Northern Land Council has been to see the return of land to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Further to this, he has worked to encourage those initiatives which help traditional owners to manage and care for their land and sea resources. 
Galarrwuy was honoured as Australian of the Year in 1978. In 1985 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia. In 1998 he was honoured as one of Australia's national living treasures. In 2001 Galarrwuy was elected as a co-chair of the Aboriginal Development Consultative Forum in Darwin. Galarrwuy will stand down in October this year, at the next full council meeting of the Northern Land Council. Although his time leading the Northern Land Council is coming to an end, his time as a leader in the Yolngu community of north-east Arnhem Land and the Indigenous community generally across Australia is far from over.
We need to understand the times in which Galarrwuy was a leader. Members will no doubt recall the days of the violent racist attacks, particularly from the conservative side of politics in the Northern Territory, against Aboriginal people and Aboriginal interests and particularly against the northern and central land councils in the 1970s and the 1980s; the battle with the then Hawke government over the issue of national land rights; and the leadership role that was played by Galarrwuy as Chairman of the Northern Land Council and Wenton and Rubuntja as chairs of the Central Land Council in thwarting the attempts by the then Labor government to water down the Aboriginal land rights act in the Northern Territory so that they could pass an acceptable land rights model nationally to suit the interests of a conservative Labor Premier, Brian Burke, in Western Australia. There have been other battles, and not the least of those was the one over native title—and Galarrwuy again was at the fore. We have seen that, in all aspects of Indigenous life in the Northern Territory, Galarrwuy has made a contribution.
It is clear that Galarrwuy has an entrepreneurial streak, and there is no doubt that, in his retirement, he will work towards setting up businesses and working with his family—and a very large extent of the family in north-east Arnhem Land. There is the challenge of the huge development in Nhulunbuy by Alcan, which wants to spend a significant amount of money to extend its lease in the life of the mine. That will involve difficult negotiations with Yolngu people, and Galarrwuy will no doubt lead many of those negotiations.
I have no doubt Galarrwuy will continue to make a great contribution to our community and to Australian life generally. His legacy of improving the lives of Indigenous Australians during his tenure at the NLC is one that we will remember with a great deal of gratitude—and, in my case, a great deal of fondness. I wish him well in the next phase of his life.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Yunupingu, Mr Galarrwuy</title>",Adjournment,32,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
I am pleased to advise the House that the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002 has been amended with the agreement of all parties in the Senate. While it is disappointing that the provisions to remove the privileged role for unions in Commonwealth occupational health and safety issues will not proceed, it is important for the government to send a strong message that we are concerned about and leading the way in strengthening occupational health and safety compliance, particularly in Commonwealth workplaces.
The passage of the bill will now put in place a stronger, more effective occupational health and safety compliance and enforcement regime. There will be greater focus on improved occupational health and safety performance and prevention of workplace injuries to Commonwealth employees. Dual civil and criminal penalty regimes for occupational health and safety breaches will now operate, with all Commonwealth employers now liable for the full range of civil penalties and remedies. The maximum criminal penalty that a number of Commonwealth employers will face for a breach of their duty of care which causes death or serious injury has also been substantially increased to nearly $500,000. This is one of the highest penalties for occupational health and safety breaches in Australia. These stronger penalties will improve occupational health and safety outcomes so that workplace injuries and deaths are prevented. This is in stark contrast to the ACT's punitive industrial manslaughter law, which simply places employers and employees in an adversarial workplace setting. Industrial manslaughter laws are unnecessary and can only create uncertainty for employers and employees. The bill will also make a number of amendments of a technical nature and other minor amendments to improve the operation of the current provisions of the act. 
I would like to thank the Australian Democrats in particular for their pragmatic and constructive approach to this bill. The government remains committed to further improvements in occupational health and safety in Commonwealth workplaces and to providing for a greater opportunity for all employees to be actively involved in occupational health and safety matters in the workplace. It is imperative that Commonwealth employers be required to consult with all employees, not just unions, about the development and implementation of occupational health and safety arrangements. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,36,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—Since the introduction of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002 more than two years ago, Labor has consistently said that there was an opportunity to achieve some valuable reform in respect of health and safety for Commonwealth public servants. Labor has acknowledged since that time that the bill contains some useful provisions. In fact, this approach goes right back to the year 2000—four years ago—when a very similar bill was proposed by the government. Labor made it clear then that it supported the bulk of the bill but was opposed to those blatantly anti-union parts of the bill which sought to restrict the role of unions in occupational health and safety.
Until today, the government had forsaken the opportunity to re-present the bill in the House in a form that was acceptable to all parties. I note that the minister thanked the Australian Democrats. I think the Australian Labor Party played a central role in getting to this point. I am pleased that this divisive, unhelpful approach has been set aside to allow the positive aspects of the bill to pass with our support. It is a shame that it has taken so long to get to this point. The bill sat dormant for almost two years after its introduction back in June 2002.
Labor have also made it clear that we supported those parts of the bill that strengthen the enforcement aspects of occupational health and safety for Commonwealth employees. These are the provisions that will be passed today. We agree with the government that there is merit in increasing the level of penalties in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act and in introducing civil pecuniary penalties for Commonwealth employers in addition to refining existing criminal penalties. This dual criminal and civil system of enforcement is also consistent with state occupational health and safety systems.
Labor accepts that introducing a civil stream of enforcement can expedite prosecutions. Under the current `criminal only' system, very few prosecutions are brought at all. The Senate inquiry into the 2000 bill found that, from 50,000 reported accidents and 1,770 investigations, only nine prosecutions had been brought. This was exacerbated by the immunity of the Commonwealth and most Commonwealth authorities from prosecution. As a result, it appears that the criminal penalties under the current act have little deterrent effect. An important aspect of this new dual system is that the bill will add a new provision, which was not in the original 2000 bill, to make it possible to secure a pecuniary penalty order against the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. It therefore gives me great pleasure to indicate Labor's support for this bill, as amended.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report: Report 402, Review of Auditor-General's reports 2003-2004, first and second quarters.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report No. 402, Review of Auditor-General's reports 2003-04: first and second quarters. The committee selected six Australian National Audit Office performance audits for review by public hearing from a total of 24 reports presented by the ANAO to the presiding officers during the first and second quarters of 2003-04. The six audit reviews examined respectively the implementation of two industry assistance schemes; a statutory supervisory function; the audits of two areas of public sector transparency; and the management of the plasma fractionation agreement extension option review.
I must highlight that the committee was disappointed by the lackadaisical approach shown by the Department of Health and Ageing to resolving the government's position on the blood plasma fractionation agreement extension option. Health exhibited a history of disregard for advice from the ANAO, and indeed the committee itself, to expedite the task of assessing the extension option. Further, when Health did get on with the task, it did not comply with Department of Finance and Administration guidelines. The committee believes that Health needs to put some extra effort into developing staff skills in competitive tendering and contracting. Those staff involved in contract management must comply with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and circulars, especially with regard to value for money.
In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people from the many government agencies and private organisations which contributed to the reviews by preparing submissions and giving valuable evidence at public hearings. I also wish to thank the members of the committee—in particular my vice-chair, Ms Plibersek, who has been an outstanding contributor to the work of the committee—for their time and dedication in the conduct of these inquiries.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—Labor will oppose the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003 and defend the ability of students to protect their own interests. Frankly, this bill is nothing more than political payback for the campaign that student organisations have vigorously conducted against this government's attacks on university students and their families. The Howard government does not like the fact that student organisations regularly and very effectively remind the Australian public that over the last eight years HECS fees have nearly doubled—the debt that students have to carry has nearly doubled. We know that if the Howard government is re-elected many universities will hike up their HECS fees by another 25 per cent because that is what this government is allowing them to do. Already, 26 universities have announced that if the Howard government is re-elected they will put their fees up, and 18 of them will put their fees up by the full 25 per cent. If the Howard government is re-elected, many students who are hoping to start a university course next year will be facing a very hefty rise in their HECS fees.
The Howard government does not like the fact that student organisations remind the public that it is the government that allows Australians with lower marks than their colleagues to buy places at university, by paying full fees of up to $100,000—and if the Howard government is re-elected those will rise to $200,000. The Howard government also does not like it when student organisations remind the public that funding cuts under this government have resulted in a blow-out of more than 30 per cent in class sizes at universities. The Howard government also does not like it when student organisations remind the public that the failure to fund enough HECS places is resulting in around 20,000 qualified students being turned away from university every year.
It is hardly surprising that the Howard government gets rather rattled when its appalling record on higher education is highlighted to the electorate. But, instead of shooting the messenger—which is what this bill is all about—the Howard government needs to learn to deal with criticism. Criticism is an inevitable and important part of the political process. I think everyone in this place has at some time felt aggrieved by the comments or actions of a peak body, but not every member of parliament who has felt this way has then tried to eliminate the source of that criticism. But that is exactly what the Liberal Party is doing with this bill. This bill is a massive overreaction to valid criticism of the Liberal Party by student organisations. This bill would provide the government with a $5 billion a year sledgehammer to smash student organisations. This bill would give the government the power to withhold $5 billion a year in university funding in order to force universities to comply with what can only be described as this government's ideological agenda.
Funding blackmail on this scale is extraordinary. It even overshadows the Howard government's attempted $404 million blackmail of universities to force them to implement this government's industrial relations policies. This is another example of the government's attempts to impose its ideological will on universities. Just last December the government secured passage of a piece of legislation more interventionist in the running of universities than any in the history of the Commonwealth. That legislation gave the education minister and all future education ministers the power to determine the number of students in each course in each university. It also introduced a concept that has been foreign to Australian universities until now: that the minister would have the right of veto over what universities teach right down to the course level. That is what this minister's track record of intervening in universities is like. 
The bill we are considering here would further increase the level of government control over universities. This bill would allow the government to withhold core educational funding to achieve non-educational objectives. Universities value their political independence from government, and so they should. It is something that everybody in this place should fight hard to protect, but that is not something we have seen from this government. Universities are too important as institutions of free and independent thought to become beholden to the political whims of governments of any persuasion. But that is precisely what the Howard government has set out to do. As the proportion of funding universities receive from government has declined under the Howard government, the level of political control over the internal operations of universities has increased.
At present every university in the country is free to independently determine whether or not students are to become members of their student organisation as part of the enrolment process, and what contribution they will make to these organisations. It is no coincidence that each and every one of them recognises the benefits of the current arrangements. The current policy on membership of student organisations is a good, sensible and practical policy. But this legislation is all about telling universities that they are wrong. This government always thinks it gets everything right and this is all about telling the universities that they are all wrong. It is going to effectively blackmail the universities into changing their policies; otherwise they risk losing billions of dollars in Commonwealth funding.
I must say attacking vocal opponents of Liberal Party policy has become a bit of a sport for this government, but attacking student organisations has achieved the status of a holy crusade for a little band of zealots opposite. Understanding the origins of attacks on student organisations is useful to understanding the motivation for this draconian piece of legislation. Until the mid-1970s bipartisan support existed for student organisation membership as an automatic consequence of enrolling at university, with a corresponding requirement to contribute to the costs of these organisations. As student organisations, particularly the Australian Union of Students, asserted a more active role in political debate, this consensus began to break down. It was not the basis of membership of student organisations or the requirement by universities that students contribute to the running of these organisations as a condition of enrolment that changed; it was the views of the Liberal Party that changed in direct response to student organisations expressing views that did not accord with the Liberal Party view of the world and which, it was feared, might damage its electoral prospects. The Liberal Party view of student organisation membership has nothing to do with principle. The Liberal Party's approach to student organisations is entirely motivated by self-interest and is an attempt to destroy that which it cannot control. 
With consensus for the existing practices of membership of student organisations to be broken down, Liberal students and members of the wider party began a campaign to destroy student organisations. They have attempted a number of strategies to achieve this. First there were attempts to achieve their aims through democratic means by initiating referenda on campus to alter student organisation constitutions. However, they were unable to win the support of their fellow students, so they moved on. Next they tried the courts, by challenging the right of universities to place conditions on enrolment such as payment of a fee for the running of student organisations. Again this proved unsuccessful, so they changed their attack again. Last year we saw a challenge to the existing membership arrangements at James Cook University through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Once again the outcome was a setback for those who seek to undermine student organisations.
That only left open this legislative intervention into universities. So the Australian Liberal Students Federation have campaigned to win the support of Liberal parliamentarians to impose their will on the broader body of students. This has proved to be the only glimmer of success for those opposed to student organisations, with sporadic interventions, particularly by Liberal state governments, over the last two decades. So here we are again, as we were in 1999 when the member for Goldstein, who was then the minister for education, tried unsuccessfully—and I think this attempt will be unsuccessful as well—to legislate against student organisations. Here we are again with Liberal students past and present attempting to impose their will on students and universities via the federal parliament.
A recurring theme through all of these campaigns has been the accusation that student organisations are merely an adjunct of the Labor Party whose purpose is to elect Labor governments. In 1988 the Australian Liberal Students Federation—we might remember that the Prime Minister is patron of that organisation—circulated a briefing to coalition MPs explaining why they should implement the Liberal Students Federation plan to destroy student organisations. Under the heading `Student Unions Help Keep Labor in Power' the briefing paper notes:
Generations of students have been subjected to the massive outpourings of Left-wing propaganda from student unions.
It goes on to lament:
Left-wing ideas have thus gained a currency amongst Australia's educated professionals (eg in the media and universities) way out of proportion to their intellectual integrity and their currency in society as a whole. This can only make the job of the Coalition in winning elections that much more difficult.
This is a sentiment that the Prime Minister, of course, endorses. Within months of the election of his government, he opened the Liberal Students Federation conference by congratulating Liberal students, on behalf of the Liberal Party, on their role in this ideological battle. It was a message he reiterated in July last year, when he returned to open their 2003 conference and stated:
... fundamental to the political debate that goes on in this country is the battle of ideas. That unless a political party wins the battle of ideas, it cannot hope to either gain or retain office ... Liberal students are at the forefront of the battle of ideas ...
That is really what this bill is all about: attempting to neutralise alternative viewpoints in the battle of ideas. This battle of ideas is about long- and short-term differences. Equally important to the accusation that student organisations are indoctrinating generations of unsuspecting students is the role student organisations play in advancing the interests of their members at election time. When debating legislation in 1994 to provide support to student organisations that were under attack from the Kennett and Court governments, there was a common thread in the arguments of those opposite. The role of the National Union of Students in running a `Put the Liberals last' campaign during the 1993 election featured prominently in the arguments of a number of members still in this House today. The member for Sturt highlighted the apparently outrageous actions of the National Union of Students in opposing the election of a Liberal government intent on deregulating student fees and introducing a voucher scheme. Never letting the facts get in the way of rhetoric, the now Minister for Health and Ageing went one step further in suggesting that the NUS had actually donated $100,000 directly to the Labor Party. Of course, it was not true, but that did not stop the minister for health. We can only wonder what other fanciful allegations he is going to dream up this time. 
The Liberal Party continues to attempt to create the impression that the campaigns that are run against the Liberal Party by student organisations at election time are some kind of conspiracy. But they are nothing of the sort. Student organisations campaign against the Liberal Party because it is in the well-informed interests of students against an unambiguously anti-student Liberal Party. Students and their representative organisations are taking the only practical action available to them to defend their interests and the interests of their universities. Perhaps the Liberal Party could test its conspiracy theory one day by adopting policies that would be good for students in this country and their families. I am not anticipating it, and I imagine the students are not anticipating it happening any time soon, given the government's consistent anti-student track record over the last eight years.
The Liberal Party is nothing short of a broken record when it comes to the role of students in universities. The Liberal government's attitude is that students should pay more and more and expect less and less in return. This bill is saying that students should keep quiet about it. For more than a decade now, the Liberal Party has relentlessly adopted policies to make students pay higher and higher fees and to push them more and more into full fee paying places. At the same time, the Liberal Party has presided over massively declining public resources in our universities. If this bill were to pass, the only crime for which students would be paying would be to have acted to defend their interests against attacks by a Liberal Party that has made them the cash cow of our university system.
Another recurring theme in Liberal arguments to destroy student organisations is that students should not have to contribute to activities that they do not support. Some students will object to various positions taken on issues by their student organisations. That is in the nature of any form of representation. Unanimity in any democratic organisation is pretty hard to come by. However, opposition by a minority over a particular issue is not an argument in favour of this bill. The importance and validity of all students contributing to student organisations, even if they do not agree with every aspect of their activities, was put very well in a report on an AUS conference more than 25 years ago which said:
... since various student unions do have a positive contribution to offer to student welfare and student education they should be supported by all those who profit from them. It seems reasonable that all those who do profit should make some contribution in return. The funding and therefore the provision of various student services would be impossible unless there was some requirement to pay a contribution towards them. 
The fact that some people object to the way in which some public funds are spent does not mean that they are therefore exempted from paying taxes.
Let me emphasise that: `does not mean that they are therefore exempted from paying taxes'—a very good point indeed. Who do you think it might have been that said this? It was none other than the current Treasurer, writing in the Monash University student union newspaper, Lot's Wife, in March 1978. If the Treasurer supports this bill that is here today, I look forward to him introducing a companion bill giving taxpayers the option of not paying for the upkeep of two prime ministerial residences, the Prime Minister's still very generous superannuation or any other Commonwealth spending that any citizen might object to. The Treasurer should have some consistency about his arguments.
There is a lot at stake with this bill. If it were to become law—and, as I say, I very much hope that it does not—we would see a drastic decline in the ability of student organisations to both represent the interests of their members and provide them with a range of services and support integral to the successful completion of their studies. More than this, the positive role that student organisations have played in cultivating active citizenship would be jeopardised. The experience gained in student organisations has assisted many of those involved to go on and contribute to the public life of our nation. Alumni of student organisations can be found on all sides of politics. They can also be found in the judiciary, the arts, the media and amongst many public commentators.
The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor Gavin Brown, articulated the value to society of participation in student organisations to last year's Senate inquiry. He said:
I seriously believe that experience in student politics ... is enormously valuable both to the individuals who participate in it and ultimately to the country in terms of the training and so on they get ... you should provide students with the opportunity to be engaged in serious political involvement while they are students, because that is ultimately to the net benefit of society.
This is a valuable contribution from a vice-chancellor who has probably been on the receiving end of more than his fair share of student organisation criticism and protest. Nevertheless, he still recognises the value of what the students have been doing. It would be easy for those such as vice-chancellors, for whom student organisations can be a real thorn in their sides, to sit back and let the Howard government kill off this source of dissent. But, unlike the Liberal Party, vice-chancellors recognise that dissent is a natural and very important part of our democracy.
I have focused today on the role of student organisations in defending the interests of students, and I have done this because it is this role of student organisations that has brought us to this point in the parliament today. It is this role that motivates this bill. But we should also be very conscious of the devastating impact that this bill would have on student services on campus. These would be the collateral damage of this bill, which, although it is aimed at stifling dissent, would also severely restrict the availability of basic services to students.
These services are vital to supporting students to successfully complete their studies. For example, orientation weeks are invaluable in helping new students find their feet in the strange new environment that is a university. Much of what goes on during orientation week is organised by student organisations. Child care, word-processing facilities for students who cannot afford their own computers and independent representation for students in internal university processes are all vital services provided by student organisations and are all placed at risk by this bill. 
Let us also not forget the role played by student organisations in funding and supporting clubs and societies on campus. These create a campus culture that supports a good learning environment. Many of the most important lessons students receive at university take place outside the classroom, lab or library. Student involvement in clubs and societies is not only invaluable for the social support networks they provide, which help students to make it through their studies, but also an intrinsically valuable part of the university experience.
These support structures are particularly valuable to students moving from the country and those students who are the first in their family to go to university. They are also important to international students, who face the additional challenge of finding their feet in a new country. These students are the most likely to need the support offered by student organisations to adjust to university life. Some of these are the students most at risk of finding the transition to university difficult and most at risk of not completing their studies. The minister is fond of quoting how many students do not continue into their second year at university. If this bill were to become law, it would only make this situation worse.
The experience in Western Australia under the Court government legislation that this bill is modelled on gives us a warning of what would follow. Student representation was decimated under this type of legislation in Western Australia, and many student services were lost. There can be no pretence that the consequences of this bill are unintended. We are debating this bill in the full knowledge of its outcomes.
ACUMA, the body that was formerly the Australasian Campus Union Managers Association, warns that this bill also jeopardises a wide range of essential services for students. It provided to last year's Senate inquiry a list of 26 services that are likely to be lost under this legislation. ACUMA also warns that up to 2,000 jobs could be lost under this bill, many hundreds of them in regional universities. One has to wonder what those who represent areas that have a regional university are going to say when these jobs are lost in regional Australia. All of this—and so much more—is at stake if this bill becomes law.
Finally, I want to note that, outside the Liberal Party and Liberal students, there is no support for this bill. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee said about this legislation:
The AVCC calls on the Government to abandon its intended restrictions on student services fees and arrangements for membership of student organisations.
This unequivocal opposition from vice-chancellors is matched by opposition from university staff, students and the community. The Liberal Party are on their own in supporting this policy. They are on their own in pushing what can only be described as an ideological barrow, and I trust they will be on their own when the vote on this bill is finally taken in the Senate.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003. I cannot think of any other instance in Australia where third-line forcing operates to force a group of people to compulsorily pay a fee to be a member of an organisation. So, from a national policy perspective, why should university students be different from everyone else in the country? Why should university students not be able to choose whether or not they want to be a member of a student association? The Liberal government has been very much about choice, and it has been very successful in a wide range of fields of endeavour. It believes that university students should also be able to choose whether or not they want to be a member of a student union. 
The government does not believe that there should not be student unions. The member for Jagajaga seemed to be indicating that that was our view, but no-one is suggesting for one moment that there should not be a student union to fiercely articulate whatever the issues are—whether that be from a left wing or a right wing perspective. That is healthy. What the government does argue is that those students who do not want to be a member of a student union should not be forced to be a member of a student union. It is the compulsory nature of joining the union that the government objects to.
The member for Jagajaga said that universities had gone significantly backwards under the Howard government. I represent James Cook University in North Queensland. This university has powered ahead. In 1996, James Cook University was a basket case on the brink of failing. There have been several very significant issues on which I have been able to deliver that have seen James Cook University power ahead. We have also seen that James Cook is now one of the top 500 universities in the world and one of the top 13 universities in Australia. Amongst tropical universities, James Cook University ranks in the top dozen or so in the world. In that group, it ranks first for the number of citations per paper and third for the number of publications in nature and science.
James Cook University is a university on the move. It is a university that is doing very well and it is doing so under the Howard government's policies on higher education. For that reason, I can see future opportunities for James Cook University. It is the natural site for the development of a concentration of tropical science, and innovation, expertise and capacity. We can see James Cook University becoming the most significant tropical university in the world in relation to tropical science, research and innovation. JCU has certainly positioned itself well over the last few years to achieve this. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that just two years ago Australia's Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham, referred specifically to the distributed strength of the Townsville region in tropical science, particularly marine science, and recommended the establishment of a supercentre. That is what I am talking about in the parliament this morning.
In his speech to the National Press Club earlier this year, Dr Brendan Nelson, the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, gave impetus to another wave that JCU is well positioned to ride given our championing of the benefits of co-location. I can see a supercentre with the students and the postdocs at JCU that embodies the CSIRO, BSES, SRI, DPI&F, with a veterinary science degree and a tropical agriculture degree aimed at JCU. It is a very significant opportunity indeed. The CSIRO currently has the Davies Laboratory in Townsville, but I would like to see that move into the supercentre at James Cook because that will allow the CSIRO to increase the effectiveness and impact of its R&D investments in North Queensland by creating growing partnerships with other research providers and users. Like JCU, the CSIRO believes that greater impact will be achieved and greater returns on investments will occur if greater synergies can be created among the researchers and research users of the north.
Dr Steve Morton, the executive chair of CSIRO Environment and Natural Resources, says that, for several years now, the CSIRO and JCU have been looking at the possibility of locating the Davies Laboratory on the JCU campus so that we all get the potential benefits of co-location. I very much support that and would very much like to see the Davies Laboratory moved to the supercentre in Townsville. I know that the CSIRO is fully committed to the achievement of this vision, subject only to winning the case for external funds, and I believe that we are a fair way down that track. The CSIRO's Chief Executive, Geoff Garrett, said in an ABC interview earlier this year that the number of staff numbers based in Townsville's Davies Laboratory is expected to grow under a partnership with James Cook University. That could only be very good for our region, for our university and for science in the north. I know that there has been some very significant discussion in Townsville about the possibility of a new veterinary science school. I very much support that as it is part of the wider vision of the tropical science, research and innovation precinct. There are a number of reasons for a vet science school and they have certainly all been articulated. I will come back to that in a moment, if I may. 
I would like to address something else that the member for Jagajaga raised in her contribution this morning. She talked about the level of political control over universities and how the Howard government had tried to increase that political control. I refer the member for Jagajaga to the fact that universities operate under state acts and that councils of universities are appointed by state governments. Of course, that results in a level of political control in universities that is beyond the capacity of the federal government to have any influence on. It seems rather odd that the federal government contributes all of the money that runs universities but the state governments have all of the control. To add insult to that, state governments take their cut back from the universities through payroll tax contributions.
At the university I represent—that is, James Cook University—the state government currently takes $4 million in payroll tax out of that university and puts it into its coffers. How odd is it that the federal government puts all of the money into James Cook University and then the state government immediately says, `We'll have $4 million of that, thank you very much'? That is unfair.
Higher education funding is not meant to pay payroll tax to a state government. It should cease. Alternatively, if the state governments were fair dinkum, in the interests of consistency they would take the $4 million and then immediately put it back into capital infrastructure or something like that at the university so that the money that is given by the federal government for the purposes of higher education is used for the purposes of higher education. There is no doubt that that should happen. I call on the state government to relinquish its control in relation to universities and to allow councils to be more properly elected on the basis of who funds the universities.
In relation to compulsory student union fees, nothing has really changed in all of this over the years. The federal government has been a very strong supporter of the notion that there should be choice in relation to whether student union fees are paid. I can tell you that students do not want to pay. I move very widely on the campus of James Cook. I am always out there. I know, as probably every other member of this House does, that 95 per cent of students at university campuses are not interested in what happens in student unions. They have no interest at all. They are busy going about their daily lives, seeking to get their degrees and working very hard. They really have no interest in student unions, and they do not have any intention to use, and do not use, the facilities of student unions. They do not want to pay. They tell me that all the time. Every year, when university enrolment procedures come up, I get calls to my office saying: `Why do I have to pay this compulsory fee? I don't want to pay it. It doesn't give me anything. There is no value for it,' and there is not. The member for Jagajaga says, `Student unions provide sporting facilities, recreation facilities, refectory facilities and so on.' Yes, they do, but they can be provided on a cost recovery basis for those who want to use those particular facilities. They do not have to be compulsorily paid for. 
We have all heard the horror stories of how some student unions use their funds for direct political campaigning. It is unfair that students should be forced to pay money to contribute to a political campaign that they do not believe in. It is unfair. The parliament of Australia should not require students who have no interest in a student union to pay money to be used for campaigns of a political nature. If people want to be involved in that, they can of their own volition join a student union, but they should not be made to compulsorily join a student union. They should be able to make a choice. The reason that the Australian Labor Party is so dead against this is that the dollars that are collected are used in the interests of the Australian Labor Party. It is true that the money may not go directly as a donation to the Australian Labor Party but, by and large, across the country these funds are used in the interests of the Australian Labor Party. Fortunately, at my university we have had a student union of a right wing persuasion for most of the time. It was that student union that supported the government's notion that there should not be compulsory union fees, so it was entirely consistent with the position being put to the parliament this morning.
No--one is saying that there should not be student unions. We just say that there should be choice. I am very pleased to also be able to say that I understand why the AVCC is opposed to this particular legislation. The AVCC sees this as a way of collecting more dollars of a compulsory nature from students so that these funds can be used for the provision of facilities on university campuses that the management of the universities should be contributing. It is a very interesting situation when you look at why people are opposed to the government's bill and understand that it has nothing to do with whether students should have choice and everything to do with trying to preserve the status quo in the interests of those particular interest groups.
I now return to the James Cook University situation in relation to veterinary science. Particularly given the factors of climate change, the prevalence of tropical diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, dengue and malaria in close neighbour countries to our north, the development of dangerous new diseases of both livestock and humans in our geographical region, and the economic importance of Australia's livestock industry, it is hard to exaggerate the importance of developing preventative measures, early detection measures and methods for the treatment and control of tropical diseases. We already have in Townsville the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and we now propose to establish a new program in veterinary science. That has my strong backing. This would fulfil all of the normal functions of a veterinary school but, in addition, it would provide a special focus on tropical animal husbandry and diseases and on zoonoses—that is, human diseases of animal origin. This would mesh perfectly with the `healthy country' theme of the CSIRO research and with a considerable fraction of the work carried out by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries.
In relation to tropical agricultural science, the CSIRO and DPI&F research foci would also ideally complement the second of the two proposed new courses at JCU. With a major presence in both Cairns and Townsville, JCU is perfectly placed to play a part in the development of new tropical agricultures. With funds advanced through Queensland's Smart State initiative, the Australian Tropical Forest Institute will be established at JCU Cairns in 2005. It will concentrate on the commercial development, use and sustainable management of forestry resources, particularly photochemicals and fruits in the tropics. In Townsville we will establish an undergraduate program in tropical agricultural science that will provide training for Australian and overseas students and act as a focus for research in tropical agriculture, including of course sugar. 
Turning to sugar, an important component of the tropical science precinct initiative is designed to enhance one major sector of Queensland's R&D base supporting the sugar industry. JCU has a long history of research and development for the sugar industry and has engaged in discussions with the Sugar Research Institute, which is currently based in Mackay, for a number of years. In those discussions, the JCU has focused on increasing and enhancing our collaboration on the possibility of harnessing the resources of the two institutions to create a critical mass in joint research efforts. I strongly support the establishment of a supercentre of tropical science and innovation at James Cook University in Townsville.
Debate (on motion by Ms King) adjourned.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—I move:
That the amendments be considered forthwith.
—I point out to the member for Cunningham that, while I am not denying him the call, it would be unusual to speak on this motion, which is entirely a matter of timeliness. Opportunity to participate in the debate will follow the decision of the House to consider the amendments forthwith.
—I wish to speak before that, Mr Speaker.
—I apologise to the member for Cunningham and I recognise him.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-12,"—I would like to speak to the motion that the amendments be considered forthwith. I would suggest that these amendments not be considered forthwith, because it is not timely. These amendments have not been considered by the House. This House has not had the opportunity in any way to consider in any detail the US free trade agreement and its implications for Australia. Over the last couple of days we have seen those in the Senate discussing, in some detail, aspects of the free trade agreement and various issues concerned with it. They have highlighted that there are many concerns and that the amendments should not be considered forthwith, as is suggested by the current motion before the House.
There are many reasons why these amendments should not be considered forthwith. The bill was first introduced into this House relatively quickly; there was really no consideration given for detailed debate. This bill affects 10 different pieces of Australian legislation and its implications for the Australian people are considerable. So I think we in this House would all have to agree that not enough time has been given to consider the amendments. We have seen the Senate over the last couple of days considering these amendments in incredible detail. So I do not support the current motion that the amendments be considered forthwith. With what has happened in the Senate over the last couple of days, we have seen there are many outstanding issues with the US free trade agreement. This just shows the people of Australia that this House has not considered these amendments in detail. It is important that we have further time to consider the two amendments that are being brought before the House in this manner; they have only just passed through the Senate and the motion now before us that `the amendments be considered forthwith' does not give us any time at all to consider them in detail. 
Government member—We've had six months; where have you been?
—I notice the interjection that we have had six months to consider them. We have not had six months to consider them at all. These amendments have been passed through the Senate only in the last hour or so. This is not the way this parliament should act, rushing such important legislation through. We now have before us a motion that the amendments be considered forthwith. I oppose that motion on the basis that this is such an important bill; it is such an important issue that we are dealing with here. As I have said, the FTA affects 10 various pieces of legislation in this country. There is much concern in the community regarding the implications that changes to these pieces of legislation will have on ordinary Australians outside the scope of our dealings with the US in connection with the free trade agreement. As I said, it is important that in considering this motion we go back to what we are all here for—and we are all here to represent the people of Australia, to look in detail at the various elements of legislation brought before us.
As I have said here before, we cannot have government by rushing important bills through this House. We need time to consider, we need time to talk to our constituents, if we are going to best represent the people of Australia as we have been elected to do. So the current motion that the amendments be considered forthwith is not an appropriate motion at this time. We have not had time to consider the amendments, and we need to take into account all those issues that have been raised in the other place over the last two or three days. They have raised a lot of concerns as regards the implications of these amendments that we are now talking about considering. Through the whole process, with the passage of the legislation through the Senate, all the debate we have had from crossbenchers such as Senator Bob Brown, Senator Kerry Nettle, One Nation's Senator Len Harris and Senator Aden Ridgeway from the Australian Democrats has raised a lot of important issues about the US-Australia free trade agreement.
—They certainly have.
—`They certainly have,' the member for Calare said. And so we are here today—the crossbenchers, in this place and also in the other place—standing up for Australia, standing up for what ordinary Australians are thinking on this issue.
I do not accept at all that these amendments should be considered forthwith; I think we should be taking our time. There is no rush. I ask the Prime Minister: what is the rush? If this is such an important agreement, what is the rush? I know the Minister for Trade, who is at the table, said that he was hoping to have it all finalised by mid to late October. What is going to happen then? I suppose it is to do with the whole election hysteria going on at the moment. But that is not the issue; the issue is `considering these amendments forthwith'. I think we need to take our time with all the issues that are brought before this House, and this is just one example. We have before us very important legislation: the legislation associated with the US free trade agreement. As I said, it deals with 10 pieces of Australian legislation. Have we sat down and discussed those 10 pieces of legislation in any real detail? No, not at all. I think it is a disgrace that there are 10 significant pieces of legislation attached to this proposed US free trade agreement and we have not had the opportunity to discuss that in detail. As I said— 
—Order! The member for Gilmore! The member for Cunningham has the call. He has the right to be heard under standing order 55, as you should be well aware.
—I think it is totally appropriate that we be given time to consider these amendments. It is very important that we take our time to consider issues that are so significant to the people of Australia. If we are going to follow the processes of this House, I think they need to be followed to the nth degree and to the letter, and that is what we are all here for.
—Stop repeating yourself and sit down.
—Rushing through such a significant bill is not in the country's best interest. I look forward to speaking to these amendments should this motion be supported, but at this point in time I am just raising with the House the issue of considering these amendments. I think it is totally inappropriate that we have been called back here on Friday, a non-sitting day, for no good reason. The government should have taken the opportunity to let the Senate deal with this issue, as they have done over the last couple of days. They only finished at 10 o'clock this morning. We should have had the opportunity to go away for two weeks and consider a lot of the issues raised in the Senate by some of the speakers I mentioned previously. They raised a lot of issues so that we could take on board those concerns.
I spoke about the US free trade agreement on the radio this morning, and I was informed that there has been a lot of comment and public concern on this issue, not just from areas such as the urban electorate of Cunningham but from electorates out in the country and all throughout Australia. This is an issue of extreme concern to the Australian people. We have an election coming up, and I think there are going to be a lot of people considering what the government has done with regard to this issue.
I do not think we should be considering these amendments forthwith—and that is what I am speaking to at the moment rather than going into all those things that are wrong with the free trade agreement. I could easily talk about that, but I will not do so at this point because we have to make sure we stay relevant to the motion, and the motion is that the amendments be considered forthwith. There is no point in rushing through these elements—and I will keep repeating that because I think that is the whole point: this is being rushed through.
The opposition is totally supportive of the government on this motion. I do not think that is in the best interests of this nation. I have been in this House for almost two years now, and I have seen a number of bills rushed through. We have not had the opportunity to discuss a lot of these issues in much detail at all. I do not think it is appropriate that haste be taken on any of these bills, whether it is the US free trade agreement bill or any other bill. The government introduces bills without due consideration being given for members of this place to have the opportunity to consider the bills in detail and really speak to their constituents to see whether they are in the best interests of this nation. And obviously there are concerns with this specific bill. So I speak in opposition to the motion that the amendments be considered forthwith, and I hope I have the opportunity later on to expand on some of the views as to why we should not be considering these amendments at this point in time. ",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—I would also like to speak to the motion that the amendments be considered forthwith and reinforce some of the comments that the member for Cunningham has made. I think the uncertainty that has been created overnight in the United States about the acceptance or otherwise of not only the amendments that were proposed in the Senate but also the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 itself is good reason for this House to approach this issue in a much more considered fashion rather than coming in here, having five minutes each and then walking out.
It is not good enough for the Minister for Trade to say that this legislation was considered sufficiently when it was introduced into this chamber a couple of months ago. It is not good enough to say that, because since then there has been a report handed down by the Senate and we have had a whole range of information, and research has been done in the intervening time. We have had four days of debate in the Senate that have indicated to me—and I had an open mind as to whether I was going to support this or not—that this arrangement is not good enough for the people of Australia. It is not good enough for the farmers of Australia and it is not good enough in terms of the safeguards for medicines and the PBS into the future.
The comments that were made in America last night about the amendments seem to say that the Americans can back out of this if they like. There are so many holes in this legislation that it allows the Americans in particular to weasel out of some of the provisions that the minister, in good faith—I have high regard for the minister—believes will be safeguarded. I think this legislation does need the full consideration of this House, and the House needs to do that in a deliberate fashion, not just rush this legislation through the parliament. I make that point.
Some months ago I raised this issue with the Prime Minister and, because there were concerns about the net effect of the free trade agreement on various industry groups and the populace of Australia, I asked him whether he would consider getting the Productivity Commission—really the only independent body in terms of economic assessment—to review this particular piece of legislation. He has not done that. In the intervening time we have seen a number of research documents produced. The one that came out of the Senate process and the deliberations of the Senate suggested that Australia was going to be $53 million better off under this process—all those unknowns that are in this legislation, in these documents, and we end up with a plus of $53 million! That is about half what the government has spent on advertising in recent months.
—The member for New England should appreciate the need to link his remarks to the motion that the amendments be considered forthwith.
—As I said, this arrangement is not good enough. I hark back to comments that the Leader of The Nationals made last year: `It would be un-Australian if sugar were not included.' Well, sugar is not included.
—The member for New England must link this to the timeliness. There will be lots of opportunities to discuss the amendments. The motion is about the timeliness of considering them immediately. 
—It is very obvious, given the occurrences overnight, given the debate that has come out of the Senate and the uncertainties that are there and given this deal that has been done between the opposition and the government, that the Australian people—and you have only got to listen to what is happening on radio at the moment—want this issue investigated properly. They want their elected members, this House, to consider this bill in full and to do so with the additional information that has come out of the Senate process—not to come into the House and all expect to be out of here in an hour. This is far too important to this nation for this legislation to be rushed through. I suggest that the minister allow the debate to take place.
Another issue to come up in recent days is that presidential candidate John Kerry has said that he will reconsider all free trade agreements, and there is a reasonable chance of him winning that election. So why are we rushing this one, particularly given the holes that have been put in it by the debate that has taken place in the Senate? I congratulate the crossbench in the Senate; I think they have put in an amazing effort to properly scrutinise this legislation. It is to the shame of this chamber that we are not going to scrutinise this legislation. At some time the government will use its numbers—and probably be supported by the opposition, to their shame—and push this legislation through.
The cousin of the Leader of The Nationals, Rob Anderson, Senior Vice-President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, and a man for whom I have much regard, summed up this arrangement very succinctly, I think, when he said, `There's not much in it, but it's better than nothing.' I happen to think Australia is a little bit more important than `not much in it—better than nothing.' I think that is a dreadful attitude for this House to be expressing. We get $53 million and that is the best thing that this government has done in its term; the Leader of the House, Tony Abbott, suggested that on television the other day—the best thing that it has done. I think we deserve better and I am asking this chamber to allow sufficient time for all the issues in this document to be debated.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—The amendment before the House, as I understand it, is the amendment concerning pharmaceuticals. The House will recall that on many occasions I was very vociferous about Glivec and its costs—
—The member for Kennedy must understand that the motion before the House right now is that the amendments concerning the free trade agreement be considered forthwith. What I need from him is reference to that.
—I understand, Mr Speaker. I take the point that you are making and accept it. I will give reasons why these should not be considered forthwith. We had interjections from the other side saying, `You've had six months on this,' or `You've had eight months.' We have not had six or eight months on the amendments that are now before the House, and this is a highly complex issue. The formula, as I understand it—and this is the best information I can get—is that, firstly, the matter will be considered by a body that is acceptable to the United States and that, secondly, the body will consider what is an adequate rate of return on invested capital for the drug in question.
Who would be qualified to provide what the cost of developing a drug is? I use the example of Glivec, which undoubtedly is a life-saving drug. For the sake of the House, it costs $50,000 a year per patient. The Treasurer mentioned it twice in his budget speech. It is a very important issue. How many life-saving drugs are out there priced at $50,000 a year and how many of those drugs can Australia afford? This little tablet costs $50,000? But I am quite sure that when we get the submission from the pharmaceutical company it will prove conclusively that an adequate return requires $50,000 a year. We had a phone call concerning the drug called Concerta. The cost of that drug has increased by $60 to total $294 per two-month period, and that drug will not go on the freebie list because apparently Concerta is significantly cheaper in other countries. 
So there is no mechanism being put in place here by the ALP amendments—on the face of and as I understand it—that overcomes these problems. And I am being very specific in the cases of Glivec and Concerta. The government and the opposition are saying this should be considered forthwith but what we are saying is, `Hey, here are specific examples that we have no answers on.' Anyone who thinks that we are going to get an answer on this in this place in a short period of time would believe in the tooth fairy!
I am not going to talk about the huge cattle meeting in Roma that rejected the free trade proposal by 1,500 to 20. I am not going to talk about the sugar industry, which was left out of what is called a free trade deal. The important point here is that the United States has said and the Prime Minister of Australia has said—twice—that the United States may not accept the changes that we want to make, yet here we are rushing forward. Surely the government side of the House would not want to jeopardise this agreement. Surely the other side of the House, who are obviously in favour of the free trade deal, would not like to jeopardise this agreement.
We do not know what the reaction of the Americans will be. Surely this matter should be discussed with the Americans before this place makes a decision that could be irreversible. I do not know whether anyone has noticed it but there is an election on in the United States. It may well be that the other candidate in the United States election, Mr Kerry, will have a look at this and say, `No, we're not going to accept this.' But this place has rushed in, without any consideration as to what the American reaction will be. And that is not me saying that; that is the Prime Minister saying that.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1

That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Calare moving forthwith:
That the House, acknowledging that the narrow scope of debate available at this stage is unsatisfactory:
(a)	Recognises that the House of Representatives is not being given the opportunity to consider matters highlighted in evidence to the Senate Inquiry on this legislation, specifically:
(i)	concerns regarding the delayed access of key Australian agricultural exports to the US market;
(ii)	serious reservations about the impact of US intellectual property rights on the Australian economy and the lack of fair use clauses in the agreement;
(iii)	concerns about the lack of consideration of economic impacts of exotic diseases on domestic industries in Chapter 7 dealing with Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures;
(iv)	the lack of monitoring of price impacts on our domestic markets;
(v)	the impact on Australian manufacturing;
(vi)	the unequal application of country of origin rules in the agreement;
(vii)	the inadequacy of amendments agreed to by the government and Labor Party in relation to pharmaceuticals and Australian media content; 
(viii)	the potential undesirable consequences for regional development policy; and
(ix)	the lack of protection of the Australian national interest in this agreement;
and
(b)	Recognises that further negotiation is required to further improve the Free Trade Agreement in Australia's interest, particularly in light of potential US reluctance to accept the amendments made by our parliament in relation to media content and the PBS.
Here we have the Clayton's free trade deal: the deal stitched up by the Labor opposition and the government so that they can both try and claim the high moral ground in the approaching election—
Mr VAILE (Lyne—Minister for Trade) (11.50 a.m.)—I move:
That the question be now put.
A division having been called and the bells having been rung—
—As there are fewer than five members on the side for the noes, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative in accordance with standing order 204. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.
Question agreed to. Mr Andren, Mr Katter, Mr Organ and Mr Windsor voting no.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The debate that is about to start in the House of Representatives on these amendments is the culmination of quite a few years of hard work not only by me as Australia's Minister for Trade but by a team of officials, both here in Canberra and in Washington, who did some very significant work in negotiating what is undoubtedly an historic agreement as far as Australia is concerned. Certainly, as far as the government is concerned, this is a great day for Australia in terms of the benefits that can accrue to our economy for decades to come from this historic agreement. We have maintained from the outset the significance of the deal in terms of the economic benefit across the economy: a $6 billion boost to the economy each and every year after the FTA has been in operation for 10 years, and the generation of 30,000 new jobs. These are jobs in export industries, which research has indicated are worth on average $17,000 a year more to employees than ordinary jobs in the economy. Jobs in export industries are usually more secure than other jobs.
We see an almost $3 billion benefit to Australia's beef industry, leading to an open market arrangement into the United States, the largest market for beef in the world. We see a $1.6 billion boost to Australia's dairy industry. The representatives of Queensland's dairy farmers have said this week that that is worth between $2,000 and $3,000 per Australian dairy farm per year. We will see the tariffs that currently exist on $280 million worth of lamb—a market that Australia alone has developed in the United States—removed from the beginning of next year. We will see the 25 per cent tariffs that are currently applied to Australian utes and special utility vehicles removed as of day one, once this agreement is implemented. We will see access in the United States to the $200 billion government procurement market at a federal level, plus the $200 billion state government procurement market. 
From the outset, the government have maintained our position very firmly that the negotiated outcome in this agreement has protected the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from any attack in terms of pricing or listing. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, once this agreement was negotiated, remained secure for all Australians. Drug prices for all Australians were not going to rise as a result of the negotiated outcome of this agreement.
In the audiovisual sector, we secured the local content rules, so in this agreement they are bound, as they were, at 55 per cent local content for drama on free-to-air television and 80 per cent local content for advertisements on television.
In the area of quarantine, which is all important in the Australian environment, we agreed to maintain the soundly and scientifically based quarantine system we have in this country. It has served us so well over many years, and it continues exactly as it is, to ensure that our environment in Australia does not get subjected to the incursion of exotic pests and diseases.
I go to the amendments that have been moved in the Senate and that we are debating here now. There are a number of amendments that fundamentally go to two issues. One is the audiovisual sector. In this agreement, we have bound the level of local content. The amendments fundamentally put a floor in that so that, if any future government wants to weaken it, it must be brought back to the parliament.
The other issue is the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—or, more importantly, the relationship between patented drugs, the protection of intellectual property and generic drugs. The government has argued that the related amendments are unnecessary and too heavy handed, but in the interests of getting this agreement through the parliament during this sitting week we have agreed to the opposition amendments that were moved in the Senate and are the subject of this debate here in the House. For all the reasons that I outlined in terms of the benefit to the Australian economy and future generations of Australians, I commend to the House the bill and these amendments from the Senate.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—These amendments are a win for the Australian people, and they are also a win for parliamentary democracy. These are the amendments that the government never wanted to see. These are the amendments that the government said they would never consider, let alone support. What they do is validate the approach that the Australian Labor Party have taken to this trade agreement. We wanted to get this right for the Australian people, so we embarked upon a Senate process that gave detailed and thorough consideration to all aspects of the trade agreement and the enabling legislation. We said that we would fight and fight for improvements to the enabling legislation, and today I can report that that objective has been achieved in two key areas.
That objective has been achieved in two key areas—two dividends for the benefit of the Australian people. If it had been left to the Howard government, we would not have now before the parliament amendments to enshrine in the laws of the parliament the local content rules protecting our Australian cultural content. We would not have safeguards in place to ensure that in the future we have Australian faces on Australian television and Australian voices on Australian radio. If it had been left to the Howard government, with its approach of rushing in and rubber-stamping whatever is put on the table, we would not have amendments before the parliament protecting our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
This is a government that was willing to take the risk of evergreening practices in Australia. This is a government that was willing to rush in and rubber-stamp the enabling legislation and leave the Australian people exposed to the possibility of evergreening. This is a government that was willing to take the risk of delays for affordable generic medicines coming onto the market. The Australian Labor Party said that we would not take that risk. We would not expose the Australian people to any delays for affordable medicines coming onto the market; the risk was not worth it. Even though the Prime Minister was saying that he would not even consider amendments to prevent evergreening and to have effective penalties and deterrents in place, the Labor Party put them forward. They were good at law, they were consistent with the text of the FTA and now they give that guarantee to consumers right around the country. We do not want to take any risk with the entry of affordable medicines onto the Australian market.
The government would not have had these amendments before the parliament. They would not have had the penalties, and they would not have had the deterrents in place. They would not have been doing things to safeguard affordable medicines in this country. All we have from the Prime Minister is a pathetic attempt to try to muddy the fact that he has had to backflip, that he has had to concede the correctness of Labor's approach, that he has had to order his government members to vote for Labor's amendments here in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister is engaged in a pathetic attempt to muddy the situation.
If it is true that he has legal advice that the amendments are outside the text of the FTA, why are all these government members here today going to vote for Labor's amendments? If the Prime Minister has that legal advice, why are they all in here, under instruction, to vote for Labor's amendments? Why are they all here voting for the Labor amendment that the Prime Minister said he would not even consider?
—Member for Hunter! Member for Paterson!
—If it is true that the Prime Minister thinks there is a difference between the spirit and atmospherics of the agreement and the text—that there is some big gap, that something was said and something was put on the negotiating table that reflects a difference between the spirit and atmospherics of the FTA and the actual text—again, why are they all in here, these Liberal and National Party members, voting for Labor's amendments? Their presence in the House today exposes the Prime Minister's fraud. It exposes the way in which the Prime Minister tried to muddy the situation to cover himself politically. He is a Prime Minister who is always doing things for political purposes, not for the national interest.
—If the member for Hunter and the member for Paterson want to be removed from the chamber at the vote, they will continue to behave as they are behaving.
—Of course, another thing is left exposed on the government side in this debate, and that is the way in which the government always talk about risks. They talk about risks for the coming campaign, but the Australian people see in the Labor Party the most effective set of legislators from opposition in the history of the parliament. First it was the reform of parliamentary superannuation that they never wanted to do. Then it was the abolition of ATSIC. Then it was the baby-care payment. Then it was the pneumococcal vaccine. Then it was the child-care changes. Then it was the agenda for childhood obesity. And today it is Labor's amendments protecting cultural content and protecting affordable medicines coming onto the Australian market. I put to the parliament and I put to the people: if we can achieve all these things from opposition, imagine how effective we will be in government. Imagine how much we will get done for the Australian people when we are in government. There is no risk in that. That is the way in which we can get more good things done for the Australian people. We are here today with the dividends for the Australian people on cultural content and affordable medicines. There is no risk in that. We will be getting more done for the Australian people in the future: this is just the beginning.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—Pharmaceuticals and local content are but two items in a 1,000-page trade document over which parliament has no control. The doubts expressed by US trade representatives overnight about these specific amendments, particularly that relating to pharmaceuticals, are reason enough for this parliament to delay any debate on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and to reconsider the raft of issues that have not been included in this legislation. These amendments leave a huge question mark over the pharmaceutical issue alone. One must ask: why the rush? Who is in charge here? Is it John Howard, Mark Latham or indeed Bob Zoellick? Where are the amendments moved by the minor parties in the Senate to preserve Australia's national interest? Where is the amendment to the Quarantine Act so that the interests of other nations are not taken into account when making determinations under the risk assessment process? What do we have to gain?
The Minister for Trade talks of tens of millions of dollars of gains in the first few years for agriculture alone and says our drug prices are safe. Dr Philipa Dee, who is a member of the Productivity Commission, which this government refused to consult, has made the most comprehensive of any assessment I have seen on this deal. She sees annual gains of just $58 million for the Australian economy. Let me quote briefly from Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald this week. Gittins says our Prime Minister insisted that a bad deal be accepted after President Bush rejected his overtures for a better outcome, particularly on agriculture. Why did he do this? According to Gittins it was:
Because of the loss of face the Man of Steel would suffer when it became known his mateship with Dubya counted for so little.
Because he had to show something good had come from our participation in the Iraq war.
I fully agree with Gittins that the nation's economists have by and large been derelict in their duty, while political commentators have become instant trade experts at best or have mouthed the wishes of their masters, particularly the Murdoch press. As Gittins argues, last week's Senate report should have formed the basis of a decent public debate. It should have been the beginning and not the end of the debate.
The Labor Party has buckled, as it did under the `Tampa-ing' of the truth prior to the 2001 election. It has picked out chemist bills and the media as two areas likely to score political points and has conveniently ignored the rest. There was an invitation from across the table for a continuation of this debate, with the Independents carrying it to whenever. We are not going to accept that challenge. But I issue a challenge: were we to have that debate, where would those on both sides stand who have, behind the safety of their party room doors, opposed elements of this trade deal, if not all of it? Where is the real debate on this issue? What has happened to some of the sentiments expressed in the second reading debate, on the non-government side particularly, before we had access to the Senate report—which, incidentally, included that Philipa Dee assessment? We did not have access to that at the time of the second reading debate. It was rushed through this House. This is the House of Representatives—not the Senate, to which we defer so much of the nitty-gritty of legislating. This is where the amendments should have been moved. This is where they should have been debated. Again we have executive government stamping its authority on the people's house, determining where the economic future of this country lies and handing over massive amounts of our sovereignty to a massive trading partner that enjoys benefits of scale that we can only dream of. 
I point all members to some of the contributions made by the minor parties in the Senate debate, particularly those by Senator Aden Ridgeway and Senator Len Harris, who, in his summing up of this, alluded to some of the trade zones near the Mexican border, where outrageous industrial relations practices are employed. Unfortunately, that labour is going to produce many of the goods that are going to arrive on these shores and further bite into the profitability—indeed, the very existence—of manufacturing in this country. My own orchardists are fearful of the ramifications of the quite likely potential impact on our quarantine standards, particularly relating to fire blight.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—Seeing that we are going to continue debate on the amendments, I thought we should maintain some balance on the facts of the free trade agreement and the amendments that have been proposed and sent down from the Senate. Over the last two weeks, the government has engaged in dialogue with the opposition on the proposed amendments and the concerns that have been raised. During the course of that discussion, we suggested some minor alterations that in our view would have made those amendments a little more consistent with the Vienna convention, under which, as the Prime Minister outlined quite clearly yesterday, after signing a treaty governments have a responsibility to ensure that enabling legislation reflects and does not undermine the objects of the treaty.
We believe we had done that, but we also believe there was a way of improving the amendments the opposition had moved, particularly with regard to the issue of patented drugs versus generic drugs. From the outset, we have maintained very clearly that, during the course of the negotiations, we maintained a very strong line, and we secured an agreement that fully protected the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The fact is that in the enabling legislation no amendments and no changes were needed to the PBS legislation—none. There was agreement in the overall FTA that Australia would provide independent review of applications that were unsuccessful through the PBAC. We have made public the structure of that and how it is going to be done in a totally transparent way. But the PBS legislation, the law that underpins our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, is not going to be changed in any shape or form.
In terms of access for generic drugs coming onto the market in Australia and the development of generic drugs—and this is what this debate is fundamentally all about; the ongoing sustainability and affordability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—one of the negotiating points was with regard to the protection of the data that underpins the molecular structure, and that is the intellectual property of patented drugs. In Australia that is protected for five years. In America it is protected for eight years, and that extra three years keeps generics off the market for that extra time. In Australia generics can come onto the market three years sooner on that basis. We held the line very firmly on that and it was a key point that we ensured was there, because the government does value the significance of the research and development that goes into and the capacity of the generic drug industry in Australia. 
When the negotiations were concluded and we signed off on the agreement, there were positive comments from the generic drug industry in Australia that they had been fully protected, that the PBS was safe, that it had not been undermined and that generic drugs would be able to come onto the market in a timely manner. That is the subject of the opposition's amendments to the enabling legislation. We have maintained all along that they are unnecessary. The Leader of the Opposition made the point that all the government members are in here voting for the bill that has been amended in this way. Of course we are, because we want the whole agreement to go through. We want the whole deal to go ahead because of the billions of dollars worth of benefit to the entire economy in Australia and the jobs that will be generated for decades to come. That is what government is about. Government is about taking tough decisions and showing leadership. The broader community in Australia expects government to achieve things and do things, and therefore we have got to be prepared to negotiate and compromise. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, we knew at the outset that ultimately it would require a positive vote of the Labor Party in the Senate to get this agreement through. We knew that we did not have the numbers in the Senate and so we had to engage the Labor Party on those issues and those concerns. We hold our point of view that the changes were unnecessary. We have accepted them in the national interest because we want this deal to go ahead.

"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—One hundred and three years ago, the first member for Kennedy entered this place and gave his first speech, and he talked about the White Australia Policy. He was not a racist, not even remotely a racist, but what he did not want was people in Australia working for coolie wages. That is why he was elected to this place. Many of the other Labor members in those days were elected to this place for the same reasons. If ever you have watched a betrayal, Mr Acting Speaker, it is the gutlessness of the ALP in this place in this debate. They will have to live with their consciences.
The other thing that leapt to my mind about pharmaceuticals and the agreement's bigger ramifications is a famous cartoon of Mr Keating when it had been proved that his free market policies had failed miserably. Of course, the years have proved that they failed even more miserably under this government. The cartoon shows Mr Keating reading the Japanese economy book. He is saying, `It works in practice but it'll never work in theory.' Not that the major parties would ever take any notice of the average Australian, because he is a fool. They do not know all these sophisticated arguments; they just know they are losing their jobs, the poor stupid people.
—Rubbish, Bob.
—I will read it out to you, my friend, because you might be in one of the marginal seats polled. I asked the library for the latest polling. Forty-eight per cent of the Australian people oppose the free trade agreement and 41 per cent support it. Sixty-five per cent agree that Australia could have done better in negotiating the free trade agreement. Only nine per cent of voters believe that Australia will benefit most from the FTA, with 61 per cent saying that the US will benefit most. Sixty-one per cent of voters oppose Australia becoming more integrated with the American economy. Fifty-two per cent of voters believe that the Prime Minister is putting America's interests ahead of Australia's. So don't worry about what the voters or the people of Australia think—that has never worried you people before. 
I was staggered to find out—this is very relevant to the pharmaceutical issue—that the United States do not have any tariff protection in agriculture; it is less than two per cent. So they have very generously given up their two per cent. They have not given up their subsidies, which are 49 per cent. So we have done a deal that leaves them with a 45 per cent advantage in the marketplace—
Government members interjecting—
—Go and get the OECD figures and go and get the World Trade Organisation figures. I asked the library for the figures. If government members listened, they might know how stupid what they are saying is. I have been horse trading all of my life. I bought and sold cattle for a fair period of my life, and mining leases and areas. You don't do a deal that leaves your competitors 45 per cent better off in your own market here in Australia. We are excellent producers of pharmaceuticals and we are excellent producers of agricultural products, but we are not 45 per cent better than the Americans, not even in agriculture where we have a lot of advantages. And, if we are not, we are doomed. If the government says that they cannot keep their subsidies, there is no talk, I hope, about us losing the subsidy we have got at the present moment for sugar and for milk, temporary as it is. But if you stand up in this place, Mr Minister for Trade, and say that the subsidies in America are not staying, I am going to start getting worried that the sugar moneys and milk moneys that we have got are going to be taken away from us.
With pharmaceuticals we are talking about manufacturing. I was rung the other day by a person very high up in the meat-processing game. He said, `Do you know where the meat processing takes place in the United States?' I said, `Yes, Kansas City, Omaha and to a lesser extent Chicago, right in the middle of the continental United States.' He said, `No, old days.' I said, `Mexican border?'
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
—I would like to continue, Mr Acting Speaker.
—Order! Whilst I appreciate the temporary greatness that is thrust upon me, I am not technically the Acting Speaker. You may refer to me simply as the Deputy Speaker. The question is that the amendments be agreed to. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade is seeking the call. As is the precedent, the call goes to either side.
—I can get back up, Mr Deputy Speaker.

"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—What has been signed between our trade minister and this government and the United States is the world cup of trade. When the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, first went into this portfolio there was only the multilateral round. Australia, through three successive governments, has knocked on the door of that multilateral round. This minister decided to do bilateral agreements—Singapore, Thailand, the United States, now a trade and economic framework with China, looking at Malaysia, a trade and economic framework with Japan. 
I want to take the House for a moment back to 1957 and talk about then trade minister Black Jack McEwen, because at that time McEwen proposed something quite radical. He said at that time that he wanted to do a trade agreement with Japan. This was greeted with outrage. The Labor Party, in the House of Representatives, opposed any trade agreement with Japan. They spoke against it. Fortunately, the government of the day went ahead—and the rest, as we know, is history. Can you imagine Australia today if we did not have, as our largest customer, Japan—for beef, for a whole range of agricultural exports, for our coal exports? They are one of our biggest customers. Yet the Labor Party at the time opposed the trade agreement with Japan.
We will scroll forward now to 2004. Once again we have a trade minister—the best trade minister since Black Jack McEwen—who has said: `We're not going to keep knocking on the door of the multilateral round. We are actually going to try to get some benefits for Australia's efficient producers.' So, there have been trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand and the United States, and there is a purported free trade agreement being fast-tracked with China. But there are always those who live pre-1957 who say: `We mustn't do any trade agreements. Oh, dear, it'll disadvantage us.' The reality is that this is a nation of 20 million people. If we stay as a nation of 20 million people, the most efficient farmers in the world will have no markets. We have to make the arrangements that we can to give our farmers markets. Thank goodness we have a trade minister who is prepared to go out and leverage the world's respect for this government, and for the Prime Minister, to get good trade deals, not the sort of nonsense we saw the Labor Party do when they were in government, where they sold our farmers out. They allowed other countries to keep their high level of protection, but not Australian farmers. That lies firmly at the feet of the Labor Party when they were in government.
In the time left to me I want to speak very briefly about the sort of market that we are going to be locked into. There has been an argument that Australia will be swamped by exports from the United States. We are a nation of 20 million people. We can only buy what 20 million people can consume. But we are locking into a market that has 300 million absolutely dedicated consumers. We will have opportunities to sell agricultural products, minerals, a whole range of processed materials. Also, for the first time, we will have access to the $200 billion a year United States federal procurement program. As I have said, we will have access to a population of 300 million dedicated consumers, a GDP of $11 trillion a year—the world's largest importer, the world's largest investor, the world's largest purchaser of goods and services. I reckon that is a pretty good deal. Whether you consider economists who say the free trade agreement is worth $6 billion a year or economists who say it is worth $1.6 billion, the reality is that, like the deal with Japan, it will grow. The ramifications of this will spread out through the whole of the Australian economy. It is very easy when you have never done any deals to sit back and say, as they did in 1957: `Oh, dear, we can't go ahead with this. Let's just stay as little old Australia.' Thank God Black Jack McEwen had the courage to do it. Mark Vaile has the courage to do it, and Australia will be much better off right across the nation.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—With all due respect to the previous speaker, the member for Dawson, Anthony and McEwen were the architects of trade deals all right, but they were trade deals which benefited this country over the people they were dealing with. They did not do a deal that left us at a 45 per cent disadvantage in the marketplace. I refer specifically to wool and to the international sugar agreement. I have got on my wall a picture of John McEwen with his three statements, which he gave to me when I was around 19 years of age, giving the reasons for tariffs. We now have a proposition that somehow he was the proponent of abolishing tariffs! With all due respect to my worthy colleague, this takes a considerable leap through space. She can come up and view the picture on my wall with John McEwen's three statements on trade. But you can read that in any book on McEwen, of course. There is a difference between free trading and aggressive trading. I would like to think that in most of the trades I have done in my lifetime I have been pretty damned aggressive. We have come out on top. There is no-one in this country who believes we have come out on top with this agreement. Have a look at the figures. Nobody believes it. I most certainly do not. 
I go back to previous comments about the White Australia Policy. It was about cheap labour destroying the working man's income in this country. That is why the Labor Party was founded. That is why Labor members came into this place in the first place. That is also the reason why the Country Party was founded—to deliver a single desk seller arrangement in wheat, which I think this agreement undermines. I go back to talk about the man who asked me about meat processing in the United States. I said, `It is in Kansas City, Omaha and, to a lesser extent, Chicago—right in the centre of continental United States.' He said, `No, that was in the old days.' I said, `Don't tell me: they have all moved to the Mexican border.' He said: `Yes. Wetback labour runs the meat processing there.' You see the recurring phenomenon that we are up against here.
You cannot seriously put forward the proposition that manufacturing in Australia—for example, our motor vehicle industry—is going to stay alive against plants that are set up to supply a market, under NAFTA, of 400 million people. Our plants are set up to supply markets of 20 million people. Someone said, `We'll sell utilities over there.' No sooner was that said than the United States immediately started making noises to the effect that that will not be acceptable. Their companies—Ford or Holden; I cannot remember which—said, `No, we're not going to do that because that would disrupt the labour market producing our cars in the United States.' You can see how sovereignty is being undermined here.
As a long-serving senior minister in a government, I know the value of procurement contracts. People here, unless they have had a lot of ministerial experience, do not really understand the importance of procurement contracts in maintaining industries of strategic value to this country. One of the three things that McEwen said to me when I was a very young man was: `I'll never see my country placed in another war without the ability to build a main battle tank.' He was the munitions minister who could not even get a fighter plane built in Australia, and he knew the frustration of that.
To me there is no doubt—and they made no secret of this fact—that BHP are getting out of steel because there was no future for the steel industry in Australia. If the United States free trade deal did not get them, then the Chinese would—and this was the most efficient steel industry in the world. So probably in 10 years time we will have a country that not only cannot build a main battle tank but will be flat out building a rowboat. As I understand it, the Americans have preserved the Jones act. They are not giving up any rights to build ships or on procurement arrangements for shipping, yet one of the most valuable resources this government had was the procurement contracts for frigates and patrol boats, which obviously should be the basis of our defence mechanism in this country. 
I will jump back to the pharmaceuticals issue because that is probably one of the worst aspects of this bill. I could not help but burst out laughing when the Leader of the Opposition said, `We've made it safe for people consuming pharmaceuticals in this country so they will get their products for a reasonable price.' We argued before that there should be more time to discuss this. Basically, nobody has seen anything. All we can get is what is in the media, and the media are saying there will be a tribunal—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—I would like to address some of the concerns raised by other speakers. Somebody has raised the question of subsidies in the United States. One of the fundamentals of a free trade agreement is that access is negotiated. Subsidies and any other support mechanisms existing in the country are dealt with in the multilateral round. No free trade agreement has those negotiated. Whether it is with Thailand, Singapore, China or wherever, those issues are dealt with in a multilateral round.
The Minister for Trade has just had a very good outcome in the multilateral round, in the WTO draft panel report on sugar, in getting rid of some of the EU subsidies. Australia, with Thailand and Brazil, went to the WTO and took them over the inconsistent export subsidies for sugar. While the draft reports out of these meetings are always confidential and we are not allowed to discuss them, the reality is that the Brazilians are very pleased and so are our cane farmers. Let me tell you: they know which trade minister worked for them.
Three million tonnes of sugar out of the EU, which has an export subsidy through their domestic price support, is going to be challenged. Also, 1.6 million tonnes from Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific and India that goes through the EU is going to be prevented. There will be a final report, in mid-September this year, but that can only deal with the legal aspects of this draft report, not the fundamental finding. So in the EU, where for years Australia has knocked on the multilateral round door and been refused help for the most difficult commodity, the minister has had a victory. I come from an area that grows most of Australia's sugar, and I accept that sugar is one of the world's most corrupted markets. But the Minister for Trade took this matter to the WTO, which is where subsidies and all issues except quota and access are dealt with, and has had a stunning victory at last. Ross Walker from the Australian Cane Farmers Association said on AM only a week or so ago that it was a very significant step forward. It is the first time we have had a breakthrough on the subsidies that bedevil Australian sugar producers in the corrupt world market.
That is the answer to why FTAs do not deal with all of those other aspects; they are dealt with in a multilateral round. I want to deal now with what has actually come out of the FTA. I acknowledge that the quota for sugar was not increased. It is 87,000 tonnes and, to our great disappointment and regret and despite the efforts of the Minister for Trade, that was not increased. As a result, the Australian government has recognised the need for a domestic approach to assist sugarcane growers, and there is a $444 million package. It is not Gold Lotto, but it will give them some means to go forward to a more secure future. 
I want to talk about the FTA with the United States. Ninety-seven per cent of our exports to the United States will be duty free from day one. As I said in my previous address, the US federal procurement program, worth $200 billion a year, will for the first time be accessible to Australia. The 25 per cent tariff on light commercial vehicles, our little Aussie utes, goes to zero from day one. On passenger vehicles and auto parts, it goes to zero from day one. The Jones act, which imposes a 50 per cent tariff on ship repairs and maintenance, is being removed.
Sixty-six per cent of agricultural tariffs will go to zero from day one. Our beef quota, which is currently 378,000 tonnes—and we have only hit that quota twice—will be increased by 18.5 per cent over the next 18 years. Effectively, after that period, the quota will go to zero. Would we have liked a shorter period? Of course we would have, but this is better than what we had before and, as I said, our beef producers have only hit that quota twice. Lamb and sheep meat—and this is very dear to the hearts of people throughout western New South Wales and Queensland—goes to zero from day one. Dairy is increasing from $40 million a year by $55 million a year, so it is more than doubling for our dairy exporters. Mangoes, mandarins, strawberries, tomatoes, cut flowers, fresh macadamias—all of those horticultural products—go to zero from day one. For the first time, 4,000 tonnes of avocadoes, with quarantine applying, will go into the US.

"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-12,"—I rise to speak on these two amendments, which go to the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and also to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. As we are aware, one has to do with Australian cultural content in our media and the other is about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Australian Greens' position on these amendments and on other aspects of the US free trade agreement is quite clear and well known. Our points have been outlined in detail over the last couple of days by Senator Bob Brown and Senator Kerry Nettle in the other place. I do not need to go through all that here today. We have stated quite unambiguously that the Greens are opposed to the US free trade agreement because it is not in our national interest. There are too many negatives, and one negative is one negative too many. Other speakers in this debate have already highlighted some of the concerns out there about the impact it is going to have on this country over the coming years.
The amendments are part of the problem and part of the sell-out of the Australian people. There are questions about the amendments, especially about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I think the people of Australia have been getting a lot of mixed messages about the PBS from day one. We just heard the minister saying how the PBS is fully protected. I am getting information from various people saying that it is not fully protected. There are some doubts out there. In light of the recent increase in the cost of medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, in terms of the schedule of payments, of $4.90, there is a lot of concern out there in the community about the cost of medicines in this country and also about the way in which Medicare is being attacked. These amendments regarding the PBS are one area that is going to cause and is causing a lot of concern for the people of Australia. The threat that the US will be able to bring pressure to bear on this country via the free trade agreement and these amendments, resulting in an increase in the costs of medicines, is something that I know I and the people of Cunningham are very concerned about. 
Medicines are becoming expensive enough as it is, and we are already hearing stories of people forgoing medicines because they cannot afford them. I recently met with a lady who has to take 20 different prescriptions every day just to stay alive. Even though she is on the gold card, the pensioner card et cetera, the cost is still going to be substantial for people like her. This is an area of real concern. The whole FTA is a cop-out. Labor has sold out. The government has sold us out. I will not go into the real concerns we have about the loss of sovereignty through this free trade agreement and the fact that the US is now telling us what to do in so many areas. This is an agreement between executive governments; it is not an agreement between the parliaments, and that is the thing that is of real concern. As I said, some of these issues have been raised in the other place by the two Australian Greens senators and other members of the crossbench. It is a dud deal. Issues such as the environment FTA have not been addressed much at all in this place. Some of those amendments were put in the other place by the crossbenchers but we do not have the opportunity to put them to the government here and debate some of those amendments. That is a real shame. And the member for Calare has outlined the real problems with this place not being able to address some of those issues.
The Greens are opposed to the US free trade agreement. We are quite clear about that. We see it as a sell-out. It is not in our national interest, and there is ample evidence of that. There is a lot of concern out there. The community are increasingly concerned and, with the passage of this legislation through the House today, it is going to be quite clear to them who is on their side, as well as some of the real negative implications of the US free trade agreement for ordinary Australians.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—I am being very specific here in trying to bring home to the House—futile as that may be—the situation that will arise with pharmaceuticals should this free trade agreement legislation pass through the House. I had a lot to do with Glivec. I knew two people who were dying because they could not get Glivec. One had three months to live. It is a miracle drug that got international publicity and was mentioned by the Treasurer in the budget speech two or three times. It costs $50,000 per patient per year. We are talking about a little tablet here. There is no supergold or something from outer space put into it. The pharmaceuticals board of Australia knew that they were being taken to the cleaners and tried desperately to negotiate, which was very hard for them with people like me leaning on them saying: `I have people dying here. They cannot afford $50,000 a year.' This bloke told me that he was not going to put that cost on his family; he will just die.
There is a second drug, called Concerta. This is a very common drug for young people with ADHD. In the case that I am referring to, the school told the parents that they will not have the child in the school unless the child is taking this Concerta drug which modifies their behaviour. I rang up to find out what the figures were and they said it was $290 every two months. I said, `That's not right. That's $60 more than it was last time I got the figures.' They said, `It's gone up.' At the time, the makers of Concerta had not applied for the free list. They may have subsequently applied. I rang up our drug administration people—and they were not referring necessarily to the manufacturers of Concerta—and said, `Why haven't they applied to go on the free list?' The drug authorisation body appointed by the government said, `In a lot of cases they will not do it because they are charging a hell of a lot less overseas than they are here in Australia.' 
However, you have this powerful body that exists at the present moment that gets a terrific deal for us on drugs, but that powerful body will be watered down and made acceptable to the United States. Guess who is the greatest exporter of pharmaceuticals in the world? The United States. This is a multibillion dollar industry, but according to the wording that we have seen—and we have had no access to the actual wording—it will decide an acceptable return for invested capital and risk. This is what the media has said. Clearly the makers of Glivec and Concerta are going to provide those figures. I would like to know how an Australian tribunal would find out and decide whether those figures were reasonable or unreasonable—particularly a tribunal which had to be acceptable to the United States when it was appointed. I do not wish to be discourteous to any speakers in this place, but the previous speaker said that we were going to win in manufacturing areas like pharmaceuticals, motor cars and steel against a giant like the United States. That is a proposition that no--one in Australia would, or should, accept.
As far as getting up here and saying, `What the Americans have agreed to goes,' does it seriously matter what they have agreed to? They signed the WTO agreement to reduce agricultural support levels by 30 per cent. According to the OECD agricultural outlook report, they have increased them by one per cent. They completely ignored the agreement. According to their own media, three years or four years ago or whenever it was, thye President I think it was President Clinton—the doubled the assistance to primary industries in the United States. Certainly the OECD says that they have not reduced their levels by 30 per cent, as they agreed to do 20 years ago. They have actually increased their support levels. So what they agree to and what they do are two entirely different things. Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a book called The Great Unravelling. I do not like the theme of his book, but there are some very interesting pieces of information in it. He said:
America has absolutely no credibility or integrity in world trade after the decision massively increase the subsidies for the steel industry two years or so ago.
I agree with that. Even if we get agreements, does anyone seriously think this agreement is going to be kept when we have a giant on one side and tiny little us on the other— (Time expired)",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—I would like to place on record some of the concerns that I have in relation to the broader agreement. I am not going to oppose these amendments today. My concern is essentially about the agreement itself. I was interested to see the minister enter the debate a couple of speakers ago, and I thank him for that, because there are a number of questions that he may well be able to shed some light on, and I think a broader debate about all the information that we now have has gone through the Senate process would have encouraged a lot of those items to be teased out.
First, I want to refer to the motion to suspend standing orders that was moved by the member for Calare and defeated a moment ago. It recognised a number of matters, which I would like to place on the record, that indicate some of the areas where people in the broader community are very concerned about this arrangement. The first one is that there are:
... concerns regarding the delayed access of key Australian agricultural exports to the US market ...
Hopefully, the minister may be able to address some of these issues in his response. The second one is that there are: 
... serious reservations about the impact of US intellectual property rights on the Australian economy and the lack of fair use clauses in the agreement ...
The third one is that there are:
... concerns about the lack of consideration of economic impacts of exotic diseases on domestic industries in Chapter 7 dealing with Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures ...
There is great concern out there, not only in relation to the US trade agreement but also with respect to what may happen to the chicken industry in particular with the Thailand trade agreement. The fourth one is:
... the lack of monitoring of price impacts on our domestic markets ...
The fifth one is:
... the impact on Australian manufacturing ...
Obviously, that is fairly broad and I would not expect the minister to be able to address all of the issues that are there, but I think he would be well aware of many of the ones that came through the Senate debate. The sixth one is:
... the unequal application of country of origin rules in the agreement ...
I personally would very much like the minister to try and flesh out some of those points that have been raised by various experts, and talk about the unequal distribution between two economies that are similar in a sense but very different in terms of their size and the implications that that will have downstream. I pick up on some of the comments that the member for Kennedy made. The next three are:
(vii)	the inadequacy of amendments agreed to by the government and Labor Party in relation to pharmaceuticals and Australian media content;
(viii)	the potential undesirable consequences for regional development policy; and
(ix)	the lack of protection of the Australian national interest in this agreement ...
It is unfortunate that this agreement has been rushed to the extent that it has. I can understand why the Prime Minister in particular, and the government in general, has moved in this fashion. Obviously there were difficulties with the multilateral world trade arrangements that were spoken about a moment ago, and I guess it was felt that Australia's trade negotiations were not going brilliantly.
I can remember being on the Grains Council of Australia during the late eighties and early nineties; a lot of the things we were arguing for then we are still arguing for now in the multilateral rounds. It became very frustrating, to say the least, that the forward motion was not really going anywhere. Discussions were probably held, particularly in light of the Iraq situation, about the successful development of wedge politics arising from the difference in the Labor Party's relationship with the Americans and the coalition's relationship with the Americans. (Extension of time granted) I think all those factors coming together, particularly the various attitudes to the United States, presented the government with an opportunity to wedge the opposition. I think that is the most unfortunate part of this: it was really about politics rather than trade.
If ever I needed confirmation that this was a deal not well done—and, I say again, I have always had personal regard for the minister in the chair—I got it when I watched the minister come into the chamber some weeks ago now and make his speech, presenting this as a major breakthrough in world trade. The way he carried himself that day was a dead giveaway. I noted his lack of enthusiasm in articulating the various things that had happened. I know there are members of The Nationals and the Liberal Party who have made comments privately that they do not believe the arrangement is a particularly good one. But I think they felt it was a good opportunity to create another circumstance where they could paint a political picture against the opposition. 
The opposition, quite smartly in some ways, has moved to address that, obviously, by standing beside the coalition and not allowing a wedge to take place. That is all very interesting in terms of the run-up to the next election. But this is not just about one term of government and who the next Prime Minister will be; this is about the evolution of our trading relationships with not only, in this case, the United States but also with other countries—and it is also about the multilateral negotiations that are going on.
To date, people in here have raised a number of issues. For instance, the wheat industry has been raised; there is not much about that industry in this agreement with the United States.
—There's not much about sugar either.
—But people say, `Oh, that's being taken care of in the world trade negotiations, the multilateral negotiations'—and we all know that the single desk for wheat is at risk in that forum at the moment. But the wheat industry, quite conveniently, is out of this particular forum. The two things are related. Some progress has been made in the multilateral negotiations, and again that says to me: if progress is being made in terms of world trade, why are we rushing towards something where we have a net gain of $53 million a year? As I mentioned earlier, I think $24 million is being spent on advertising the A Fairer Medicare package. To start with, when it was $917 million, the government itself did not want it; now it is spending $24 million advertising the $2.9 billion A Fairer Medicare package. So in terms of the magnitude of money that the best guesses can give in relation to this process, Minister, $53 million is not a good deal; it is not a good deal.
It left sugar out and, by doing so, I think it sent a very firm message to the other agricultural industries. Talk to anybody in the beef industry and you will find that no-one actually believes that in 18 years time this deal will be standing as written now. I made this point a little earlier: you have two like economies here. You have a big one and a small one, but in a lot of ways we are quite similar in what we do. The capacity to win against a very large economy like this one when essentially we are in the same businesses is very limited—and that is indicated by the $53 million assessment.
I would also like the minister to touch on the rules of origin issue. Perhaps he could also explain to the House the impact of the arrangement on the states within the United States that have zonal taxation arrangements and enterprise zonal arrangements that encourage industry development. (Extension of time granted) In terms of the interpretation of the agreement, perhaps the minister could explain the implications of zonal taxation arrangements and enterprise type arrangements, which many states in the United States have, and the legal position of those states and that relationship with the free trade agreement. Perhaps he could just flesh that out, because I am getting mixed messages from various supposed experts as to whether a domestic zonal taxation or enterprise zone arrangement overrides the free trade agreement. I think that is something a lot of people would like clarification on.
I would like to work through an example—and I spoke to some people yesterday about particular examples. The minister would be aware of this example, so I will ask him to comment on it. Some years ago, when I was a state member of parliament, the state government developed a contract to build buses in a country community—it was Tamworth at that time, and I think Mark would remember that. There were a number of reasons for doing that. There were some politics in it, of course, but one of the reasons was to try to encourage manufacturing in communities where manufacturing was not as buoyant as it could be. Also, it was to try to soak up some unemployment. That was a state government decision in Australia to encourage development. Those sorts of things could be done through zonal taxation arrangements as well and through enterprise zones, if they were ever introduced in a bigger way in Australia. I was told yesterday that under this agreement all American bus-building companies would have access to those tenders and that it would probably be illegal, in a sense, or outside the agreement to allow a state government to favour a particular location in the development of, in that case, a bus-building contract. I would like the minister to flesh those issues out, if he possibly could. 
I have a number of other concerns, and obviously the Labor Party had a number of concerns a week ago because it had a document that held 42 reasons why the arrangement was not a particularly good one. Then, suddenly, when it came down to it, only two were of real concern, and they were probably, as the member for Calare said, Clayton's amendments so that Labor could buy back into the debate and neutralise the issue as an election issue. I started on that point and I will finish on it, because it is central to the debate. It is unfortunate now in a political sense that no-one gets a political advantage out of this. It was really only done to achieve a political advantage for one side of the parliament.
All the research that I have seen, the fears that have been expressed and the concerns that have been raised indicate to me, quite clearly, that this is not a good trading deal. It was poorly negotiated; it was negotiated from a position of weakness. It was negotiated from a position, as I think Ross Gittins indicated, where the Prime Minister could not afford to not do a deal. If you are dealing with someone who has your hands tied behind your back and your head in a hollow log, you are in a bad negotiating position. I think that is exactly what happened here. I feel for the minister, because I think he and some of the farm negotiators in particular went into the negotiations thinking that they would not be hoodwinked and sidelined. I feel for him to the extent that he has been ordered to accept a deal that he really does not think is acceptable.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NATS,2004-08-12,"—In conclusion, before we close the debate and vote on the amendments, and in response to some of the questions raised, I think it needs to be made very clear that the benefits that are going to accrue will accrue from day one. I am sure the member for New England is well aware of that in terms of the $22 million worth of tariffs that are immediately removed from all the existing beef exports. The quota access into the United States starts from year 2, with an increase of 15,000 tonnes, and increases on a sliding scale over 18 years to arrive at an open market basis. The people I have spoken to in the beef industry clearly understand that. Dairy access increases immediately from day one and is actually trebled, with a five per cent growth factor per annum. Improvements to horticulture access start immediately from day one.
As I said before, the scientific basis of our SPS protocols on quarantine are absolutely secure. There has been no weakening in those areas. There has been no impact on regional policy in terms of state arrangements. Australian companies receive national treatment in the United States that is equal to US companies in those procurement arrangements. Regional programs have been allowed for in the agreement. All those things are quite clear in the agreement. 
Again, I acknowledge the hard work that has been done on this, by Australia's negotiating team in good faith. We believe that, although we would have liked to have achieved more, we have achieved an enormous amount. Notwithstanding some of the comments that have been made, this deal is significant for the Australian economy. It was one that was not to be missed, and certainly this government was not going to miss that opportunity.
Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,40,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—There are some very strange issues that arise in this place from time to time. I listened to the member for Herbert ask the fundamental question of why there should be the right to compulsorily require an individual to join an organisation, whatever its purpose. That question must be fundamental to this debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003. I have some examples that reject all the scare tactics that get raised in this place and in the public debate, more particularly by university vice-chancellors, who are very happy to see this massive cash flow dragged into their organisations' financial affairs.
I want to give the example—and I am speaking from memory, but I think I have it pretty right—of when the Court government managed to pass legislation in Western Australia banning compulsory membership of student unions. We were told immediately that the sky was going to fall in. What was the reality? The reality was that quite a few students continued to pay voluntarily, and there was a reasonable cash flow into the student unions for the purposes for which I would have thought they existed—which have been argued here today—like putting a case for better deals for students. Why student union funding was ever transferred to the services that exist around a university campus I will never know.
When the university vice-chancellors and their executives and their treasurers and everyone else—and I noted in the newspaper the other day the fact that in universities we have constantly increasing numbers of executives as compared to teachers, and we have a similar thing in the health system, with administrators outnumbering nurses and the doctors—were confronted with this, what did they do? They turned to private enterprise. My advice was that at the University of WA the services continued and improved and, in fact, more people used them, because they liked them. It was not socialism, it was not communism, it was not `I'd better use it because it's there and I've paid for it'; it was `I'll use it because it's good.' The sky did not fall in. We have since had that decision reversed. There was nothing wrong with it. The services did not collapse. There was still a student union, but those who chose to be part of its executive had to go and sell its benefits to individual students.
The cost of this is quite significant. Why, if you have special dietary requirements and they are not available through the student union arrangements, should you have to subsidise food or coffee or something else for others? Why should you have to do that? It is quite unreasonable. And yet that was an argument put here by the member for Jagajaga. I heard part of her speech. There might be all those wonderful services, but you might not want any of them. Furthermore, you might not be able to afford them. The member for Jagajaga never stops telling us of the terrible impositions that are being prospectively placed on university students—but you cannot put the union fees on HECS; they have to come out of your or your parents' pockets. That in itself can be quite debilitating. You might not have the money. Do you not go to university because you cannot afford the fees? Possibly so. There must be a demarcation point in that regard. 
There has got to be some logic to an argument. If you stand up in this place and say, `The removal of compulsory union fees will cause the economies of universities to collapse; it will destroy all the restaurants, cafes and counselling services,' you ought to be able to prove that that in fact will happen. When the compulsory student union fees arrangement was overturned in Western Australia, choice was given to university students and all those things did not collapse. I do not know to what extent the university treasurer had to dip into the university's affairs to sustain the odd thing. They get a lot of money. It is measured nationally in billions of dollars. One would think that that would be okay. As I recollect, they even ended up with some hairdressers and things like that operating within the University of WA. It was like our airports today. When the pressure was put on the university administration and they no longer had that guaranteed cash flow, they made alternative arrangements. They put the restaurants out to tender and the private sector turned up. It was a great market—thousands of young people wandering around—but the first thing they had to do was make sure people came through the door. They had to provide a service acceptable to the students. What is wrong with that? Where is the evidence that this legislation destroyed the university sector in WA? It does not exist, and it is fundamental to this argument.
This is just nanny state support for an issue that resides in the 1930s. We all know that a union or organisation of that nature was a necessity then. There are many other examples of when people lacked the communication skills. Turn on ABC NewsRadio any morning you like and you will get stories from all around the world. Look at our newspapers. Many of them have a world news section. It might be of some interest to look at some of these organisations—and of course there is only a hair's-breadth difference between a student union at a university and a trade union out in the private sector—let us say, in car manufacturing.
I guess there are people in this place who have read, as I have, the evidence of the deals that the trade union movement is presently doing in Germany. It is signing deals with people like DaimlerChrysler to return to a 40-hour week, with no extra pay. Why? Because fortress Germany does not work any more. I will not take the opportunity to go into the debate that has been exercising the minds of this place. Germany, the identified efficiency machine of the world, has an extremely powerful union movement, and all of a sudden they have realised that jobs are disappearing—for instance, to East Germany, Poland and the new admittances to the European Union. The union movement has just signed a deal. I hope the truth in parliament issue is such that no-one will try to stand up in a minute and say it never happened, because it has happened all right. 
The French, with their view of the world—fortress France—have turned around and legislated for a 35-hour week, I think. Now their own socialist party are saying, `We're going to have to reverse that, because we are losing our standard of living as a consequence. We cannot compete in a global economy.' It is the same with a student union in a university. They were quite insular establishments once. If you lived in Sydney there was little opportunity to find out about what operated in Western Australia. You certainly did not read much about poor old WA in the Sydney newspapers. I think we still struggle a bit. The reality is that people did not know. This legislation has been put to the test. I would be prepared to re-read the contribution of the member for Jagajaga. I will be interested in the remarks of the member for Ballarat, whom I assume is going to read her already prepared speech of doom and gloom—the end of the world is tomorrow if you remove compulsory student union fees—but I bet there is nothing in her speech that tells me what disasters occurred in Western Australia during the period that non-compulsory student union fees existed, because there were none.
I had an understanding at the time from young people I knew—which might have included my youngest daughter, but I have forgotten when she concluded her university studies at Murdoch University. She is a veterinarian. The reality is that, during that period, the feedback from young people was, `This is great. I've now got an entrepreneurial hairdresser. I'll go and get a haircut between lectures.' It actually improved the services, so it is a silly argument. Of course, if people find that they want a union to represent them, because they feel they are being disadvantaged, they will join if they have the money. This, of course, is the same problem for a lot of working people. They have family commitments and they know they are doing extremely well with their purchasing power under the Howard government—much better than they did under the previous government and that wonderful thing called an accord—so they say, `Why should I pay a fee for something that's not doing anything for me?' And why should they? Why should we legislate and force people to pay for something when they may be struggling to buy their next meal or shoes for the kids? What is their order of priority?
The system has become almost optional. We are told that trade union membership in the private sector has gone down to 17 per cent. I would be prepared to lay a reasonably substantial bet that half of that membership is still compulsory. It is called no ticket, no start. In other words, you cannot get on the job unless you are a member of a union. Where does that fit with the Australian psyche of a fair go? If the service is so good, people will queue up to buy it. Today they are not so silly and so ill informed as to believe that there is a benefit when they cannot see it. That is fundamental to this debate. If the service is so good and so necessary, of course people will buy it.
What if the proven fact was that the implementation of the alternative, which is proposed in this legislation, would not result in the sky falling in and, what is more, that services would improve? I expect that a considerable number of students would continue to pay a reduced fee for the specific service of representation by some elected members. We are not trying to prevent that. This is not a bill to ban student unionism; it just gives the individuals involved the right to choose. As I said, I will be most interested in future contributions. Considering that there are a very large number of people on the speakers list—I think the organisation of the House is back in place—I will conclude my remarks at that point. ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I am most grateful to the member for O'Connor for keeping the debate going while I made my way down to the chamber. The free trade agreement debate finished a little earlier than I expected. I thank him very much for that contribution, which I know he was not prepared for. I speak in opposition to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003, which aims to abolish up-front fees for joining student unions or student associations and replace them with voluntary student unionism.
The bill has two impacts. Firstly, from 2005 any higher education provider, primarily universities, receiving Commonwealth support under the Higher Education Support Act would be prevented from making membership of student organisations a condition of enrolment. This aspect is essentially unnecessary in our view as universities already offer students a conscience objection to membership based on cultural, religious or ideological beliefs. Secondly, the bill would prevent higher education providers from making a condition of enrolment the payment of any fee that does not relate directly to the course. While this is clearly targeted at student organisation fees, it has been drafted so broadly that it catches a range of other fees charged by universities, such as parking fees, library fines and accommodation charges collected for affiliated colleges. Enforcement of these policies would become a condition of receiving a grant. Thus, over $5 billion of Commonwealth funding to universities would be forgone by universities if they were to ignore those conditions and continue with their current arrangements requiring students to pay a fee to student organisations.
The reality of this bill is that it is not just about voluntary student unionism. The reality is that it is payback. It is payback to students for running a campaign against this government's 25 per cent HECS fee hike and $100,000 full fee paying Australian undergraduate university courses. The government has a long history of trying to get rid of compulsory student union fees. It comes on the back of consensus that existed in the 1970s about the importance of student associations and student unions. The government has been after student unions for a long time. The last attempt to do this which we saw in this place was the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. That bill was subject to a report by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee and did not progress through to the Senate.
We heard from the member for O'Connor about the enactment of such a policy in Western Australia. Two states have enacted legislation on voluntary student unionism—Western Australia and Victoria. Both states have now reversed those decisions. The Bracks and the Gallop governments, when they came into power, reversed those decisions. Much of the Liberal argument in favour of this legislation revolves around the idea that membership of student organisations is a form of compulsory unionism, often invoking the idea of universities as closed shops. In the member for O'Connor's contribution we heard him again attempting to spread that myth. There is a misunderstanding of the role and status of student organisations that is reinforced by the fact that many of them are called student `unions', although `representative council', `association' and `guild' are also often used. In the case of the University of Ballarat, the university in my and Deputy Speaker Hawker's area, we actually have a student association—and one whose politics, I have to say, have been nowhere near that of the Australian Labor Party for a long period of time. 
The use of the name `union' is an historic accident based on the evolution of the earliest student organisations out of the Oxford and Cambridge debating unions. They were founded as early as 1815. As these organisations adopted a wider role, they retained the title `union', which was then adopted by student organisations at other universities. Student organisations are not industrial bodies and are not unions in the popular understanding of the term.
Much of the Liberal attack on automatic membership of student organisations has often been based on the claim that the current arrangements infringe freedom of association. Numerous legal challenges on that basis were defeated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In Clarke v. University of Melbourne [No. 2], the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held that the essence of the university's powers is that they are powers of self-government, affecting only those who choose to become members by enrolment, and they cannot touch anyone else who does not voluntarily bring themselves within its reach. In Harradine v. University of Adelaide, the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia stated:
The suggestion that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is at all relevant to the issue here is not sound. That declaration is not part of the domestic law of South Australia. In any event, cl. 8 of statute No. XXV does not deny the right in article 20 to anyone. The article does not demand that there be no qualification for entry to a university as a student, nor does it contemplate a union at a university. Moreover, no-one is compelled to belong to the union. Membership follows lawful entry to graduate study at the university and of course membership produced by payment of a fee can be ignored and never exercised.
The full court in fact went on to reject the notion that the requirement to join a student association was the equivalent of compulsory unionism. The University of Adelaide union is `a body providing services to members of the university' that the learned trial judge said `is not a union of the kind well known in the industrial and commercial world'. Further, His Honour correctly said, `It is a students' club providing facilities for eating, sport and other activities.' Certainly, this learned trial judge was correct in rejecting the contention that the clause imposes compulsory unionism.
One of the other arguments that the Liberal Party seems to put quite strongly is this notion that compulsory student unionism really is something that should be done away with completely. What it fails to understand is the role that student associations and student unions play within our university sector. We had some assessments done not too long ago of this particular bill. ACUMA, the organisation representing staff of university service providers, released a report in September 2003 which said that 550 jobs would be lost from 13 of Australia's regional universities. ACUMA in fact said that 15 jobs would be lost from my university, the University of Ballarat. In regional towns, 15 jobs are quite large job losses.
The other issue that has been raised consistently in this debate is loss of services. Again, just describing student unions and pretending that they are exactly the same as industrial unions neglects to understand the types of services that are provided by universities. The types of services that are provided by the student association at the University of Ballarat include welfare and academic support, child-care facilities, subsidised health services, orientation programs, distance education support, safety and security transport, legal services, taxation advice, student loans and computer labs.
If we were to follow the advice of the member for O'Connor in his contribution to the debate, we would basically be saying to people who pay taxes to governments to get services that they should opt out of that system; that if they do not use those services—for example, if they do not use the road that the federal government provided some funding for—they should not have to pay for them. That is the argument that is being put forward by the Liberal Party on this issue. 
The effect of this bill on the local community and within universities is that it has the possibility of reducing not only services but also the vibrancy and cultural life of universities. It will withdraw assistance to students from outlying regional areas who rely on these services—particularly those who come from outlying areas into the University of Ballarat, in the city of Ballarat—and it will reduce the support that is required for them to access other services.
Welfare and academic support is particularly important at the University of Ballarat. We have a high proportion of students from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds. We have a high proportion of students from small rural communities and a high proportion of students from smaller regional cities, including students from the electorate of Deputy Speaker Hawker, who is in the chair. Those students need additional support, and the University of Ballarat Student Association has played an incredibly important role in ensuring that those students make it through particularly their first year of university study. It can be pretty tough when you have had to move away from home, often not of your own will. Often that is the only choice that you have if you wish to attend university and you come from a small rural town. The support that the University of Ballarat Student Association provides to those students means that they are able to continue their studies. It gives them welfare and other support while they negotiate their way through what can be a fairly complex new system and a new town. Certainly trying to find accommodation is extremely difficult in my district.
Recently a huge number of international students arrived at the University of Ballarat. Over 160 students from more than 23 countries have arrived in the city of Ballarat in the last month. Students from Iran, India, Fiji, Timor, Mexico, Spain and America have landed in the city of Ballarat with very little knowledge of the Australian system and very little knowledge of how to make their way while living in a regional city in Australia. The student association and the international students club are playing a very important role in making sure that those students not only settle into their studies but also settle into the community of Ballarat.
I now wish to talk about the local reaction when this bill was first touted—in particular, the reaction from the then President of the University of Ballarat Student Association. I again remind the House that the student association at the University of Ballarat has for a long time not had any association whatsoever with the Australian Labor Party and has had, in fact, a much stronger association with the other side of politics. Brian Taylor, the then President of the University of Ballarat Student Association, was reported in the Age on 17 May 2003 as being opposed to this bill. He said that it would dramatically affect the association's student welfare role—a big issue given that many students come from low-income families or are disadvantaged.
Student organisations make an incredibly valuable contribution to university life, and they provide vital support to students. They provide a range of essential services to students and support them to successfully complete their studies. Student organisations represent the interests of their members inside and outside of universities, and that is what is at the heart of this bill. This bill is payback to the student associations and students who stood up against the government's 25 per cent HECS fee hike—the same 25 per cent HECS fee hike that happened, surprisingly, at the University of Ballarat, where there is such a large proportion of students from families on low incomes. Also, more recently we have seen at the University of Ballarat the acceptance of full fee paying undergraduate courses, which was not something the University of Ballarat had intended to do initially—certainly not the university council—but which has crept in there. 
This bill is essentially payback to those students who have stood up against this government. As we heard in the member for Jagajaga's contribution, there is a bit of a pattern that comes from this government. If you speak out, if you are prepared to disagree with the views of this government, then you are going to get squashed pretty quickly. Your organisation is going to get defunded, the government is going to legislate against you or, as we saw with the 43 former diplomats and members of the Defence Force, it is going to denigrate you in public. The Prime Minister might not do it, but he certainly lets his attack dogs off the leash at the doorstops in order to do it.
Students who are the very first in their family to go to university and those moving from the country to study are particularly reliant upon the support provided by student organisations. Over 60 per cent of the students who go to the University of Ballarat are the first ever in their family to attend a higher education institution. They do not have a history or a pattern within their families of long-term university study, and many of them need extra support. That is what the student association at my university provides.
Again I remind the House of the support provided to international students. It is an area that is growing within our particular university. They really are being faced with enormous challenges, particularly students from Iran, who often come to this country with their families and expect to be able to find, as they are entitled to do, 20 hours of part-time work to supplement their incomes here. They are finding it enormously difficult to get access to rental accommodation and to find casual work in an economy that has been growing very well but certainly has not been growing with enough speed to absorb a large number of casual workers in the form of international students.
Student organisations have actively and repeatedly voiced their opposition to Liberal Party attacks on students in universities. In this bill, the Liberal Party is attempting to silence dissent, because student organisations have successfully highlighted the anti-student policies of the Howard government. In my view, the bill is political retribution by the government against student organisations that are opposed to government cuts of billions of dollars of university funding—in the case of the University of Ballarat, over $52 million since 1996 was cut from the university's funding—doubled HECS fees over the last eight years and now increases of a further 25 per cent. The government have allowed class sizes to increase by more than 30 per cent, and the quality the students can expect has certainly been thrown out the window. They have allowed universities to enrol students paying $100,000—in fact, it has increased well beyond that—while students with better marks miss out.
The Liberal Party has been obsessed with crushing student organisations for well over 25 years. Liberal Party students have been unable to win the support of other students, so they have turned to their parliamentary representatives to force their will upon students. Current membership arrangements have been endorsed already by the courts and they have been endorsed by the ACCC. This legislation is unnecessary and it should be opposed. The current membership arrangements in student organisations are not—as is claimed by the Liberal Party—an infringement of freedom of association. That has been found time after time in court cases. 
Essentially this bill is about squashing student dissent. It will have a negative impact, in my view, on the cultural life of universities and on the ability of students, in particular regional and rural students, to find the support services that they desperately need in order to stay at university, particularly in the first year, which is a difficult year. The University of Ballarat Student Association has been providing those services to students for a long time and many of the students within that university have welcomed those services. It certainly means that they are able to stay within that university to complete their education. Again, this bill is very much about squashing student dissent and making sure that students, who speak out against the government and who have spoken out against the government's 25 per cent HECS fee hikes, are punished for having done so.
What we have seen time and time again from this government is a preparedness to say to people: `If you're prepared to speak out then watch out. We may not get you immediately but we'll certainly work towards either legislating or defunding your organisations.' We have seen again and again examples of the attempts to squash dissent by this government. I am very happy to support the member for Jagajaga in her opposition to this bill because of the impact it will have not only on jobs in the University of Ballarat Student Association but also on services and on the ability of students who come from my district to complete their university education. I support the member for Jagajaga and the rest of my colleagues in opposing this bill.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—As the youngest member of the federal parliament I am very pleased to rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003 and in particular to state very strongly my support for voluntary student unionism. At its core, voluntary student unionism is a fundamental human right. It comes down to one of the most fundamental privileges of living in a Western democracy—that is, the right to freedom of association. I would have thought that anyone who lived in a democracy would be very strained indeed if they were asked to come up with a possible argument to support why we should compel people to join a union.
It is only the Australian Labor Party that would come into this chamber to argue to the Australian people that, in some way, in typical left wing political style, the Australian Labor Party, and through them the National Union of Students and the various student unions around this country, know what is best and what is in the interests of students on university campuses across this country. It is only the Australian Labor Party that would dare to have the arrogance to say to the Australian people: `You know what, you should outsource your decision making to us. In fact we're going to make it compulsory for you to pay us hundreds of dollars each and every year at university campuses across this country because we know what's in your best interests.' That is the typical kind of arrogance that we see from the Australian Labor Party and that this bill is attempting to destroy. Make no mistake about it: I am very much in favour of seeing compulsory unionism destroyed. It serves no purpose other than purely political purposes for the Australian Labor Party. 
I have heard two other speakers before me in this debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003. Those two speakers were the members for Ballarat and for Jagajaga. I have to say that they touched on some issues on which they have my support. I certainly believe there are particular functions that student union groups provide and perform that are in the interests of students. I do not stand in this chamber to claim each and every activity and function student unions undertake is a negative one. Of course they are not. Of course some are beneficial, and particular programs, child-minding facilities and things of that ilk that student unions provide are of benefit.
It is exactly for that reason that I argue that student unions need not fear a more competitive playing field. If it is in students' interests—as much as the members for Ballarat and for Jagajaga claim—then students will join voluntarily. The reality is that, if you need to use student union services and you desire to use those services, you will pay to use those services. What sort of individual in their right mind would walk away from a service that they want to use? Naturally, if people want to use the services, they will pay to use them.
The difference between this side of the chamber and the opposition side of the chamber is that we do not believe you should compel people to pay for services. We do not believe there should be a compulsory levy to the tune of hundreds of dollars each and every year. It is placed on those who, in the same breath, the Labor Party claim are some of the most disadvantaged in the community. This is what is most ironic about the whole argument that comes from the political left in this debate. The political left claim that those university students are among the most disadvantaged in Australia today and yet it is the Australian Labor Party that wants to force them to pay hundreds of dollars each and every year to student unions.
Put simply, if services are useful and of benefit to students then save the $500, $600 or $700 up front that students are forced to pay and let them reach into their pockets as and when they use those services. That is how every other business in this country operates. Other businesses in this country that provide services to the public do so on the basis of asking the consumers to pay for them as they use the services. The only exceptions to that rule are, of course, governments. Governments are the ones that levy taxes on people.
Despite claims from the opposition that student unions are in fact a quasi form of government, nothing could be further from the truth. They are not a quasi form of government. A lot of them are corrupt. There are many examples of the corruption which absolutely peppers student union history and student union campuses across Australia. It is an interesting exercise to undertake a look at some of the news clippings surrounding student unions. I have to say I question the Australian Labor Party's motivation for being such a strong defender of student unionism. The Australian Labor Party come into this chamber claiming that they are the defenders of student unionism because they believe student unions know best what is in the interests of students. I disagree with that; I think students do.
I suggest that there is in fact an alternative as to why the Australian Labor Party so strongly supports compulsory student unionism—as to why the Australian Labor Party would like to continue fleecing millions of dollars each and every year out of the pockets of students. There is a reason, and one particular article sums it up the best. This is an article from the Australian newspaper on 17 March this year where the new President of the National Union of Students, Jodie Jansen, stipulated that she was not going to waste time on `primary school politics' this year. Her aim was to elevate the National Union of Students, the peak body that is funded out of the pockets of ordinary, decent Australian students who go to university, from being pesky to becoming a powerful union that would ensure that the first thing on its agenda was `a marginal seats campaign designed to lend a serious hand to a change in government at the federal level'. The article said: 
In the aftermath of the Nelson reforms, the NUS is firmly on the warpath and—despite an increased Liberal presence on the national executive—has authorised a $150,000 campaign in marginal seats during the election.
The campaign, which Jansen says is “the last stand” for higher education in Australia, will include radio and television advertisements, billboards and letterbox drops in six or seven marginal seats across the country.
`If the Howard Government gets in for another three years our public education system will be unrecognisable,' she said.
That basically sums up the reason why the Australian Labor Party are such strong defenders of student unions. It is that student unions and, in particular, the National Union of Students are puppets in the hands of the Australian Labor Party. There are many examples in the past of student union politics being  a  recruiting  ground  for the Australian Labor Party. Indeed, we have seen in Queens-land, as a consequence of the Shepherdson inquiry, that student unions have been used by the Australian Labor Party as a way of fraudulently enrolling people in marginal electorates because they believed that delivered political outcomes. It is interesting to see the member for Rankin sitting in the chamber today, because perhaps the member for Rankin and the Australian Labor Party in his electorate are those who have benefited from some of the outrageous things that student unions have got up to off the back of the money of hardworking, decent Australian students, who would rather go to university and study than see their money absolutely compulsorily ripped out of their pockets and misused by student unions for purely political purposes.
I speak about Griffith University, in particular, when I make reference to the ways in which the Australian Labor Party misuses student unions. On 23 October 2000, Chris Griffith wrote an interesting article about student politics in the Courier-Mail. He wrote:
It remains the training ground for our future politicians, ministerial advisers, public servants and political operatives—and what a training ground it is. Take Griffith University, the political kindergarten of several young ALP guns who became heavyweights in Labor's AWU faction and are now before the inquiry—
that inquiry being the Shepherdson inquiry. He goes on to state:
First, the Young Labor Club at Griffith was the scene of violence, and at one stage disbanded, and it is alleged students made themselves available to stack key meetings of other campus organisations. There were some claims of the misuse of student resources for political purposes, such as the repeated unauthorised use of a bus for campaigning for the ALP near Currumbin.
There was also a case of the improper use of university resources and letterheads in a push polling operation mounted from the university to oust non-AWU faction office bearers from a furniture union. But there also were serious claims of misappropriation, one of which led to the sacking of the student council's permanent administrator who brought the allegation to the CJC's attention.
So we see there claims regarding Griffith University from 2000 which highlight the reason why the Australian Labor Party would be such a strong defender of student unions, particularly compulsory student unionism. It is that the Australian Labor Party, throughout history, has had its tentacles interwoven in the National Union of Students and interwoven in particular student unions. 
I state again that not every function a student union undertakes is a negative function—there are some benefits—but let students choose whether or not they wish to take advantage of those benefits. Do not slug them $400, $500 or $600 a year and make it compulsory so that it can prop up the Australian Labor Party. I turn to another example from 11 February this year, in the Australian newspaper again, dealing with the University of Melbourne. The article says:
The president of Melbourne University's troubled student union has been removed from office pending a police investigation into the body's financial affairs.
Mr Dean McVeigh, who was the liquidator of the student union:
... also found the student union, under Mr Crawford, had inappropriately awarded contracts, falsified records and made decisions that were a conflict of interest.
So we have another example at Melbourne university, and the list goes on. Dealing still with Melbourne university, an article in the Age on 13 June 2001 describes the Melbourne university vice-chancellor, Alan Gilbert, as accusing students who occupied and vandalised his office in April of the previous year of `criminal behaviour'. It states:
Professor Gilbert said students had been warned before the protest that they would be charged, and claimed he had never seen behavior like that of students who “smashed their way through a concrete-reinforced door with a sledgehammer” and “traumatised” staff.
The article goes on:
The Melbourne University students were among 74 protesters who broke into Professor Gilbert's office to protest against up-front fees, increasing class sizes and the privatisation of university assets. An estimated $100,000 damage occurred during a six-hour occupation in which students ransacked files and spray-painted walls.
Again, that was at Melbourne university. And what about James Cook University? These student unions that the member for Jagajaga and the member for Ballarat claim are doing such a service to students—what about this example? As reported in the Courier-Mail on 23 February this year, a student union campaign at James Cook University accused Australian soldiers of `murdering innocent Iraqis for oil'. It was `blasted as distasteful and distressing'. A very good member of this parliament, Peter Lindsay, claimed that it was very distressing to members of the armed forces. In this particular case, as the newspaper says:
The National Union of Students distributed mock army recruitment posters across Australia last year urging people not to go to university because “we'll pay you to shoot people instead”—
purporting that that is what the Australian Army has at its core. There is another example from Melbourne university. In the student council election manifesto that they use to try to get elected, a Bracks government staffer openly backed university students using potentially lethal drugs such as ecstasy and speed. David Henderson, the staffer, advocated the use of ecstasy and amphetamines as a key platform in the Melbourne university council elections. The Herald Sun on 29 May 2002 said:
He promoted the mixing of drugs and counselled students against small doses of ecstasy—
saying, `The more, the better'. Similarly, a five-page article was included in the orientation handbook of the University of Technology, Sydney, which outlined how to use drugs. Instead of actually counselling students against using drugs, UTS put together a five-page booklet instructing students on how to use drugs—another useful service, no doubt put forward by the student union and another way the Australian Labor Party believe the student unions are adding value to the hundreds of thousands of students across this country that are forced to pay them money. Students have no choice about whether or not they pay that money and, if they do not pay the money to the union, they do not get their university results. It is an absolute disgrace that the Australian Labor Party would deny a student their results, the consequences of their hard work, because it is in Labor's interest to see hundreds of thousands of dollars put towards campaigns against the Howard government. The Labor Party wants the political benefits that flow from that money. 
There is a further example, again from Melbourne university. There was, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, a case where the Melbourne university student union went into liquidation. This is from the Australian on 17 December 2003:
Insolvent and facing a liability of up to $11 million on a failed property deal, the union has been placed in the hands of a liquidator by order of the Victorian Supreme Court.
How do these student unions garner the power that they garner? How do they get access to millions of dollars? How do they waste $11 million of hard-earned money that students have to put into the unions' pockets because the Australian Labor Party stands opposed to the kinds of amendments we are making? Labor argues it is a form of government; we have heard the member for Jagajaga and the member for Ballarat claim that it is a form of quasi-government. I know of no government that operates in this way. Again, I quote from the Australian:
By December 2002, Ray—
one of the student activists at Melbourne university—
was used to getting his way. His faction had mastered the art of winning student votes by handing out food vouchers to those who cast ballots. Its questionable tactics marginalising his opponents were challenged many times, although not with any success.
The student union, with more than 100 staff, a fleet of cars and access to abundant office equipment and secretarial support, was a solid base from which to advance his interests as a budding young member of the Labor Right.
So we see another connection between the misappropriation of student unions' money and fraudulent claims by student unions, and the Australian Labor Party.
I in fact urge any member of the opposition who comes to speak against this bill today to outline the way in which students benefit from having the Labor Party's hands in the pockets of student unions—the way in which students benefit from seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars of their money misused on federal political campaigns to prop up the ALP. I challenge any member of the Australian Labor Party to indicate the way in which student unions, through, for example, losing $11 million at Melbourne university, are benefiting the student body.
As I said at the outset, this bill goes to a fundamental human right: freedom of choice. The Labor Party stands opposed to that right to choose because it has at stake millions of dollars in student unions. The Labor Party stands opposed because, as we have seen at Melbourne university and as we have seen at Griffith University—and as we saw with the Shepherdson inquiry—the Labor Party is the direct beneficiary of students engaging in the misappropriation of student funds, of students engaging in fraudulent enrolments and of students misusing their positions in student unions to try to climb the ladder of opportunity that exists inside the Australian Labor Party. That is why the Labor Party stands opposed to this bill. That is the reason why the Australian Labor Party does not want people to have freedom of choice. That is the reason why the Australian Labor Party would rather closet student unions from any need to be accountable or to provide value for money back to students. 
It is a pretty simple proposition—a very simple proposition, in fact. If students get actual benefit from the services operated by student unions then let them pay to get access to those services. If students gain as a consequence of having access to child-minding services, subsidised canteens or the other kinds of services that are offered by student unions, do not charge them $700 up front. Do not make it compulsory; let them exercise what should be a fundamental right, surely, in a Western democracy like Australia.
That reality is that, when voluntary student unionism was introduced in Western Australia, you did not see the collapse of all sorts of services. The only services that collapsed were services that propped up the Australian Labor Party and services that propped up the kinds of irrelevant and useless services that students do not wish to use. They are the services that collapsed. The useful, beneficial services are those that stayed. I simply call upon all members of the Australian Labor Party to recognise the truth, walk away from this shonky, dishonest campaign—the smoke and mirrors Labor have got going—and make sure that you give back to those hardworking Australian students that truly are disadvantaged the choice as to whether or not they use those services.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I glean from the speech that has just been delivered by the member for Moncrieff that he is not enamoured of student unions. He should, however, be fond of university campuses and the Young Liberals—and branch stacking, because he is an expert at it. I have a file upstairs—which I have never bothered to use and have not brought down on this occasion, either—that documents well the activities of the member for Moncrieff and other Young Liberals in Queensland in the faction wars that afflict the Liberal Party in Queensland from time to time, most of them waged through the Young Liberals. The member for Moncrieff was a very active warrior in those battles, and no doubt still is.
It therefore astonishes me that he should be so averse to student unions and the sorts of activities that take place on student campuses, because he was a very active participant in the Young Liberals and in recruiting students from those campuses. At one stage, I think there was a caper involving a sixpack of beer. If you were prepared to join the Young Liberals you got a sixpack of beer. I do not think the joining fee was very expensive—my recollection now is that there was no joining fee—but you did get a sixpack of beer. The member for Moncrieff was involved in that, with others who I will not name under parliamentary privilege. But I think the member for Moncrieff is fair game because he has just been speaking with great indignation about university campuses and student unions.
In drafting the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003 the government yet again misused the term `choice'. It does so frequently in industrial relations legislation, where it speaks of choice but introduces legislation to deny a choice on the part of working Australians. In this legislation, the government again uses the word `choice' but in fact the legislation containing the word `choice' prescribes—dictates—to universities what they can and cannot do. The government is seeking to stop universities deciding the best way of providing important services to students at their universities by banning what it calls up-front student union fees. 
I want to talk about the sorts of services that are provided by student unions. As well as representing students in the national debate on higher education issues, student unions provide a huge range of valuable services to university students. The Australian courts have repeatedly held that freedom of association issues and conventions do not apply to student unions, largely because a student union—in the words of the South Australian Supreme Court—is:
... not a union of the kind well known in the industrial and commercial world. It is the Student's Club providing facilities for eating, sport and other activities ...
Student unions provide important services, such as sporting facilities, welfare services, career support services, child care, legal support, student finance, and communal and arts facilities. These are not all services for which individual fees can or should be charged. The risk with charging fees for services such as welfare services is that university students are less likely to use them, even when they are in need of those services. This sort of legislation was in place in both Western Australia and Victoria under conservative state governments in the 1990s. As the member for Jagajaga pointed out in her speech, experience at the state level with legislation of this type has shown that the risk of drop-outs increases if student services are wound back as a result of the abolition of student union fees.
The bill takes away choice for universities. What is so wrong with universities being able to make these decisions? Why is the government so obsessed with intervening in such a strong way in the activities and decisions that universities can make? The decision about whether or not all students should be charged these student union or student administration fees should not be made by government. Universities should be able to make those sorts of decisions. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has called on the government to abandon this bill.
It is bad policy to tie university funding grants to the government's obsessive anti-union agenda, which apparently even spreads to student unions. It appears that student unions are being targeted simply because the word `union' appears in their name, even though they are not unions in the usual sense of the word. They are probably closer to what we would normally think of as a student administration and support association. Because student unions—particularly at the peak level—have been vocal critics of the government's higher education policies, they are being targeted in this legislation, in which funding is being made conditional on certain provisions.
In relation to student unions, for 8½ years the government has been attacking trade unions. These attacks have occurred through legislation, royal commissions, government departments like the Office of the Employment Advocate, the code of conduct that the government applies in respect of Commonwealth funds being allocated to building projects and road projects around Australia, and backing unethical and unlawful practices in disputes—such as the waterfront dispute. Now the government is turning its attack on student unions. But again the government has badly misjudged the situation. Labor and the minor parties strongly oppose this legislation, as do the vice-chancellors, student groups and teaching groups.
The reason—apart from the fact that the term `union' appears in their name—the student unions are being targeted by this government is that they have been critical of the government. We have seen that pattern develop over the last 8½ years: any critics of the Howard government in our democracy are targeted, either through vilification in the public arena—often under the protection of parliamentary privilege—or through legislation designed to seek revenge on parties, community groups and organisations that attack the government. That is a very strong motivation behind this piece of legislation. It is true that student unions have been critical of the government. They have been highly critical of the government's regressive and inequitable higher education policy. 
Members of this House might recall on 14 October 1999 the Prime Minister saying:
There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government.
Most Australians would think, `Well, if the Prime Minister of the country says that there will be no $100,000 university fees, there won't be.' The tragic reality is that there are university fees just five years later of not only around $100,000 but $144,000 and now soaring up towards the $200,000 mark. So the Prime Minister broke his promise, and he knew that his promise that there would be no $100,000 university fees would be broken when he made it on 14 October 1999. I will have something to say in a moment about the minister's response when he was asked about high university fees, because it makes for very instructive reading.
This government has consistently failed Australia's universities and their students. On that basis, student unions have been completely legitimate in criticising these failures, but the government seeks its revenge through this sort of legislation. The government also knows that by attacking student unions it will also be jeopardising the provision of services to university students. It obviously regards this as some form of acceptable collateral damage in its fight to muzzle any critics.
It is obvious that, if student administration fees are made optional, many cash-strapped students will choose not to pay such fees, even if they see the benefit of contributing to these services. Given the communal nature of many of the services provided by student unions, fee-for-service arrangements are just impractical. This is particularly relevant in respect of cultural and recreational infrastructure, the benefits of which are enjoyed by all students, whether or not they pay the student union fees. Universities are more than capable of deciding whether or not to charge compulsory student administration fees. It is really not the Commonwealth government's business, and yet the government has sought yet again to intrude into the operations, the decision making, of universities and to make funding conditional on the abolition of compulsory student union fees.
I did say a moment ago that the Minister for Education, Science and Training participated in an astonishing interview. When Professor Bruce Chapman, who developed the higher education charge known as HECS, told a conference that by 2008 one in 10 Australians would be paying full fees—not just high fees but full fees—he said:
Unless you've got rich and generous parents, you are in trouble.
The next day, after Professor Bruce Chapman had made those remarks on 3 August, the minister for education was interviewed on the Jon Faine program. By way of introducing Professor Chapman, Jon Faine said:
He is quoted in the papers this morning as having said that the system that he helped create is not working the way he wanted it to. He says that “unless you have got rich and generous parents you are in trouble”.
So Jon Faine brings the minister onto the line and says this:
The man responsible for introducing student loans says the way the system is evolving and where you are taking it is only going to help rich students, students from rich families, is he right? 
The answer from the minister is:
Well in fact Professor Chapman is right ...
So here is the minister conceding on the Jon Faine program that Professor Chapman is right, that it is only going to help the students from rich families, that the government's policies are only going to help rich families.
—Finish the quote.
—I will finish the quote, as invited to by the member for Parramatta. The minister says:
Well in fact Professor Chapman is right, but the interpretation of what he is saying is in fact a little bit incorrect.
What a devastating qualification, member for Parramatta. I have finished the quote there, but I will go on and finish the remainder of the quote because it makes for amazing reading. The minister goes on to say this:
Well in fact we have got 784 courses in Australian unis which charge or offer full fee paying places to Australians, we have got about 16 of those courses that have fees of around $100,000 or more, needless to say veterinary science, dentistry and so on.
Is this right? Here is the minister conceding on 4 August this year that in 16 courses there are fees of more than $100,000. The Prime Minister, on 14 October 1999, said that, under his government, `There will be no $100,000 university fees.'
The member for Parramatta would do well to remember that in October 1999 the Prime Minister made a solemn promise in this parliament—not off the cuff in response to a talkback radio call but in this parliament—assuring the people of Australia that there would be no $100,000 university fees and his minister then boasted just a short time ago—only on 4 August—that there are in fact $100,000 university fees in the case of 16 courses. The member for Parramatta would do well to explain that to his constituents.
Faine goes on to ask, `Medicine?' and the minister says:
Well Medicine not yet, but that's coming in, and we know that Notre Dame will be about $125,000 and we have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000.
That is $200,000 to do a university degree at the University of Melbourne. I recall, in a debate earlier, that the member for Ryan, when we talked about these $200,000 university fees, said that the minister had been verballed. These are the minister's own words: `We have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000.' The interview goes on. Jon Faine says:
Now there is no way that an ordinary Australian family can afford to put a kid through one of those courses is there?
Nelson's answer—and the member for Parramatta has gone away—is:
Well in fact you are right ...
He is saying that there is in fact no way that an ordinary Australian family can afford to put a kid through one of those courses. So there is the minister saying, `Yes, you're right about that; so what's the problem?' The transcript continues as follows:
Faine: Well ... look at some of the fundamental principles Dr Nelson. Did you come from a rich family?
Nelson: Arr, no I certainly didn't.
Faine: You got a medical degree?
Nelson: Yes, I did medicine at a time when there was no HECS, there were no full fee paying places for Australians, there was nothing like that.
Faine: Well don't you think it's fair that anyone from any family no matter what their capacity to pay but just on their sheer ability should have an equal chance?
Nelson: Well the situation in theory, you are right.
In theory, the minister says, that is right, but in practice it is not. In practice the minister concedes that, under the Howard government, it is not right that not all young people with talent who have done the hard work to get high marks at school are able to go on and get a university education. This is some theoretical construct as far as the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Prime Minister are concerned but, in the real world of Australia today, early in the 21st century, it is just not happening. The minister made that very plain to Jon Faine and, through him, to the Australian people. 
You would think it would end there, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, but I do not have another half an hour to speak. This transcript is full of gems, but I will just quote a couple of the more astonishing statements in it:
Faine: And someone else who can just write out a cheque ...
Nelson: Exactly!
Faine: ... because Daddy has got the money in the bank ...
Nelson: Exactly!
Faine: ... buys that place and that is not fair.
Nelson: You are absolutely right, Jon.
So the minister said that it is absolutely right that it is not fair that someone else can just write out a cheque, because their father has the money in the bank, and buy a place. The minister said: `That is absolutely right, it is not fair. It is just something that we do. So what?' The Australian people would not be surprised that this government does this, because this government has no sense of fairness. The government boasts about returning the Australian higher education system to the pre-Whitlam era, where privilege, not talent, determined whether a young person who worked hard could get on and get into university. The government boasts that it is returning Australia to the pre-Whitlam era, thereby denying opportunities to young Australians with talent who are prepared to do the hard work. The government is creating circumstances where young Australians with some talent who perhaps have not done quite as much work but have lots of money can buy a place ahead of those students who do the hard work and get higher marks. This is called queue jumping.
In most areas of public policy the government is completely opposed to queue jumping but in two areas we know it very strongly supports queue jumping. One of those areas is higher education, where wealthy students can jump the queue ahead of less privileged students who got higher marks at school and worked harder. That is one form of queue jumping. Another form of queue jumping happens on a daily basis with Medicare—that great Labor reform—where people can jump the queue by paying higher up-front fees in doctors' surgeries so that they can be served and treated ahead of patients who do not have the money to pay those fees and therefore need to see a bulk-billing doctor.
I will complete my account of the remarkable interview between Jon Faine and the minister with a last quotation from it. It finishes in this way:
Faine: ... Dr Nelson, we just wanted today to get your reaction to Professor Chapman's criticisms and I am grateful to you for them this morning.
Nelson: And I think they are valid.
Professor Chapman's criticisms are valid—that unless you have rich and generous parents you are in trouble. Professor Chapman's central criticism is that, under the Howard government, you are in trouble unless you have rich and generous parents. At the end of the interview the minister summed up beautifully, when he said:
... I think they are valid.
Those criticisms are valid, and that is why this election will be so important for the very future of our country—for the very character of Australia. The election will determine whether we return Australia to that great Aussie notion of a fair go, where opportunity is available to all Australians irrespective of the incomes of their parents, or whether we revert to that dog-eat-dog mentality where privilege and not talent determine whether a young person can express their talents and develop them in higher education. The Australian people have a very stark choice to make at the next election, which is now only a few weeks away. That choice will determine whether we return to the pre-Whitlam era, where privilege and not talent decided whether young people could get into university, or whether we return Australia to that great Aussie notion of a fair go for all, where all young people have an opportunity to climb the ladder of opportunity. 
 (Mr Wilkie)—Before I put the question and call the next speaker, I would just remind the member for Rankin that, even when referring to the transcript of an interview, the minister is still the minister and needs to be referred to in those terms. I thought I would mention that before the member for Parramatta leapt up and raised a point of order.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am delighted to rise to speak to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003, because the bill sets out a principle that is fundamental to Australia, to our notion of who we are and to where we are in the 21st century. That simple principle is that people from anywhere in society are entitled to freedom of association. Freedom of association is about their right to join a union and their right to act collectively—and I will defend that right—and their right not to join a union and not to act collectively, to act as they see fit. Freedom of association, in its most fundamental sense—in Australia and internationally—means the right to choose whether to act and to participate collectively or not to do so. This bill simply removes compulsory up-front student union fees. It is not an attack upon student unions, and it is not an attack upon any other principle. The intention of the bill is to break down a form of compulsory collectivisation. That is what is intended, that is what is being pursued and that is what will be achieved. That is what this bill is about.
In discussing this bill, I want to deal with three things. Firstly, I will take the opportunity to refer to an important higher education initiative within my electorate of Flinders. Secondly, I want to look at this within the context of the national debate about higher education. Thirdly, I want to examine the specific provisions to abolish compulsory up-front student union fees.
Not long ago, thanks to the work of the government—and in particular of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson—I was able to announce funding of $9.7 million over seven years for 110 tertiary places at the Australian Maritime College to establish and oversee a national centre for marine and coastal conservation in the old barracks precinct at Point Nepean in my electorate of Flinders. This is a wonderful creation. The vision is simple: to create one of Australia's—if not the world's—leading marine and coastal conservation centres. It will be of the status of the Bodega Marine Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It will allow Victorian and Australian tertiary students to learn about the marine environment. In particular, it will allow primary and secondary students to make day visits in 2005—and, as the year rolls on, overnight and short course visits. It will give primary and secondary students from the Mornington Peninsula and from throughout Victoria the opportunity to participate in learning about the marine environment of their own region. To me it is a tremendous thing—an intake of 40 students per year, at full intake, and a total of 110 students over a three-year course, allowing for some attrition. 
What is amazing is that there are people who criticise, denigrate and downgrade this outcome. They question whether this area is appropriate for marine education. Now that it has been delivered, it is surprising that the very people who a year ago were demanding marine education now say, `We are not sure whether it is the appropriate place.' I set out a very clear vision 2½ years ago that the land at Point Nepean should be a national park and that the 100 buildings of the quarantine station and the old Army school of health and barracks should be used for marine education. I am glad that we have this tertiary education in my electorate of Flinders.
The second point I want to make is about the great national debate about the extent and scope of higher education funding in Australia. We have heard the great myth perpetrated that students are being denied the opportunity for study by the imposition of fees. There is a very simple principle: the number of funded student places at tertiary institutions in Australia has increased dramatically. In the last year, we saw a budget of $4.9 billion for higher education, an increase of 5.8 per cent. Interestingly, over the last three years we have seen an additional 8,300 fully funded undergraduate places in medicine, law, engineering, science, arts, health sciences, chiropractic studies and across the full range of studies. These are opportunities that will help Australia as a whole and also provide a great leap forward in the lives of the students.
Against that background, in addition to the increase in fully funded places, I would like to give you a hypothetical example. Let us say that in 2001 there were 800 funded medical places in Victoria—I use that as an example and not as a fact. Let us say that has now been increased to 1,000 fully funded places—a significant increase in fully funded places. That is the reality across Australia: the number of fully funded places has been increased. In addition to that, government reforms have allowed students from Victoria and Australia who do not make the first 1,000 places to contribute to their own education and give themselves the opportunity to enter education in the same way that overseas students can. So, if there were 800 places and there are now 1,000 fully funded places, let us say an additional 100 places were made available for those who did not make the priority cut on academic grounds. That would increase the total pool of students. Not only is there no decrease in the pool of fully funded students; there is a practical, real, substantive increase in the number of fully funded students. In addition to the fully funded students, there is the opportunity for those who do not quite make the cut to contribute to their own education. That is what this is all about. There is a double basis of increase. Firstly, there is an increase in the number of fully funded places. Secondly, there is an increase, over and above that, in the number of places for students to contribute to their own education.
The third thing I want to address is the reforms in the bill. The bill has three key purposes. Firstly, it provides choice for all students with respect to membership of a student union. Students would no longer have to fund an organisation they may not require or support. An example is off-campus students. Importantly, the bill does not prevent students who voluntarily wish to become a member of a union from doing so. That is a fundamental right, and it is something I will stand up for, protect and endorse. But the counter-right is to choose not to be a member. The second purpose of this bill is consistent with the principle of freedom of association as it applies to other unions throughout Australia. Why should higher education be any different? It is possible to ensure that student services are provided without compelling people to be members of a union. Thirdly, the bill allows higher education to be cost free at the point of entry. That is a very important principle, and one that seems to have been ignored by our friends in the opposition. They seem to ignore this fact and airbrush it out of existence. Students currently pay between $100 and $559 a year in union fees at tertiary institutions around Australia. The fee is unrelated to the course of study and is charged regardless of a student's capacity to pay. What this bill does is entitle students to determine their own outgoing expenses. 
So, firstly, I am delighted that we have been able to deliver 110 marine education places for students on the Mornington Peninsula. I think it is an outstanding step for tertiary students and for primary and secondary school students. I hope in time to have a special program that might be able to support local Indigenous students. Secondly, I strongly support the government's commitment to increasing the number of fully funded places and, over and above the fully funded places, to allowing other students the capacity to participate in tertiary education. Thirdly, I support this bill, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003, for the very simple reason that it provides freedom of choice, it allows freedom of association and it allows students to make their own choice to either affiliate or not affiliate. Above all else, it exemplifies, it reinforces and it reaffirms the right to freedom of choice and freedom of association.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—This bill, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003, is the last of the three bills implementing Backing Australia's Future, announced as part of the 2003 budget. The true aim of this legislation is not what the government purports but to silence student dissent. There is no doubt that since the government has embarked upon an increase to HECS fees the student associations across Australia, on behalf of students, have wished to express their grave concern and anger over the government's making such decisions. There is no doubt that the government's decisions to increase HECS fees and to introduce $100,000 degrees are going to disenfranchise disadvantaged students. There is no doubt that the NUS, the National Union of Students, and its affiliates, the student associations at campus level, who wish to express their concern with respect to the policies of the Howard government are being targeted as a result of this bill.
The member for Flinders and others like to see this as an abstract argument about freedom of association and they want to put forward civil libertarian views as to why you should not compel anyone to be in an association. However, we know that that is not the intent of this bill. If we were concerned only about the way in which you may be accepted as a particular individual in a given group, there would be reviews of all sorts of things. You do not see the Treasurer and others in this place reviewing the way in which bar councils of Australia operate to exclude or disadvantage non bar council members—that is, those barristers who would choose not to be members of a bar council. The fact is that there are many associations that compel members of a particular group to be part of a collective, but we know the government always focuses upon attacking employee organisations and student associations, because it has the view that they are not an ally of the government. That is the reality, and that is why this bill is being introduced into this House. That is the intention of this government. 
I mention the Treasurer because we know the Treasurer has a bit of a fetish when it comes to student associations. We know he has had a fetish about student associations for more than a quarter of a century. We should remember that he was the chairperson of the Monash Association of Students. He was an active political leader, and some people say he earned his stripes in student politics.
—For Labor.
—That was when he was associating with the Labor Party. He was telling the people electing him that he was an associate of the Labor Party and the Labor club at campus level. That is what we know he was involved in 25 years ago. We also know he was about faking assaults. We know that after an alleged assault he went running off crying to the media. He had himself wrapped up in some sort of garb to suggest that he had been assaulted, for political advantage. We remember how he masqueraded to the daily media—that was one of his first media efforts, I think. We saw a very young Peter Costello, at that time pretending to be a Labor Party associate—a fellow traveller of this side of the chamber, not of a Tory party. I remember him being involved in student politics as an elected representative of a compulsory student union, and we do not forget that he faked an assault on himself so that he could promote himself in the media. We know a number of things about the Treasurer and about this government.
We know this bill is about the Treasurer wanting to destroy student unions because he fell out with them. We remember that he was a beneficiary, as a student political leader, of the student union—the Monash Association of Students—which people had to be a member of. He decided to be a beneficiary of it, but he obviously fell out with the Labor Party and clearly somewhere down the line he fell out with his support for student unions. I recall that in 1979, 25 years ago this year, the now Treasurer, then an officer of the Monash Association of Students—we know that back then he was a big supporter of student unions and the Labor Party—fell out with some people and chose to seek disaffiliation of Monash from the Australian Union of Students. I am told that the Treasurer gave it a pretty good shot and at the student general meeting did his best to convince the student body at large that they should disaffiliate from the Australian Union of Students. But he failed. He failed in his attempts to disaffiliate the university from the larger body, the predecessor to the National Union of Students, and I do not think he ever recovered. I do not think he ever forgave those students who wished to have a collective association that would put education and students' interests above other interests. He never fully accepted it.
So we on this side of the House know that one of the most fervent anti-student members of the House is indeed the Treasurer. We know that, because he is very happy to be involved in a process that will introduce $100,000 fees. We know that he is increasing HECS fees. I believe a lot of this goes back to the Treasurer's failure as a student politician and his shame that he started in the Labor Party and moved across to the Tories. There is a lot of the Treasurer wrapped up in this bill, from my point of view. I am aware that he has not recovered from his failure to disaffiliate his campus and his failure to destroy AUS.
Never mind listening to the member for Flinders telling us that this is about freedom of association. This is not a debate about civil libertarian views and about whether you should have collectivism or individual rights. This is about a government that wants to remove student dissent, that wants to diminish the capacity of organisations that represent students to say to the government: `What you're doing in education is disenfranchising the most disadvantaged students in this country.' That is what this bill is about: undermining the capacity of student unions in this country to say to their membership and to the country at large that the policies of the government are making it increasingly harder for people from socially and economically disadvantaged areas to go into tertiary education. 
If we do not have people in a position to be able to put their view then what sort of society are we living in? If it is the case that unions and student associations cannot speak on behalf of their constituent base, then this democracy is certainly threatened—certainly the democracy that we come into this place and boast about and proudly advocate. I think we are seriously going to undermine the capacity for democracy to properly operate in this country if, any time a particular group decides to criticise the government decision, the government tries to find ways to heavy, to verbal, to bully those associations. That is what we are seeing here. We saw it with the verballing of Mick Keelty, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. We have seen it with public servants. We have seen it with trade unions. We are now seeing it with student associations.
Student associations are not exactly unions. They are not trade unions. But we do know that the government has a blind spot. Once you utter the word `union' they go a little bit funny. I am sure that if I came in here and said that the institution of marriage is a union between a man and a woman and the government heard the word `union' they would vote against it. Because they hear the word `union' they cannot help but vote against whatever it is. Student associations are not trade unions. The bulk of the resources at the disposal of those associations is used for services for students. That is the reality of student associations. Most, if not all, students benefit as a result.
We have seen the heavy-handed approach that funding will be connected to ensuring there are no compulsory student unions, as the government would put it—that is, no right for people to be charged a service fee when enrolling in a student campus. We know that is the same approach that the Minister for Education, Science and Training put to the vice-chancellors in respect of AWAs. When it came to significant funding for the educational institutions of our land, I can recall—and I am sure most members on this side of the House can recall; those on the other side may not wish to recall—that the minister for education attached billions of dollars to a condition that would compel the universities to allow the introduction of AWAs.
Well over the majority, if not all, workers at the universities were not interested in AWAs. But the fact that this government is so ideologically predisposed to smashing unions means that it was willing to threaten the funding of billions of dollars to universities in order to introduce an industrial relations mechanism that was not being accepted at the workplace level. That is how ideologically driven this government is. It has a blind spot for any group that it believes is not acting in the interests of the government, not agreeing with the government, not a Uriah Heep who basically will accede to everything the government does.
This pattern of bullying, verballing and pressuring groups has become a hallmark of this government. It is time for this government to go. It is time for people to have another choice. It is time for the Australian community to ensure that they can stand up and criticise a government, criticise the Commonwealth, on a decision it may make, and not be punished. It is time that the retribution that is being handed out by this government to its perceived enemies stopped. Democracy will be worse off if we do not stop it. Democracy will suffer if we do not stop this approach that the government has embarked upon. Unfortunately, this bill is another means by which to punish those people perceived to be not in support of the government's policy position. 
They are some of the issues. To me, they are the substantial reasons for, and motives of, this government in introducing this bill. It is also important to note, as I say, that the organisations to which I refer are, in the end, mainly service providers. Based on a survey of its members, the Australasian Campus Union Managers Association, which is the peak body for service-providing organisations on campus, has estimated that if this legislation is passed at least 1,400 jobs will be lost, including hundreds in regional areas.
Student organisations also support students moving from regional areas by funding clubs and societies which provide a support network, orientation programs, assistance with finding accommodation and employment, emergency loans and advice, and representation if students are having difficulties with university processes. Some of the services likely to suffer under this legislation include student employment services, child care, welfare services, student leadership, student development and activities, orientation, transition to university, cultural development, information services, student lounges, meeting rooms, diaries, magazines, publications, student insurance, student loans, sport and recreation, commercial services, accommodation referral services, legal services, postgraduate support, mature age student support, safety shuttle buses, subsidised health services, resource centres, theatres and galleries, international student support, distance education support, visual and performing arts, new constructions, new businesses and, no doubt, new services.
The fact is that in the government's effort to silence dissent in the education area, in the government's attempt to attack what I know the Treasurer and others on the front bench believe to be an enemy of this government, it fails to understand what damage it will do to our campuses across the nation. The government fails to understand how many student services will be adversely affected if this bill is accepted by this place. Therefore, I ask the government to reconsider its position. I ask the executive—most, if not all, of whom were tertiary students—to reconsider their position. We are fortunate in this place. As a group we have a higher proportion of people who have been fortunate enough to go through post-secondary education. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Treasurer and others, including me, were beneficiaries of, effectively, a free education. It was an education provided by the taxpayers of Australia, hopefully to provide us with the capacity to do the right thing for this country. We have benefited from that.
Despite the personal experiences of the members of the executive of this government who have been clear beneficiaries of earlier policies, we have seen that this government are willing to move tertiary education out of the reach of most Australians. It is an absolute shame. I suppose I could understand it more if in their day they had done it tough and had scraped money together to make sure that they got to university. But in fact the opposite is true. In their day the Treasurer and the Minister for Education, Science and Training had a free education provided by the taxpayers of this country. Now they want to introduce an imposition that will make it virtually impossible for many people in economically and socially disadvantaged areas of this nation—however smart and hardworking they are—to ever get a degree. 
For some people, as the Leader of the Opposition has said time and time again, sometimes education is a passport out of poverty. Sometimes education is the only thing that allows people to get into areas which, without that education, they would not be able to access. So, on what could be the last day of this term, I ask the government and the executive, the beneficiaries of those earlier policies, to reconsider this bill. I ask them to reconsider, more fundamentally perhaps, what they are doing to fees and what effect that is having upon the tertiary students of this country or those people who wish to become tertiary students. I do not hold out much hope that that will change. There does not seem to be any particular concern shown by the Howard government towards students—or indeed towards workers, as we know. If this is the bill that we happen to finish on in this term, if it is the last day of the term, then I would hope that the government would reconsider their position so that campus services will still be there when their kids are going to university, and forevermore. I oppose the bill. I believe that the intent behind it is malevolent and pernicious. I believe that the government should reconsider their position, because this would be a shameful piece of legislation if enacted.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,42,1
"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I rise today to speak strongly in favour of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2003. I cannot help but comment on some of the comments made by the members for Rankin and Burke. The member for Rankin claimed that a student union is not really a student union; it is a student club. It is a very exclusive little club. In my day, when student union election time came around, less than 10 per cent of students voted in those elections. The reason less than 10 per cent of students voted was that it was totally irrelevant to their daily life and their study. Therefore, what we had was a totally unrepresentative group of student representatives, by and large. The member for Burke claimed that student unions have a constituency base. There is no legitimacy to their constituency base. You just have to look again at the number of students who actually bother to vote.
There is quite a peculiar attempt to hide the very nature of these student unions. Both the member for Rankin and the member for Burke claimed quite incorrectly that this side of the House objects to student unions because they have the word `union' in it. That is quite a facile argument. Don't those members and doesn't the opposition get it? This government and I have been strongly against compulsory student unions because of the word `compulsory'. They force students to pay union fees. It is the compulsory element of the money that feeds into these unions that totally takes away their legitimacy. Not to be outdone at all, the member for Burke came up with a phrase that would be worthy of inclusion in any modern text to rival George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four. He said, `There should be a right to be charged a service fee.' Fancy that! Instead of calling it a compulsorily acquired union fee, when it should really be called `No union fee, no education' or `no ticket, no start', he has turned around to call it a right to be charged a service fee. No thanks! A lot of students are saying, `You you can keep that right for Labor members of parliament but we don't want that so-called right to be charged a service fee.'
As a former vice-president of the Australian Liberal Students' Federation and former president of the Melbourne University Liberal Club, I did spend a significant amount of time in my formative political years promoting voluntary student unionism and opposing student unions forcing students to join a union. I did not want my money collected forcibly from me to be used in political campaigns with which I did not agree. Perhaps the passion with which I campaigned against compulsory student unionism gave me the taste and the belief that it was worth fighting for injustice and the things that were unfair. I am pleased to say that it was a terrible struggle and I am sure we will continue waging this battle. I was fortunate enough during those early years to work with a group of principled and determined Liberal students and others right across the country who were not daunted by the thuggery and threats of the leftist student movement. I recall a particular occasion when I was walking across campus to get the tram at night-time and the cowards who were my political opponents were hiding in the bushes and making obscene political comments across the concrete lawns of the University of Melbourne. And some of them have not really changed. I was particularly pleased to spend time in that battle with many wonderful and principled individuals, and I am particularly pleased that one of those former Liberal students is the member for Casey, who currently sits next to me in this chamber. 
It is also heartening to see in this place that others on this side of the House have subsequently joined that very passionate struggle for voluntary student unionism. The idea of compulsory association strikes at the heart of every Liberal. Liberal students have fought for decades to give tertiary students the choice of whether or not to join a student union. Unfortunately, the current situation is that you cannot enrol in a tertiary degree unless you pay money over to the student union. The description of this payment has varied over time and been called all sorts of seemingly innocuous words, but the unavoidable practicality is that on Australian campuses today there should be a neon light as soon as you enter that says, `no ticket, no start' because that is the practical reality.
It is important to note that currently in every state and territory throughout Australia, if a university student fails to pay their compulsory, non-academic union fee, they will be prevented from graduating. Regardless of whether a student uses the services and facilities provided by a student union, if they do not pay this fee, they will not graduate. At the very heart of this struggle is the basic premise that students are old enough to vote and intelligent enough to make decisions for themselves and participate as fully fledged adults in the community. And forcing them to join a student union is totally unconscionable and totally patronising.
Left wing students follow the beliefs that often underpin Labor politicians—that is, if people do not agree with you then they must be stupid, ignorant and undeserving of a voice. We saw many of them cry foul, whinge and abuse the Australian electorate on many occasions, particularly after losing an election, referendum battle or public debate. They abuse those who do not agree with them. They know that, if voluntary student unionism was introduced, they would be more accountable and would not be able to use the millions of dollars in compulsorily acquired union funds for their own pet political and often extremist projects.
In an era when compulsory unionism has all but disappeared from the employment sphere and only 17 per cent of private sector employees belong to a union, students are trapped in a time warp by Labor-run student union activists. The push to introduce a federal system of voluntary student unionism in Australia has a long history. Unfortunately, it has been a long history because there has not been successful legislation to give students the freedom to decide whether or not to join a union. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that struggle will continue as I am sure many Liberal students will continue the battle on campus, and I hope to see many of them join this House eventually. 
I have campaigned for voluntary student unionism all my political life. Whilst at the University of Melbourne, the Labor club reigned supreme and compulsory student union funds were used to build the careers of Labor Party hacks that are now scattered right across the country. The once great party of the working class was now attracting the guilt-tripping, elitely educated bourgeoisie students. Kim Beazley senior described the new class of Labor members as `the dregs of the middle class'.
It was not only the student leftist movement that leached money that had been effectively stolen from students. As students, our money was used—and the money of current students is still used—to fund political campaigns for Labor candidates. The member for Moncrieff eloquently outlined some of the shameful acts and shameful funding that has occurred in political campaigns using compulsorily acquired student union fees in Queensland.
I support this bill for many reasons. The most fundamental of these is that no individual in Australia should be forced to join any organisation against their will. No student should be forced to become a member of an association unless they choose to. No student should be required to pay money, directly or indirectly, to an association for services unless they choose to use those services. This bill supports the right of university students to freedom of association and it supports their right to freedom of choice on university campuses.
The role of campus organisations is significant, and student unions invest a great deal of effort in persuading students to adopt a point of view sympathetic to the support of unionism and its ideals. Despite their trusted position on campus, many—if not most—student unions often present a one-sided political debate. This bill will address the existing legislation which has allowed university administrators to be the shop stewards collecting compulsory student union fees and passing them on to the student union.
Membership of student unions is now compulsory in every state in Australia, and the cry from the Left is that student unions will collapse, essential student services will disappear, and panic and disaster will strike tertiary campuses. But this is not their main concern. We all know that they are crying crocodile tears, and they know the falseness of such assertions. What really upsets them is that, under voluntary student unionism, a different sort of student union would probably develop—one that was not cashed up and that did not play party politics or build the careers of political activists on ill-gotten gains.
There is one example of the success of voluntary student unionism. A great tribute needs to be paid to the Hon. Norman Moore MLC, the former Liberal minister for education in Western Australia. He had the courage of his convictions to give students in his state voluntary student unionism. Mr Moore will go down in history as one of the true believers who delivered freedom of association to students. This freedom was unfortunately short lived. From 1995 up until last year, 70,000 Western Australian university students enjoyed full voluntary unionism. Unfortunately, Labor Premier Geoff Gallop moved to abolish voluntary student unionism last year. Western Australia was the one state in Australia that gave university students the right to choose whether to join and fund a student union—or student guild, as they are called.
In yet another example of a Labor Premier taking a backward step, Premier Gallop reintroduced compulsory student unionism, dictating that all students automatically become members of the student guild upon enrolment and have to pay a so-called amenities fee—in other words, a union fee, but it is called an amenities fee as it does not sound as offensive. This is regardless of whether these students benefit from what the student union provides and the political causes that the student union supports. I can understand that the notion of freedom of association may be foreign to members of the Labor Party, given that their own constitution demands they maintain union membership. When she failed to maintain her union membership last year, I thought the member for Fremantle was perhaps ahead of her time and expressing her own democratic right to choose to maintain her union membership. Unfortunately, that was not the case. 
Students throughout Australia support this bill. A great number of university students do object to being forced to pay a student union fee, knowing that their money is diverted to political causes. The member for Lalor would know this, given that in the 1980s she was president of the Australian Union of Students—an organisation that proclaimed marriage was prostitution, and an organisation that collapsed, amongst much disgrace and financial mismanagement, and was reincarnated to now be known as the National Union of Students. No doubt the member for Lalor would be aware that the NUS actively funds a number of radical political causes, and student guilds over many decades have donated money to organisations like the Friends of Palestine, the Palestine Liberation Army and the Communist Party of Malaya, just to name a few.
Whether student union fees are used to produce information booklets promoting theft and how to use drugs or containing blatantly political campaign material, it should be students who decide whether it in their interests to join a union and to allow their money to be used for such campaigns. What is so offensive about that to the Labor Party? Voluntary student unionism will ensure student unions genuinely focus on the needs of their members. Rather than offering left wing political diatribe and second-rate canteen food, they will be forced to provide genuine services and facilities that students actually need, want and demand.
This bill on the abolition of up-front student union fees is a way of making student unions accountable and responsive to their constituency—students. The only unions that should be worried about the implementation of this bill are those student unions that are providing services that students do not want or need. The Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats tell us that voluntary student unionism will mean the end of student representation. The only thing that this bill will bring an end to is the rorting and abuse of student money by often incompetent and politically motivated student politicians. The significance of the mismanagement of student unions by their leftist boards should not be underestimated. My old stomping ground, Melbourne university, is testament to this.
—I fully expected members on the other side to try and drown me out, because they do not want to hear the disgraceful story that will unfold. A spectacular example of gross mismanagement and nepotism was recently exposed at the University of Melbourne. Last year, it was uncovered that in 2001 the student union entered into a contract with Optima. That contract was not disclosed to the union executive. An audit last year revealed that a contract had been entered into for a $44 million apartment complex. This contract purported to bind the university as a guarantor. Darren Ray, the signatory, and Scott Crawford, the former student union president, kept it secret. Both were members of the Labor club. The student union is now in liquidation, and the fraud squad are continuing their investigations. 
I join many others who wait quite anxiously in anticipation of what the fraud squad's final conclusions will be. I wonder what complex web of connections and associations they will uncover. I wonder whether they will find some connections to and associations with some of the Labor student politicians that I encountered when I was at Melbourne university. To my knowledge, Mr Scott Crawford is only the second student union president to be sacked. The first one to be sacked was Andrew Landeryou—an occasion I well remember, with great fondness. Both these young men were key activists for the Labor club on campus. It is interesting to note that the man generally considered to be the power behind Mr Landeryou was Mr David Feeney, who later went on to occupy the exalted position of State Secretary of the Victorian Labor Party. My, my, my, what a useful training ground! What a useful little cash cow compulsory student unions have been for the Labor club in the little sandpit of student politics!
What happened at Melbourne university? Out of a budget of $13 million, only $100,000 was put aside for clubs and societies—and this is despite what other members have said during this debate about it being so important to have compulsory student union fees because of things like clubs, societies and entertainment. Here we have $13 million, and only $100,000 of it is being spent on clubs and societies. Students who have been surveyed said they also want and enjoy student entertainment, but that only receives another $100,000. So a communications department is employing huge numbers of people putting out lots of material, but the essential services that students are demanding on this particular campus get a mere pittance.
Let us move to the other side of Melbourne. Recently, after the S-11 tragedy, the Monash Student Association used student money to produce stickers that read `Bomb the White House'. How repulsive, how unacceptable and how out of step with the mainstream student body. Interestingly, for as long as I can remember, left wing student unions have rallied on campus against up-front fees. Earlier this year there was a story in the West Australian about the Murdoch student guild occupying the university's Senate building in protest against full fee paying students and causing $12,000 worth of damage. The guild president, who orchestrated this antisocial behaviour, turned out to be one of those `permanent students' who had been studying for 12 years, and I would bet he has never protested against the up-front student guild membership fee that his union imposes on students.
With the guarantee of funding without accountability, student unions have become breeding grounds for the political fringe dwellers of campus communities who live in the dark, dim past of glorifying socialism and communism and encouraging antisocial behaviour with student money. How can we forget the infamous shoplifting article first published in La Trobe University's ratbag student newspaper Rabelais in May 1995—and in Melbourne university's student union publication—and then republished in universities across Australia? The four-page detailed guide instructing students how to shoplift was paid for by a student union with student money. Eventually, of course, charges were laid against the four La Trobe students responsible.
Under compulsory student unionism, student unions have become hostage to left wing extremists and myriad examples illustrate just how out of step they are with mainstream students. Take the ban on the sale of Nestle and Weston products at some university campuses, or the National Union of Students campaign last year that was titled `If Centrelink can't help, theft will'. 
This bill supports a strong and vibrant university atmosphere but, most importantly, it supports the fundamental principle of freedom of association—the freedom of an individual to choose whether or not to belong to a union. The government has tried to legislate to provide freedom of association within the area of industrial relations and it has been successful; it is time to give students that freedom as well.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
In my relatively short time as the Attorney--General, I have achieved a number of successes with which I am pleased— the passage of the first federal bill dealing with age discrimination, the announcement of child custody and family law initiatives and migration litigation reform amongst their number—but I have never been more satisfied than I was today when the Senate passed the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004, which is important legislation that will effectively mean that Australia is leading the world in implementing antiterrorism legislation designed to protect our community and thwart the possibility of a terrorist attack. I just emphasise in this context the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, article 3, which provides that we should respect the right to life but also the safety and security of a community. That is a very important obligation that has to be weighed up with other rights that are often mentioned in relation to counter-terrorism legislation. 
We are now at the forefront of international efforts to combat terrorism. The offence of `consorting' or `association' is not a new concept in law enforcement. New Zealand, Canada and France all have in place association offences which can be used to deal with those who associate with criminal gangs, such as terrorist organisations. I understand that similar legislation is being considered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
Early in my career as Attorney--General I announced that it was my intention to look at and, if appropriate, enact an offence of consorting with terrorists. When the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 was introduced into this chamber in June of this year, it had its critics. Even the shadow minister for homeland security became, I think, a little weak kneed when confronted with this bill and preferred to refer it for detailed consideration to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. My resolve in this matter was further strengthened when I came across words of support for this offence from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty, who said:
Terrorist organisations rely on support and assistance from outside their membership structures to exist. Importantly, our experience has shown that their capacity to use modern and emerging technologies is frightening. The proposed offence will help close the gap through which listed ... organisations use people outside their membership structure as a means of support and assistance.
The government's approach to calls from our law enforcement and security agencies for more effective laws has of course been strong, swift and decisive. The passage of this bill is an example of what can be achieved if there is sufficient will and strength. I know that our security and law enforcement agencies and those who recognise terrorism for the despicable scourge that it is today share my satisfaction.
The government carefully considered the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommendations and agreed to adopt a number of them. I am pleased that the Senate supported the government's amendments to give effect to those recommendations and agreed with our decision not to make amendments that undermine or otherwise reduce the effectiveness of the provisions dealing with associations, in particular. For example, we will not be extending the public religious worship exemption to the associations offence to include places of private worship. The blanket exemption of private worship would make enforcement difficult. It is easier for terrorist associations to occur under the cover of worship in a private setting. It should be noted that the exemption in its current form is sufficiently broad to cover any place being used for public worship. It is not confined to formal places of religious worship such as churches, temples, mosques or synagogues. Rather, the place is defined by reference to the type of activity taking place. Public religious worship takes place in the course of practising a religion whether it is in an outdoor setting or in a building. In any event, it should not be forgotten that what we are talking about here is an exemption. People genuinely engaged in private worship have nothing to fear, nor will they be relying on the exemption because they will not have met the essential elements that have to be satisfied to prove this offence. (Extension of time granted) Genuine worship will not be done with the intention of providing support to a terrorist organisation. 
The Senate agreed to four amendments that give effect to three of the committee's recommendations. The first makes clear that the presumption against bail inserted into the Crimes Act by the Anti-terrorism Act of 2004 does not apply to the offence of associating with terrorist organisations. The association offence has a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment. The government agreed that the presumption should not apply to this offence because it is much less serious than the other terrorism offences which have maximum penalties of between 10 years and life imprisonment or state offences such as homicide which have a similar presumption that applies.
The government also moved amendments to broaden the exemption of the provision of legal advice or representation where that advice or representation is provided to meet the obligations and exercise rights under other antiterrorism legislation. This includes legal advice concerning ASIO warrants procedure as well as proceedings for a review of a declaration relating to issue or the failure to issue—or to demanding the surrender—of a passport or other travel document. The Senate committee also recommended that provisions dealing with the transfer of prisoners for national security reasons not proceed until there is further consultation with the states. The government believes that the better approach is to enact schedule 4 in its current form and to treat the operational security transfer procedures as a separate exercise.
It is not desirable to have no legislation in place in the coming months. However, the government agreed to an interim measure that sees the transfer of prisoner provisions confined to those prisoners convicted of, and prisoners on remand in relation to, federal offences only. Officers from the Attorney-General's Department will continue to consult with state and territory officials to develop an appropriate model for the treatment of state and territory prisoners where there is a national security concern. It is my hope that there will be no national security concerns to do with state and territory prisoners in the meantime, but it is not the first time I have had to accept a less than ideal outcome.
An exemption also applies where the association is only for the purposes of providing aid of a humanitarian nature. Recommendation 6 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report on the bill recommended that the government report on types of aid contemplated by exemption. I am pleased to report on behalf of the government that this exemption would cover meeting members of an organisation to treat diseases or wounds. However, it would also cover someone who is meeting or communicating with members to assess medical needs of a group—activity of that nature would still be for the purpose of providing humanitarian aid. If someone was meeting members of a terrorist organisation to provide food aid through them to a community to prevent the starvation of children, the exemption would apply. Likewise, meeting with such people for the purpose of providing vaccinations for children against serious diseases and the provision of emergency shelter for refugees would be other examples covered by the exemption. In any case, those genuinely engaged in assistance for a humanitarian purpose have nothing to fear because of the proof of knowledge requirements related to the offence. Genuine humanitarian aid will not be given with the intention of providing support to a terrorist organisation. Finally, the committee recommended that an independent review of the proposed associating offence be conducted after three years. The government is able to undertake to this chamber that the review will be conducted not in three years but rather in conjunction with the review of new security related powers which is to occur three years after the passage of those provisions in July next year. 
This bill is a further contribution to the development and consolidation of counter-terrorism laws that are essential to ensure that the scourge of terrorism is confronted and dealt with. The job is not yet complete. Just as the security environment evolves and the threats we face become more sophisticated, so is the legislative framework an unfinished canvas. This bill reflects the reality that, in achieving justice, the safety and integrity of our society and its institutions must be ensured. Security is not anathema to our freedoms and liberties. Indeed, as we continue to witness the war on terror, security is absolutely an essential component of our rights and freedoms. This cannot be realised unless our security is assured. This is what this bill seeks to achieve. We can be proud of what we have achieved so far, but the job is not yet done. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee next week will report on another bill, the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004. I think it is a very important reform and I hope that we can reach an accommodation on that at an early stage because I think it is an important part of the measure of legislative matters that we need to comprehensively address.",REPS,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,43,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I will speak only briefly on the amendments to the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004, and do so in the absence of the shadow Attorney-General—in many ways to repudiate what I believe was quite a malicious and unwarranted slur directed towards him by the Attorney-General. The minister suggested that the shadow Attorney-General was weak kneed because he insisted that this legislation have some examination by a parliamentary committee. I think it degrades this parliament for it to be suggested that legislation proposed by any government is immune from parliamentary scrutiny.
We are not the clones or the creatures of the executive. We are elected here to give service to the public, and the minister ought withdraw what I believe was a scathing and completely disgraceful attack on the institutions of this parliament with that suggestion. Indeed, the minister adopted and now presents to the House, as improvements on his own legislation, measures which were inserted as a consequence of that parliamentary examination. It would have been unconscionable to have consorting offences carry with them unreviewable bail provisions. It would have been unintended and not acceptable to any person in this House that those who were the subject of investigation on ASIO related offences could not seek legal advice because their lawyers might be innocently swept up by consorting offences.
True it is that consorting offences do exist in a number of pieces of legislation. But, in every instance where consorting is introduced, we know it is perilously close to circumstances where persons who do no more than associate with those who have done wrong find themselves in jeopardy through the law. We are always careful, if we are secure in our responsibilities—not only to protect the nation from terrorism but also to respect the rights of our fellow citizens—not to allow such laws to trespass too far on the rights of our fellow citizens.
So I regret that the Attorney comes to this House—in circumstances where, as far as possible on national security and terrorism issues, we ought to seek the agreement of all members of this House, not just the major parties but all members of this House—and speaks in such a partisan way. The minister really does himself no service. He has an honourable tradition in this parliament of speaking up for broad human rights issues. He and I have shared many ventures together on that path. But, as we edge closer to an election, let us not disgrace our democracy by allowing such divisive language to be used—to suggest that you are weak kneed in the service of your community if you examine a proposal that the legislature has put forward. 
It is not the case that ministers are immune from error and that the legislation that they can propose cannot be improved by such examination. I wish it had been the case that I could have asserted that all legislation I proposed when I was in a similar position of responsibility to the minister was immune from improvement, but it was not. And, when such legislation was subjected to parliamentary committees, frequently I came back to the House and acknowledged that the legislation that I had put forward on behalf of the then government had been improved as a consequence. Indeed, I believe the honourable member, the minister, actually participated in some of those committees in improving such legislation that I put forward in a number of areas which improved law enforcement in this country.
So, if I can ask, in defence of the shadow minister, who unfortunately cannot be present in the House now—in the dying hours of this parliament before adjourn, perhaps, for the last time before an election is called—that in the discourse that occurs in the lead-up to the election we be at least a little bit civil and we recognise that it is the responsibility of this parliament to examine and test legislation that is ultimately proposed to this House to ensure it is not simply passed because of an assertion by the executive of the day that it suits the appropriate circumstances but rather because it has been tested and found appropriate for the needs.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-08-12,"—In the brief time I have available, I would like to raise a disturbing event that occurred in the new division of Gorton, which I hope to represent after the next election. This matter has had an extraordinary impact upon the whole nation, as I think it touches on one of our most elemental fears: the sudden disappearance of a child. I am speaking of course about the alleged abduction of baby Montana Barbaro at the Brimbank shopping centre last Saturday. The baby's parents, Anita Ciancio and Joe Barbaro, are obviously relieved to have their child returned to them alive and healthy, and I would like to offer my best wishes to them in their recovery from this traumatic event in the days and weeks to come.
I would like to say how grateful for and impressed I am by the performance of the police and emergency services in this matter, in combination with the media. The emergency was resolved in an extremely short time and with a minimum of extra trauma to the parents, which does the police and emergency services nothing but credit. I would also like to take the opportunity to commend a group which we are often eager to criticise in this place—namely, the media. Both the print and the electronic media reacted swiftly by spreading accurate information about the events at Brimbank and made it possible for a local to assist the police by passing on vital information that put baby Montana back in the arms of her mother. The local to whom I refer—a jogger, Lesley, I understand—happened to be passing the derelict North Melbourne house and alerted emergency services after she heard the baby's whimpering from outside. Her first thought upon hearing the child was that it must be the baby Montana, as she had heard the news reports. I am pleased to say that the matter is proceeding through the courts with a couple currently in custody. I hope the case passes through with a minimum of fuss and stress added to that already suffered by the parents.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,"<title>Barbaro, Montana</title>",Statements by Members,48,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-12,"—It is appropriate that the delegation is here with us this morning, because I would like to talk about a part of Australia that is larger in size than the United Kingdom. I refer to the 2,900 islands and reefs that make up the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park system. I would like to draw your attention to a pastoral letter from the Catholic bishops of Queensland—all seven of them. The Catholic bishops of Queensland wrote this pastoral letter to say to the people of Queensland, the people of Australia and indeed the people of the world that we have to do everything that we can to protect this wonderful asset that lies off the Queensland coast. I pay a tribute to the Catholic bishops for taking the stance that they do on this protection. The document says: 
As the Catholic bishops of Queensland, we have written this letter to emphasise our shared ecological responsibility for one of the greatest national natural treasures, the Great Barrier Reef. Care for the environment and a keener ecological awareness have become a key moral issue for the Christian conscience.
Good on them for standing up and saying that. They go on:
We cannot realistically love our neighbours and leave out the neighbourhood in which they live, nor can we pretend to respect that neighbourhood without understanding it is a life-sustaining environment.
Some in Queensland—indeed, some in Australia—really think that the government did the wrong thing in relation to the Representative Areas Program. For the information of the delegation here today, the government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which manages the reef system, embarked on a process to lock up more than 30 per cent of the reef system as representative areas so that future generations could have examples of the ecosystems of the reef and, of course, to make the reef system sustainable.
It was done on a sound scientific basis. It was questioned by those who felt that you could rape and pillage and do whatever you wanted to do in the environment—those who felt that it was their right and that the government should not interfere. The government should interfere. The government has a responsibility, as the Catholic bishops quite rightly point out, to make sure that our environment and our wonderful Great Barrier Reef are protected for future generations. I know that it has been a wonderful exercise and that we are the envy of the world in what we have been able to do. I encourage the members of the delegation to have a closer look at that to see what you might be able to do in your part of the world.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Environment: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park</title>,Statements by Members,50,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-08-12,"—I would like to speak today in the adjournment debate about a survey on health that I recently carried out in my electorate of New England. The survey, comprising six questions, was answered by 8,380 people within the electorate. I thank those people for the effort that they put in not only in responding to the survey but also in writing letters, many of which related personal experiences with respect to the delivery of health care—the problems, the good points et cetera. As I said, 8,380 people responded to the survey, which is about a 16 per cent response rate on the number of surveys that we sent out. I think it was an excellent response; it was similar to that received to a survey on Telstra a couple of years ago.
I would like to go through the results of that survey. As many members would know, there is currently a merger process going on with some of the area health services within New South Wales. Even though it is essentially a state issue it could have some federal implications further down the track. The merger process that was under way at the time was between the New England Area Health Service and the Hunter Area Health Service. Asked whether they supported that merger, 93 per cent of the respondents said no, 2.3 per cent said yes and 4.7 per cent were undecided. 
The other issues that were canvassed were in relation to dental health. On the question `Should dental health work be covered by Medicare?' 92 per cent of the respondents said yes, five per cent said no and three per cent were undecided. That is a very appropriate question to ask at this particular time. At the recent budget, the government made some positive moves in the right direction to include some aspects of dental care under Medicare. I do not think that has gone far enough. I understand that the Labor Party are moving in a further direction in relation to that as well. I would encourage both the government and the opposition to look very carefully at the results of this survey and particularly at the issue of dental care. If we do not look after oral health we are going to end up with some enormous expenses further down the track in terms of bodily health. It amazes me that we have not included dental health in Medicare in the past.
Bulk-billing is another significant issue. I asked the question, `Does your local doctor bulk-bill?' and 34.6 per cent said yes, 58.2 per cent said no and 7.2 per cent did not know, so obviously they are in good health and are not going to their doctors. Those figures are quite alarming. I ask the Minister for Health and Ageing to release the bulk-billing figures. I know that they have changed the rulings on that recently. I think the December ruling was that about 47 per cent of New England doctors were bulk-billing. This survey indicates that it is not improving, and we need to take these figures on board.
I asked, `Which level of government do you want in charge of our hospitals?' I apologise for this question because I think it was actually interpreted in slightly different ways. I know that debate is taking place at the moment between the Commonwealth health minister and the state ministers. The answer is interesting, but, because of the way the question was framed, I do not know whether we can take a lot from it. A lot of people in New England are very upset with the Carr Labor government at the moment, with the health merger, and that had some impact on the way in which this question was answered. Forty-one per cent said that they would rather see the federal government take charge of our health system, 20 per cent said the state government, 24 per cent said the local government—that is where there is a bit of a merging of the question—and 15 per cent were undecided.
Another issue of great importance—and I highlight this one—is that people would vote for an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to two per cent. Eighty-one per cent of people said that they would vote for that. Ninety-one per cent said that they wanted the University of New England to be the facility for a medical school and allied health services in order to train and retain doctors and allied health service professionals within country areas.
