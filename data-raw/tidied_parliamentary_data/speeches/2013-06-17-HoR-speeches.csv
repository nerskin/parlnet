The SPEAKER
 (10:01):  Just before I call the first member, I do have a matter of privilege to clear up. On 6 June 2013, the Leader of the Opposition raised a matter of privilege in relation to a matter of public importance not being proceeded with earlier on that sitting day. 


As a background to this matter, on 6 June 2013 I received two proposals for matters of public importance to be discussed: one from the member for Throsby and one from the Leader of the Opposition. As required by the standing orders and practice, I selected the matter I considered should be proposed to the House for discussion—namely, the matter proposed by the member for Throsby. At the time for the MPI, again in accordance with the standing orders, I read the proposed matter to the House. As neither the proposer was in attendance to support it nor an additional seven members standing to support it, as required by the standing orders, the matter lapsed. It was not open to me under the standing orders to propose another matter for discussion.


As far as I can ascertain, the only circumstances in which a proposer has not been in the chamber to support their matter of public importance has been where there has been some misadventure or other processes of the House have prevented them from being present.


I do not consider the action of a proposer of a matter of public importance in absenting themselves from the chamber, either deliberately or not, when the matter is read out gives rise to any issue of contempt such as would warrant precedence being given to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests. 


However, matters of public importance are a significant part of the House's proceedings and I believe that all members should show respect for the processes of the House. These processes allow important opportunities for all members and all members should recognise this.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:09):  As the deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Gambling Reform, it is a great pleasure to speak on the tabling of the committee's fifth report today. This report covered the area of advertising and promotion of gambling services in sport and a related bill. 


Although the committee heard that children are not directly targeted, the committee is concerned about children being exposed to the advertising for an adult product, the messages being consumed and what effect this may have on future behaviour. It is also concerned about other vulnerable people, such as problem gamblers. 


The government is well aware of the level of community concern regarding the promotion of live odds. In May 2011, the government announced that it would work with the sporting and betting industries to reduce and control the promotion of live odds during sports coverage through amendments to existing industry codes. On 29 June 2012, the minister announced an agreement had been reached with the commercial and subscription broadcasters to reduce and control the promotion of live odds during sports. Free TV and ASTRA released the proposed amendments to their codes on 22 April 2013 for public comment before 20 May. During this process, the government took additional action to respond to a level of concern in the community, and on 26 May the Prime Minister announced that live odds would be banned. In addition, all generic gambling advertisements will be banned during play. Generic advertising will only be allowed during scheduled commercial breaks, such as quarter or half time and before or after the game.


The government has indicated that it will monitor the intensity of generic gambling advertisements and, if it is found to be beyond reasonable levels, will impose a total advertising ban. The industry is on notice to respond appropriately to the level of community concern and to reflect community expectations. In case further steps become necessary, the committee noted the exemption for gambling advertising for sporting programs and recommended that this exemption be reviewed. This process will provide for appropriate consultation with the community and stakeholders and should also serve to articulate and provide greater clarity around the reasons for this exemption and whether it is meeting its intended purpose.


The committee noted the need for the industry to be part of the solution. There are other industry codes that could potentially cover this issue, and the committee recommended that government review the self-regulatory action being taken by industry with a view to legislating in this area if industry does not make appropriate changes regarding the promotion of gambling products in an environment that includes children.


The link with betting raises issues for the integrity of sport. The committee received a comprehensive briefing from the Australian Crime Commission about the infiltration of sport by organised crime. While the ACC has not conducted specific in-depth analysis of the relationship between organised crime and online gambling, it has nonetheless identified vulnerabilities for the sector, through its broader work on methodologies used by organised crime. The committee was pleased to hear general acknowledgement that the integrity of sport is the overriding concern and that action is underway by the stakeholders to put in place processes to strengthen the environment against organised crime. The committee acknowledges the role of the betting agencies here to alert authorities to irregular betting. I note that in October 2012 the government established the National Integrity of Sport Unit, and it is currently working with sporting codes, the betting industry, state and territory regulators, and justice and law enforcement agencies to ensure that sports have the systems in place to monitor and report on players' and officials' activities; that sporting codes have education programs in place to prevent match fixing; that a betting industry standard for information exchange is developed; that there is a national approach to regulation; that there is consistent criminal legislation being implemented; and that a rapid, nationally coordinated response is available, assisting sports codes experiencing integrity issues. Safeguarding the integrity of sport in Australia is of utmost importance, and the committee supports the current work underway. The committee also noted the importance of ensuring that amateur sport has the resources and tools available to increase awareness by participants of the risks and threats to the integrity of their sport.


It has again been a privilege to be the deputy chair of this committee and to see the tabling of its fifth report. I want to thank the member for Denison for very capably chairing the committee and for running the inquiry very smoothly. I would also take the opportunity to thank the secretariat for their exceptional work. I also thank all those who contributed to the inquiry and I commend the report to the House.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:14):  Speaker, on behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, I present the committee's fifth report, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled The advertising and promotion of gambling services in sport: Broadcasting Services Amendment (Advertising for Sports Betting) Bill 2013, together with evidence received by the committee.


It is clear that there is considerable concern in the community about the proliferation of advertising for sports-betting services, and I share that concern. Children in particular are being constantly bombarded with advertising for gambling, just about every time they watch sport, even though the wagering organisations say children are not being directly targeted. Targeted or not, our children sure are being exposed, which is normalising gambling for them and resulting in stories like the one the committee heard about young people now not talking about their team's form but, instead, their team's odds.


The committee welcomed the announcement on 26 May about the so-called ban on live odds. It is a step forward, but I would quickly add that this is one of the areas where I diverge from the committee report, because I believe that the government's move does not go nearly far enough and has come much too late, given the obvious concerns in the community. In fact, from the time of the first announcement about reform in May 2011 to an industry code amendment being in place, it is likely to take over two years, and that is clearly way too long.


The committee's second report concluded that a total ban on the promotion of live odds should be underpinned by legislation. I maintain this position, not least because it was only overwhelming community concern that forced the government to act to ban live odds. This so-called ban is really only the threat of legislation and, in any case, the industry simply cannot be counted on to limit any reform to any more than the minimum that it can get away with. Furthermore, live odds is really only a subset of gambling advertising.


Generic advertising will still be allowed during sports broadcasts during the day, even though the current broadcasting restrictions were developed to ensure that gambling and sports-betting advertisements would not be placed in programs likely to have an audience of children. The research shows that it is difficult for children to clearly distinguish commentators and bookmakers, that children are consuming brand messaging and that the brands are becoming part of the way they talk about sport. In line with the public health approach to gambling, we should not wait for more problems to occur but, instead, we should take a cautious approach, particularly as research shows children are so vulnerable to advertising. To the same end, gambling promotion on the uniforms of senior teams should also be banned. The players are, after all, role models to children and the messages on their jumpers are on the screen all of the time, and the net effect on children is mightily powerful.


More broadly, the association of sport and gambling draws attention to the need to ensure the integrity of sport, so the committee was pleased to learn that a considerable effort is in fact being expended to ensure that the threat to integrity in sport is being addressed before the problem escalates further. In particular, the committee commends the initiatives being implemented by sporting codes in relation to the threats and vulnerabilities identified by the Australian Crime Commission.


The committee was not pleased to hear of the introduction of online gambling on amateur sporting events. For example, there were reports of betting agencies offering live odds on amateur competitions here in Canberra. Clearly, amateur sports are not adequately resourced to address the integrity risks that this brings, so the committee has recommended drawing on the integrity tools and resources being developed by the National Integrity of Sport Unit for professional sporting codes and has recommended resources be, in fact, developed for amateur sport.


In closing, I add that the committee's work on sports betting has been a valuable opportunity to learn about the new forms of gambling, which are growing rapidly. Now is the time to reduce the harm before it becomes unassailable. The committee received 52 submissions and heard from a variety of interested stakeholders. I sincerely thank all of those who contributed. I would also like to thank the committee members for their involvement and the deputy chair in particular during this inquiry. I also thank the secretariat who once again provided invaluable support of the highest standard. I commend the report to the House.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2013-06-17,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:41):  I present the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Strengthening Rules About Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2013 and the explanatory memorandum.


This is the bill that puts to the House sensible extensions of our existing competition and consumer laws to give real results to all industry and business concerned about their ability to compete with the two major supermarkets that have more than 80 per cent of the grocery market in Australia. It is strengthening and empowering competition and consumer laws in Australia, as opposed to attacking them. I was a member of the New South Wales parliament when dairy deregulation occurred at the start of this millennium. I did not like it at the time due to a number of issues, including the loss of the all milk levy and one of the quirks of that meant that we lost the best TV ads going around promoting fresh milk. But, as well, and more importantly, the pressure that deregulation placed on many smaller dairies in regions such as the one that I represent has, nearly 15 years later, seen a large exodus from the industry by many people with generations of commitment to the dairy industry. Those days have now passed.


We are now more than 15 years beyond that and since deregulation, I have been approached by farmers continually concerned about their ability to participate still in the fresh milk market. Never have these concerns been more grave in recent times than when the major supermarkets decided to enter into a price war for one litre of milk, slashing the cost and selling it and $1 a litre, which from a consumer point of view, is less than the cost of the bottled water appearing on the very same shelves at the very same time. There has been an inquiry by ASIC, an inquiry by the Senate, a private member's bill for re-regulation of the dairy industry from a colleague and widespread condemnation of the actions of the major supermarkets over this in a loss leader strategy to try to get people in the door to buy the cheap milk as an essential and not realise that other products have gone up on the back shelves, and really prices have not changed at all. It is a nice marketing gimmick that has impacts on the supply chain and on the dairy industry.


There have not been sensible regulations that do not impose inflexible rules on a flexible market.


In my electorate, I still have a large number of dairy farmers. I have proactive entrepreneurial dairy farmers in my region, dairy farmers who were understandably concerned about the prices on offer—a price war that has not ended and that they now believe is impacting on milk contract prices about to be renegotiated. 


Farmers from my electorate have joined a new organisation called Dairy Connect. At the beginning of the year, some of these local farmers came to see me. I was impressed that they did not come to me asking for a return to protectionist measures. They wanted real measures to look through deals taking place between supermarkets and large processors and right through the supply chain and the market that they believed was having an impact on their ability to farm. 


The ACCC under current legislation looks at negotiations between large supermarkets and large processors. There is equity in bargaining power. The consumer certainly wins in the short term. But there remains genuine concern that in the long term farmers will leave the market; competition among them will be destroyed; and the result for consumers will be higher prices. These concerns echo concerns that have come up before—for example, with petrol discounting. The consumer wins in the short term. But, if too many smaller petrol stations leave the market, will this lessening of competition lead to higher prices in the future? Evidence over the last decade seems to suggest the answer is yes. Another example is supermarkets diversifying their business and causing concern about how their power in the grocery market will affect the new markets they are entering. Now, at a retail level in the grab for market share in many communities, the major players are going into anything and everything at a retail level, from video shops to clothing, you name it, the small retail operator is certainly now being directly challenged. There is also own-brand labelling and the drive for all produce to go to larger processors who can label with own-brand; again there are short-term benefits for consumers but a lack of a conversation around the long-term implications for consumers and community. 


I have always been a big believer in the power of the market, wherever possible, to help itself, but the market always needs rules that work. I am excited about the market in dairy—for example, in my electorate a group of farmers have taken the initiative and collectively bargained with Woolworths. Norco—dairy farmer owned and operated—which sources milk from the Manning Valley, has come to a supply agreement with Coles. That is great proof that, for all markets concerned about duopolies, there are genuine market solutions that do not require a blunt legislative instrument all the time. But—and I do emphasise this 'but'—that is the point of this legislation: Genuine bargaining assumes a level playing field which we definitely do not have. There is still at the very least the perception of inequity and anticompetitive behaviour. 


These changes to the competition and consumer legislation are about: (1) making sure that tests to be caught by the anticompetitive behaviour clauses in current laws extend to both broader market impacts and future consequences with a 'reasonably likely' test; (2) ensuring that the ACCC can compel the holders of the documentary evidence—that is, the supermarkets themselves—to produce all relevant documents, not just the end stage contracts, and this has been a issue in competition law in the courts for some time; (3) trying to get around what are real issues and what are perception issues by compelling the creation of a supply chain impact statement from those seeking greater market power. 


I see these as sensible regulatory changes under current law. They do not interfere with markets. They do open up the mystery around contracting and providing opportunity for the big players, if they truly have nothing to hide, to change perceptions. I am putting the broader issue now to both the government and the opposition and certainly look for support in those regards. As well, alongside and in parallel with this legislation, we need broader trade in international market work on behalf of dairy farmers. More work needs to be done at the grassroots level to ensure ways to get our fresh produce, including beef and dairy, into the emerging markets of middle-class Asia, and I think governments across the board can do more on that front.


We do need that development of the code that has been talked about for some time, with appropriate ACCC oversight and a broader use of the Produce and Grocery Ombudsman. We do need to look at the use of existing primary production R&D levies and government contributions to ensure development of markets is receiving its fair share of revenue and reviewing the operation of bodies funded by compulsory levies. We do need development assistance programs for primary producers that help them to do what some small groups of dairy farmers have done, and that is explore market solutions to recognise problems. The challenge has been that primary producers are recognised as being absolutely stretched in the operation of their on-the-ground businesses and do not always have the skills, the resources or the capacity to negotiate with the big end of town.


So I put before the House this sensible bill that extends the role of the ACCC. Most think they already have the powers to do this when in reality they do not. As a consequence, in the long-term consumers are being let down. I would hope that this 43rd parliament—which has passed so much legislation and a lot of legislation in a bipartisan manner—can look at this legislation, see the sense in opening up these relationships and make this another piece of legislation in the interests of consumers, farmers and suppliers and strengthen our existing competition laws. I commend this bill to the House.

More work needs to be done at the grassroots level to ensure ways to get our fresh produce, including beef and dairy, into the emerging markets of middle-class Asia, and I think governments across the board can do more on that front.


We do need that development of the code that has been talked about for some time, with appropriate ACCC oversight and a broader use of the Produce and Grocery Ombudsman. We do need to look at the use of existing primary production R&D levies and government contributions to ensure development of markets is receiving its fair share of revenue and reviewing the operation of bodies funded by compulsory levies. We do need development assistance programs for primary producers that help them to do what some small groups of dairy farmers have done, and that is explore market solutions to recognise problems. The challenge has been that primary producers are recognised as being absolutely stretched in the operation of their on-the-ground businesses and do not always have the skills, the resources or the capacity to negotiate with the big end of town.


So I put before the House this sensible bill that extends the role of the ACCC. Most think they already have the powers to do this when in reality they do not. As a consequence, in the long-term consumers are being let down. I would hope that this 43rd parliament—which has passed so much legislation and a lot of legislation in a bipartisan manner—can look at this legislation, see the sense in opening up these relationships and make this another piece of legislation in the interests of consumers, farmers and suppliers and strengthen our existing competition laws. I commend this bill to the House.


Bill read a first time.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?




Mr Sidebottom:
  I second the motion.




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  I particularly notice the attendance of the Ambassador of Peru, Luis Quesada, and I also note the extremely active Consul General in Sydney, Elizabeth Castro, who is certainly doing a significant amount of work to make sure that this 50th anniversary is noteworthy in Sydney.


I also note that 50 years of diplomatic relations between Peru and Australia has certainly been significantly recognised in Peru itself. On 30 January this year, those 50 years were recognised by an event at our embassy in Lima attended by 480 guests, including the Foreign Minister of Peru, Rafael Roncagliolo. The Congress of Peru on 9 May passed a congratulatory resolution, which was taken to the embassy by Victor Isla Rojas.


Today we recognise 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Obviously, there are many connections. We share borders with the largest ocean on this Earth—the Pacific, which covers 46 per cent of the world's water. We have a strong Indigenous population—in the case of Peru a far higher proportion than our own. Both countries are troubled by the struggle for equity of these people. We are both heavily dependent upon extractive mining, which tends to cause a degree of dislocation in our economies, and we have very strong ties. Through representative diplomats—in our case through Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, the former Australian Leader of the Opposition, and in their case through former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar—we have also had significant roles on the international stage with regard to United Nations activities.


Our relations of 50 years involved, on our part, an embassy in Lima from 1968 to 1986. It was closed, but it is pleasing that it was reopened in 2010. It is important not only for Peru but also for large parts of South America with regard to immigration and other matters. In the case of Peru we are the 30th export source and the 39th import source. Peru has a population of 30 million—not that far distant from our own. Both countries have been very strong on international diplomatic fronts: Peru involved in the United Nations, APEC, the IMF, the WTO and the Organisation of American States, and this year it is the chair of the Union of South American Nations. We also bear common membership of the Pacific Alliance Forum.


Both countries are heavily dependent on extractive industries. In the case of Peru they make up 63 per cent of the total merchandise exports for that sector. The CIA handbook for the last year said of Peru:


The Peruvian economy has been growing by an average of 6.4% per year since 2002 with a stable/slightly appreciating exchange rate and low inflation, which in 2013 is expected to be below the upper limit of the Central Bank target range of 1 to 3%. Growth has been in the 6-9% range for the last three years, due partly to a leap in private investment, especially in the extractive sector, which accounts for more than 60% of Peru's total exports. 


There is the question of how you finance investment, development and infrastructure in a mining industry, and it is worthwhile noting that Australian companies have $1.7 billion invested in the country, and $5 billion worth of new projects pending. When we hear people talking about foreign countries investing in Australia and what they own with regard to mineral sectors, it is important to note that Australian companies are themselves very active in other nations. We are in the top 10 investor sources for Peru.


There are other facets to our relationship, and one of them is migration. There are approximately 6,800 people in this country who claim Peruvian ancestry—a medium group by the standards of Australian migration diasporas—and of those a high proportion were born in Peru rather than being Australian-Peruvians born of parents from Peru. In my own electorate there are only 286.


People-to-people relationships are important, and I will talk briefly about three typical people I know who have migrated to this country. Francisca and Felix Grau have been known to me for the last decade or so. They are hardworking people: Felix is a handyman at a private school in Sydney and his wife is a trained teacher. They are people who make sure they try to enhance Australia's knowledge of their country through heavy involvement in music, dance and drama productions that they and friends put on in the Parramatta region. I have also known Isabel Almendrades for approximately two decades. She is a social worker who has been very involved with women's issues and with migrant needs in both North Sydney and Western Sydney. These are typical of migration sources, and typical of people who help build up a country.


The relationship between the countries takes many forms. It is worth noting that a very strong accent has recently been on educational efforts. Recently we have had applications for AusAID's Australian award scholarships for Latin America. They opened in February and closed on 30 April. These are very important. We also as a country have the Australia Latin America leadership program taking place in Australia in October this year. Young leaders from Peru and Bolivia between the ages of 28 and 42 with at least eight years work experience benefit from the program in terms of getting to know Australia and Australian participants and working with other young leaders from Latin America. We will select 24 people from both countries to make sure that this exchange between the countries is valuable.


Another aspect of relations between the countries is the question of volunteers. Every day of the week you hear about those people who have a change of lifestyle. One of my wife's relatives the other week, a well-paid chef in a London restaurant earning big bucks, suddenly became connected with an African village and was running a small fundraiser in Parramatta the other day to make sure that water and education will be provided. In Peru at the moment there are 12 Australian government-funded volunteers working there and many NGOs and religious orders. For instance, two Sisters of Mercy, Patricia McDermott and Joan Doyle, have just left Peru after devoting 17 years to changing the lives particularly of women and children in Candela, north of Lima. I notice that recently in the Queen's Birthday awards one person in Western Sydney in close proximity to where I live was recognised for those kinds of efforts.


We salute today Peru's historic liberation in 1821 from Spanish control. The efforts of Jose San Martin and Simon Bolivar headed a struggle that involved a multiethnic effort to replace the Spanish regime. As I noted earlier, on the world stage in recent years Peru has very much punched above its weight in a variety of international fora. The country also holds attractions for Australia in regard to investments in a number of other industries: energy, airports and traffic systems, agribusiness, sugar, dairy and gourmet foods. Australia is of course aware of Peru's arrival in a big way on the international gourmet cooking front. Agricultural equipment, genetics and veterinary products are also seen by Australia, along with environmental management, as being areas in which there can be development by Australian investment.


As of December last year there were 1,700 students enrolled in Australian universities. These are apart from those scholarships I talked about before, being students who have financed themselves. That is another significant way in which we can develop contacts between our two countries. Ex-president Garcia has visited Australia and back in 1975 Gough Whitlam enhanced Australia's contacts with the continent by a visit to Peru. I salute the efforts of Peru since its independence in 1821 and more particularly over the period that Australia and Peru have had diplomatic relations. These are important ties which are part of our wider engagement with South and Central America. Lima is indeed, through the embassy, an important stage post in that relationship. I also recognise that Peru's diplomats in Australia will make sure that that the Peruvian community is aware of these 50 years of ties and has an opportunity to participate in festivities and to drive home the connection between the two countries.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Government Whip) (11:23):  I would like to thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this motion before the parliament in recognition of the 50 years of diplomatic relations between Australia and Peru. We enjoy very good relations between our two countries and it stems from our shared common values, particularly in freedom, liberty and the transparency of government. We also share a commitment to global cooperation through membership of organisations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation, APEC and others. Our relationship has been integral to developing our participation in those bodies. 


The two nations also share a commitment to tackling such issues as environmental issues, fisheries management, international law enforcement and transnational crime. Madam Deputy Speaker Grierson, you and I are aware of their cooperation in respect of those latter matters, being former members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Law Enforcement.


Among the things I would also like to talk about in the limited time I have today are our educational ties. These continue to grow between our Australian universities through agreements with their Peruvian counterparts. There is certainly a successful scheme in place at present that sees the exchange of post-graduate students. At the moment, our trade in exports is also up from 2011-12 to about $244 million.


Like Australia, Peru is also a resource-rich country. Mining is a vital part of Peru's economic development and is a significant contributor to its GDP, much as it is in Australia. In fact, Peru is ranked amongst the top five global producers of minerals and metals such as lead, silver, zinc, tin, gold and copper. That naturally attracts the interest and involvement of companies operating in Australia, such as BHP Billiton and Xstrata. 


As I understand it, there are about 8,500 Peruvian-born citizens in Australia. Whilst I have the honour of representing the most multicultural electorate in the country, the Peruvian community in my electorate is relatively small, especially compared to the Vietnamese, Chinese and those of Arabic-speaking backgrounds. However, although small this community has a very strong representation in local organisations looking after the interests of individuals and various Latin-American speaking groups in my community. For instance, Community Action Services Australia, CASA, is a local not-for-profit organisation representing Australians with a framework of diverse multiculturalism. I have known CASA over the last few years, have seen them on several occasions and have visited their premises at Fairfield Heights. They provide assistance, guidance and under the leadership of their executive officer Marta Faggiano they aim to assist, particularly, disabled people, those with hearing problems and people from Latin-American speaking backgrounds. In addition to a very comprehensive settlement grants program, this organisation has expanded its services to assist those who are unemployed, families, single parents, aged migrants and refugees. Their concentration is on those people coming from Latin-American speaking backgrounds.


Another local organisation offering support and assistance to members of the Spanish and Latin-American communities, including the Peruvian community, is the Spanish and Latin American Association for Social Assistance, known as SLASA. Under the leadership of its president Yvonne Santalucia, SLASA assists migrants and refugees when they settle in Australia. I recently had the opportunity to support this organisation's application for a program to provide Spanish-speaking men in the Fairfield LGA with services and educational activities in relation to health and social issues. As most of us would acknowledge, men are generally known to be a little more reluctant to discuss issues of health, particularly mental health, and therefore this organisation has concentrated on making sure these issues simply do not fall through the cracks and are addressed. I have nothing but praise for the Peruvian community. The fact that they take on leadership not only in Peru but also what they do here in Australia is a credit to them. (Time expired)

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:28):  I thank my colleagues from across the chamber, Mr Ferguson and Mr Hayes, for the opportunity to speak today about the importance of Australia's relationship with Peru. It is very timely that we are discussing this motion, as we celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations with Peru in the year 2013. In the time available to me this morning I wish to touch upon three aspects: the first is our investment relationship; the second is our developing tourist trade; and the third is the educational connections between our two countries.


Australia is one of the very important investors in Peru. Many in this place would be aware that, since 1997, Australia and Peru have had a bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement. This is indeed very important. Peru has an open investment regime and abundant natural resources—much like Australia—which makes it an attractive destination for Australian investment. Perhaps people would not be aware that there are many Australian companies with offices in Peru, and they are heavily involved in the mining sector. In fact, Australian investment is estimated by our authorities here to be at least $1.7 billion, with around $5 billion in new projects pending. This makes Australia amongst Peru's top 10 investors. This is indeed very significant.


We also find Peru to be a very attractive destination for tourism. Any Australian setting out today to do the world tour is lured by that wonderful trek, Machu Picchu. It is usually amongst the top international tourist destinations that many young Australians want to experience. Around 30,000 Australians travelled to Peru in 2011 and 2012, and the vast bulk of those were travelling to see Machu Picchu and all the other wonderful tourist destinations Peru has to offer.


The final point I want to raise today, in addition to the investment and tourism relationships that we have developed over time, is that we have had significant cooperation on the issue of education. In 2006, during the previous coalition government, Australia and Peru signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in education, and our educational ties are in fact growing.


Many would be aware that, in the very beginning, when the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, was thinking about our foreign policy, he devised the Colombo Plan, to get the best and brightest from around the world and educate them here in Australia. The current shadow foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has tweaked that plan and we have now in place a policy, a reverse Colombo Plan, to not only educate in our country, in our higher educational institutions, the best and brightest from around the world but also to send our best and brightest out into the world and to help them experience all that the world has to offer. I am confident that, with the plan we will develop in government, there will be an opportunity for some of our best and brightest who wish to study in Peru to do just that.


Australia has a very good relationship with Peru. We are celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations, and I am sure we will celebrate many more in the future. Our investment in Peru is very strong, and our tourist links are growing stronger, as are our educational links. We look forward to continuing strong diplomatic relations with Peru in the years to come.

Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (11:55):  I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to South Africa and Zambia in April 2013, and seek leave to make some very brief comments.


Leave granted.




Mr SECKER:
  This was a fairly arduous delegation visit over a short period, thankfully, with only three members of the delegation. There was a lot of hard work and we had to share the same load between three instead of the normal number of five people. I would hope that having three members of a delegation is not the norm for future delegations. I thank the secretariat. John Studholme did a brilliant job, particularly considering that that was the first delegation visit that he had been part of.


As noted in the report, the delegation members worked well as a team. In the past I have been somewhat critical of some of the AusAID projects that I have seen while on delegation visits, but I would have to say that, from the projects we saw during this visit, which are noted in the report, I thought AusAID money was being spent very well. So I congratulate those involved in making sure that that money was spent wisely. I think Australia can be proud of the work they are doing both in South Africa and in Zambia.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:57):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, I present the committee's final report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Review of the rollout of the National Broadband Network (Fifth report), together with the minutes of proceedings.


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  by leave—I present the fifth report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, entitled Review of the rollout of the National Broadband Network, covering 1 July to 31 December 2012 as well as other issues reported after this period. During its fifth review, the committee examined the ongoing National Broadband Network rollout of fibre, fixed-wireless and satellite services, performance reporting, the potential of private equity to fund the NBN, and Telstra workforce issues associated with the retraining funding deed under the Telstra agreement. The committee made five recommendations. 


During this period, NBN Co. informed the oversight committee that it would revise its corporate plan targets shortly for the fibre rollout to take into account around a 12-week delay. The delay has been attributed to a slower rate of rollout progress on the ground by contractors than was originally forecast and is not expected to delay the overall time frame nor affect the total cost of the project. It is important to repeat that, despite in the short term a 12-week delay, it is not expected to delay the overall time frame nor affect the total cost of the project.


In terms of the NBN rollout KPIs, the findings reported were similar to those already included in previous review report—namely, that information provided in the shareholder ministers' report is again presented in a way which does not enable comparison with corporate plan targets without checking against those targets separately. This is proving frustrating for proper oversight and scrutiny. In addition, with the changing KPI categories and the possibility of changes to corporate plan targets without notice, tracking the progress of the NBN rollout is made more complex and reliance is placed on qualitative statements made in the public domain about NBN progress rather than on published quantitative data. Again, for proper oversight and scrutiny this is proving more frustrating than is necessary.


Overall, the committee found that, given that the NBN is the largest ever infrastructure project undertaken in Australia, at this early stage of the NBN rollout it is timely that there be greater rigour placed on the public reporting of the financial and physical aspects of the NBN rollout. The NBN Co. stated that it is investing $9.8 billion to connect multidwelling units to the NBN, with the individual cost of connection having fallen to $1,100. The NBN Co. also stated that it investigated making use of the existing copper network to connect MDUs, multidwelling units, but that this approach was not taken as it presented issues in ensuring a high-speed connection and analog voice services for customers.


This report also includes commentary on costing alternative NBN models. The committee found that the NBN Co. is best placed to undertake this kind of costing within the framework of its corporate plan and has recommended accordingly. This is important in light of what is still a policy dispute in this parliament and with reports from organisations such as Cisco and Dr Pepper, the vice-president internationally, only recently commenting on issues of policy in regard to the rollout in Australia and internationally. So I would encourage government and this parliament to consider that recommendation closely.


The committee's report also looks at the NBN rollout in regional and remote Australia. A combination of the three NBN technologies, fibre, fixed wireless and satellite, is being rolled out now to regional and remote communities. Both major parties in the policy sense have committed to satellite and wireless on exactly the same terms. This is welcome. However, the committee is seeking more from NBN Co. to talk about their work in communities in regional Australia. The committee is interested in how NBN Co. is balancing construction of the network across both metropolitan and regional locations. The committee felt it would be useful to hear more about the regional aspects and made a recommendation to that effect. The committee was also interested in the rollout of the fixed wireless and satellite networks. It noted that in February 2013 NBN Co. announced plans for a new, faster speed tier for its fixed wireless and long-term satellite services for regional and remote communities. It also noted that the take-up rate for NBN Co.'s interim satellite service is challenging in regard to the long-term satellite service to be introduced in 2015 by both sides of the parliament. So the question of the interim service and the provision of its customer cap predicted to be reached in 2014 does not at the moment align with the launch of the long-term satellite service in 2015. The committee has therefore made recommendations on the best ways to deal with that timetabling and transition issue.


The report also considered two matters determined by the committee to be of significance at this stage of the NBN rollout: private equity engagement and workforce issues. The committee has investigated the points of entry for private investment in the NBN in all five of its reports to date. The discussion has been in the interests of ensuring the most efficient build of the NBN. The committee recommended that the government continue to consider investor interest in the NBN and the optimum capital structure for NBN Co. This is all about the rate of return for taxpayers. At the moment the current rate of return is over seven per cent. Other options are unknown, including policy changes that NBN Co. themselves may make at any change stage, and a focus on that rate of return on investment to the taxpayer is the guiding light that I hope with the investment of public and private dollars the NBN Co. and government can maintain a focus on.


On the matter of NBN workforce issues, the committee continues to be interested in progress under the Telstra retraining funding deed. Under this deed the government as committed to provide $100 million to Telstra to support the availability of an appropriately trained workforce for the NBN and retrain Telstra staff affected by the NBN rollout. The committee also heard that NBN Co. and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure an appropriately skilled workforce to support the NBN rollout. In this important area the committee recommended that NBN Co. continue to work with contractors to ensure sufficient mobilisation of skilled labour to meet NBN rollout targets. It also recommended that NBN Co. continue to update NBN workforce modelling data to assist with planning for changing NBN training needs and workforce demands. 


For all the challenges of the largest infrastructure build in our nation's history as well as the policy risks to manage at the September 2013 election, Australians can now be confident the NBN will be completed in some form. It will make a big difference in many lives; it will strengthen our economy; it will promote our cultural identity in a flattening global culture. Overall it will create opportunity and deliver equity for all Australians. 


The NBN remains on track to deliver a rate of return to the taxpayer of over seven per cent per annum. The NBN in its current form assists greatly in delivering industry restructuring in telecommunications, which many have identified as a historic problem in Australia. On the politics of the moment, part of this upgrade is Telstra management and shareholders improving their pits and pipes, including removing asbestos from old infrastructure; and may they do that safely.


The NBN does deliver ubiquity. This means the wholesale platform being built does not discriminate by location. Wherever you live and in no matter what style of residence—whether farm or flat—the speed, reliability and wholesale pricing will have equivalence. The principle of consumer equity is finally alive in Australian telecommunications. 


All of this is before we explore the personal and business benefits of improved speed and reliability with a technology that is open to higher and higher speeds. It is human capacity, not the technology's capacity, that holds us back on even faster transfers of data. Once it is built, the advancement of its speed will be an exciting challenge for the innovators. I make particular reference to the excellent report commissioned by Google, Culture boom: how digital media are invigorating Australia, which is publicly available online. The cultural boom happening in Australia today, contributing $26 billion per year in export value to our economy, is important and should not be dismissed as merely a platform to access episodes of the television series Game of Thrones.


It is an export market. As the report identifies, more Americans today are digesting Australian content than Australians are today with existing poor telecommunications. What an opportunity to promote Australia and expand our export economy by getting this build right. By building the NBN we can unlock this even more than the current cultural boom allows. We promote Australian culture to the world. We show respect to sectors like education as our second-biggest export market and invite it to grow. We play to our strengths by unlocking entrepreneurship in this country. 


I have personally done what I can to see the NBN completed to the best standard possible. It is, in my view, real nation building. I certainly invite the 44th Parliament and its NBN oversight committee to commit to doing likewise. As this is the final report of the oversight committee, I thank all 60 committee members—there are many here at the moment—in particular, the 15 voting members. We have all got to know each other better through some difficult but important policy discussions. 


Finally I thank the secretariat. I have often watched them and wondered what they are really thinking when committee members, including me, drift off track, ask a silly question or demonstrate forgetfulness. The secretariat has been a group of quality professionals and the engine room of true oversight. On behalf of all committee members I sincerely thank them. I commend the report to the House and I move:

It also noted that the take-up rate for NBN Co.'s interim satellite service is challenging in regard to the long-term satellite service to be introduced in 2015 by both sides of the parliament. So the question of the interim service and the provision of its customer cap predicted to be reached in 2014 does not at the moment align with the launch of the long-term satellite service in 2015. The committee has therefore made recommendations on the best ways to deal with that timetabling and transition issue.


The report also considered two matters determined by the committee to be of significance at this stage of the NBN rollout: private equity engagement and workforce issues. The committee has investigated the points of entry for private investment in the NBN in all five of its reports to date. The discussion has been in the interests of ensuring the most efficient build of the NBN. The committee recommended that the government continue to consider investor interest in the NBN and the optimum capital structure for NBN Co. This is all about the rate of return for taxpayers. At the moment the current rate of return is over seven per cent. Other options are unknown, including policy changes that NBN Co. themselves may make at any change stage, and a focus on that rate of return on investment to the taxpayer is the guiding light that I hope with the investment of public and private dollars the NBN Co. and government can maintain a focus on.


On the matter of NBN workforce issues, the committee continues to be interested in progress under the Telstra retraining funding deed. Under this deed the government as committed to provide $100 million to Telstra to support the availability of an appropriately trained workforce for the NBN and retrain Telstra staff affected by the NBN rollout. The committee also heard that NBN Co. and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure an appropriately skilled workforce to support the NBN rollout. In this important area the committee recommended that NBN Co. continue to work with contractors to ensure sufficient mobilisation of skilled labour to meet NBN rollout targets. It also recommended that NBN Co. continue to update NBN workforce modelling data to assist with planning for changing NBN training needs and workforce demands. 


For all the challenges of the largest infrastructure build in our nation's history as well as the policy risks to manage at the September 2013 election, Australians can now be confident the NBN will be completed in some form. It will make a big difference in many lives; it will strengthen our economy; it will promote our cultural identity in a flattening global culture. Overall it will create opportunity and deliver equity for all Australians. 


The NBN remains on track to deliver a rate of return to the taxpayer of over seven per cent per annum. The NBN in its current form assists greatly in delivering industry restructuring in telecommunications, which many have identified as a historic problem in Australia. On the politics of the moment, part of this upgrade is Telstra management and shareholders improving their pits and pipes, including removing asbestos from old infrastructure; and may they do that safely.


The NBN does deliver ubiquity. This means the wholesale platform being built does not discriminate by location. Wherever you live and in no matter what style of residence—whether farm or flat—the speed, reliability and wholesale pricing will have equivalence. The principle of consumer equity is finally alive in Australian telecommunications. 


All of this is before we explore the personal and business benefits of improved speed and reliability with a technology that is open to higher and higher speeds. It is human capacity, not the technology's capacity, that holds us back on even faster transfers of data. Once it is built, the advancement of its speed will be an exciting challenge for the innovators. I make particular reference to the excellent report commissioned by Google, Culture boom: how digital media are invigorating Australia, which is publicly available online. The cultural boom happening in Australia today, contributing $26 billion per year in export value to our economy, is important and should not be dismissed as merely a platform to access episodes of the television series Game of Thrones.


It is an export market. As the report identifies, more Americans today are digesting Australian content than Australians are today with existing poor telecommunications. What an opportunity to promote Australia and expand our export economy by getting this build right. By building the NBN we can unlock this even more than the current cultural boom allows. We promote Australian culture to the world. We show respect to sectors like education as our second-biggest export market and invite it to grow. We play to our strengths by unlocking entrepreneurship in this country. 


I have personally done what I can to see the NBN completed to the best standard possible. It is, in my view, real nation building. I certainly invite the 44th Parliament and its NBN oversight committee to commit to doing likewise. As this is the final report of the oversight committee, I thank all 60 committee members—there are many here at the moment—in particular, the 15 voting members. We have all got to know each other better through some difficult but important policy discussions. 


Finally I thank the secretariat. I have often watched them and wondered what they are really thinking when committee members, including me, drift off track, ask a silly question or demonstrate forgetfulness. The secretariat has been a group of quality professionals and the engine room of true oversight. On behalf of all committee members I sincerely thank them. I commend the report to the House and I move:


That the House take note of the report.

Mr MURPHY:
  The committee has endorsed the content of this statement. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Consumer Protection) Bill 2013, a government bill, was introduced to the House of Representatives on 21 March 2013. On the same day it was referred to both the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and the Joint Select Committee on Broadcasting Legislation. The bill was referred to this committee by the House of Representatives Selection Committee and the reason for the referral was:


There has not been the opportunity to properly scrutinise the changes proposed in this bill or their potential impacts.


The Joint Select Committee on Broadcasting Legislation was established on 14 March 2013 under a resolution of appointment 'to inquire into and report on potential areas for further reform of Australia's broadcasting legislation'. The bill in question deals with telecommunications. Therefore it would appear that it is not within the remit of the terms of reference of this committee. Furthermore, the Senate committee reported on the bill on 13 June 2013. The opportunity for proper scrutiny of the bill has been made possible through the work of the Senate committee. It is the view of the Joint Select Committee on Broadcasting Legislation that to adopt this concurrent inquiry would be an unnecessary duplication of process. This statement discharges the requirement to provide an advisory report on the bill.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (13:51):  Several weeks ago I joined the volunteers and attendees at the Epping RSL Granny Smith Day Club to help celebrate 30 years of operation. The Epping RSL day club has been open since April 1983 thanks to the dedicated support of a large number of volunteers. Every Friday the volunteers put on a morning of activities for the elderly and isolated at the Chester Street Epping Uniting Church. Essentially it is a social club designed for people who are unable to participate in social activities already established in the community and it generates personal friendships between people who are isolated.


A free bus service takes people to and from the venue each and every week. I have visited the Granny Smith Day Club on several occasions and I can attest to the wonderful work that they are doing to provide a warm and inviting environment. I have been told by many of the regulars how much they look forward to Fridays at the Epping RSL Granny Smith Day Club. President John Curdie, Margaret Waddell and John Roddy along with their team of volunteers continue to provide a vibrant program each week of mental stimulation and gentle physical exercise. The program is full of variety and I thank the volunteers for going to so much effort in preparing a diverse array of activities. The volunteers give significantly of their time and energy and, without their efforts, the Granny Smith Day Club would not be the success that it is. I offer them every good wish and hope that the program continues well into the future.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:01):  Madam Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I remind her that in the past three years families' electricity costs have increased by 45 per cent. Is the Prime Minister aware that Australians' electricity bills have increased by more under her than they did in the entire 11 years of the Howard government? Will the Prime Minister now reduce the squeeze on families' cost of living by rescinding the increase in the carbon tax due to take effect in just two weeks?

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it enables me to explain to him something that I explained to the Australian nation last year—that is, what are the real drivers of cost in electricity, including the extraordinary levels of investment we have seen in the poles and wires; including the market incentives that there are in the current system for the so-called gold-plating of the system that then feeds through to the prices that families and businesses pay.


Of course, we got the facts out on the table—and I know the facts are something the Leader of the Opposition never likes to hear about because they disturb his world outlook, but facts are facts and they deserve paying regard to. The facts of this, of course, were that well before our nation priced carbon, consumers had had to tolerate increases of more than 50 per cent in their electricity prices because of these other drivers of costs. So we have moved to address those other drivers of costs through a comprehensive reform process we engaged in through the Council of Australian Governments in the last six months of last year, and we did secure agreement at the COAG meeting at the end of last year to regulatory and other changes to put downward pressure on electricity pricing.


But of course the Leader of the Opposition does not want to refer to any of that because he does not want Australian families to know the truth about what is driving electricity prices, but that is the truth. And the Leader of the Opposition spent many weeks at the time of the greatest heat in that debate effectively defending Liberal state governments and saying on that area, which would make a real difference to the cost-of-living pressures experienced by households, that he would do absolutely nothing. On carbon pricing, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, carbon pricing is working to reduce carbon pollution, it is working with our renewable energy target to reduce carbon pollution, and households have been assisted with the price rise that they saw in electricity, which was exactly as we predicted. None of the Leader of the Opposition's fear mongering in any of that came true.


So to the Leader of the Opposition, the questions are simple. Why does he want our nation to reduce carbon pollution in a more expensive way? Why doesn't he join with the government in effectively working to put downward pressure on electricity prices through the COAG reform agenda? And why is he insisting on doing things like ripping money out of the hands of families through ripping away basic benefits like the Schoolkids Bonus? That is what the Leader of the Opposition should answer.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:05):  Lesson No. 1: do not let the member for Flinders give you a handwritten question. Lesson No. 2: on carbon pricing, what we always said on this side of politics was that putting a price on carbon would increase electricity prices by 10 per cent and we would assist families with those increased costs—and we did.


On the other side of politics, the Leader of the Opposition ran around the country on a crazed fear campaign, saying people would not have a job, Whyalla would be wiped off the map, there would be astronomical increases in the cost of living, and members of the opposition were telling us that a lamb roast would cost $100—ridiculous stuff. Ridiculous, mendacious claims from the Leader of the Opposition. Well, now he stands here with all of those claims proven to be untrue. With other conservatives around the world embracing putting a price on carbon as the most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution, there he is with his turkey of a policy that he cannot explain and that does not add up. This government stands for reducing carbon pollution in the most cost-effective way, whereas the Leader of the Opposition stands for shovelling huge burdens to pay for his ridiculous policy onto Australian families.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:39):  I thank the member for Capricornia for that question, because over the past five years our economy has emerged as one of the strongest developed economies within the global economy. All of this has been achieved in the middle of extraordinary uncertainty: the global financial crisis and all of its aftershocks. You only have to look to Europe and what has occurred there in the last couple of months. We have achieved something very special in this area for Australia. It has been done by choice and not by chance because, if those people opposite would have had their way, they would not have moved to support the economy as we did during the global financial crisis. Because of the actions that we took, we supported employment and we avoided the skill destruction, the capital destruction and the destruction of communities that come from high levels of unemployment and the destruction that it causes to small business. All of that was avoided in this country, giving us the strength to invest for the future to make sure we get the prosperity of tomorrow.


Let us just look at some of the facts: our economy is 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. If those people opposite had had their way this economy would have experienced a recession. In our economy there have been almost one million jobs created over the past five years. We have an unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the developed world, and particularly when you look to Europe where the rate is 12.2 per cent. We have strong public finances. We have a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies with a stable outlook—something never achieved by that mob in 12 years—and of course we have low levels of debt. 


All of these things say that our economy is in good nick. But what we have to do is to make the investments for the future; make the smart investments for the future. That is why we found the savings in our budget to make the investments in education, investments that the Prime Minister has been talking about today. We understand that the future of productivity growth in this economy is dependent upon the investments we make in the quality of our education today and over the next decade. And that is precisely what we are doing; precisely why we are investing in schools, in New South Wales with a Liberal premier and investing in South Australia. 


We hope to invest right across our country, but what we have seen here is just how negative the Liberals are when it comes to this fundamental investment in the future of our country. Playing politics with the education of our kids, and nowhere is that worse than in my state of Queensland which badly needs the additional money. The additional $3.8 billion to lift the educational standards in our state. Last week, we saw the Benny Hill routine of the Premier of Queensland in and out of state schools, unable to explain why he is being so difficult and negative when the truth is that he and the Leader of the Opposition are in lock step because they do not believe in investing in our schools.


We on this side of the House are up for the future investments which will provide for future prosperity. (Time expired)

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:46):  I thank the member for his question. In his electorate of Makin alone we have seen over $108 million invested in improving school facilities. We have got trades training centres, some seven of which are in his electorate, and he will have seen the additional investment and support that this Labor government provides across the country but particularly in South Australia. So I welcome the question.


We do not want to see any young Australian child left behind at school and now the National Plan for School Improvement is being accepted by premiers around Australia. New South Wales has signed, the Australian Capital Territory has signed, the Australian Education Bill has passed the House, and South Australia has also now signed the National Education Reform Agreement. This plan now covers over 60 per cent of students in our schools. It is about delivering reform which makes a difference, improving teacher quality, making sure that the implementation of the Australian curriculum is accessible to all students and empowering school leadership, particularly principals, who know how their schools should be organised and the resources used as well.


This is an important agreement for South Australia because it will see an additional $656 million in base funding and, when you add the certainty of indexation which we are providing, a total injection of over $1 billion—in fact, $1.1 billion—extra into schools in South Australia. That will be especially important in supporting regional and disadvantaged schools. This is about making sure that South Australian schools can move into the top five of school systems in the world as well. It is also about making sure that kids in South Australia reach their full potential. I think that is why the Premier, Jay Weatherill, said:


This will, in the long term, make an extraordinary difference to the future prosperity of South Australia and the wellbeing of its citizens.


I agree with the Premier. 


I am asked about obstacles. The fact is that the obstacles to us delivering a fairer funding system with more resources to students around Australia lie with the opposition here in the House of Representatives. It is the member for Sturt, who is the shadow minister, and the Leader of the Opposition who are trying to destroy and frustrate these important education reforms. The fact is now that it is up to the Victorian Premier to stand up for the students in his state and recognise—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Speaker, on a point of order: it is quite clear from the Practice that the minister, in trying to describe what is opposition policy, is out of order. It is not directly relevant within the new framework and he should either return to the question or sit down.



The SPEAKER:  The minister has the call.




Mr GARRETT:
  I am happy to address the opposition's statements on education because the member for Sturt is on record as wanting to sack one in seven teachers, the Leader of the Opposition thinks that supporting government schools is an injustice and now they are trying to block $1.1 billion of extra support for students in South Australia. That is what this debate is all about: those opposite—

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Minister for Road Safety, Minister for Regional Services and Local Communities and Territories) (15:15):  by leave—Today I give my second annual statement to the House on progress in delivering a vital national initiative—the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-20.


The strategy aims to cut the annual number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads by at least 30 per cent by 2020. It is an ambitious target.


Australians recognise the absolute importance of achieving this target, and this understanding underlies the commitment of all Australian governments to delivering the strategy. 


The Gillard government is proud to have played a major part in forming the strategy in 2011 and to have a major role in delivering it.


The strategy is multidimensional, because there is no single solution to improving road safety. 


The strategy covers 59 priority action items in four cornerstone areas: safe roads, safe speeds, safe vehicles, and safe people.


These themes encompass the need for both the safer design of roads and vehicles, and the safer behaviour of drivers, passengers, pedestrians and other road users.


The Australian government is responsible under the strategy for allocating agreed infrastructure resources to the national highway and local road networks, and for regulating safety standards for new vehicles. 


Minister Albanese and I emphasised at the launch of the strategy that this target of a 30 per cent reduction in fatalities, and also—equally importantly—a 30 per cent reduction in serious injuries, was challenging but achievable, and it remains so. 


In 2012, 1,309 people died on Australia's roads—2.5 per cent more than the number of road deaths recorded in 2011. 


The 2012 increase is incredibly disappointing.


However, I do want to emphasise that it runs counter to the long-term downward trend in national road fatalities and still represents a significant 8.2 per cent reduction relative to the strategy's baseline period of 2008 to 2010. 


Furthermore, all states and territories achieved reductions in road fatalities compared with the strategy baseline, and road deaths decreased across most age groups and road user categories. 


Unfortunately, the main exception to this pattern involves people aged 60 years and over. In 2012, fatalities among this older group were up by 19 per cent, relative to the baseline period, and while it is premature to see this as an emerging trend, it is clearly an issue that warrants further examination.


Despite the encouraging gains overall, the level of death and injury on Australia's roads remains unacceptable and underlines the need for continuing efforts by all governments to implement the priority actions of the national strategy. I particularly want to take the opportunity to recognise in this place the role that local government played last night at the Australian Council of Local Government awards. We recognised, at the ALGA awards, that the Dungog, Maitland and Port Stephens councils received not only the national road safety award for local government, but also the overall national award for some fantastic work that they have done in their local communities on motorcycle safety. In fact, during the six months that they have had the program in place, they have not had a single motorcycle accident, and I want to acknowledge that.


I now want to turn particularly to the progress the Commonwealth has made in our specific areas of responsibility under the strategy.


Over many decades, the Australian government has administered the Australian Design Rules, which have underpinned the safer design of Australian road vehicles.


All road vehicles, whether newly manufactured in Australia or imported as new or second-hand vehicles, must in general comply with the relevant ADRs at the time of manufacture and supply to the Australian market.


As part of its commitment under the strategy, the Australian government is pursuing significantly improved road vehicle design in several areas.


We have streamlined the harmonisation of the ADRs with international standards, and we will continue to work closely with our international counterparts to ensure we progress improved safety measures in vehicle regulations that can be applied internationally.


Until recently, this has been a position supported by both sides of the House.


In addition to improving the safety of vehicles through changes to national standards, the Australian government continues to support complementary safety measures—particularly since becoming a member of the Australasian New Car Assessment Program, ANCAP, in May 2010.


Labor is proud to be the first federal government to join ANCAP as an actual member.


We have provided ANCAP with $4.95 million in the period 2009-10 to 2013-14, which aims to increase ANCAP's crash test program and research and development. I think it is a tribute both to the funding and to ANCAP's work that it has become the driver of consumer concerns in safety and one of the components that people look for on the purchase of a new vehicle.


On recent figures, around 98 per cent of the vehicles rated by ANCAP have four or five star ratings. 


The Australian government has also mandated seatbelt reminder systems, set requirements for ISOFIX child restraint systems and improved the standards for electric bicycles.


Our work is now focused on mandatory electronic stability control and brake assist systems.


In April this year, I released for public comment a proposal to make ESC compulsory for new light commercial vehicles, such as utilities and goods vans, and to make BAS standard in light passenger and light commercial vehicles.


In parallel with these efforts, the Australian government's work on the introduction of anti-lock braking systems for heavy trucks, trailers and buses is now well advanced.


This work, which forms part of phase 1 of the National Heavy Vehicle Braking Strategy, is an important step in bringing more modern braking systems into Australia's heavy vehicles. 


It is also very encouraging that peak industry bodies are developing a code of practice to help operators optimise the performance of different braking technologies when combining trucks and trailers together.


Consistent with the National Road Safety Strategy, the government envisages that the next phase of the National Heavy Vehicle Braking Strategywill consider even more advanced braking technology such as ESC systems.


While we often and understandably think of road safety mainly in domestic terms, it also has important international dimensions.


Australia's National Road Safety Strategy coincides with the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety, and around 90 per cent of the world's road fatalities—which exceed 1.2 million—are suffered by low- and middle-income countries.


Australia is seen as a world leader in road safety for our significant achievements in reducing road trauma over several decades. Countries in our region often look to us for assistance and expertise in developing their own responses to this immense public health issue. 


Australia is the largest donor to the World Bank's Global Road Safety Facility.


We contribute to regional road safety measures through international forums such as APEC, and we are delivering safety improvements through our aid-funded infrastructure programs in developing countries.


Australia has also participated very strongly in the development of international vehicle standards by the United Nations World Forum on Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. 


Australia has led the development of a Global Technical Regulation on Pole Side Impact—the first time Australia has led development of an international vehicle standard. It is one that impacts on Australian motorists very heavily.


Side impacts with poles, trees and other narrow objects account for over 20 per cent of the Australian road toll and for a large number of serious head injuries. This new standard will require strong protective measures for vehicle occupants, including curtain airbags, which will be beneficial in all side impacts. 


I am confident that the GTR will be adopted by the UN forum and that it will be incorporated into future Australian design rules. 




Infrastructure Investment 



Improving safety through investment in the nation's road infrastructure is a critical element of the strategy. The Australian government has made major investments in Australia's highway and other road infrastructure under the Nation Building Program. The government's expenditure on roads between 2008-09 and 2013-14 will total over $20.5 billion.


This investment has built and upgraded around 7,500 kilometres of road, resulting in a marked improvement in the condition and safety of our highways. The Australian Automobile Association considers that the proportion of the National Road Network rated 'high risk' has fallen substantially since 2007.


The second phase of the Nation Building Program will maintain the momentum of this investment. 


The Black Spot Program, which targets road locations with recurrent crashes, will continue as part of the Nation Building Program until at least 2019. 


An amount of $300 million will be provided over five years from 1 July 2014. Since 2008-09, more than 2,000 sites have been approved for funding, and this extension will fix a further 1,200 black spot areas.


The Australian government established the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program as part of the Nation Building Program, to improve the safety and productivity outcomes of heavy vehicle operations across Australia.


Funding has been applied to a range of projects to provide new or upgraded heavy vehicle rest areas and new or upgraded parking or decoupling bays, and projects which enhance the capacity and safety of roads and bridges and also saleyards for livestock to allow better access by heavier, high productivity vehicles to the road network.


The 2013-14 budget provided a further $100 million for heavy vehicle related projects under the next tranche of the Nation Building Program. This will bring total funding between 2012-13 and 2018-19 to over $250 million.




Seatbelts on Regional School Buses



The strategy also calls for governments to address the risks to children on school bus routes. For its part, the Australian government runs the highly successful Seatbelts on Regional School Buses program, which aims to increase the number of school buses equipped with seatbelts for students in rural and regional areas. 


The program provides school bus operators with funding to fit seatbelts to new buses or to retrofit existing buses. I am pleased to see some movement from state governments on this issue. In April this year, I approved grants for a further 115 buses under the government's scheme, which has now provided total funding to date of $7.5 million to install seatbelts on 421 buses across bus routes in regional Australia.




Driveway Safety



One issue that has been very dear to my heart has been the problem of children being killed or injured by vehicles around the home. It is a matter of particular urgency. My department is working with a wide range of stakeholders to produce a set of voluntary building design guidelines to help protect young children—in particular—from the risk of vehicle run-overs in home driveways and related areas. 


I am planning to release a public discussion paper on this work by the end of June.


Yesterday I also announced that my department is now undertaking the first stage of an international study into the effectiveness of reversing cameras as a means of reducing reversing crashes, including those leading to driveway deaths and injury of young children.




National Road Safety Forum



In August last year I also had the pleasure of hosting a very successful National Road Safety Forum at Parliament House in Canberra, engaging with a wide range of stakeholders in a national discussion on road safety issues. 


Ministers of the Standing Council on Transport and Infrastructure have since agreed to convene the forum annually. The 2013 forum will be held in Hobart next month and will focus on vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and motor cycle riders.




Implementation Progress 



The Commonwealth and other jurisdictions are closely monitoring progress in delivering the strategy against high-level outcome measures and specific performance indicators.


In November last year, transport ministers published a report on the implementation status of the strategy. The report found that there was a considerable amount of work underway to implement the strategy, and that good progress had been made in several areas.


These areas include improving safety standards for new vehicles; the delivery of infrastructure programs addressing major crash problems and vulnerable groups; and stronger speed enforcement and compliance programs.


However, we still need to strengthen efforts to ensure that sufficient action is being undertaken to deliver the strategy.


At the most recent meeting of the transport ministers in May, I called on all governments to reaffirm their commitment to improving road safety by strengthening all of their efforts to implement the key priority action areas highlighted in the strategy.


Ministers noted that progress remains limited in a number of key areas including the introduction of point-to-point speed camera enforcement for all vehicles, which is highlighted in the strategy as a very effective road safety measure.


At that meeting I also raised concerns about the continuing lack of national data on serious injury crashes, due to major inconsistencies in the way states and territories define a serious injury crash. This significantly limits our capacity to properly monitor and analyse national road safety trends.


The Bureau of Infrastructure Transport and Regional Economics within my department, in cooperation with state and territory agencies, has developed a national road crash database to support measures of progress against the targets for both fatal and serious injury. 


This national crash database was used in the last implementation status report for the strategy to produce fatality measures against most of the strategy's indicators. There is in-principle agreement among transport ministers to include serious injury measures once an adequate source of national serious injury data is established. I encourage all states and territories to continue with that work. 


A comprehensive review of the national strategy and progress towards the target will be undertaken in 2014. The review will be an important element in ensuring we stay on track to achieve the aims of the strategy and reduce fatalities and serious injuries by at least 30 per cent over the decade.


I am pleased to have been able to bring a number of developments in that vital area to the attention of the House.


I present a copy of my ministerial statement, and I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Gippsland to speak for 15 minutes.


Leave granted.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2013-06-17,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (15:30):  In rising, I welcome the opportunity to respond to the ministerial statement on the progress of the National Road Safety Strategy. In doing so, I would like to stress the largely bipartisan nature of the political debate right across Australia in relation to the urgent need to reduce the impact of road trauma in our community. In that spirit of bipartisanship, I would like to congratulate the minister on her appointment as the Minister for Road Safety. As others in the industry have remarked, it will certainly help to elevate the issue of road safety to a new level in the Commonwealth and I commend the minister for her efforts in that regard.


As a regionally based MP, something I share with the member for Ballarat, I think we have a shared concern about the disproportionate number of rural and regional road users who continue to die or are seriously injured on our roads, both on our regional highways and on our local road networks. I think it is also a source of enormous anguish for you, Deputy Speaker, in your regional electorate that people in our regional communities continue to suffer a disproportionate amount. It troubles me deeply that although the overall road toll has reduced across Australia in recent years, the regional road toll has not responded at the same rate. This is despite not only the very good efforts of community groups and local government, which the minister referred to in her report, but also of state governments and now the federal government. I think it remains an enormous challenge for us all to confront in this place, but particularly the regional members on both sides of the chamber.


The minister was right to make the point that the issue of road safety is not a simple one. It is not just about increased enforcement activities by police, although that is important. It is not just about improved driver behaviour, although we do know that distraction, excessive speed, use of mobile phones and so forth, and drink-driving are all important issues. And it is not just about building safer roads or having safer vehicles. It is a combination of all of these factors and about making sure we do as much as we possibly can do right in the interests of reducing road trauma wherever possible.


There is a very complex equation or sequence of events that can contribute to a road accident occurring—or can contribute to a road accident not occurring through prevention measures that have been put in place in the first place. On top of that, there is the equally complex equation that will decide how serious the injuries are of the people who have been involved in that accident: whether there has been an appropriate road treatment put in place to minimise the level of damage to a vehicle, whether there are emergency services available in a time effective manner, whether in fact there are mobile phone services available for people to seek help in the first place. These are all part of this complex equation about whether we can prevent accidents and, when they do occur, how we minimise the damage—obviously to the people involved but also to the broader economy. It is by no means a simple issue that we are talking about here today and there are no simple answers or silver bullets in relation to the road toll.


As the minister indicated in her progress report, there has been some good news and some bad news in relation to the key target of the National Road Safety Strategy to reduce the annual number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads by at least 30 per cent by 2020. In 2012 more than 1,300 people died on Australian roads, which is a 2.5 per cent increase in the number of deaths that were recorded in 2011. Thankfully, it is contrary to the longer term trend of reductions in the overall toll. But the obvious question for this place is: are the reductions, are the improvements, happening fast enough? Are we doing everything we possibly or reasonably can as a nation to save ourselves from that enormous economic cost of road trauma, which is estimated at more than $27 billion per year—and that is quite aside from the very significant social costs as lives are shattered and loved ones are left to grieve.


Personally, I believe we can do better. In fact, we must do better if we are to reclaim our place as a world leader on road safety. That is not just my view; to quote from the National road safety strategy 2011-2020:


Over the past several decades, Australia has earned an international reputation as a model country in many areas of road safety intervention. But the overall performance in recent times has not kept pace with the achievements of other developed countries, and there is a need for a major shift in thinking by governments and the community.


Against international levels our relative performance has fallen. If there was a road safety Olympics, we would not win a medal at the moment. That is a concern for a nation that has a very proud record in relation to road safety. If we had a road safety Olympics right now, Australia would not feature in the medals.


I am not by any stretch trying to disparage the efforts made by this government or by people in our community, but I believe it is time for us to reset the clock on the road toll and to raise our aspirations. That is our challenge here today: how are we going to implement the programs and projects that we know work, and also when are we going to encourage innovation to make improvements wherever possible? I fear that, as a community, we have become perhaps complacent or perhaps just accepting of the road toll. We seem to be almost resigned to the fact that accidents will always happen and there is not much we can do about it. I beg to differ, and I think there is more we can do and we must never rest in that regard.


That is also the view of industry stakeholders, who I am sure the minister has met with and discussed this issue with. They have the view as well that there is more we can do to reduce both the prevalence of accidents and the severity of those accidents when they do occur. I have had the opportunity to meet over the past two years with peak motoring bodies and leading researchers in this space, and they argue to me there is more we can do and that we must do more in reducing the toll, particularly that severe economic impact of $27 billion per year to the national economy and obviously, as I said earlier, the severe emotional impact on people who have lost loved ones on our roads.


I stress that my comments are not intended in any way to be a criticism of the minister or the current government at a federal level. As I said at the outset, I believe the minister's appointment has helped to give prominence to this issue at a national level, but I think we can do more. I am confident that if there is a coalition government after September it will aim to continue to provide national leadership on road safety with a focus on, as the minister correctly said, building safer roads, supporting the rollout of safer vehicles and promoting improved driver behaviour. While the nation's road toll has steadily fallen from nearly 2,900 deaths in 1982 to 1,300 in 2012, I want a new coalition government to recognise that more needs to be done to reduce that road toll and to reduce the number of serious injuries from vehicle accidents.


I have taken the advice of key stakeholders across the nation and I share their view that there must be a more holistic approach from governments to reducing road trauma in recognition of the social and economic impacts we have already referred to across the entire community. Across the broad range of government departments there needs to be renewed focus on reducing the public health impacts of road trauma and leading the public debate on road safety initiatives with a partnership approach across all levels of government, the research agencies, community groups, vehicle manufacturers and other stakeholders. 


At the moment I think we see the issue of road safety through the paradigms of the new Minister for Road Safety or through the ministry of transport but there is no doubt that the issue of road safety plays out across a whole range of government departments, including the department of health, and there are issues that should be dealt with by the minister for youth and issues that need to be dealt with by the minister for Indigenous affairs. We need to take a more holistic approach and develop strategies to ensure that all government departments and ministries with a relevant role in road safety take up the responsibility and take up the challenge of reducing the impact of the road toll on our community.


I am concerned that at the moment there is too much confusion and duplication of effort in relation to road safety. I recognise that different jurisdictions have the right to have different approaches to road safety but there is confusion within our community at the moment relating to the inconsistency in the graduated licensing system, the safety messages across state borders, the enforcement programs and the road laws themselves, which vary too much across state borders. I would be hopeful, if not confident, that in the future it may be possible for us to do the research and develop a best practice model in relation to road safety and then encourage all jurisdictions to roll out the best practice model in a coordinated and cohesive manner. As it stands today, if Australians move across state or even territory borders here in the ACT, they face a confusing range of laws, regulations and penalties, particularly when it comes to the systems adopted for learner and P-plate drivers. There is an inconsistency between the ACT and New South Wales about the speeds that learner drivers are allowed to drive at. It is ridiculous that in the 21st century we cannot come up with a best practice model and ensure that it is implemented right across our nation.


I take up the minister's references earlier to the government's record in relation to improving the safety of roads because the coalition itself also has a proud record in terms of investing in the safety of our road network. It was the coalition that initiated the Roads to Recovery program more than a decade ago. Also the coalition took a policy to the last election for bridge renewals, which I think is an important initiative. We support the government in its efforts in relation to black spots and its commitment to invest in more rest areas. These are policy commitments that the coalition has made and the government has also been implementing over the past five years.


I think it is foolish for any minister—and I am certainly not referring to the Minister for Road Safety—to stand in this place and suggest that previous governments did nothing. The coalition government did invest in improving our road network. I find it sometimes reckless of ministers, like the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, to claim that the coalition did nothing in relation to investing in the road network. No government ever does nothing. No government ever sets out to not improve the lot of the Australian people. I think it was reckless for the minister for transport to make those types of claims because I know that the former minister for transport worked diligently in his role to improve road safety across the nation within the confines of the budgetary circumstances he was faced with.


I also note the campaign by various Australian motoring organisations. I am sure many other members in this place have been inundated with demands from their constituents for more funding for road improvements. I support those associations in their efforts because we recognise that investing in safer roads and improving the safety of the road environment will save lives. I commend the government for the improvements it has made in that space and recognise that the former coalition government worked diligently in that regard as well.


I recently made some comments in this place—and I think the minister may have made some thinly veiled reference to this in her report—in relation to the message we need to send to international vehicle manufacturers. I think a couple of weeks ago now I referred to the fact that I consider it important that any future coalition government sends a message to vehicle manufacturers throughout the world that we consider safety to be the highest priority when it comes to new vehicles. It remains my personal view that we should ban the importation of any vehicle that is sold in volume in Australia that does not achieve a minimum of three-star—preferably four-star—ANCAP safety rating. The current government has quite rightly moved to a position where its own fleet of light passenger vehicles must achieve a five-star ANCAP safety rating. I congratulate the government for that move because we know that having safer vehicles on our roads can lower the road toll.


I think we should be sending a signal now to the international vehicle manufacturing market that in a specified time in the future we do not intend to keep allowing the importation of vehicles that have comparatively low ANCAP safety ratings. It is a view that some in the industry have strongly endorsed since I made those comments. I note that the minister herself in her comments here today strongly endorsed the fact that safer vehicles do matter. I commend the work the government is doing in relation to its support for ANCAP, which will allow the authority to test more vehicles, and the government's desire to see the rollout of new technologies, such as the electronic stability control system and the brake assist systems. I am concerned about the relatively poor performance in terms of safety ratings of some of the vehicles that are on sale in Australia at the moment. I believe we can send a message to the international market that in the future Australia will be encouraging all vehicles on sale in Australia to achieve a higher ANCAP safety rating.


As the minister rightfully acknowledged in her progress report, there are 59 action items in the National Road Safety Strategy across the four cornerstone areas of safe roads, safe speeds, safe vehicles and safe people. It is important that the minister come to the House and report on the success or otherwise of the strategy because everyone in this place has a genuine concern for the amount of road trauma in our communities and what steps are being taken at the federal level to reduce that wherever possible.


In conclusion, I finish where I started. I believe that elevating the issue of road safety in our national debate is an important measure. I commend the government for the work it has done in that regard. I welcome the minister's progress report. I commit the coalition to continuing to work in a bipartisan manner wherever possible to further the goals of the National Road Safety Strategy in the interests of saving lives and in the interests of reducing trauma and delivering economic benefits to all Australians.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (15:44):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Regulatory framework for tax (financial) advice services, previously Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 Schedules 3 and 4, together with the evidence received by the committee.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—This inquiry was based on schedules 3 and 4 to the first reading version of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. These schedules proposed amendments to the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 that would bring financial advisers who provide tax advice into the tax agent regulatory regime overseen by the Tax Practitioners Board.


The proposed amendments that the committee has been tasked with reviewing will be an important regulatory change. It is clear that bringing financial advisers who provide tax advice into the existing regulatory regime will strengthen the overall regulatory environment that applies to tax advisory services. The changes would mean that all tax advice that is provided for a fee or other reward would be consistently regulated, regardless of whether it is provided by a tax agent, a BAS agent or a financial adviser. This is important because consumers of these services simply expect to go to the service providers within that sector and find a standard that is consistent, regardless of who it is they interact with.


The enactment of these measures will complete a process that has been many years in the making. It will end the need for the financial advisers' carve-out from the Tax Agent Services Act which has been in place since 2010 and reviewed on an annual basis. The most important outcome of the changes, however, is the further protection for consumers they will provide. If the proposed measures in this report, and in the bill, are enacted, financial advisers who provide tax advice will need to meet a new standard of relevant qualifications and experience. Accordingly, consumers of tax advice can be confident that the standard of advice they receive is of a similar professional standard to that provided by registered tax agents.


It needs to be recognised that these measures have not suddenly been announced and thrust onto the industry, despite what may be said in the explanation of the dissenting report. It is clear that there has been ongoing consultation with the industry since the measures were first proposed in 2010. For those who would like to find the detail, we have very clearly set out the dates when that period of interaction occurred in our report in a quite full and very clear tabled manner.


Importantly, the measures include a generous three-year transitional arrangement, with the full regime not commencing until 1 July 2016. The transitional arrangements mean that, for an 18-month period from 1 July 2013, financial advisers could effectively continue to provide services in the same manner as they do today. I do want to stress that the length of the transition period is three years, so any sense of creating alarm about a sudden change here is misrepresenting the reality of what this legislation seeks to do.


It is also important to be aware that industry participants are genuinely supportive of the overall policy intent. The Financial Services Council, which certainly did have some reservations, stated in its submission that the FSC is supportive of the amendment of the Tax Agent Services Act to create a specific and appropriate type of tax adviser which is congruent with the tax advice a financial adviser gives in the context of financial planning. The FSC is supportive of the regime on the basis that increased advice-provider competency is a public good. It will enhance the quality and value an advice provider delivers to their client.


The Financial Planning Association of Australia also noted the benefits that the regulatory changes will have. At the committee's public hearing, the FPA's chief executive officer stated that:


The FPA understands and supports consumer protection objectives of the tax agent services regime, which include firstly that providers of tax advice are appropriately and adequately trained; secondly, that proper complaints handling and redress is available to consumers; thirdly, that enforceable ethical and professional conduct requirements are imposed on providers; and, finally, a strong regulatory oversight in relation to the Australian tax law system.


While the industry accepts the policy intent, the committee acknowledges that the industry had some concerns about the detail. After taking evidence from key industry organisations and Treasury at a public hearing, the committee has made some recommendations in its report that are intended to minimise any burden on industry participants during the three-year transition period that lies ahead. These recommendations, and the evidence provided by Treasury and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, should help allay concerns about any of the measures in the bill.


The committee has recommended that the measures be reintroduced into the parliament and passed. The committee would also like to highlight the urgency that is required in this regard. If the current regulatory exemption from the Tax Agent Services Act that exists for financial advisers expires on 30 June—this month—without a suitable replacement being enacted, a significant burden will be imposed on the industry. As the chief executive officer of the Financial Services Council, Mr John Brogden, told the committee:


The worst outcome of all would be if the legislation did not proceed in any form, because that would leave the financial advice industry in a perilous situation where an enormous number of advisers simply would be in breach and be unable to comply. That is not an acceptable environment for Australians and their financial advice.


The committee shares Mr Brogden's view that such a result would be unacceptable. The enactment of these measures prior to 1 July 2013 not only would prevent this clearly undesirable outcome but also would commence a three-year transition to a better regulatory environment, one that is absolutely and clearly focused on consumer protection and ensuring the provision of quality taxation advice.


On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the organisations that lodged submissions and the witnesses who gave evidence at the committee's public hearing, particularly given the short period of time in which the inquiry was conducted. I stress once again the general agreement across the profession about the need for this legislation to go forward and for care in the transition period to be attended to, if necessary through amendments and certainly through consultation and ongoing discussion with relevant agencies and regulatory authorities. I commend the report to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (15:53):  by leave—I am pleased to rise to make some brief comments in relation to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the provisions which were previously to be schedules 3 and 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill.


This is yet another episode of a disorganised government in a desperate scramble to get legislation through before a deadline which it has known has existed for three years. Indeed, this is also another inglorious episode where the government's standards of consultation with industry have been highly deficient. The only reason that this inquiry into this bill was held was that the coalition pointed out some of the serious flaws in the schedules to the bill as they were going through the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago. The government reluctantly agreed to excise the schedules and allow time for a committee inquiry by the corporations and financial services committee.


Coalition members of the committee have only had our concerns increased through the consultation that we have done through the committee process. It is our view that the burden of proof, which the government would need to discharge if it were to demonstrate that it is prudent to rush ahead with the provisions in their current form, should be adopted. That burden of proof has not been discharged. We are in the unfortunate position where there are now less than two weeks to go before the changes proposed by the government, which would move financial advisers into the Tax Agent Services Act regime, and yet there remain some very serious questions about the provisions of the legislation.


I will briefly highlight some of the most serious of those concerns. The first is that there has been insufficient consideration by and consultation with industry. Although it is now more than three years since the Tax Agent Services Act took effect, for much of that period there has been very little consultation occurring. A time line provided by the Financial Planning Association showed that no material consultation occurred in either 2011 or 2012. Draft legislation was exposed for the first time for consultation in February 2013, but it was only when the schedules were tabled in the bill before parliament on 29 May 2013 that industry participants were able to see key provisions, including a definition setting out the scope of the advice which would be the subject of the regulatory regime that would take effect by reason of the passing of this legislation.


It is uncontested by witnesses with different perspectives that there remains considerable work to be done before the details of this legislation are nailed down. For example, Mr Drum of CPA Australia said to the committee last week:


Some of the matters raised here quite rightly identify that every issue has not been—


The chair intervened at that point to offer the words 'perfectly resolved'—


Mr Drum responded:


Correct. There are still a lot of unanswered questions.


In the coalition's view, if there are a lot of unanswered questions that raises very serious issues about proceeding with the bill in its present form.


We were equally concerned that there does not appear to have been an adequate cost-benefit analysis conducted of these measures. One group of stakeholders, the Financial Services Council, informed the committee that they were not aware of any Treasury cost-benefit analysis being conducted, and they had not been asked to contribute to such analysis. Treasury officials, when appearing before the committee, were asked whether there had been a cost-benefit analysis. Oddly, they indicated that there had been and that we could find it on the Department of Finance and Deregulation website. It also became clear in the exchange with witnesses from the Treasury that the kinds of cost components which the Treasury had thought appropriate to include in the cost-benefit analysis excluded a number of cost categories that industry members were very concerned about. That is perhaps not surprising if the cost-benefit analysis was conducted without consultation with industry participants.


Another reason my coalition colleagues and I are very concerned about the provisions of this legislation—and we have made our concerns clear in our minority report, our dissenting report—is that this bill, if it were to pass into law in its proposed form, would impose extra cost burdens on the financial sector at a time when very substantial additional costs have already been imposed on this sector thanks to the torrent of regulations which the present government has introduced, much of it done in a chaotic, disorganised and last-minute fashion. Regrettably, this is all too consistent with this government and this minister, who I am confident did not, when he was at school at Melbourne's exclusive Xavier College, rejoice under the nickname of 'Details Shorten'. I very much doubt that that was his nickname.


Another concern to coalition members is that no evidence was persuasively presented that there would be any particular adverse consequences if this legislation were not to proceed in its present form. Witnesses who were arguing that legislation should proceed—and there were one or two of them—were given the opportunity to explain the dangers which they believed were present if the legislation did not go ahead with effect from 1 July 2013 in its present form. Their explanations, I have to report to the House, were unpersuasive.


Concerns were also raised about the breadth of the present definition in the bill. Industry participants, pleasingly, informed the committee that they had worked together to come up with another definition, and that has been agreed upon by the Financial Services Council, the Tax Institute and a range of other participants. That is a very impressive piece of work by the industry. Coalition members and senators on the committee certainly encourage the government and the Treasury to consult carefully with industry on the amended definition which so many stakeholders have come together to prepare.


In conclusion, the view of coalition members and senators of the corporations and financial services committee is that it does not make sense to allow passage of these schedules into law at this time. A much better course of action, and the course of action which we recommend, is that the current exemption which financial planners and advisers enjoy from the Tax Agent Services Act—an exemption which has been in place for three years—should be extended by a further 12 months so that the work can be done of properly analysing these provisions, taking account of the recommended changes to the definition and getting the job done right rather than rushing it at the very last minute.

If the proposed measures in this report, and in the bill, are enacted, financial advisers who provide tax advice will need to meet a new standard of relevant qualifications and experience. Accordingly, consumers of tax advice can be confident that the standard of advice they receive is of a similar professional standard to that provided by registered tax agents.


It needs to be recognised that these measures have not suddenly been announced and thrust onto the industry, despite what may be said in the explanation of the dissenting report. It is clear that there has been ongoing consultation with the industry since the measures were first proposed in 2010. For those who would like to find the detail, we have very clearly set out the dates when that period of interaction occurred in our report in a quite full and very clear tabled manner.


Importantly, the measures include a generous three-year transitional arrangement, with the full regime not commencing until 1 July 2016. The transitional arrangements mean that, for an 18-month period from 1 July 2013, financial advisers could effectively continue to provide services in the same manner as they do today. I do want to stress that the length of the transition period is three years, so any sense of creating alarm about a sudden change here is misrepresenting the reality of what this legislation seeks to do.


It is also important to be aware that industry participants are genuinely supportive of the overall policy intent. The Financial Services Council, which certainly did have some reservations, stated in its submission that the FSC is supportive of the amendment of the Tax Agent Services Act to create a specific and appropriate type of tax adviser which is congruent with the tax advice a financial adviser gives in the context of financial planning. The FSC is supportive of the regime on the basis that increased advice-provider competency is a public good. It will enhance the quality and value an advice provider delivers to their client.


The Financial Planning Association of Australia also noted the benefits that the regulatory changes will have. At the committee's public hearing, the FPA's chief executive officer stated that:


The FPA understands and supports consumer protection objectives of the tax agent services regime, which include firstly that providers of tax advice are appropriately and adequately trained; secondly, that proper complaints handling and redress is available to consumers; thirdly, that enforceable ethical and professional conduct requirements are imposed on providers; and, finally, a strong regulatory oversight in relation to the Australian tax law system.


While the industry accepts the policy intent, the committee acknowledges that the industry had some concerns about the detail. After taking evidence from key industry organisations and Treasury at a public hearing, the committee has made some recommendations in its report that are intended to minimise any burden on industry participants during the three-year transition period that lies ahead. These recommendations, and the evidence provided by Treasury and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, should help allay concerns about any of the measures in the bill.


The committee has recommended that the measures be reintroduced into the parliament and passed. The committee would also like to highlight the urgency that is required in this regard. If the current regulatory exemption from the Tax Agent Services Act that exists for financial advisers expires on 30 June—this month—without a suitable replacement being enacted, a significant burden will be imposed on the industry. As the chief executive officer of the Financial Services Council, Mr John Brogden, told the committee:


The worst outcome of all would be if the legislation did not proceed in any form, because that would leave the financial advice industry in a perilous situation where an enormous number of advisers simply would be in breach and be unable to comply. That is not an acceptable environment for Australians and their financial advice.


The committee shares Mr Brogden's view that such a result would be unacceptable. The enactment of these measures prior to 1 July 2013 not only would prevent this clearly undesirable outcome but also would commence a three-year transition to a better regulatory environment, one that is absolutely and clearly focused on consumer protection and ensuring the provision of quality taxation advice.


On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the organisations that lodged submissions and the witnesses who gave evidence at the committee's public hearing, particularly given the short period of time in which the inquiry was conducted. I stress once again the general agreement across the profession about the need for this legislation to go forward and for care in the transition period to be attended to, if necessary through amendments and certainly through consultation and ongoing discussion with relevant agencies and regulatory authorities. I commend the report to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (15:53):  by leave—I am pleased to rise to make some brief comments in relation to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the provisions which were previously to be schedules 3 and 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill.


This is yet another episode of a disorganised government in a desperate scramble to get legislation through before a deadline which it has known has existed for three years. Indeed, this is also another inglorious episode where the government's standards of consultation with industry have been highly deficient. The only reason that this inquiry into this bill was held was that the coalition pointed out some of the serious flaws in the schedules to the bill as they were going through the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago. The government reluctantly agreed to excise the schedules and allow time for a committee inquiry by the corporations and financial services committee.


Coalition members of the committee have only had our concerns increased through the consultation that we have done through the committee process. It is our view that the burden of proof, which the government would need to discharge if it were to demonstrate that it is prudent to rush ahead with the provisions in their current form, should be adopted. That burden of proof has not been discharged. We are in the unfortunate position where there are now less than two weeks to go before the changes proposed by the government, which would move financial advisers into the Tax Agent Services Act regime, and yet there remain some very serious questions about the provisions of the legislation.


I will briefly highlight some of the most serious of those concerns. The first is that there has been insufficient consideration by and consultation with industry. Although it is now more than three years since the Tax Agent Services Act took effect, for much of that period there has been very little consultation occurring. A time line provided by the Financial Planning Association showed that no material consultation occurred in either 2011 or 2012. Draft legislation was exposed for the first time for consultation in February 2013, but it was only when the schedules were tabled in the bill before parliament on 29 May 2013 that industry participants were able to see key provisions, including a definition setting out the scope of the advice which would be the subject of the regulatory regime that would take effect by reason of the passing of this legislation.


It is uncontested by witnesses with different perspectives that there remains considerable work to be done before the details of this legislation are nailed down. For example, Mr Drum of CPA Australia said to the committee last week:


Some of the matters raised here quite rightly identify that every issue has not been—


The chair intervened at that point to offer the words 'perfectly resolved'—


Mr Drum responded:


Correct. There are still a lot of unanswered questions.


In the coalition's view, if there are a lot of unanswered questions that raises very serious issues about proceeding with the bill in its present form.


We were equally concerned that there does not appear to have been an adequate cost-benefit analysis conducted of these measures. One group of stakeholders, the Financial Services Council, informed the committee that they were not aware of any Treasury cost-benefit analysis being conducted, and they had not been asked to contribute to such analysis. Treasury officials, when appearing before the committee, were asked whether there had been a cost-benefit analysis. Oddly, they indicated that there had been and that we could find it on the Department of Finance and Deregulation website. It also became clear in the exchange with witnesses from the Treasury that the kinds of cost components which the Treasury had thought appropriate to include in the cost-benefit analysis excluded a number of cost categories that industry members were very concerned about. That is perhaps not surprising if the cost-benefit analysis was conducted without consultation with industry participants.


Another reason my coalition colleagues and I are very concerned about the provisions of this legislation—and we have made our concerns clear in our minority report, our dissenting report—is that this bill, if it were to pass into law in its proposed form, would impose extra cost burdens on the financial sector at a time when very substantial additional costs have already been imposed on this sector thanks to the torrent of regulations which the present government has introduced, much of it done in a chaotic, disorganised and last-minute fashion. Regrettably, this is all too consistent with this government and this minister, who I am confident did not, when he was at school at Melbourne's exclusive Xavier College, rejoice under the nickname of 'Details Shorten'. I very much doubt that that was his nickname.


Another concern to coalition members is that no evidence was persuasively presented that there would be any particular adverse consequences if this legislation were not to proceed in its present form. Witnesses who were arguing that legislation should proceed—and there were one or two of them—were given the opportunity to explain the dangers which they believed were present if the legislation did not go ahead with effect from 1 July 2013 in its present form. Their explanations, I have to report to the House, were unpersuasive.


Concerns were also raised about the breadth of the present definition in the bill. Industry participants, pleasingly, informed the committee that they had worked together to come up with another definition, and that has been agreed upon by the Financial Services Council, the Tax Institute and a range of other participants. That is a very impressive piece of work by the industry. Coalition members and senators on the committee certainly encourage the government and the Treasury to consult carefully with industry on the amended definition which so many stakeholders have come together to prepare.


In conclusion, the view of coalition members and senators of the corporations and financial services committee is that it does not make sense to allow passage of these schedules into law at this time. A much better course of action, and the course of action which we recommend, is that the current exemption which financial planners and advisers enjoy from the Tax Agent Services Act—an exemption which has been in place for three years—should be extended by a further 12 months so that the work can be done of properly analysing these provisions, taking account of the recommended changes to the definition and getting the job done right rather than rushing it at the very last minute.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:01):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill 2013. At this stage the coalition will not be supporting this bill and will be seeking to refer it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for further review, to clarify the economic impacts and to ensure that there are no unintended border control consequences that arise from this legislation.


As we see it today, we believe this bill is an attempt to regulate overseas workers participating in offshore resources activities by bringing these people into Australia's migration zone and thus requiring them to hold a valid visa under the Migration Act. Our concern is that this is just yet another union-placating exercise from this government and from this minister, particularly since this minister took hold of the portfolio earlier this year.


This is the same minister—who, sadly, is no longer with us at the table now—who shouted from the rooftops that there were 10,000 rorters in the 457 visa system while his department tripped over itself to distance itself from that claim. Clearly, that was a claim that was completely made up by the minister at the time.


This is the same government that in their attacks on the 457 visa program for months have been demonising skilled workers—skilled migrants—and the contribution they have made, and continue to make, to building this nation. This is an extraordinary thing to see; that after decades and decades of bipartisan support for skilled migration in this country this government would launch into the attacks that they have against skilled migrants in this country, who contribute from day one.


Now Labor have set their sights on resource projects. We have noticed that there has been quite a pattern since Minister O'Connor came into the revolving door of the immigration portfolio. First, there were these claims that I mentioned about the 457 visa rorting that no government agency and no report have been able to confirm. Perhaps, they came from his brother, the National Secretary of the CFMEU. He is well-known to the minister, obviously. Remember, this is the same CFMEU that donated more than $6 million to the Labor Party over the last decade.


We know that Minister O'Connor simply made this figure of 10,000 up. He plucked it right out of the air and was later forced to admit that this had been the case when the department did not provide, or was certainly not willing to provide, any evidence to back the claim up or to own any advice that went to him on that matter, because there was none. The officials told the Senate inquiry in no uncertain terms:


We certainly did not provide advice around a number of 10,000.


Not only that but one of Australia's most respected demographers, Professor Peter McDonald, a member of the government's own Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, called the Prime Minister's rhetoric on this attack on 457s as 'nasty'. 'Nasty' is what he said about the Prime Minister's attacks on skilled migration.


Now we have this bill, which is clearly designed to appease the Maritime Union of Australia. This is the same union that recently boasted celebrating 114 years of union militancy. This is the same union that has given Labor $3 million since the 2010 election. This Labor government cannot face their failures on our borders, so they go off on these distractions and diversions orchestrated by their union masters to distract the attention of the Australian public. But it is not working, because the Australian public knows and can see through this.


The minister is simply doing the bidding of his union mates, the same unions who bemoan 457 abuses but who I am advised have not actually reported one of those alleged abuses to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's investigation team. This is not surprising, given that the government has been cutting the funding of the investigatory capacities of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for years now. That is how seriously they take these concerns.


So concerned are they about 457 workers that they employ them themselves. And so concerned is the Prime Minister about 457s that she employs 'Aussie' John McTernan on a 457 in her own office. Apparently there is a shortage of media people prepared to work for the Prime Minister.


This bill is not subtle. In his second reading speech the minister is inferring that somewhere beyond our shores and beyond the reach of the Migration Act, wealthy resources companies have sent their Australian workers packing and chained foreign workers to their oil rigs and installations to slave away around the clock, overworked and underpaid. That is the sort of imputation that this minister is putting out there in the way that he has characterised these measures. The bill is not subtle, and all it is trying to do is increase the reach of the union movement. That has been a core agenda item of this minister since he has taken over the role.


If only Labor were as concerned about protecting our borders as they are about protecting the interests of the union movement. Perhaps then, we would have had in question time today an honest response from the Prime Minister when asked about whether she continued to support the decision of former Prime Minister Rudd that has caused such havoc on our borders—to abolish proven measures, and the chaos, costs and tragedy that resulted. Perhaps if this government were as keen about protecting our borders as they are the unions then she would have responded honestly, like Mark Latham did—a former Labor leader—just last week when he said it was wrong; just plain wrong.


And it was wrong that the Prime Minister not only did not take that opportunity to do that today in obfuscating in her answer but also, by implication, she stands firmly behind that decision of Prime Minister Rudd. If Prime Minister Rudd were to return as a prime minister again in that capacity—when the government has worked through yet again the latest act of this soap opera that continues to unfold on their side of the House—then he would have to simply answer one question: was he wrong to abolish the measures of the Howard government that has led to the chaos, cost and tragedy that has resulted on our borders from that decision?


The former Prime Minister, when he lost his job, said on the eve that the new prime minister, if she were to become prime minister, was going to lurch to the right. I can only assume that, if Prime Minister Rudd were to come back as Prime Minister, he must be going to lurch to the left and compound even further the grave problems that have occurred on our borders as a result of this government's poor decisions.


There are many problems on so many levels with this bill, and I can run through them. It is worth noting upfront the rank hypocrisy of this bill because when the resources industry has come to this minister, and previously to his predecessor, seeking visas for their workers these requests have been strung out for months on end. They have tied Australian businesses and foreign investors up in union red tape and bullied and belittled skilled migrants. Labor has created sovereign risk and damaged our international reputation by continually changing the rules and moving the goalposts whenever they feel like it.


Enterprise migration agreements are a case in point. These agreements were first announced in May 2011 and were supported immediately by the coalition because, in principle, they are good policy. Yet, to date—despite the then minister announcing one on the very day with the Roy Hill Mine project, implying that this thing had been done—there is no such agreement, even to this day. There is no deed of agreement for an EMA for the Roy Hill Mine project even to this day. This is a policy that has been stillborn by this government—a government that never really believed in it in the first place. With the passing of Minister Bowen and the former minister for resources, the member for Batman, any hope that there would be any genuine follow-through passed on that this quite worthy policy would be given any serious attention by a government who is basically opposed to skilled migration in these forms.


Enterprise migration agreements are a good policy and the coalition continues to support it. Three applications were deemed by the department to be complete on 11 September 2012; yet, it was confirmed in Senate estimates that none have been approved for commencement. The government's farcical and incompetent handling of EMAs has created sovereign risk and threatened vital resource projects in the pipeline. 


The mishandling of the Allseas Construction Contractors Australia issue which goes to this bill and this bill put forward before the House, has only created further confusion and threatens to deliver another blow to Australia's reputation. The industry group, Australian Mines and Metals Association., argue that this bill would impose a further level of suffocating regulatory burden on the offshore resource sector for no appreciable social or other gain, and at likely high economic cost. Moreover, AMMA fear that this bill would put at risk the viability of current projects and weigh heavily against the commencement of future projects.


This is a government that is held hostage by the unions simply tying up resource projects, installations and pipelines with yet more union red tape, stifling business and investment. This bill was drawn up by the government in response to the federal court's decision on the matter of Allseas Construction in May 2012. The court found the two pipeline vessels were not Australian resources' installations, within the meaning of the act, while they were wholly or principally engaged in operations relating to the installation of offshore pipelines. The court ruled that the vessels and noncitizens working on those vessels were not working within the migration zone as defined by subsection 5(1) of the act. As a result, overseas workers on board those vessels did not require a visa. But this minister thinks he is above the law and above the court. The bill is an unashamed attempt to get around that court decision, because it is inconvenient for the Labor Party's union masters.


The irony is that Allseas only went to court to begin with because the department of immigration had failed to provide them with the clarification they had been seeking for years. Over a number of years, the AMMA sought clarity from DIAC as to how they interpreted the migration zone with respect to workers on offshore construction vessels. The responses they received were often, 'contradictory, vague and lacking in a rigorous examination of the relevant provisions of the migration act'. Finally, Allseas gave up and went to the Federal Court to try and obtain clarity. The justice on that case confirmed on 22 May:


Allseas has endeavoured to pursue in good faith and openly, firstly, the correct interpretation of the Act from the Minister and, secondly, the obtaining of relief of a declaratory nature to clarify its obligations in those serious and imminent circumstances.


The court decision did not create a loophole; it created clarity—a clarity that was being sought by industry on these matters because clarity had not been provided. 


Labor and the unions may not like the clarity, but nevertheless it has been provided. Global law firm, DLA Piper, noted in response to the court decision:


If however amendments to the Act are mooted it will be interesting to see how the legislature proposes to overcome  international law and jurisdictional hurdles that may be placed in front of them.


The coalition are not satisfied that these changes overcome those jurisdictional hurdles. Moreover, the coalition is not convinced that the ramification of these changes proposed by Labor have been thoroughly worked through and resolved. This bill could have significant implications for business, for investors, for the resources industry, for matters of border protection—which I will come back to—not to mention the threat of potential litigation and jurisdictional conflict with international law and conventions relating to sovereign rights in international waters.


We need to look before we leap—not something this government is used to doing—and be certain that the changes that Labor is seeking to make, for the sake of placating their union mates, will not unwittingly create serious unforeseen consequences from the first day this bill is introduced and operative.


Concern has been expressed by industry groups, including the AMMA, that any attempt to regulate who may work or the employment conditions on foreign ships in international maritime zones off Australia's coastline would exceed our jurisdiction under international law as found by the Federal Court in relation to the scope of Migration Act. Nations may exercise limited sovereign rights in international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but there is also a caveat on sovereign rights contained in article 56(2) which states:


In exercising its rights and performing its duties under this Convention in the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State shall have due regard to the rights and duties of other States and shall act in a manner compatible with the provisions of this Convention.


This is already a heavily legislated and regulated space at international, federal and even state level, but too much regulation is rarely enough for this government.


There are overlapping areas of complex national and international jurisdiction, and any attempt to try and assert Australian law in defiance of existing legal precedents or international conventions must be carefully considered. Vessels and installations are also regulated under the Maritime Labour Convention 2006. Industry groups argue these conventions suggest that EEZ and ECS ships should be entitled to freedom of navigation and that any matters relating to labour conditions on board foreign ships are matters for the flag state. This would seem to be echoed in regulation 1.15D of the Fair Work Regulations 2009 which states:


… the Act does not apply in relation to all the waters … on the landward side of the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia, including such waters within the limits of a State or Territory to the extent to which its application would be inconsistent with the right of innocent passage or transit passage being exercised by ship other than—


a licensed ship or a majority Australian crewed ship. Furthermore, 1.15E notes that the extension of the Fair Work Act to ships in the EEZ or above the continental shelf is subject to 'Australia's international obligations relating to foreign ships and the concurrent jurisdiction of a foreign state'. On that basis, the Migration Act cannot be seen to apply as a blanket rule across the board to all vessels in the territorial sea, the EEZ or the ECS. Clearly, there are exceptions that need to be looked into meticulously.


The coalition recognise the importance of the offshore resources industry, which is precisely why the government should not be charging into this like a bull in a china shop without due consideration of the impacts on business and projects in the pipeline. Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer, and each year our oil and gas industries make up 2½ per cent of GDP, generating $28 billion in revenue. These industries also contribute about $9 billion in direct tax payments and supply 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs.


An inquiry by the Inspector of Transport Security into offshore oil and gas resources sector security found that companies are 'increasingly recruiting personnel from overseas due to skill shortages in Australia'. The government has said that estimates as to how many people are employed on these rigs without visas are sketchy—not like the minister's own claim about 457 abuses. This is convenient to the minister and his smear campaign on these arrangements, although I am surprised he has not produced another magical number like that 10,000 figure of 457 abuses in the system that I mentioned before. We do not know how many overseas workers are currently employed on these installations without visas. The minister admitted that much in his speech when he said that the government has an 'incomplete picture' of the number and identity of foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones—but this has not been sufficient to stop the minister from charging in with his legislation and regulation on behalf of the unions who have encouraged him. Surely that would be the first piece of information that you would think you would attempt to gather if you were serious about reforms in this space.


The very report the minister referred to, undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, noted that whilst companies are having to rely on personnel from overseas to overcome skills shortages in Australia, usually these employees are granted a 457 visa under which an applicant must be sponsored by an employer. The report went on to note that the overseas workers must demonstrate they have the skills to meet the requirements of the nominated position. Many working arrangements on resource installations or vessels are fly-in fly-out operations, and if companies want to be able to move their workers back to the mainland to another worksite or even just transit through an Australian airport or move into a different region of our waters, they require a valid visa for entry. The report concluded that, realistically, 'there is a limit on the extent to which work visa style vetting arrangements could be tightened or extended'.


The department of transport inquiry estimated there were 70 oil and gas facilities operating offshore within Australia's exclusive economic zone in 2012 and that, together, Australia's offshore oil and gas industries employed about 20,000 people in 2010-11. It is critical to note here what the minister has omitted to say—that whilst the Federal Court found the Migration Act may not have the reach to certain offshore installations or vessels, these workplaces are not operated in secret. In addition to the international conventions, the offshore resource industry is already subject to complex and overlapping regulatory systems imposed by various pieces of federal, state and territory legislation.


Under Australian law there are mechanisms in place to safeguard those who work on board installations or vessels in Commonwealth waters. Many installations operate under the purview of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, which has responsibility for the regulation of the occupational health and safety of workers on offshore facilities, wells and well operations in Commonwealth waters and in waters where state powers have been conferred. By law, offshore petroleum activities cannot begin before NOPSEMA has assessed and approved a detailed risk management plan, including how an organisation will manage risks to worker health and safety. In 2012 this organisation had oversight of 36 operators, over 151 active facilities including pipelines and production platforms, 25 titleholders across 223 petroleum titles and 257 wells, and 36 activity operators of 110 petroleum activities including drilling and seismic surveys. In 2012 it conducted 99 inspections covering a total of 156 facilities, and these visits included meetings with the health and safety representatives. During the same calendar year, just 13 complaints were made to the organisation relating to health and safety issues—the lowest recorded in seven years. This included anything from work procedures, culture, work environment, noise, heat, pollution, equipment, services, galley and accommodation to fatigue, shifts and rosters, work procedure methods, practices of management, bullying and intimidation. 


If the minister has evidence to demonstrate the size of the problem he is trying to point to then by all means produce it, but the parallel between this issue and the minister's attacks on 457s is hard to miss. The coalition look forward to the investigation by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Affairs Committee, as they perhaps may be able to shed a little more light on this, as the minister has failed to do so himself in putting forward this bill. The coalition as a result cannot lend our support this bill in its present state. The case has just simply not been made by the government. We will not be party to another Labor attack by imputation on either the resource sector or skilled migrants. We will not sign up to another episode of Labor's incompetence that could land Australia in direct confrontation with international law or legal precedent, nor will the coalition support the creation of unnecessary union red tape for business.


The resources industry in Australia not only competes for skilled labour, it also competes for a very limited pool of international investment capital for which there are many alternatives. The way this government speaks about the minerals and resources sectors you would think we had a mortgage on the capital market when it comes to investment in these sectors. We do not. We have very serious competitors and, increasingly, day by day those competitors are getting the better of us. We need to be making ourselves most attractive as an investment opportunity, but this government continues to do its best to scare business off as they continue to parrot their union mantra.


In Western Australia alone there are currently $187.5 billion in major approved projects of which $107 billion are LNG projects. Another $50 billion of LNG projects are awaiting a final investment decision. This bill jeopardises the $50 billion in unapproved LNG projects by increasing the administrative burden, not to mention the costs for engaging overseas skilled workers in this project. This bill has the potential to inflict great pain for very little, if any, gain that can be demonstrated by the government in bringing this matter before the House.


But there is another area of this that is of great concern to the coalition, and that is the unforeseen consequences for border management. The Department of Infrastructure and Transport inquiry report also notes that on some facilities a particular threat is potentially posed by the crews and passengers of SIEVs, suspected illegal entry vessels, and by international fishing boats operating close to and approaching offshore facilities. Certainly, there have been circumstances where illegal boat arrivals have tried to present at oil rigs or resource installations at sea. Currently, all Australian sea and resource installations are defined as excised offshore places so if an IMA reaches an oil rig they are not taken to have arrived in Australia's migration zone and can be processed offshore. However, there is a risk that, if this bill is not properly considered, it may undermine those arrangements. And, despite the minister protesting and saying that he is happy to guarantee these matters, I frankly cannot trust those guarantees.


We need to be sure that this would in no way present any further compromise to our borders beyond what this government has already done. Any definitional changes to Australia's migration zone requires thorough investigation to prevent the occurrence of unintended consequences that may result in litigation or override the power of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to grant or refuse a visa. In this instance, there is also Federal Court precedent that must be taken into account.


Again, this is another reason why the bill should be referred to a committee. The coalition cannot support this bill unless assurance can be provided with substantiation other than the 'just trust us' claim that is currently made. Fundamentally, this comes down to a matter of trust, and this government's trust bank is empty when it comes to border protection. There is nothing in that account upon which this government can draw. They are not just in deficit fiscally; they are in deficit when it comes to trust. When the coalition left office in 2007, there were just four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat. That figure today is over 23,000. More than 44,000 people have turned up on boats and more than 6,000 of those were children.


A government that has failed so terribly on our borders and, under Prime Minister Rudd completely abandoned the measures that worked under that government, and to this day continues to refuse accountability and acknowledgement that that set in motion the cost, chaos and tragedy that we have now seen unfold in our borders, is not a government deserving of trust on anything. This government cannot be trusted to protect our borders. 


They can be trusted to protect the interests of unions. They demonstrate that in this bill, and they have demonstrated that in other bills they are seeking to rush through the parliament as we consider these matters in these final weeks of the sitting of this parliamentary term. Whether it is Mr Rudd the member for Griffith, the former Prime Minister, whether it is the current Prime Minister, or whether it is the previous ministers for immigration or the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, none of them have earned the trust to come into this place and say, 'Trust me, it will be okay on our borders,' because the carnage that has followed from their decisions on this is there for everyone to see, and we do not trust them. It does not matter who leads the Labor Party, this Labor government will never be trusted on our borders because they have been such a hopeless failure.


So whatever prevails in the acts that follow on the sideshow that is occurring on that side of parliament, the one issue of trust on borders will remain in the negative. It will remain in the negative from now until the election, and the Australian people will have the opportunity to make a decision about that on 14 September. That is why at this stage the coalition is not prepared to support this bill. We will seek to have it referred to committee in the other place where some of these matters can be tested. This government operates from a very low bar when it comes to its substantiation and evidence to support their claims, and the coalition will apply an appropriate and responsible bar. The government has a long way to go.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (16:27):  I am astonished that the opposition which professes to be concerned about protecting our borders does not support this Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill. The shadow minister claims to be concerned about protecting our borders but shows no interest in supporting Australian maritime workers. It is disgraceful that the opposition shows no concern about the prospect of foreign flag vessels using foreign workers to extract Australian resources without their having any Australian visas whatsoever. It is a remarkable and scandalous disregard for the interests of Australian workers. The opposition is so deeply and wholly owned by and hostage to large corporations that it will not protect the interests of Australian workers and is happy to see foreign workers exploited in the cause of driving down wages and conditions. 


The shadow immigration minister's remarks made the ridiculous claim that the government here is acting above the law. What the government is doing is coming into this parliament with legislation. That is precisely what the rule of law is all about. He also made the claim that the Allseas decision gives clarity. The fact is that we have never had this situation before.


This bill gives all members of the House the chance to show which side they are on—Aussie maritime workers or large foreign corporations. The shadow minister for immigration has made it all too clear that the opposition is on the side of large foreign corporations, not on the side of Australian maritime workers. The shadow minister implied in his remarks that this bill was directed at skilled migrants. It does nothing of the kind. It is not about skilled migrants. What we are talking about here with the Allseas case is workers who have no visa at all, not skilled migrants. The amendments in this bill will regulate foreign workers participating in offshore resources activities by bringing these persons into the migration zone and therefore requiring them to hold a specific visa under the act. Of course, skilled migrants by definition already hold a visa.


The bill represents the government's response to the Federal Court's decision in Allseas Construction SA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in which the Federal Court found that foreign workers on pipe-laying vessels were not in the migration zone and therefore did not require visas. In particular, the bill provides that a person is taken to be in the migration zone while he or she is in an area to participate in or to support an offshore resources activity in relation to that area. On 15 October last year the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon. Chris Bowen, announced that the government would legislate to amend the act and clarify the situation around workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones to address the decision in Allseas and also in fulfilment of a commitment in the ALP platform:


Labor will ensure that all Australian employment and industries are regulated under Australian law, including those located on the landward side of the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia, in the Exclusive Economic Zone, or in the waters above the continental shelf. To this effect, Labor will review the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) with a view to ensuring that the definition of the 'Migration Zone' encapsulates all offshore Australian employment and industries.


The Federal Court decision found that by the operation of section 5(13) of the act two pipe-laying vessels, the Lorelay and the Solitaire, were not Australian resources installations within the meaning of the act while they were wholly or principally engaged in operations relating to the installation of offshore pipelines, thus explaining why the foreign workers on these vessels were not within or working within the migration zone and did not require a visa. The decision also meant that foreign-flagged vessels operating in Australia's exclusive economic zone were beyond many of Australia's laws, creating a loophole that could be exploited to the detriment of Australian workers. The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers expressed concern to me that some of the operators of vessels in the offshore oil and gas sector had taken the view that they could use foreign workers on these foreign-flagged vessels without any requirement to obtain anything more than a holiday visa to transfer through an Australian airport—that is, they could work without even having a 457 visa.


There are a large number of foreign-flagged vessels operating in Australian waters which are not engaged in international trading voyages or in interstate trading voyages. The clearest example of this category of vessel is the offshore oil and gas industry fleet. In this booming sector, a large majority of vessels are already foreign-flagged vessels. At any time, there are up to 200 vessels servicing the offshore oil and gas industry in Australia's exclusive economic zone. The majority of these vessels are foreign-flagged vessels—over two-thirds according to the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. These vessels spend the majority of their time in Australia's exclusive economic zone. Indeed, some of them have spent years in Australian waters.


Minister Bowen established a review within the department of immigration to examine how best to amend the Migration Act to extend the migration zone to all offshore resource industry workers. The shadow immigration minister said that the government had been a bull at a gate and that the minister had been charging in. Neither of these things was true. There was a Migration Maritime Taskforce comprising departmental subject matter experts with legal, operational and policy backgrounds. This was developed to conduct this review and explore options to determine the most appropriate way to ensure that foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones come within the ambit of the act.


The Allseas decision reduced the number of workers in the offshore resource industry captured by the Migration Act, and this, combined with other limitations in the act's operation offshore, has left a significant gap in Australia's ability to regulate the conditions in its offshore resources industry and to regulate which foreign workers are employed on these valuable national assets. Under the current legislative framework, we have an incomplete picture of the number and identity of foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones. This is in part due to the absence of a regulated visa scheme to capture those engaged in Australia's offshore maritime zones and provide the corresponding migration information.


This incomplete information has security ramifications. You would think the opposition might be concerned about security issues, but you would be wrong. The June 2012 report of the offshore oil and gas resources sector security inquiry recognised that visa security checks are one of the only ways Australia is able to examine noncitizens in this security-sensitive industry. While it is recognised—and I think we all agree—that visa character checks have their limits, in their absence the government has no information at all about some of these workers. You would expect that the opposition might be concerned about this, but apparently not.


The task force recommended that all workers should be covered, as these are Australian resources and Australian jobs. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea gives Australia the jurisdiction to do this, as it provides sovereign rights with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of Australia's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. There has been extensive stakeholder consultation about this problem with the offshore resources industry, unions and other Commonwealth agencies. More recently, the government has consulted on the findings of the task force and the issue, which informed our decision to implement the recommendations of the task force. More consultation will follow as we engage with stakeholders to develop supporting regulations for this change.


There has been a lot of discussion on the best way to effectively address the problem of unregulated work in Australia's offshore resources sector. This bill deals with the practical actions that are necessary to create real, effective tools to deal with this problem. The bill implements the key recommendations of the task force. The task force found that any question as to whether a person was in the migration zone or not should not be solely dependent on where that person was physically located but should also be dependent on the sorts of activities that person was conducting.


The amendments in this bill will regulate foreign workers participating in offshore resources activities by deeming them to be in the migration zone, which enlivens the requirement for them to hold a visa under the Migration Act. The bill will amend the Migration Act to provide that a person is taken to be in the migration zone while he or she is in an area to participate in or to support an offshore resources activity in relation to that area. The bill will define 'offshore resources activity' as an activity administered under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 or under a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory determined by the minister in writing. The amendments in this bill will bring offshore persons into the migration zone and thereby require them to hold a visa under the act.


In addition to these two acts, the bill will create a power for the minister to make a determination in writing for the purposes of defining 'offshore resources activity'. This will provide the minister with flexibility to declare certain activities administered by other regulatory schemes as offshore resource activities for the purposes of the new deemed migration zone. This would include projects that take place within areas that are within the coastal waters of the states and the Northern Territory which are regulated under state and territory laws rather than their Commonwealth equivalents.


The legislative measures will supplement the current framework under the act, which defines as part of the migration zone Australian resources installations and Australian sea installations. Together with the existing provisions in the act, this new, comprehensive framework will ensure that workers in Australia's offshore resources industry are regulated under the act and are required to hold specific visas. Individuals who engage in offshore resources activities in Australia's offshore maritime zones will be subject to existing compliance measures in the act that address breaches of work and visa conditions.


The government is working with industry and with the relevant unions to establish a specifically tailored visa pathway which will ensure that industry has the flexibility it needs while maintaining protection for Australian working conditions. It is proposed to prescribe this visa in the migration regulations of 1994. The new visa pathway will need to be in place before the requirement to hold a visa offshore commences. At this stage it is envisaged that the bill will commence in early 2014 with the intervening period used to develop the new visa arrangements.


I think it is important to implement these changes as soon as possible to give certainty to the offshore resources industry and to workers, and the government understands that industry need certainty as they develop commercial contracts and run their businesses. Where there are skills shortages and where the Australian workforce cannot provide the required labour in Australia's offshore resource activities, there will be a need for foreign workers; however, this need should not be allowed to undermine Australian working conditions and should not happen without the oversight of Australian law as is currently the case. These are Australian resources and Australian jobs. The resources are governed by Australian laws, and the jobs should be too. It gets down to the simple proposition that whilst operating in Australia foreign companies should comply with Australian laws. The current legal structures applying to the Australian maritime industry do not deliver this objective. It is critical that we as a parliament attend to the anomalous situation created by the Federal Court's decision in the Allseas case by amending the Migration Act.


We believe that there is a principle at stake here. These are Australian jobs which should be subject to Australian law. The government should act to exercise Australia's sovereign rights over the exclusive economic zone, and people working in the exclusive economic zone should be covered by Australia's laws just like people who work on the land. I commend the bill to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:41):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill 2013. I do so because I have a strong interest in this issue, given the fact that much of this activity that we are talking about happens off the coast of Western Australia, the state in which I represent the electorate of Canning. At first blush, on looking at this bill, one would think that this government was interested in some motive that was highly commendable for protecting our borders. It says here that it is not uncommon for illegal maritime arrivals to present at oil rigs and resource installations in the ocean. Currently, these ocean installations are not defined as part of Australia's migration zone. Consequently, if an illegal maritime arrival reaches an oil rig presently, they are not taken to have arrived in Australia's migration zone and could be processed offshore. The rest of this bill does not properly consider that they may undermine the offshore processing arrangements. How altruistic. But this is not what the bill is about.


This bill is about a further grab for union control of the Australian workforce. Let's have a look why. The fact of the matter is that this bill was introduced into parliament by Minister O'Connor on 30 May this year. We want to understand why it was introduced by Minister O'Connor and not by former Minister Bowen. Minister O'Connor has form in this area. You have to understand the history of somebody coming into this place with the agenda that he has. You have to know where they have been to know where they are going. We know that this minister was an Irish citizen born in England who migrated to Australia and eventually found that his best form of employment was to involve himself in the union movement—which is fine. I was a union rep myself in my previous days as a schoolteacher. Collective bargaining is not such a bad thing if it protects the rights and conditions of workers. But this is not what it is about. This is about a power grab by the unions to control the resources sector.


Not only does this minister have form from his previous working history; his brother is one of the big bosses in the CFMEU, Mr Michael O'Connor, who I understand is a very close friend of the Prime Minister. As a result, he has been sent into this place on a number of bills while there are over 200 bills that we have waiting to be passed in the next eight days in this parliament—7½ now. Why is this so important to get through in the dying days of this Gillard government? It is about shoring up one's base. It is about shoring up the financial support and support for tenure in one's seat among those in the union movement. We know that Michael O'Connor has a lot of influence. That is how his brother became a member of parliament: he had his backing. This is payback time. This is real payback time in terms of this minister and the final days of this parliament. Last week, another bill was brought into this parliament. It was called the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013. It was meant to talk about bullying, but it was actually about rights of entry and about people being able to enter the crib rooms on worksites to sign up members on spurious safety concerns. I spoke on that bill, and this is no different. This is about allowing union representatives to fly onto areas offshore—in terms of our continental shelf and our resources zone, which is about 200 kilometres—and to fly onto these rigs, these production boats, with the same rights of entry into offshore facilities. 


As I said on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013 last time we were here, what people do not understand is that this right of entry provision that is in this bill forced the owners of the construction and resource sites to pay for the transport and accommodation costs of the union people coming onsite. It was predicted that it could be up to $30,000. For example, you could fly from Perth to Karratha, you could get a helicopter out to a rig, you would be accommodated on the rig and then you would be flown back. The cost of all this could be up to $30,000 per person, and who is bearing the cost? This is all about right of entry onto our resource projects. Is it any wonder that we are now becoming uncompetitive with the rest of the world in terms of developing our resources projects and they are going offshore. Further to this, people complained about James Price Point being established onshore in the Kimberleys, for a whole range of reasons—some environmental. Broome was split down the middle over this issue. Their solution was to bring the gas from the development of this gas field by pipeline down to the LNG plants in Port Hedland. Not a bad solution. There was another solution around instead of developing Inpex in Darwin, taking the pipe from the Timor Sea and that northern area there as well. 


The problem is that the boats that are laying the pipes and servicing this particular industry are generally manned by people with offshore companies. We do not have the resources. Earlier in this parliament, the Labor Party were successful in essentially locking out foreign flag vessels from our ports unless they received the same terms and conditions of payment on their ships. You cannot compare like with like—and we will not go down that road—but, at the end of the day, if you are flagged out of the Philippines and you arrive in Australia, and the Filipino average wage is $100 a week and it is $1,000 a week in Australia, you are essentially stopping Filipino boats coming into Australia. 


Ann Pickard from Shell has decided that, instead of developing James Price Point, they will have an offshore gas facility with a massive refinement and production facility on a huge boat. Most of the skills that are on these sorts of facilities are highly specialised. Many of these people are not to be found in Australia, so you get the argument about 457s and those sorts of things. In the interim, until we do skill our workforce—and I agree with the member for Wills that we should have Australians doing these jobs—we should not stop the good job from going ahead because we do not have an Australian to do it. As a result, rather than have the project go ahead with the use of some foreign skilled workers, they are saying that you cannot have them at all. That is what this migration amendment bill is about. It is not about illegals tying up to oil rigs, it is about stopping people from coming to Australia. It is stopping people from flying through Australia and landing, for example, in Karratha, catching a helicopter out to the rig or the production platform and working on that rig so that it can produce or drill.


What the minister is doing in this bill is saying, 'We want them to now get a visa if there is a flight through Karratha.' The previous speaker—the member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson—said: 'This can be worked out. Just trust us. We'll give you a temporary holiday visa.' It does not work. You cannot get a temporary holiday visa to go and work on an offshore platform. As we have already heard, previous companies have been held up and in court for a long period of time trying to get their workers here on these so-called 'temporary visas'. He says that there needs to be certainty and that this legislation will bring certainty. It will not bring certainty to the workers and it will not bring certainty to the projects; it will only bring certainty to the unions, because they want these blokes to join a union. As I said, there is nothing wrong with joining a union, but most of the people who are coming to these offshore facilities are not Australians, because they are owned by foreign companies. What happens as a result? A tug tows a platform from South Korea down to Australia and drops it into the water off there, and then Labor says, 'Hang on, we want someone from the union and the migration department to go out and check that they have got a visa.' They are not even going to touch the mainland, in many cases, and they want them to enter into a visa arrangement. It is just impractical. 


That is why the shadow minister, Scott Morrison, has said, 'This legislation shouldn't be before this House until it has been through the Senate committee.' There are a whole lot of unintended consequences in this bill that should not be allowed to happen. There are flow-on effects that could happen, for goodness' sake, with us trying to unpick them. The cant and hypocrisy about all this is that, in terms of right of entry in the bill last week, the Independents said, 'We are not going to allow this through this place unless it is bipartisan, because we don't think it is in the Australian interest to allow these sorts of last-minute changes to happen to the Australian workforce without proper scrutiny and in a rush in the last days.' Surprise, surprise: the member for New England found some way not to be here so that the bill passed by one vote. So much for sincerity and genuine behaviour. He let it through. They are saying, 'Trust us.' It is the same on this right of entry provision—they are saying, 'Trust us.' 'More consultation,' the member for Wills said. 'There needs to be more consultation, which will follow, so trust us.' How can we trust this side of the parliament with anything when they have done to our borders what they are doing now?


Why are we talking about this bill? This Gillard-Rudd government have been in power since 2007 when they changed the migration laws. We have since had 44,219 people—and probably more because this was given to me a few days ago—and the total number of boats since 2007 has been 723 boats. I cannot keep it updated in case somebody else has arrived today. They are not coming by small boats. They are coming by ferries now. Ferries carry 200 people or more. That is how many are arriving on certain boats. They are in a rush because they know that this side of the House will stop that terrible behaviour.


The government should be concentrating on stopping these people fraudulently getting to Australia. We saw on the front page of the Australian newspaper today about the lies that have been told. You do not tell a genuine story. You make up a story so you can get past the migration officials when they assess you. The officials have actually stopped assessing people now. I think the minister said we have something like 13,000, or is it 19,000, parked in the Australian community because they cannot be processed. The next government are going to inherit this problem. Whatever the figure is, it is thousands and it is a disgrace. So do not tell us about trusting you on border protection. 


Here we are, trusting the minister. He said there are 10,000 rorts—and I am going to speak on this tomorrow—with 457 visas. I did a report on this which I will talk about tomorrow. It was a bipartisan report which found none of this and suddenly the minister said 10,000 and then he said he was only guessing and he was not sure. On this case, he said there are a whole lot of rorts in this activity. So in 2012 there were 99 inspections covering 156 facilities. Have a guess how many complaints they had. There were 13 complaints. They are bringing in legislation for 13 complaints when there are 13,000 people parked in the Australian community taking the resources and the welfare from the likes of the Salvation Army that could be giving it to hard done by Australians. Don't tell me this is important legislation that has to get through.


I am sure the Independents will pass this as they do everything. They are going to finally ingratiate themselves in the last eight days. Hopefully their electorates in New England and Lyne are hearing that they are going to help get this sort of legislation through because any future government that has to unpick it will have all sorts of problems because they have landed it through the Senate.


At the end of the day, this is not legislation that is important. Out of all the legislation that needs to come through this House, this is one of the least important pieces. The Labor Party is holding up this parliament and trying to ram this through. They have even changed the agenda—the speaker list—to get this through ahead of other legislation. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Asian Century) Bill 2013 was meant to be before this. So much for Gonski. This is Minister O'Connor paying back his union brother and his union mates in the dying days of this government because they know if they do not they will be in trouble in terms of their funding and their preselections. I hope people see this for what it is worth. It is a payback at the very last moment and this bill does not need to be through this House. It needs to be scrutinised properly in a committee of the Senate which was agreed to earlier and it has not been done. As a result, of course we will not be supporting this legislation.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:56):  It is my pleasure to rise in this House to follow what was a very passionate and thoughtful contribution by the member for Canning, as well as that by my colleague the member for Cook. This Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill 2013 will see foreign workers on overseas resource installations fall within the migration zone of Australia, thereby requiring a visa. That is what this is all about. It follows on from a Federal Court decision in May last year called the Allseas Construction case which found that two pipe laying vessels and the workers on them did not fall within the migration zone.


We cannot support this bill because, firstly, we know what its motivations are about. The member for Canning explained to this House that this is all about improving the ability of the unions to recruit workers. This is all about payback. Secondly, there has not been a rigorous analysis of the economic impacts of this bill, because it is going to increase the burden on one of our most productive sectors in the economy—namely, our resources industry. Thirdly, we do not know what the impact is going to be on our border protection system. What happens if somebody goes onto these offshore resource rigs and starts to seek asylum that way? Do they fall within the migration zone of Australia as a result of the bill? That is a legitimate question. Given this government's absolute failure to protect our borders, where we have seen more than 43,000 unauthorised arrivals come in just the few years that Labor have been in government, we cannot take them at their word. We cannot trust this government to protect our borders, let alone to protect the resource industry which does so much for the economic growth of this country.


What we are proposing today is that this bill goes to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, where the proper questions are asked, the analysis is undertaken and, ultimately, the best interests of the Australian people and the Australian economy will subsequently be served after we have had a full debate about the merits of this bill. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you do not have to take my word for this. You have to hear from companies and industry bodies that are engaged in the sector to hear what they think about this government bill before us. The Australian Metals and Mines Association has said that this bill will impose a 'further level of suffocating regulatory burden' on the offshore resource sector for 'no appreciable social or other gain and at a likely high economic cost'. The member for Goldstein, the shadow minister for finance, who is sitting in this chamber, knows all about what it takes to get the productivity of our country moving. And when he hears the words of the Australian Mines and Metals Association talk about this bill in the most derogatory terms, he knows as well as I do that this is bad news for the Australian economy, an economy which, after 14 September, he will hopefully have his hands at the reins of.


This body has also said that this bill would 'put at risk the viability of current projects and weigh heavily against the commencement of future projects'. Why is that important? That is important because currently there is a pipeline of projects in Australia that is above $100 billion just for the resource sector alone. But we have seen, under this government and due to the policies of this government, significant resource projects, both onshore and offshore, either postponed or cancelled because Australia is in danger of becoming a low-productivity, high-cost economy. We all know about Olympic Dam, that $30 billion project in South Australia, and the Port Hedland extension. We know of a number of our major energy companies—I saw the Oakajee project has now been put on hold by Mitsubishi. All of these projects that would deliver untold economic benefits and employment benefits to our country have now been put on hold because of the costs of doing business in Australia. And there you have the Australian Mines and Mines Association making it abundantly clear that the legislation before this House is putting those projects in jeopardy.


We are the ninth largest energy and oil producer in the world. This is a multibillion dollar industry in Australia that contributes up to 2.5 per cent of GDP on an annual basis, and it is growing. In our region there are more than three billion people who will be entering the middle class between now and 2050. We have China, 1.3 billion people; India, another 1.3 billion people. Those people in those countries, together with Vietnam and Indonesia, are moving rapidly into the middle classes. As a consequence of that, they are demanding energy. They are demanding energy to build their economies, to put new infrastructure in place, and to provide for the homes and the services that we have all come to take for granted here in Australia and in other advanced economies around the world. So Australia is in a perfect position to service those countries as a net energy exporter to support those people as they go up the value chain and enter the middle classes. We can do that only if we are a cost-effective place in which to do business and in which to produce energy.


I said at the start we cannot support this bill because we know that it is an explicit, unashamed grab for power by the union movement, by the masters of the Labor Party in the Maritime Union and in the CFMEU. If it is not good enough to provide millions of dollars to the Labor Party, it is good enough for the unions to get 50 per cent of all Labor votes at federal and state caucuses. And to get 100 per cent of the Labor caucus being a member of the union. Now, why is this an issue? This is an issue because in the Australian economy today, in the private sector, only 13 per cent of the workforce belongs to a union. And when you take into account the public sector, it rises to 20 per cent. But the unions are dominating the legislative agenda of this government, and this is setting back the economic priorities for Australia. We had the former head of the HSU, Kathy Jackson, say of the member for Maribyrnong, who is the minister for workplace relations in this country and the former secretary of the AWU, that he is 'Dracula in charge of the blood bank'—and boy, is he that.


The member for Canning referred in his speech to the Fair Work legislation that this parliament debated a couple of weeks ago. The right of entry provisions will ensure that no worker around this country will be able to eat their lunch in peace and quiet anymore because what this House passed was right of entry provisions that will see unions enter during the lunch hours of workers right around the country to try to recruit them to their unions. And what is more, when these union reps have to travel far distances, they will be sending a bill to the employers to pay for their travel expenses. How crazy a system has this become? There are more than 120 provisions in the Fair Work Act, which those opposite have passed, that have increased the power of the unions at the expense of the employee and at the expense of the employer. And it is no wonder that industrial disputes have more than doubled under this government. It is no wonder that this government has abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission and all that that did to create billions of dollars in new wealth and productivity improvements in our economy. It is no wonder that you have launched a war on the 457 system, and it is all because you are paying back your union mates.


The 457 visas are very relevant to this debate. The 457s are about foreign workers, just as this debate is about foreign workers on overseas resource installations.



A government member interjecting—




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  You have said that you do not want people on 457s coming to this country. That is effectively what you have said. And this is despite former minister for immigration Chris Bowen saying in January that you, as a government, have got the balance right on 457s and the Prime Minister of this country, Julia Gillard, saying in China when she was visiting there just recently that the balance is right on 457s. This is despite the number of people on 457s in this country dramatically increasing to the record high number of 125,000 today. This is despite half the members of the Transport Workers Union, including Tony Sheldon's own personal staff, being here on 457s. This is despite the Prime Minister's Scottish 'Svengali' John McTernan also being here on a 457. You have put aside all of that evidence and the fact that people coming to this country on 457s are filling voids in our labour force in information technology, engineering, health services and the resources sector to confect an argument against 457s based on what you are being told by your union paymasters.


This is not good for this country. We have seen a government become totally beholden to the power of the union movement. This bill before the House is just the latest example of it. This bill before the House is the latest instalment in an attack on foreign workers and an attack on the most productive sectors of our economy. It is very funny that on the 457s the Prime Minister said:


We inherited from the previous government a 457 temporary foreign worker visa program that was totally out of control …


If it is so out of control, why did you see the number of foreign workers coming to this country increase dramatically to today's record high number of 125,000? You did it because you understood back then that 457s were an important part of the economy. Even Chris Bowen said:


… migration is shaped by Australia's economic needs, and the Temporary Business 457 visa is a key pillar in this approach.


The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said:


… we will need skilled migration. I believe we’ve got the visa settings right particularly with short term 457 visas.


So we know that you started a war on 457s for the very same reason you are starting a war on those foreign workers working on offshore resource activities and doing so to improve the economic management of those resource companies that produce export dollars for the Australian economy and help grow our system. That is the key issue here.


In conclusion, we cannot support the bill before this House because there has not been the rigorous consultation with the industry, because there has not been an assessment of the economic impact this higher regulatory burden will have and because of the complicating factors it may have for our border protection policies and our ability to protect our borders. Most of all, we cannot support this because this is just a payback to the union movement by the Labor Party.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:01):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill 2013. At this stage the coalition will not be supporting this bill and will be seeking to refer it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for further review, to clarify the economic impacts and to ensure that there are no unintended border control consequences that arise from this legislation.


As we see it today, we believe this bill is an attempt to regulate overseas workers participating in offshore resources activities by bringing these people into Australia's migration zone and thus requiring them to hold a valid visa under the Migration Act. Our concern is that this is just yet another union-placating exercise from this government and from this minister, particularly since this minister took hold of the portfolio earlier this year.


This is the same minister—who, sadly, is no longer with us at the table now—who shouted from the rooftops that there were 10,000 rorters in the 457 visa system while his department tripped over itself to distance itself from that claim. Clearly, that was a claim that was completely made up by the minister at the time.


This is the same government that in their attacks on the 457 visa program for months have been demonising skilled workers—skilled migrants—and the contribution they have made, and continue to make, to building this nation. This is an extraordinary thing to see; that after decades and decades of bipartisan support for skilled migration in this country this government would launch into the attacks that they have against skilled migrants in this country, who contribute from day one.


Now Labor have set their sights on resource projects. We have noticed that there has been quite a pattern since Minister O'Connor came into the revolving door of the immigration portfolio. First, there were these claims that I mentioned about the 457 visa rorting that no government agency and no report have been able to confirm. Perhaps, they came from his brother, the National Secretary of the CFMEU. He is well-known to the minister, obviously. Remember, this is the same CFMEU that donated more than $6 million to the Labor Party over the last decade.


We know that Minister O'Connor simply made this figure of 10,000 up. He plucked it right out of the air and was later forced to admit that this had been the case when the department did not provide, or was certainly not willing to provide, any evidence to back the claim up or to own any advice that went to him on that matter, because there was none. The officials told the Senate inquiry in no uncertain terms:


We certainly did not provide advice around a number of 10,000.


Not only that but one of Australia's most respected demographers, Professor Peter McDonald, a member of the government's own Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, called the Prime Minister's rhetoric on this attack on 457s as 'nasty'. 'Nasty' is what he said about the Prime Minister's attacks on skilled migration.


Now we have this bill, which is clearly designed to appease the Maritime Union of Australia. This is the same union that recently boasted celebrating 114 years of union militancy. This is the same union that has given Labor $3 million since the 2010 election. This Labor government cannot face their failures on our borders, so they go off on these distractions and diversions orchestrated by their union masters to distract the attention of the Australian public. But it is not working, because the Australian public knows and can see through this.


The minister is simply doing the bidding of his union mates, the same unions who bemoan 457 abuses but who I am advised have not actually reported one of those alleged abuses to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's investigation team. This is not surprising, given that the government has been cutting the funding of the investigatory capacities of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for years now. That is how seriously they take these concerns.


So concerned are they about 457 workers that they employ them themselves. And so concerned is the Prime Minister about 457s that she employs 'Aussie' John McTernan on a 457 in her own office. Apparently there is a shortage of media people prepared to work for the Prime Minister.


This bill is not subtle. In his second reading speech the minister is inferring that somewhere beyond our shores and beyond the reach of the Migration Act, wealthy resources companies have sent their Australian workers packing and chained foreign workers to their oil rigs and installations to slave away around the clock, overworked and underpaid. That is the sort of imputation that this minister is putting out there in the way that he has characterised these measures. The bill is not subtle, and all it is trying to do is increase the reach of the union movement. That has been a core agenda item of this minister since he has taken over the role.


If only Labor were as concerned about protecting our borders as they are about protecting the interests of the union movement. Perhaps then, we would have had in question time today an honest response from the Prime Minister when asked about whether she continued to support the decision of former Prime Minister Rudd that has caused such havoc on our borders—to abolish proven measures, and the chaos, costs and tragedy that resulted. Perhaps if this government were as keen about protecting our borders as they are the unions then she would have responded honestly, like Mark Latham did—a former Labor leader—just last week when he said it was wrong; just plain wrong.


And it was wrong that the Prime Minister not only did not take that opportunity to do that today in obfuscating in her answer but also, by implication, she stands firmly behind that decision of Prime Minister Rudd. If Prime Minister Rudd were to return as a prime minister again in that capacity—when the government has worked through yet again the latest act of this soap opera that continues to unfold on their side of the House—then he would have to simply answer one question: was he wrong to abolish the measures of the Howard government that has led to the chaos, cost and tragedy that has resulted on our borders from that decision?


The former Prime Minister, when he lost his job, said on the eve that the new prime minister, if she were to become prime minister, was going to lurch to the right. I can only assume that, if Prime Minister Rudd were to come back as Prime Minister, he must be going to lurch to the left and compound even further the grave problems that have occurred on our borders as a result of this government's poor decisions.


There are many problems on so many levels with this bill, and I can run through them. It is worth noting upfront the rank hypocrisy of this bill because when the resources industry has come to this minister, and previously to his predecessor, seeking visas for their workers these requests have been strung out for months on end. They have tied Australian businesses and foreign investors up in union red tape and bullied and belittled skilled migrants. Labor has created sovereign risk and damaged our international reputation by continually changing the rules and moving the goalposts whenever they feel like it.


Enterprise migration agreements are a case in point. These agreements were first announced in May 2011 and were supported immediately by the coalition because, in principle, they are good policy. Yet, to date—despite the then minister announcing one on the very day with the Roy Hill Mine project, implying that this thing had been done—there is no such agreement, even to this day. There is no deed of agreement for an EMA for the Roy Hill Mine project even to this day. This is a policy that has been stillborn by this government—a government that never really believed in it in the first place. With the passing of Minister Bowen and the former minister for resources, the member for Batman, any hope that there would be any genuine follow-through passed on that this quite worthy policy would be given any serious attention by a government who is basically opposed to skilled migration in these forms.


Enterprise migration agreements are a good policy and the coalition continues to support it. Three applications were deemed by the department to be complete on 11 September 2012; yet, it was confirmed in Senate estimates that none have been approved for commencement. The government's farcical and incompetent handling of EMAs has created sovereign risk and threatened vital resource projects in the pipeline. 


The mishandling of the Allseas Construction Contractors Australia issue which goes to this bill and this bill put forward before the House, has only created further confusion and threatens to deliver another blow to Australia's reputation. The industry group, Australian Mines and Metals Association., argue that this bill would impose a further level of suffocating regulatory burden on the offshore resource sector for no appreciable social or other gain, and at likely high economic cost. Moreover, AMMA fear that this bill would put at risk the viability of current projects and weigh heavily against the commencement of future projects.


This is a government that is held hostage by the unions simply tying up resource projects, installations and pipelines with yet more union red tape, stifling business and investment. This bill was drawn up by the government in response to the federal court's decision on the matter of Allseas Construction in May 2012. The court found the two pipeline vessels were not Australian resources' installations, within the meaning of the act, while they were wholly or principally engaged in operations relating to the installation of offshore pipelines. The court ruled that the vessels and noncitizens working on those vessels were not working within the migration zone as defined by subsection 5(1) of the act. As a result, overseas workers on board those vessels did not require a visa. But this minister thinks he is above the law and above the court. The bill is an unashamed attempt to get around that court decision, because it is inconvenient for the Labor Party's union masters.


The irony is that Allseas only went to court to begin with because the department of immigration had failed to provide them with the clarification they had been seeking for years. Over a number of years, the AMMA sought clarity from DIAC as to how they interpreted the migration zone with respect to workers on offshore construction vessels. The responses they received were often, 'contradictory, vague and lacking in a rigorous examination of the relevant provisions of the migration act'. Finally, Allseas gave up and went to the Federal Court to try and obtain clarity. The justice on that case confirmed on 22 May:


Allseas has endeavoured to pursue in good faith and openly, firstly, the correct interpretation of the Act from the Minister and, secondly, the obtaining of relief of a declaratory nature to clarify its obligations in those serious and imminent circumstances.


The court decision did not create a loophole; it created clarity—a clarity that was being sought by industry on these matters because clarity had not been provided. 


Labor and the unions may not like the clarity, but nevertheless it has been provided. Global law firm, DLA Piper, noted in response to the court decision:


If however amendments to the Act are mooted it will be interesting to see how the legislature proposes to overcome  international law and jurisdictional hurdles that may be placed in front of them.


The coalition are not satisfied that these changes overcome those jurisdictional hurdles. Moreover, the coalition is not convinced that the ramification of these changes proposed by Labor have been thoroughly worked through and resolved. This bill could have significant implications for business, for investors, for the resources industry, for matters of border protection—which I will come back to—not to mention the threat of potential litigation and jurisdictional conflict with international law and conventions relating to sovereign rights in international waters.


We need to look before we leap—not something this government is used to doing—and be certain that the changes that Labor is seeking to make, for the sake of placating their union mates, will not unwittingly create serious unforeseen consequences from the first day this bill is introduced and operative.


Concern has been expressed by industry groups, including the AMMA, that any attempt to regulate who may work or the employment conditions on foreign ships in international maritime zones off Australia's coastline would exceed our jurisdiction under international law as found by the Federal Court in relation to the scope of Migration Act. Nations may exercise limited sovereign rights in international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but there is also a caveat on sovereign rights contained in article 56(2) which states:


In exercising its rights and performing its duties under this Convention in the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State shall have due regard to the rights and duties of other States and shall act in a manner compatible with the provisions of this Convention.


This is already a heavily legislated and regulated space at international, federal and even state level, but too much regulation is rarely enough for this government.


There are overlapping areas of complex national and international jurisdiction, and any attempt to try and assert Australian law in defiance of existing legal precedents or international conventions must be carefully considered. Vessels and installations are also regulated under the Maritime Labour Convention 2006. Industry groups argue these conventions suggest that EEZ and ECS ships should be entitled to freedom of navigation and that any matters relating to labour conditions on board foreign ships are matters for the flag state. This would seem to be echoed in regulation 1.15D of the Fair Work Regulations 2009 which states:


… the Act does not apply in relation to all the waters … on the landward side of the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia, including such waters within the limits of a State or Territory to the extent to which its application would be inconsistent with the right of innocent passage or transit passage being exercised by ship other than—


a licensed ship or a majority Australian crewed ship. Furthermore, 1.15E notes that the extension of the Fair Work Act to ships in the EEZ or above the continental shelf is subject to 'Australia's international obligations relating to foreign ships and the concurrent jurisdiction of a foreign state'. On that basis, the Migration Act cannot be seen to apply as a blanket rule across the board to all vessels in the territorial sea, the EEZ or the ECS. Clearly, there are exceptions that need to be looked into meticulously.


The coalition recognise the importance of the offshore resources industry, which is precisely why the government should not be charging into this like a bull in a china shop without due consideration of the impacts on business and projects in the pipeline. Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer, and each year our oil and gas industries make up 2½ per cent of GDP, generating $28 billion in revenue. These industries also contribute about $9 billion in direct tax payments and supply 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs.


An inquiry by the Inspector of Transport Security into offshore oil and gas resources sector security found that companies are 'increasingly recruiting personnel from overseas due to skill shortages in Australia'. The government has said that estimates as to how many people are employed on these rigs without visas are sketchy—not like the minister's own claim about 457 abuses. This is convenient to the minister and his smear campaign on these arrangements, although I am surprised he has not produced another magical number like that 10,000 figure of 457 abuses in the system that I mentioned before. We do not know how many overseas workers are currently employed on these installations without visas. The minister admitted that much in his speech when he said that the government has an 'incomplete picture' of the number and identity of foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones—but this has not been sufficient to stop the minister from charging in with his legislation and regulation on behalf of the unions who have encouraged him. Surely that would be the first piece of information that you would think you would attempt to gather if you were serious about reforms in this space.


The very report the minister referred to, undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, noted that whilst companies are having to rely on personnel from overseas to overcome skills shortages in Australia, usually these employees are granted a 457 visa under which an applicant must be sponsored by an employer. The report went on to note that the overseas workers must demonstrate they have the skills to meet the requirements of the nominated position. Many working arrangements on resource installations or vessels are fly-in fly-out operations, and if companies want to be able to move their workers back to the mainland to another worksite or even just transit through an Australian airport or move into a different region of our waters, they require a valid visa for entry. The report concluded that, realistically, 'there is a limit on the extent to which work visa style vetting arrangements could be tightened or extended'.


The department of transport inquiry estimated there were 70 oil and gas facilities operating offshore within Australia's exclusive economic zone in 2012 and that, together, Australia's offshore oil and gas industries employed about 20,000 people in 2010-11. It is critical to note here what the minister has omitted to say—that whilst the Federal Court found the Migration Act may not have the reach to certain offshore installations or vessels, these workplaces are not operated in secret. In addition to the international conventions, the offshore resource industry is already subject to complex and overlapping regulatory systems imposed by various pieces of federal, state and territory legislation.


Under Australian law there are mechanisms in place to safeguard those who work on board installations or vessels in Commonwealth waters. Many installations operate under the purview of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, which has responsibility for the regulation of the occupational health and safety of workers on offshore facilities, wells and well operations in Commonwealth waters and in waters where state powers have been conferred. By law, offshore petroleum activities cannot begin before NOPSEMA has assessed and approved a detailed risk management plan, including how an organisation will manage risks to worker health and safety. In 2012 this organisation had oversight of 36 operators, over 151 active facilities including pipelines and production platforms, 25 titleholders across 223 petroleum titles and 257 wells, and 36 activity operators of 110 petroleum activities including drilling and seismic surveys. In 2012 it conducted 99 inspections covering a total of 156 facilities, and these visits included meetings with the health and safety representatives. During the same calendar year, just 13 complaints were made to the organisation relating to health and safety issues—the lowest recorded in seven years. This included anything from work procedures, culture, work environment, noise, heat, pollution, equipment, services, galley and accommodation to fatigue, shifts and rosters, work procedure methods, practices of management, bullying and intimidation. 


If the minister has evidence to demonstrate the size of the problem he is trying to point to then by all means produce it, but the parallel between this issue and the minister's attacks on 457s is hard to miss. The coalition look forward to the investigation by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Affairs Committee, as they perhaps may be able to shed a little more light on this, as the minister has failed to do so himself in putting forward this bill. The coalition as a result cannot lend our support this bill in its present state. The case has just simply not been made by the government. We will not be party to another Labor attack by imputation on either the resource sector or skilled migrants. We will not sign up to another episode of Labor's incompetence that could land Australia in direct confrontation with international law or legal precedent, nor will the coalition support the creation of unnecessary union red tape for business.


The resources industry in Australia not only competes for skilled labour, it also competes for a very limited pool of international investment capital for which there are many alternatives. The way this government speaks about the minerals and resources sectors you would think we had a mortgage on the capital market when it comes to investment in these sectors. We do not. We have very serious competitors and, increasingly, day by day those competitors are getting the better of us. We need to be making ourselves most attractive as an investment opportunity, but this government continues to do its best to scare business off as they continue to parrot their union mantra.


In Western Australia alone there are currently $187.5 billion in major approved projects of which $107 billion are LNG projects. Another $50 billion of LNG projects are awaiting a final investment decision. This bill jeopardises the $50 billion in unapproved LNG projects by increasing the administrative burden, not to mention the costs for engaging overseas skilled workers in this project. This bill has the potential to inflict great pain for very little, if any, gain that can be demonstrated by the government in bringing this matter before the House.


But there is another area of this that is of great concern to the coalition, and that is the unforeseen consequences for border management. The Department of Infrastructure and Transport inquiry report also notes that on some facilities a particular threat is potentially posed by the crews and passengers of SIEVs, suspected illegal entry vessels, and by international fishing boats operating close to and approaching offshore facilities. Certainly, there have been circumstances where illegal boat arrivals have tried to present at oil rigs or resource installations at sea. Currently, all Australian sea and resource installations are defined as excised offshore places so if an IMA reaches an oil rig they are not taken to have arrived in Australia's migration zone and can be processed offshore. However, there is a risk that, if this bill is not properly considered, it may undermine those arrangements. And, despite the minister protesting and saying that he is happy to guarantee these matters, I frankly cannot trust those guarantees.


We need to be sure that this would in no way present any further compromise to our borders beyond what this government has already done. Any definitional changes to Australia's migration zone requires thorough investigation to prevent the occurrence of unintended consequences that may result in litigation or override the power of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to grant or refuse a visa. In this instance, there is also Federal Court precedent that must be taken into account.


Again, this is another reason why the bill should be referred to a committee. The coalition cannot support this bill unless assurance can be provided with substantiation other than the 'just trust us' claim that is currently made. Fundamentally, this comes down to a matter of trust, and this government's trust bank is empty when it comes to border protection. There is nothing in that account upon which this government can draw. They are not just in deficit fiscally; they are in deficit when it comes to trust. When the coalition left office in 2007, there were just four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat. That figure today is over 23,000. More than 44,000 people have turned up on boats and more than 6,000 of those were children.


A government that has failed so terribly on our borders and, under Prime Minister Rudd completely abandoned the measures that worked under that government, and to this day continues to refuse accountability and acknowledgement that that set in motion the cost, chaos and tragedy that we have now seen unfold in our borders, is not a government deserving of trust on anything. This government cannot be trusted to protect our borders. 


They can be trusted to protect the interests of unions. They demonstrate that in this bill, and they have demonstrated that in other bills they are seeking to rush through the parliament as we consider these matters in these final weeks of the sitting of this parliamentary term. Whether it is Mr Rudd the member for Griffith, the former Prime Minister, whether it is the current Prime Minister, or whether it is the previous ministers for immigration or the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, none of them have earned the trust to come into this place and say, 'Trust me, it will be okay on our borders,' because the carnage that has followed from their decisions on this is there for everyone to see, and we do not trust them. It does not matter who leads the Labor Party, this Labor government will never be trusted on our borders because they have been such a hopeless failure.


So whatever prevails in the acts that follow on the sideshow that is occurring on that side of parliament, the one issue of trust on borders will remain in the negative. It will remain in the negative from now until the election, and the Australian people will have the opportunity to make a decision about that on 14 September. That is why at this stage the coalition is not prepared to support this bill. We will seek to have it referred to committee in the other place where some of these matters can be tested. This government operates from a very low bar when it comes to its substantiation and evidence to support their claims, and the coalition will apply an appropriate and responsible bar. The government has a long way to go.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (16:27):  I am astonished that the opposition which professes to be concerned about protecting our borders does not support this Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill. The shadow minister claims to be concerned about protecting our borders but shows no interest in supporting Australian maritime workers. It is disgraceful that the opposition shows no concern about the prospect of foreign flag vessels using foreign workers to extract Australian resources without their having any Australian visas whatsoever. It is a remarkable and scandalous disregard for the interests of Australian workers. The opposition is so deeply and wholly owned by and hostage to large corporations that it will not protect the interests of Australian workers and is happy to see foreign workers exploited in the cause of driving down wages and conditions. 


The shadow immigration minister's remarks made the ridiculous claim that the government here is acting above the law. What the government is doing is coming into this parliament with legislation. That is precisely what the rule of law is all about. He also made the claim that the Allseas decision gives clarity. The fact is that we have never had this situation before.


This bill gives all members of the House the chance to show which side they are on—Aussie maritime workers or large foreign corporations. The shadow minister for immigration has made it all too clear that the opposition is on the side of large foreign corporations, not on the side of Australian maritime workers. The shadow minister implied in his remarks that this bill was directed at skilled migrants. It does nothing of the kind. It is not about skilled migrants. What we are talking about here with the Allseas case is workers who have no visa at all, not skilled migrants. The amendments in this bill will regulate foreign workers participating in offshore resources activities by bringing these persons into the migration zone and therefore requiring them to hold a specific visa under the act. Of course, skilled migrants by definition already hold a visa.


The bill represents the government's response to the Federal Court's decision in Allseas Construction SA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in which the Federal Court found that foreign workers on pipe-laying vessels were not in the migration zone and therefore did not require visas. In particular, the bill provides that a person is taken to be in the migration zone while he or she is in an area to participate in or to support an offshore resources activity in relation to that area. On 15 October last year the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon. Chris Bowen, announced that the government would legislate to amend the act and clarify the situation around workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones to address the decision in Allseas and also in fulfilment of a commitment in the ALP platform:


Labor will ensure that all Australian employment and industries are regulated under Australian law, including those located on the landward side of the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia, in the Exclusive Economic Zone, or in the waters above the continental shelf. To this effect, Labor will review the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) with a view to ensuring that the definition of the 'Migration Zone' encapsulates all offshore Australian employment and industries.


The Federal Court decision found that by the operation of section 5(13) of the act two pipe-laying vessels, the Lorelay and the Solitaire, were not Australian resources installations within the meaning of the act while they were wholly or principally engaged in operations relating to the installation of offshore pipelines, thus explaining why the foreign workers on these vessels were not within or working within the migration zone and did not require a visa. The decision also meant that foreign-flagged vessels operating in Australia's exclusive economic zone were beyond many of Australia's laws, creating a loophole that could be exploited to the detriment of Australian workers. The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers expressed concern to me that some of the operators of vessels in the offshore oil and gas sector had taken the view that they could use foreign workers on these foreign-flagged vessels without any requirement to obtain anything more than a holiday visa to transfer through an Australian airport—that is, they could work without even having a 457 visa.


There are a large number of foreign-flagged vessels operating in Australian waters which are not engaged in international trading voyages or in interstate trading voyages. The clearest example of this category of vessel is the offshore oil and gas industry fleet. In this booming sector, a large majority of vessels are already foreign-flagged vessels. At any time, there are up to 200 vessels servicing the offshore oil and gas industry in Australia's exclusive economic zone. The majority of these vessels are foreign-flagged vessels—over two-thirds according to the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. These vessels spend the majority of their time in Australia's exclusive economic zone. Indeed, some of them have spent years in Australian waters.


Minister Bowen established a review within the department of immigration to examine how best to amend the Migration Act to extend the migration zone to all offshore resource industry workers. The shadow immigration minister said that the government had been a bull at a gate and that the minister had been charging in. Neither of these things was true. There was a Migration Maritime Taskforce comprising departmental subject matter experts with legal, operational and policy backgrounds. This was developed to conduct this review and explore options to determine the most appropriate way to ensure that foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones come within the ambit of the act.


The Allseas decision reduced the number of workers in the offshore resource industry captured by the Migration Act, and this, combined with other limitations in the act's operation offshore, has left a significant gap in Australia's ability to regulate the conditions in its offshore resources industry and to regulate which foreign workers are employed on these valuable national assets. Under the current legislative framework, we have an incomplete picture of the number and identity of foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones. This is in part due to the absence of a regulated visa scheme to capture those engaged in Australia's offshore maritime zones and provide the corresponding migration information.


This incomplete information has security ramifications. You would think the opposition might be concerned about security issues, but you would be wrong. The June 2012 report of the offshore oil and gas resources sector security inquiry recognised that visa security checks are one of the only ways Australia is able to examine noncitizens in this security-sensitive industry. While it is recognised—and I think we all agree—that visa character checks have their limits, in their absence the government has no information at all about some of these workers. You would expect that the opposition might be concerned about this, but apparently not.


The task force recommended that all workers should be covered, as these are Australian resources and Australian jobs. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea gives Australia the jurisdiction to do this, as it provides sovereign rights with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of Australia's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. There has been extensive stakeholder consultation about this problem with the offshore resources industry, unions and other Commonwealth agencies. More recently, the government has consulted on the findings of the task force and the issue, which informed our decision to implement the recommendations of the task force. More consultation will follow as we engage with stakeholders to develop supporting regulations for this change.


There has been a lot of discussion on the best way to effectively address the problem of unregulated work in Australia's offshore resources sector. This bill deals with the practical actions that are necessary to create real, effective tools to deal with this problem. The bill implements the key recommendations of the task force. The task force found that any question as to whether a person was in the migration zone or not should not be solely dependent on where that person was physically located but should also be dependent on the sorts of activities that person was conducting.


The amendments in this bill will regulate foreign workers participating in offshore resources activities by deeming them to be in the migration zone, which enlivens the requirement for them to hold a visa under the Migration Act. The bill will amend the Migration Act to provide that a person is taken to be in the migration zone while he or she is in an area to participate in or to support an offshore resources activity in relation to that area. The bill will define 'offshore resources activity' as an activity administered under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 or under a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory determined by the minister in writing. The amendments in this bill will bring offshore persons into the migration zone and thereby require them to hold a visa under the act.


In addition to these two acts, the bill will create a power for the minister to make a determination in writing for the purposes of defining 'offshore resources activity'. This will provide the minister with flexibility to declare certain activities administered by other regulatory schemes as offshore resource activities for the purposes of the new deemed migration zone. This would include projects that take place within areas that are within the coastal waters of the states and the Northern Territory which are regulated under state and territory laws rather than their Commonwealth equivalents.


The legislative measures will supplement the current framework under the act, which defines as part of the migration zone Australian resources installations and Australian sea installations. Together with the existing provisions in the act, this new, comprehensive framework will ensure that workers in Australia's offshore resources industry are regulated under the act and are required to hold specific visas. Individuals who engage in offshore resources activities in Australia's offshore maritime zones will be subject to existing compliance measures in the act that address breaches of work and visa conditions.


The government is working with industry and with the relevant unions to establish a specifically tailored visa pathway which will ensure that industry has the flexibility it needs while maintaining protection for Australian working conditions. It is proposed to prescribe this visa in the migration regulations of 1994. The new visa pathway will need to be in place before the requirement to hold a visa offshore commences. At this stage it is envisaged that the bill will commence in early 2014 with the intervening period used to develop the new visa arrangements.


I think it is important to implement these changes as soon as possible to give certainty to the offshore resources industry and to workers, and the government understands that industry need certainty as they develop commercial contracts and run their businesses. Where there are skills shortages and where the Australian workforce cannot provide the required labour in Australia's offshore resource activities, there will be a need for foreign workers; however, this need should not be allowed to undermine Australian working conditions and should not happen without the oversight of Australian law as is currently the case. These are Australian resources and Australian jobs. The resources are governed by Australian laws, and the jobs should be too. It gets down to the simple proposition that whilst operating in Australia foreign companies should comply with Australian laws. The current legal structures applying to the Australian maritime industry do not deliver this objective. It is critical that we as a parliament attend to the anomalous situation created by the Federal Court's decision in the Allseas case by amending the Migration Act.


We believe that there is a principle at stake here. These are Australian jobs which should be subject to Australian law. The government should act to exercise Australia's sovereign rights over the exclusive economic zone, and people working in the exclusive economic zone should be covered by Australia's laws just like people who work on the land. I commend the bill to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:41):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill 2013. I do so because I have a strong interest in this issue, given the fact that much of this activity that we are talking about happens off the coast of Western Australia, the state in which I represent the electorate of Canning. At first blush, on looking at this bill, one would think that this government was interested in some motive that was highly commendable for protecting our borders. It says here that it is not uncommon for illegal maritime arrivals to present at oil rigs and resource installations in the ocean. Currently, these ocean installations are not defined as part of Australia's migration zone. Consequently, if an illegal maritime arrival reaches an oil rig presently, they are not taken to have arrived in Australia's migration zone and could be processed offshore. The rest of this bill does not properly consider that they may undermine the offshore processing arrangements. How altruistic. But this is not what the bill is about.


This bill is about a further grab for union control of the Australian workforce. Let's have a look why. The fact of the matter is that this bill was introduced into parliament by Minister O'Connor on 30 May this year. We want to understand why it was introduced by Minister O'Connor and not by former Minister Bowen. Minister O'Connor has form in this area. You have to understand the history of somebody coming into this place with the agenda that he has. You have to know where they have been to know where they are going. We know that this minister was an Irish citizen born in England who migrated to Australia and eventually found that his best form of employment was to involve himself in the union movement—which is fine. I was a union rep myself in my previous days as a schoolteacher. Collective bargaining is not such a bad thing if it protects the rights and conditions of workers. But this is not what it is about. This is about a power grab by the unions to control the resources sector.


Not only does this minister have form from his previous working history; his brother is one of the big bosses in the CFMEU, Mr Michael O'Connor, who I understand is a very close friend of the Prime Minister. As a result, he has been sent into this place on a number of bills while there are over 200 bills that we have waiting to be passed in the next eight days in this parliament—7½ now. Why is this so important to get through in the dying days of this Gillard government? It is about shoring up one's base. It is about shoring up the financial support and support for tenure in one's seat among those in the union movement. We know that Michael O'Connor has a lot of influence. That is how his brother became a member of parliament: he had his backing. This is payback time. This is real payback time in terms of this minister and the final days of this parliament. Last week, another bill was brought into this parliament. It was called the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013. It was meant to talk about bullying, but it was actually about rights of entry and about people being able to enter the crib rooms on worksites to sign up members on spurious safety concerns. I spoke on that bill, and this is no different. This is about allowing union representatives to fly onto areas offshore—in terms of our continental shelf and our resources zone, which is about 200 kilometres—and to fly onto these rigs, these production boats, with the same rights of entry into offshore facilities. 


As I said on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2013 last time we were here, what people do not understand is that this right of entry provision that is in this bill forced the owners of the construction and resource sites to pay for the transport and accommodation costs of the union people coming onsite. It was predicted that it could be up to $30,000. For example, you could fly from Perth to Karratha, you could get a helicopter out to a rig, you would be accommodated on the rig and then you would be flown back. The cost of all this could be up to $30,000 per person, and who is bearing the cost? This is all about right of entry onto our resource projects. Is it any wonder that we are now becoming uncompetitive with the rest of the world in terms of developing our resources projects and they are going offshore. Further to this, people complained about James Price Point being established onshore in the Kimberleys, for a whole range of reasons—some environmental. Broome was split down the middle over this issue. Their solution was to bring the gas from the development of this gas field by pipeline down to the LNG plants in Port Hedland. Not a bad solution. There was another solution around instead of developing Inpex in Darwin, taking the pipe from the Timor Sea and that northern area there as well. 


The problem is that the boats that are laying the pipes and servicing this particular industry are generally manned by people with offshore companies. We do not have the resources. Earlier in this parliament, the Labor Party were successful in essentially locking out foreign flag vessels from our ports unless they received the same terms and conditions of payment on their ships. You cannot compare like with like—and we will not go down that road—but, at the end of the day, if you are flagged out of the Philippines and you arrive in Australia, and the Filipino average wage is $100 a week and it is $1,000 a week in Australia, you are essentially stopping Filipino boats coming into Australia. 


Ann Pickard from Shell has decided that, instead of developing James Price Point, they will have an offshore gas facility with a massive refinement and production facility on a huge boat. Most of the skills that are on these sorts of facilities are highly specialised. Many of these people are not to be found in Australia, so you get the argument about 457s and those sorts of things. In the interim, until we do skill our workforce—and I agree with the member for Wills that we should have Australians doing these jobs—we should not stop the good job from going ahead because we do not have an Australian to do it. As a result, rather than have the project go ahead with the use of some foreign skilled workers, they are saying that you cannot have them at all. That is what this migration amendment bill is about. It is not about illegals tying up to oil rigs, it is about stopping people from coming to Australia. It is stopping people from flying through Australia and landing, for example, in Karratha, catching a helicopter out to the rig or the production platform and working on that rig so that it can produce or drill.


What the minister is doing in this bill is saying, 'We want them to now get a visa if there is a flight through Karratha.' The previous speaker—the member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson—said: 'This can be worked out. Just trust us. We'll give you a temporary holiday visa.' It does not work. You cannot get a temporary holiday visa to go and work on an offshore platform. As we have already heard, previous companies have been held up and in court for a long period of time trying to get their workers here on these so-called 'temporary visas'. He says that there needs to be certainty and that this legislation will bring certainty. It will not bring certainty to the workers and it will not bring certainty to the projects; it will only bring certainty to the unions, because they want these blokes to join a union. As I said, there is nothing wrong with joining a union, but most of the people who are coming to these offshore facilities are not Australians, because they are owned by foreign companies. What happens as a result? A tug tows a platform from South Korea down to Australia and drops it into the water off there, and then Labor says, 'Hang on, we want someone from the union and the migration department to go out and check that they have got a visa.' They are not even going to touch the mainland, in many cases, and they want them to enter into a visa arrangement. It is just impractical. 


That is why the shadow minister, Scott Morrison, has said, 'This legislation shouldn't be before this House until it has been through the Senate committee.' There are a whole lot of unintended consequences in this bill that should not be allowed to happen. There are flow-on effects that could happen, for goodness' sake, with us trying to unpick them. The cant and hypocrisy about all this is that, in terms of right of entry in the bill last week, the Independents said, 'We are not going to allow this through this place unless it is bipartisan, because we don't think it is in the Australian interest to allow these sorts of last-minute changes to happen to the Australian workforce without proper scrutiny and in a rush in the last days.' Surprise, surprise: the member for New England found some way not to be here so that the bill passed by one vote. So much for sincerity and genuine behaviour. He let it through. They are saying, 'Trust us.' It is the same on this right of entry provision—they are saying, 'Trust us.' 'More consultation,' the member for Wills said. 'There needs to be more consultation, which will follow, so trust us.' How can we trust this side of the parliament with anything when they have done to our borders what they are doing now?


Why are we talking about this bill? This Gillard-Rudd government have been in power since 2007 when they changed the migration laws. We have since had 44,219 people—and probably more because this was given to me a few days ago—and the total number of boats since 2007 has been 723 boats. I cannot keep it updated in case somebody else has arrived today. They are not coming by small boats. They are coming by ferries now. Ferries carry 200 people or more. That is how many are arriving on certain boats. They are in a rush because they know that this side of the House will stop that terrible behaviour.


The government should be concentrating on stopping these people fraudulently getting to Australia. We saw on the front page of the Australian newspaper today about the lies that have been told. You do not tell a genuine story. You make up a story so you can get past the migration officials when they assess you. The officials have actually stopped assessing people now. I think the minister said we have something like 13,000, or is it 19,000, parked in the Australian community because they cannot be processed. The next government are going to inherit this problem. Whatever the figure is, it is thousands and it is a disgrace. So do not tell us about trusting you on border protection. 


Here we are, trusting the minister. He said there are 10,000 rorts—and I am going to speak on this tomorrow—with 457 visas. I did a report on this which I will talk about tomorrow. It was a bipartisan report which found none of this and suddenly the minister said 10,000 and then he said he was only guessing and he was not sure. On this case, he said there are a whole lot of rorts in this activity. So in 2012 there were 99 inspections covering 156 facilities. Have a guess how many complaints they had. There were 13 complaints. They are bringing in legislation for 13 complaints when there are 13,000 people parked in the Australian community taking the resources and the welfare from the likes of the Salvation Army that could be giving it to hard done by Australians. Don't tell me this is important legislation that has to get through.


I am sure the Independents will pass this as they do everything. They are going to finally ingratiate themselves in the last eight days. Hopefully their electorates in New England and Lyne are hearing that they are going to help get this sort of legislation through because any future government that has to unpick it will have all sorts of problems because they have landed it through the Senate.


At the end of the day, this is not legislation that is important. Out of all the legislation that needs to come through this House, this is one of the least important pieces. The Labor Party is holding up this parliament and trying to ram this through. They have even changed the agenda—the speaker list—to get this through ahead of other legislation. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Asian Century) Bill 2013 was meant to be before this. So much for Gonski. This is Minister O'Connor paying back his union brother and his union mates in the dying days of this government because they know if they do not they will be in trouble in terms of their funding and their preselections. I hope people see this for what it is worth. It is a payback at the very last moment and this bill does not need to be through this House. It needs to be scrutinised properly in a committee of the Senate which was agreed to earlier and it has not been done. As a result, of course we will not be supporting this legislation.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:56):  It is my pleasure to rise in this House to follow what was a very passionate and thoughtful contribution by the member for Canning, as well as that by my colleague the member for Cook. This Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill 2013 will see foreign workers on overseas resource installations fall within the migration zone of Australia, thereby requiring a visa. That is what this is all about. It follows on from a Federal Court decision in May last year called the Allseas Construction case which found that two pipe laying vessels and the workers on them did not fall within the migration zone.


We cannot support this bill because, firstly, we know what its motivations are about. The member for Canning explained to this House that this is all about improving the ability of the unions to recruit workers. This is all about payback. Secondly, there has not been a rigorous analysis of the economic impacts of this bill, because it is going to increase the burden on one of our most productive sectors in the economy—namely, our resources industry. Thirdly, we do not know what the impact is going to be on our border protection system. What happens if somebody goes onto these offshore resource rigs and starts to seek asylum that way? Do they fall within the migration zone of Australia as a result of the bill? That is a legitimate question. Given this government's absolute failure to protect our borders, where we have seen more than 43,000 unauthorised arrivals come in just the few years that Labor have been in government, we cannot take them at their word. We cannot trust this government to protect our borders, let alone to protect the resource industry which does so much for the economic growth of this country.


What we are proposing today is that this bill goes to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, where the proper questions are asked, the analysis is undertaken and, ultimately, the best interests of the Australian people and the Australian economy will subsequently be served after we have had a full debate about the merits of this bill. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you do not have to take my word for this. You have to hear from companies and industry bodies that are engaged in the sector to hear what they think about this government bill before us. The Australian Metals and Mines Association has said that this bill will impose a 'further level of suffocating regulatory burden' on the offshore resource sector for 'no appreciable social or other gain and at a likely high economic cost'. The member for Goldstein, the shadow minister for finance, who is sitting in this chamber, knows all about what it takes to get the productivity of our country moving. And when he hears the words of the Australian Mines and Metals Association talk about this bill in the most derogatory terms, he knows as well as I do that this is bad news for the Australian economy, an economy which, after 14 September, he will hopefully have his hands at the reins of.


This body has also said that this bill would 'put at risk the viability of current projects and weigh heavily against the commencement of future projects'. Why is that important? That is important because currently there is a pipeline of projects in Australia that is above $100 billion just for the resource sector alone. But we have seen, under this government and due to the policies of this government, significant resource projects, both onshore and offshore, either postponed or cancelled because Australia is in danger of becoming a low-productivity, high-cost economy. We all know about Olympic Dam, that $30 billion project in South Australia, and the Port Hedland extension. We know of a number of our major energy companies—I saw the Oakajee project has now been put on hold by Mitsubishi. All of these projects that would deliver untold economic benefits and employment benefits to our country have now been put on hold because of the costs of doing business in Australia. And there you have the Australian Mines and Mines Association making it abundantly clear that the legislation before this House is putting those projects in jeopardy.


We are the ninth largest energy and oil producer in the world. This is a multibillion dollar industry in Australia that contributes up to 2.5 per cent of GDP on an annual basis, and it is growing. In our region there are more than three billion people who will be entering the middle class between now and 2050. We have China, 1.3 billion people; India, another 1.3 billion people. Those people in those countries, together with Vietnam and Indonesia, are moving rapidly into the middle classes. As a consequence of that, they are demanding energy. They are demanding energy to build their economies, to put new infrastructure in place, and to provide for the homes and the services that we have all come to take for granted here in Australia and in other advanced economies around the world. So Australia is in a perfect position to service those countries as a net energy exporter to support those people as they go up the value chain and enter the middle classes. We can do that only if we are a cost-effective place in which to do business and in which to produce energy.


I said at the start we cannot support this bill because we know that it is an explicit, unashamed grab for power by the union movement, by the masters of the Labor Party in the Maritime Union and in the CFMEU. If it is not good enough to provide millions of dollars to the Labor Party, it is good enough for the unions to get 50 per cent of all Labor votes at federal and state caucuses. And to get 100 per cent of the Labor caucus being a member of the union. Now, why is this an issue? This is an issue because in the Australian economy today, in the private sector, only 13 per cent of the workforce belongs to a union. And when you take into account the public sector, it rises to 20 per cent. But the unions are dominating the legislative agenda of this government, and this is setting back the economic priorities for Australia. We had the former head of the HSU, Kathy Jackson, say of the member for Maribyrnong, who is the minister for workplace relations in this country and the former secretary of the AWU, that he is 'Dracula in charge of the blood bank'—and boy, is he that.


The member for Canning referred in his speech to the Fair Work legislation that this parliament debated a couple of weeks ago. The right of entry provisions will ensure that no worker around this country will be able to eat their lunch in peace and quiet anymore because what this House passed was right of entry provisions that will see unions enter during the lunch hours of workers right around the country to try to recruit them to their unions. And what is more, when these union reps have to travel far distances, they will be sending a bill to the employers to pay for their travel expenses. How crazy a system has this become? There are more than 120 provisions in the Fair Work Act, which those opposite have passed, that have increased the power of the unions at the expense of the employee and at the expense of the employer. And it is no wonder that industrial disputes have more than doubled under this government. It is no wonder that this government has abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission and all that that did to create billions of dollars in new wealth and productivity improvements in our economy. It is no wonder that you have launched a war on the 457 system, and it is all because you are paying back your union mates.


The 457 visas are very relevant to this debate. The 457s are about foreign workers, just as this debate is about foreign workers on overseas resource installations.



A government member interjecting—




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  You have said that you do not want people on 457s coming to this country. That is effectively what you have said. And this is despite former minister for immigration Chris Bowen saying in January that you, as a government, have got the balance right on 457s and the Prime Minister of this country, Julia Gillard, saying in China when she was visiting there just recently that the balance is right on 457s. This is despite the number of people on 457s in this country dramatically increasing to the record high number of 125,000 today. This is despite half the members of the Transport Workers Union, including Tony Sheldon's own personal staff, being here on 457s. This is despite the Prime Minister's Scottish 'Svengali' John McTernan also being here on a 457. You have put aside all of that evidence and the fact that people coming to this country on 457s are filling voids in our labour force in information technology, engineering, health services and the resources sector to confect an argument against 457s based on what you are being told by your union paymasters.


This is not good for this country. We have seen a government become totally beholden to the power of the union movement. This bill before the House is just the latest example of it. This bill before the House is the latest instalment in an attack on foreign workers and an attack on the most productive sectors of our economy. It is very funny that on the 457s the Prime Minister said:


We inherited from the previous government a 457 temporary foreign worker visa program that was totally out of control …


If it is so out of control, why did you see the number of foreign workers coming to this country increase dramatically to today's record high number of 125,000? You did it because you understood back then that 457s were an important part of the economy. Even Chris Bowen said:


… migration is shaped by Australia's economic needs, and the Temporary Business 457 visa is a key pillar in this approach.


The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said:


… we will need skilled migration. I believe we’ve got the visa settings right particularly with short term 457 visas.


So we know that you started a war on 457s for the very same reason you are starting a war on those foreign workers working on offshore resource activities and doing so to improve the economic management of those resource companies that produce export dollars for the Australian economy and help grow our system. That is the key issue here.


In conclusion, we cannot support the bill before this House because there has not been the rigorous consultation with the industry, because there has not been an assessment of the economic impact this higher regulatory burden will have and because of the complicating factors it may have for our border protection policies and our ability to protect our borders. Most of all, we cannot support this because this is just a payback to the union movement by the Labor Party.


Debate adjourned.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (18:23):  It is good to see people turning up to hear this important speech. Obviously, education is something I am particularly passionate about and this educational transition bill is a part of the process towards changing Australia's education future; a future that is complemented by many of the other activities by this government—No. 1, obviously by doubling the education budget, especially the big part of that being that both sides of the chamber have been involved in, with the Building the Education Revolution component. 


I have seen time and time again photographs of people from both sides of the chamber happy to acknowledge the contribution—albeit an economic program—to schools of the new facilities. I can go around Moreton and talk to school communities who were involved in decisions to bring in new school facilities; things like learning labs, new sets of classrooms, and school halls or performing arts halls. I have seen it at the Kuraby State School. I could list every single school in my electorate that has benefited from the BER program, but the doubling of the education budget is not only about an economic program; it is also about preparing Australia for a lift in educational standards. Sadly, we can look at state governments and we can look at national governments: the reality is educational standards have dropped in Australia in the last 20 years.


I finished teaching in 1997. It is sad to think that the students being educated now have educational standards, in some areas of disadvantage, that are two or three years below where they were 20 years ago. That is a shameful legacy for any government—irrespective of their political persuasion.


The Labor government saw that we needed to do more. As I said, the initial BER program was an economic program but then, look at the other reforms that we have brought in that I am very, very proud of when I talk to my teaching colleagues—I will be seeing a lot of them in a fortnight at a bit of a reunion. To be able to talk about a national curriculum—something that was too hard for this federation for 110 years, but now we have a national curriculum. When we look at improving teaching standards, when we look at reporting on the achievements of schools so that wherever you are in the country you can click on the web—if you are lucky enough to be connected to the web; obviously, when we roll out the National Broadband Network that will facilitate that because the NBN is not all about economic infrastructure; it is also about educational infrastructure—and as a parent or a student you can see how your school is performing by comparing like with like. Whether you are from a remote Western Australian school or a big inner-city school, you can make an assessment of where you are going. 


The Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 and the Australian Education Bill 2012 government amendments are all about that rollout of educational improvements in terms of making sure that our commitment to Australian schooling provides a high-quality and equitable education for all students. That is in the Labor Party's DNA.


The government's response to the recommendations of the independent Review of the Funding for Schooling, which found—as everyone who has been lobbied by a Gonski parent, a Gonski-concerned citizen, a Gonski grandparent or the neighbour of a Gonski activist knows by now—that the previous school funding arrangements, or the current school funding arrangements, are not meeting the educational needs of all Australian children, particularly disadvantaged students. In every school, whether it be independent, Catholic or state—that is why people go into education so that we give as much advantage to students as possible. The amendments implement the National Plan for School Improvement, including new needs based funding arrangements for government and non-government schools from 1 January 2014.


Let's have a look at that. I stand here as a student who attended a Catholic primary school and a state high school, who has a child at a Catholic primary school and who taught in state schools and Catholic schools. I have also had a lot to do with Christian schools and other independent schools. I have a fair degree of background in education and I know the journey that Australian governments have made over the years from looking at the arguments about who should fund non-government schools—we go back a long time. In terms of the parliament getting it right, effectively, this Australian education bill is the pinnacle. It achieves what we are trying to do by moving funds and resources towards disadvantage. 


The Commonwealth recurrent funding for schooling will now be delivered through fair and transparent needs based arrangements, providing new investment to support reforms that will help to improve each students' achievements at school. In the past we have seen the SES model, which was an idea that was flawed from the start by extracting the census collection district data from a parent then using that data to calculate whether the funds should flow to that school. We saw when the SES model was introduced that basically half the schools were funding maintained from the start. I understand that idea of making sure that schools do not lose a dollar, but when you have a system that effectively means half the schools are not in the system you know that you are not getting it right.


Under our new arrangements the participating schools will receive additional investment. Evidence based reforms will also be supported under the National Plan for School Improvement. We will look at the things that we know work—we have seen them work. You can go to the schools in my electorate that are national partnership schools. All we are effectively doing is rolling out that national partnership model on a national scale, to all 9,200 schools. Let us look at those things: quality teaching, quality learning, making sure the data that is produced is transparent and that there is accountability. We look at student needs and we also make sure that schools make decisions based on their community. Concerned parents working with professional educators and school staff are the best ones to make decisions for their environment, whether it be in Coolangatta or Cunnamulla or the cape.


Anywhere in Queensland, anywhere in Australia, local communities need to be involved and working with the educators. How will we do that? We will do it through a new schooling resource standard that will deliver a per student level of funding based on current funding levels for higher achieving efficient schools. So we will not be dealt that cruel blow that we saw in Queensland, where every single school had their funding cut under Campbell Newman. The reality there was every state school having their funding cut, combined with the Victorian and New South Wales cuts that I do not know as much about. Then, because the way they calculate funding allocations is based on how much goes towards a state government school, the funding cut to schools by Campbell and his Liberal cronies meant that every non-government school in Queensland received a consequential cut.


The funding cuts in Queensland were through things as simple as using a rounding-down capacity. Once upon a time you calculated the number of kids on day 8 of the school year, you came up with a number and if it worked out to be 23.8 teachers you got the resources associated with 23.8 teachers. But Campbell Newman, in a cruel blow at the start of this school year, rounded down so that instead of having 23.8 teachers you ended up with 23. If you are a big school you can perhaps accommodate a 0.8 reduction in staff. It has meant a lot of principals and members of the executive have gone back into the classroom, which is tough for them. Teaching colleagues of mine—people I have taught with in the past or that I know in my electorate—have had to go back into the classroom to plug this rounding-down gap. What we are doing now with the new schooling resource standard will abolish that because we will be able to give out funds according to the costs of helping a child overcome educational disadvantage, rather than using the reasonably arbitrary figures that have floated around in the evolution we have had over the last 40 or 50 years towards the correct funding model.


I see the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is here. I did not see him at Nyanda State High School or at Yeronga State School, where I would have loved to have seen him. I wish he had been allowed to come and visit me at those schools. The kids there would have loved to have seen him. I would have loved to have taken him to Nyanda State High School, the school that the Newman government has flagged to close down, the school that produced Billy Thorpe and Lobby Loyde. How can you have a school that produced two musicians like that yet they are now talking about closing it down? That is a school I would have loved to have taken the minister to.


We know that no school will lose out under this model. We have committed that no school will lose a dollar per student under these new arrangements. Each year, every school authority will receive at least the per student funding level it received the previous year, plus indexation to cover real increases in costs. I heard today a Liberal National Party member say that Queensland schools are going to miss out under our Gonski model. I know that is not the case. The Liberal National Party member was misleading the House, as far as I was concerned. For a start we have a Premier who cut funds to every school in Queensland—and I am sure we will hear about the cuts to Victoria and New South Wales—and then there are those consequences when it comes to calculating what non-government schools in Queensland receive.


I am very proud of this legislation. I am proud to have been associated with this reform process of getting it right. Every school, from the richest school in Queensland to the poorest school in Queensland, can unpack this model, see that it is transparent, see that it is fair and see where the resources will flow to disadvantage. As a Queenslander, coming from the most decentralised state and from a little country town where the high school opened when I was in grade 8 and there were 12 people in year 12, I can say that the education I received was the only thing that gave me a decent chance in life. I understand how much it costs to get it right in a decentralised state like Queensland, because the reality is we have a lot of small schools, of little one-teacher schools, and we are changing with a moving population as the shearing population decreases and other industries are on the rise. 


This Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill will usher in a new series of changes that I am particularly proud to be associated with. I particularly want to commend the education minister, Minister Garrett, who has been a regular visitor to my electorate on this topic. I thank him in particular for a storybook he donated to St Brendan's school. On the public record, I can pass on from the principal how much they appreciated that gesture. When he turned a certain age—I will leave it to him to inform the House how old——they appreciated him coming to the school, they sang 'Happy Birthday' to him and he responded by sending them a lovely storybook. I commend this legislation to the House and look forward to it rolling out throughout the nation.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (18:37):  This Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill will put in place a framework for the implementation of David Gonski's review of school funding. I wish to draw the attention of the House to one illuminating experience from the past year in my electorate of Tangney. The petitions committee of which I am a member made the historic trip to Perth in Western Australia. It made the trip to engage with students at Santa Maria College in Applecross. It was my opinion and that of all the members of the committee that the girls who gave evidence and opinion to the committee were rational and intelligent and inimitably the epitome of a good education. So if the girls of year 12 in Applecross were so good and so enlightening, what is so wrong with education? Why would any government try to endanger the quality of education at Santa Maria that Santa Maria can offer these girls and the many other girls of Applecross today and into the future? 


The situation this bill will initiate will be that many private schools in my electorate will have a future of uncertainty and relative disadvantage. Put simply, the message that this bill sends out is clear: we want to increase the average level of schooling but we want to do this by bringing down the tallest poppy by hitting over the head the brightest and best-performing independent schools. Let us not legislate tall poppyism into our future. Tall poppyism should have no future. Why do we act on this today? We act because we know that the empires of the futures are the empires of the mind. Good education reform is important. The Productivity Commission states that reform in this area could add 1.2 per cent gain to labour productivity and gains from human capital of four times other microeconomic reforms.


The coalition will not subscribe to any plan that will negatively impact on faith in our private schools. We know that choice is the key. That is what parents want and that is what they deserve—a better way forward. Focus should be put more on the quality of teachers, parental engagement and school autonomy, so the SES or socioeconomic status is the Liberal stance on funding of education. And it is working. Let us build on this, not tear it down. A better way forward for the education bill would be to use vouchers to address preprimary and primary funding and getting real with what business models illustrate and demand cost-benefit analysis of what capital employed would indicate.  


By moving to implement this bill, the Labor recipe for education has a bitter lemon aftertaste in scrapping tax refunds in favour of cash payments. Problematically, because of the fungibility issue, how is one to guarantee that the money has actually been spent on education? Also, if it is means tested as stated, then there are administration costs and so it becomes inefficient and less equitable.


Additionally troublesome are the amounts of cash bonus. Labor appear to have got the emphasis all mixed up. Large amounts of capital should be directed at the primary level as opposed to the secondary level. The plan outlined by Labor gives $820 to secondary school students and $410 to primary students. This is nonsense as the costs associated with primary are higher and also get a better return for investment in the long run than secondary. The sense of primary investment and early intervention are backed up by the work of Blauer, Posner and Becker, noted economists of long-standing and international distinction. They have literally written books on good education and economic policy. 


Investing early and often has many positive prosocial externalities. The spillovers are many and are compounded over time by a multiplication effect. Examples are in the area of crime and democratic participation et cetera. Per dollar return on investment is greatest at the earliest stages. You have an issue otherwise of diminishing utility. This is where mandatory preschool, as in WA from 2013, has a role. Finance could be found from ceasing to commit to overreductions in class size—and I repeat that 'overreductions in class size '. Reductions in class size do not pass the cost benefit of the capital-employed test and it is subject to unjustifiably high diminishing marginal utility. We must show a brave originality to break free of orthodoxy and heuristic reasoning. It is a message that is fed by the dominant teachers unions. While no-one can doubt the good work of teachers that the teachers of this nation do every single day, this is not about teachers. It is about the children. 


So how can Liberals get smart education policy that fits with the Asian century? PISA has found that it is not the volume of money spent but the way we spend it—vouchers. Liberals believe in empowering parents through the market mechanism, expanding freedom and incentive through a Friedman-style voucher system. Performing schools will then be rewarded and incentive created. This formed part of the Liberal 2010 manifesto. We see Labor recognise this in how the NDIS will operate. Vouchers in education must also be linked with reform in personal taxation such that an earned income tax credit would recognise the value of work over welfare. Cash incentives for grades work. Fryer, Sadoff and Levitt—prominent, pioneering and visionary economic policy leaders—have shown them to do so.


Let's not waste time talking about radical change; let's just do it. We need bold ideas to tackle the declining number of students undertaking secondary studies in the hard sciences and maths and the flow-on effects this is having on the Australian economy. At present, students in years 11 and 12 are dropping physics, chemistry and maths in favour of easier humanities subjects such as history and politics to boost their entrance scores. A lack of interest in physics, maths and chemistry sees fewer enrolments at university, and this has a knock-on effect on Australia's research and development capabilities. Fostering an appreciation for the fundamentals of science will prosper a culture of excellence and create a strong base to ensure long-term economic growth. I firmly believe science and maths should be core subjects for every student right up to year 12. But the government then took two steps back, dismantling the Australian Learning and Teaching Council, which was a vital cog driving research in universities. This is a major blow to our research and development capabilities and will have economic flow-on effects.


China has made the seemingly obvious connection between investment in the sciences and maths and the multiplier effect on GDP growth. It is now reaping economic and technological rewards. More than half of all Chinese students graduate in the hard sciences and engineering, compared with a world average of 27 per cent and only 17 per cent in the US—and it is even lower here. During the period 1993 to 2003, China's R&D expenditures grew faster than those of any other nation, pushing its share of world R&D investment from 3.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent. During the same period, the European Union's share declined from 28.5 per cent to 25 per cent. Australia's R&D expenditure as a proportion of GDP remains lower than the OECD average—shameful—although it has increased in recent years. This is a terrible indictment of a nation as prosperous as ours. Given our economic and social position, our R&D expenditure should track the upper end of OECD nations. We should be in a race for the top, not for the bottom. In January 2006, China initiated a 15-year medium-to-long-term plan for the development of science and technology. The nation aims to become an innovation-oriented society by 2020 and a world leader in science and technology by 2050. Under the plan, China wants to develop indigenous innovation capabilities and leapfrog into leading new industries by increasing R&D expenditures to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2020.


Australia needs to set ambitious goals and commit funding to the long term. This is our space race moment. We need teachers trained in these areas of expertise. Paying these teachers as professionals while acknowledging the need to pay them more than other teachers and giving these subjects more weight when it comes to university entrance exams are just two measures to encourage more students to study maths and science. I congratulate the University of Western Australia, which has begun to give greater weight to these subjects. Hopefully this will help address the slide against maths and science based subjects.


Teaching, learning and advancements in research and development are at the core of ensuring Australia has a prosperous economic future. But it all starts with the basics—science and maths being a central cog in our children's learning machine. This education bill has nothing to say on this. Given the positive link between education and the economic multiplier, we have to ask ourselves what kind of economy we, the coalition, are hoping to shape through educational advancement.


I have one question for the Gillard government. It is the one question I am asked every single day in my electorate of Tangney. Young and old alike ask me: if education reform is really so important to Labor, why are they not putting any money into the Gonski review's recommendations until—get this—2022? There is no money until 2022—nearly 10 years over three governments. What hubris. What trickery. And where is this money going to come from? What a shame.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (18:50):  With considerable pride and pleasure, I rise to speak to the bill before the House, the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. We have had some rather interesting contributions here this afternoon from my colleague the member for Moreton, who, like me, before entering parliament spent a period of time as a teacher. I spent considerably more time in the classroom, I think, than the member for Moreton. The member for Lingiari, who is sitting there as well, is another teacher. I have to say that being a teacher is a professional experience in my life of which I am incredibly proud. I am one of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who became members of that great profession because, once upon a time in this country—well over a century ago—a man with vision for the future of the country, Sir Henry Parkes, responded to an understanding that grew at that time around the world about the power of education to change lives, about the importance of it for society and about the challenge to liberate children, through education, to the possibilities of reaching their full potential.


Happily, we have had a very successful range of schools on offer for young Australians to become a part of; but the reality is that in the last 40 years, since the last major inquiry into the outcomes of schooling was undertaken through the Whitlam era, we have seen a degradation of funding of schools to a point that, when the Gonski review was undertaken recently, it was found that young people who had started school together 10 years ago—young Australians born into the same country—through their experience of going to different schools and born into different families, being far away from the city, being from an Indigenous family or being born with a language other than English spoken before they entered school, when they hit school were unable to get the type of resourcing and education opportunities they needed to build up the skills to enable them to be as successful at school as peers who were from non-Indigenous family backgrounds or living in the city.


Essentially, we have a system in Australia where there is a great inequity in the outcomes of schooling. We know that there is a basic amount of funding that each school student needs. We also know that we need to provide additional funding for those five critical areas in which we can transform people's learning. The reality is that we want a fair system. We want to make up the gap of a failure to invest over many years in this country and do it in a way that ensures a great future for every young Australian who shows up at the school gate in kindergarten, no matter which school they go to, no matter what state they live in and no matter what family background they may have. It is an indictment on our country that poor children are failing at school. We simply cannot allow that to continue.


This morning I was very pleased to make some points in the public place about my hope for the young children who were starting school in Victoria. I am pleased to say that in New South Wales the Premier of our state has seen the light with at least one policy area minister. He has signed up to the reforms that we are proposing here to give to our country an option for better schools and a chance for all of our young people to have a great education. Sadly, at this point in time kids south of the border in Victoria are looking at a leadership team in the conservative leader of that state and his Minister for Education, Martin Dixon, who are deliberately going out into the public place and claiming that some schools will be worse off under the plan that we are proposing. The reality is that every school in every sector will get increases in funding every single year.


The deliberate misrepresentation of the sorts of funding options that are available for every student in every school is really mischief-making in the extreme. It is one thing for people to make claims that might give them a short-term political advantage. That is always a dangerous path to take, in my view. I think the Australian people see through that and expect us to do better on both sides of the parliament. The reality is it is totally atrocious to play with the futures of children by declaring incorrect facts and making the parents of schoolchildren, teachers, school systems and the whole community think there is something wrong with investing an additional $4 billion in the education of their children. That is quite disgraceful.


I hope that as the week continues the Victorian education minister, Martin Dixon, will really take to heart his responsibility to ensure the young people of Victoria have the right and opportunity to see a future for their own education where they will receive the funding they need to be successful and the loadings we propose to add into the baseload of funding will provide the teachers with additional resources and the schools who need additional resources in the form of teachers and practical physical resources will get what they need to make sure it is possible for kids to learn.


I could best describe the reality through the experience of meeting a wonderful young woman in my electorate just over the weekend. She has a son who has struggled at school. He has been a part of the Reading Recovery program at his school. That is a renowned education program started by Marie Clay, and the outcomes for many children are absolutely life transforming. Kids who cannot read become readers. For her son, that program has not worked. He has now been withdrawn from that program; and, because there is no funding capacity for that school, there is now no special learning program for her son. This woman in particular understands why this is so vital. In her conversation with me she declared that she herself cannot read. She has survived her life and runs her own small business using her memory in an incredibly impressive way to manage the literacy demands of our community, but she more than anyone understands why her son needs the sort of program that this investment that we will put into schools—that this money that we will give to teachers and principals to do the right thing by kids—will pay for, but only under this Labor government.


Those opposite say the system is not broken. Those opposite say they do not need to put the money into schools. Those opposite say those children do not need those resources. The reality is that, while this debate is going on and many fine ideas can be put, every single parent who shows up with their kids at school every morning expects that they are going to be able to send them to school, whatever school they are at, and have adequate resources provided for teachers to do a great job.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (18:59):  I am pleased to speak and outline the coalition's stance on this transitional and consequential amendments bill to the Australian Education Bill 2013 that the House of Representatives passed in the last sitting week and which is now in the Senate. We do not oppose this bill, as we did not the Australian Education Bill, because it is a measure of the confusion of the government that they are now passing bills through the House of Representatives to implement new school funding plans before these plans have even been agreed to by state governments. We are in the extraordinary position where the House rises on 27 June, and the agreements with the states to implement a new school funding model can be agreed to anytime up to 30 June. So the House will rise on 27 June, and five out of eight jurisdictions—three have already signed up—could sign up between 27 June and 30 June, which would make the new school funding model work. But, equally, none of those five might sign up to the government's new school funding agreement. The House and the Senate will have passed a new school funding model bill, and the consequential and transitional amendments bill that goes with it, for a national school funding agreement that has no agreement and does not have national implications because it is not agreed to by an overwhelming majority of states. 


The government has got us into the ridiculous position where we are debating a bill to implement a new school funding model when not all of the states have agreed to a new school funding model. It is very different to the way that the government and the opposition handled the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which was handled in a bipartisan way. Therefore, the states and territories knew that they could sign up to the agreement for a National Disability Insurance Scheme and that it would be implemented by either a Labor government or a coalition government. In this case, on the other hand, it is very clear that there are some states that have very strong views opposing the introduction of this new school funding model—and I will go through some of those in a moment. 


The coalition has very serious concerns about this new school funding model. The first of those concerns is that it is all far too late. For this government to try and implement a new school funding model to begin on 1 January 2014, this debate needed to be held last year, in 2012. As I travel around Australia—and I have been the shadow minister for 4½ years—principals tell me that to implement a new school funding model takes about 12 to 18 months. This government has potentially given non-government and government schools less than six months to implement a new school funding model, assuming one is agreed to by all the states. It is far too late, at five minutes to midnight, for the Prime Minister and the minister for schools to try and implement a new school funding model in Australia which would normally take 12 to 18 months to do properly—and they have given themselves six months to do it.


If we were faced with a government with a record of achievement and competence, that we knew were capable of putting pink batts in the ceilings of people's homes, or building school halls that were not overpriced, or managing the live cattle exports trade—or any of the other examples I could give—then you might give them the benefit of the doubt. But we do not have that kind of government in Australia at the moment. We have a government that we know is manifestly incompetent. The prospect of them introducing an even more complicated model than the current model, that is less transparent and has had less time for consultation and negotiation with the states and the non-government sector—and the idea of them implementing that successfully—is a long way from the expectations of the opposition. For that reason, we have very serious concerns about this minister's capacity to implement any kind of new school funding model, let alone one that applies differently in different states to different sectors. Even within those sectors and within those states, depending on whether they have achieved the student resource standard or not, it applies different levels of indexation to those non-government and government schools in the same state. It is much more complicated and much less transparent than the previous model. 


It also provides a much greater concentration of power in the hands of the federal minister for education than has ever been precedented before in Australia. The Premier of Tasmania got this right on Friday when she said that Tasmania was very reluctant to sign up to a new school funding model because she did not want the opposition having that much power over Tasmanian state schools. Now, quite apart from the fact that it appears that the Premier of Tasmania has already given up on the prospect of the Gillard government being returned—which seems to be running up the white flag rather prematurely since we have 90 days or 89 days to go before the election—the Premier of Tasmania is correct inasmuch as this new funding model would give unprecedented power to the minister for schools at the federal level. The Premier of Tasmania is right: schools are run by state governments. They employ teachers, they own the infrastructure and they make the decisions in their schools. This new model, apart from creating another new bureaucracy called the Australian School Performance Institute—yet another institute and another bureaucracy in Canberra—also devolves enormous amounts of discretionary power to the federal minister for education to intervene in state government and non-government schools. 


This is one of the reasons why the National Catholic Education Commission is so concerned about signing up lock, stock and barrel to a new school funding model that allows the federal minister for education to determine whether they can vary from the school funding model that is proposed in this legislation. The Catholic system has always been run very independently. They cross-subsidise between their schools, and they do not want to have to go back, cap in hand, to the federal minister for education if they ever want to vary those arrangements. I can understand their reticence. I can also understand Western Australia's, Tasmania's, Victoria's, Queensland's and the Northern Territory's reticence at signing up to a model which allows the federal minister for education to determine the operations and management of schools in the state systems. Western Australia particularly has been doing very well in terms of its student outcomes since it shifted to a model that had greater autonomy for school principals; they call it Independent Public Schools in Western Australia.


Why should they allow the federal minister for education to ride in over the top of the state minister for education and say, 'We don't like the way you are managing your schools and, because we now have this new power under the National Plan for School Improvement, we can tell you exactly what we want you to do.' The coalition does not support that. The coalition believes in the devolution of power to the levels of government to whom it should be devolved and that state governments run state schools. State governments should be the primary decision makers in state schools.


I have talked before about how this new school funding model is a swindle. I will not delay the House at great length about that tonight other than to remind the House that the Gonski report into school funding called for $6½ billion each year in new school funding. Over the forward estimates, which is four years, you would expect that to be $26 billion. What does this new school funding model deliver? It delivers a cut to school funding of $325 million over the next four years. 


Those states and territories that have signed up to it—the ACT, New South Wales and South Australia—have signed up to a new school funding model that cuts school funding over the next four years by $325 million. Then you have to suspend everything you know about this Prime Minister and this government to believe that, miraculously, in 2018 and 2019 rivers of gold will flow to the school sector to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. That is $7.8 billion in year 5 and year 6.


It is like your boss saying, 'I am giving a big pay rise and you should go out and plan on that basis.' Out you go and you change your mortgage or you do whatever you like with credit cards or you buy a new car and then you get your pay packet and there has been a cut. You go back to your boss and you say, 'How come you promised me a pay rise? I have relied on that to make all sorts of decisions and there is actually a pay cut in my salary.' The boss says, 'No, no, you get a big pay rise. You just have to wait five or six years for it to happen.' 


No Australian would accept that from their boss and no state or territory government should accept that from the federal government. I might be cynical, but I do not believe that the Prime Minister will win the next three elections in a row and deliver rivers of gold in 2018 and 2019 to schools when she could not even keep a promise for six days not to introduce a carbon tax before the last election. This is not the Gonski report being implemented. This is a swindle being visited on schools. Principals and parents know it. Another one of our concerns is the confused data.




Dr Leigh:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas I ask the member for Sturt to withdraw his term which appeared unparliamentary to my ears.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! For the benefit of the House I ask the member for Sturt to withdraw.




Mr PYNE:
  I am not sure what term it was, Mr Deputy Speaker. I said 'truthful'—I do not believe the Prime Minister—or 'swindle'. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member will withdraw.




Mr PYNE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly never referred to anybody as a 'swindler', but I said this was a swindle.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member will withdraw unequivocally and get back on the bill.




Mr PYNE:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, if it suits the House to do so.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is good.




Mr PYNE:
  One of our other concerns is with the confused data that is associated with this new school funding model. Every time the government gives data to the states or to the non-government sector, and the non-government sector and states model that data to determine how many of their schools will be worse off, they then publish a list showing how many of their schools will lose money. The government says, 'You have got the wrong data. We will give you the right data. We do not know what data you are relying on but it is the wrong data.'


The only data the schools are relying on is the data given to them by the federal government but, apparently because it does not spit out the responses that the government wants, it is always the wrong data. Of course, the truth is the government is giving the right data to the schools and they are modelling it and it is showing that hundreds and hundreds of schools will lose money under the new school funding model—300 schools alone in Queensland will lose money under the new school funding model if it goes ahead.


Only the coalition can promise that not one school can lose a dollar in real terms because the coalition has promised to deliver the current quantum of funds plus the current indexation called the AGSRC model of indexation. The coalition can promise every school principal and every parent in Australia that it is not mathematically possible for schools to go backwards under the coalition because we will provide the current quantum plus the AGSRC indexation. Yet this government is implementing a new school funding model and tries to pretend that it will deliver rivers of gold to school communities while it is cutting funding for the next four years by $325 million. That is putting aside higher education, early childhood, child care, apprenticeships and training. At the same time it is not keeping pace with the indexation that the coalition can promise so that only the coalition can promise that no school could be worse off after the election. This government has admitted that schools will lose money over the next four years. 


Each time I have asked the minister—and I will ask him again and maybe he will tell us in his summing-up to the second reading—how many funds will flow to schools in 2014 and 2015 and 2016, school by school, the minister fluffs the answer, obfuscates and comes up with all sorts of riddles, none of which answer the question that principals want to know. That is how much will they get in 2014, 2015 and 2016. I will give the minister the benefit of the doubt. I suspect the answer is that he does not know, and therein lies the problem. Under this school funding model, schools cannot plan for the next three years because not even the government knows how much money they will lose.


Another one of our concerns is the hidden hooks in this legislation. The hidden hook that causes me the greatest concern is schedule H to the national agreement that the government has made with the states that have signed up to it which refers to the use of the socioeconomic status data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to determine funds to non-government schools between now and 2016, but then in 2017 a new tool will be developed called an individual parental capacity to pay 


When I raised this issue, the minister publicly said what that meant was the aggregate parental capacity to pay in a school. But that is not what the agreement says. The agreement says 'an individual parental capacity to pay', so those states and territories that are signed up to this agreement have signed up to a means test on the parents of children in non-government schools.


We know Labor have a propensity towards means tests. They means-tested the pension under the Hawke government in 1984. They means-tested the private health insurance rebate. The parliamentary secretary would know this because he is a bit of a savant when it comes to dates and numbers. In 1986 they means-tested the pension against the wishes of the coalition. They then means-tested the private health insurance rebate, which we know is in their DNA to means-test. And so when I discovered that schedule H said 'an individual parental capacity to pay' and I raised it, everybody in the non-government sector realised what it was—that is, a means test. And that is where the government are going. If the government are re-elected, if this government form another government after 14 September—if this parliament lasts that long—then they will, as sure as night follows day, introduce a means test on the parents of children in non-government schools. And those people who are considering voting for the Labor Party at the election, who have children in non-government schools, cannot come back to the coalition in 2017 and say, 'Why didn't somebody warn us about this,' because I have warned about it again and again and again in this place and in the media.


One of the great failures of this new school funding model is that it does not actually address any of the transformational issues that will change student outcomes in Australia. And if the only purpose of government funding for government and non-government schools is to affect the outcomes of our students in schools, then why doesn't this bill pass that test? This bill does nothing to try to address the transformational measures that are required in our schools across Australia to bring about better outcomes for our Australian children who are of school age. I talk specifically about things like teacher quality, a robust curriculum, principal autonomy and parental engagement.


Anyone who has read up on the issue of school education will know that the Grattan Institute's report, and many other venerable public advocacy organisations and academic works, have turned themselves to the question of what are the important issues in schools that bring about the best results for our students. They are: principal autonomy, parental engagement, a strong and robust curriculum, and teacher quality. The first one of those must be teacher quality, and yet these bills before the House tonight, that follow the Australian Education Bill, do not address the fundamental issues. And the member for Griffith is right when he says that the government has not made the case for the link between new spending in 2018-19 and the impact that that will have on student outcomes.


We spend a great deal of money now on schools. In fact, we are spending 40 per cent more on schools today than we were—we have increased our spending on schools, I should say, by 40 per cent over the last 10 years, and in those 10 years our outcomes have declined. We spent 40 per cent more in the last 10 years on school education and in that time our outcomes have demonstrably declined—not just relatively with our Asian competitors and neighbours, but in real terms both our literacy and numeracy have declined. So if money was the answer to every problem, why is that so?


The answer is because this government has not addressed, and the state Labor governments—they have been mostly state Labor over the last 20 years—have not addressed, the fundamental issues of teacher quality, parental engagement, principal autonomy and a robust curriculum. Except in the last three years in Western Australia. The member for Stirling is here in the chamber tonight, and he would know that Western Australia is the only state in the entire federation that has introduced the most far-reaching principal autonomy in the country in government schools and it is the only jurisdiction since 1977 that is now seeing a drift from non-government to government schools because parents are looking at the independent public school model in Western Australia and saying, 'That is where we want our child to be educated.'


The No. 1 feature of government schools in Western Australia, independent public schools, that is different to every other state is that the principals have enormous autonomy in their schools. They are one-line budget items in the Western Australian budget—school name, amount of money; decisions are made by the principals and their leadership teams and their advisory councils. Now more than 50 per cent of all children in government schools in Western Australia are in independent public schools and the market is telling us in WA that the parents like principal autonomy. These bills do nothing to address the issues of principal autonomy and the flow-on effects to parental engagement, robust curriculum or higher teacher quality.


People are entitled to know what the coalition would do. If the coalition is fortunate to be elected on 14 September this year, we will immediately move, if there has been no national agreement—and national agreement means an overwhelming majority of states—to repeal agreements made between the Commonwealth and those states that have signed up, unless there is national agreement. We will introduce a one-page bill that will roll over the current funding model from the end of this year to the end of 2015, which gives us two years to sort out the chaos and mess that this minister and this Prime Minister have presided over in the new school funding model. That will give schools their current quantum of funds, plus indexation under the average government school resourcing standard, the AGSRC, and schools can, therefore, plan. They will get no less money—in fact, they will get the same amount in real terms because of indexation—for at least two years.


We will focus relentlessly on the four priorities that I have talked about tonight: principal autonomy, a robust curriculum, teacher quality and parental engagement. We will implement a new capital infrastructure fund for schools across Australia because we know that schools are growing and in new areas of large cities and in many regional and rural areas there is enormous need for new schools, for growing schools to get capital infrastructure and for some schools with dilapidated infrastructure to get continuing support for capital.


The so-called Building the Education Revolution, like so many of this government's policies, was just another flash in the pan—the money is gone; the money has been spent—and now the government is saying to schools: 'There's no more capital infrastructure for you. You've had your share.' The member for Riverina, the member for Stirling and I know that the needs of schools continue far beyond the so-called Building the Education Revolution so, when the budget allows because of good economic management—from a, hopefully, new government in September—we will implement a capital infrastructure fund that meets the needs of school communities across Australia.


I know I said I would speak only briefly and I have spoken instead for 25 minutes because there were so many important things to put on the record, but in conclusion one of the most important things in the Gonski report was their acceptance of the coalition's policy that the funding of children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be sector blind. Hitherto, if you were a student in a government school, you would be funded in some cases at 10 times the rate of the same child in a non-government school, for example, for disabilities. I believe that is wrong and I think most Australians do believe that is wrong. One of the good things about the Gonski report is that they accepted the coalition's policy from the last election that funding of children in non-government schools should be the same as funding of children in government schools, whether that is for children with a disability, for low-SES children, for children in remote and rural areas, for children in small schools or for children from non-English-speaking backgrounds.


We believe that no matter who wins the election in September they should implement a policy that is blind to the school sectors and that allows the funding to follow a student for disadvantage. That is what the Gonski report talked about in terms of loadings. How we will make that work is something that I think we will need two years to work out with the sector. Under the coalition, the national partnerships that have been redirected into this new funding model but short-changed on the way through will continue, the targeted programs that have been cut in this budget will continue and the current quantum will continue plus the AGSRC. We will look over the next two years at how to implement a loadings policy that is fair to everyone, where the funding follows the child with disadvantage and can be afforded by the Australian taxpayer. I am quite sure that is not beyond the wit of the new government—or, indeed, of this government, should we be unfortunate to have them re-elected.


With those few words, I point out that the coalition will not oppose this bill. Of course we cannot oppose a bill that has not yet even reached national agreement. We cannot support it and we cannot oppose it, so we will let it through and we will wait to see where the states land in terms of their support or not for a new school funding model.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (19:27):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. I endorse the remarks of the shadow education minister, the previous speaker, because, as he pointed out, the government's handling of this bill has been shambolic and chaotic. Indeed, it has been farcical the whole way through. Like everything else that this government does, it has been rushed in with indecent haste, as the shadow education minister pointed out, at five minutes to midnight. Barely a few days before the 43rd Parliament finishes, we are expected to come in here and absorb, firstly, 71 pages of amendments and, now, this consequential and transitional provisions bill. We will not have time to take it all in. It has been rushed in in typical Labor fashion. We all know that our children are extremely important. Health and education are two of the most important sectors which we deliberate on, which we try to make good public policy for and which deserve far more than what we are giving them by rushing this bill through this House and then through the Senate without the due diligence that this bill requires. 


We have gone from a situation where there was no detail contained in the Australian Education Bill to a situation where we now have the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth moving detailed and complex amendments to the bill that we, let alone the government members, have had no time to consider. We all know that the government members will blindly like sheep vote en masse because, if they do not, they will get ejected from their party for life. This is too important to not properly consider it. Our children are far too important to not give this bill due consideration.


The coalition have had very little opportunity—no chance—to consult with the schools in our electorates on how the new amendments might affect them. In saying that, it is important to note that many of these people are extremely concerned about what it is going to mean for them. I quote from a letter from the principal of the Mater Dei Catholic Primary School at Wagga Wagga, Danny Malone, who wrote to the Prime Minister on 4 June, because this is quite important and needs to be placed on the record:


In response to your recent email I, and the entire school community of Mater Dei Catholic Primary School Wagga Wagga, request further clarification. There are many facts and figures in your email and, indeed, being reported in the press. The National Plan for School Improvement adds additional information to be absorbed and worked through, but still does not provide any real clarification to four key areas which are of concern to Catholic schools Australia-wide. We seek your response to questions below:


(1) When will the final financial outcomes for each of the next six years of the rollout—2014-2019 inclusive—for each state and territory Catholic Education Commission and each non-systemically funded Catholic school be known?


(2) Would you explain your claim on Sunday 19th May that the average non-government school in New South Wales will lose $800,000 if the new funding model is not adopted?


(3) What guarantees do we Catholic schools have that the full funding for the model will ever actually be found or delivered by 2019?


(4) How can the government even predict funding for 2016 at this stage, given the 2015 review of indexation?


Mater Dei Catholic Primary School is part of the Wagga Wagga Catholic diocese which provides wide-ranging support to our systems of schools that, in turn, allows for the efficient use and equitable allocation of all funds and resources. The new model to fund schools individually would undermine our diocesan system which is already in place and working! Parents of Mater Dei Catholic Primary would like answers to their questions about how our school will be affected and what this new funding model will mean to staffing and resourcing for 2014 and beyond. Planning for 2014 cannot be waylaid until after the next federal election.


Sincerely,


Danny Malone, Principal


He is a good man, Mr Malone. He was a teacher or principal when my three children went through that particular school. But he, like so many other principals, is asking questions. He, like so many other principals—Catholic, independent, Christian and public school principals—has to put budgets in place. I know it is not important for those on the opposite side to put budgets in place. I know they do things very willy-nilly and with indecent haste. It is not their money they are spending—it is the taxpayers'. But the thing is, schools need to be able to budget. Schools need to be able to make sure that the money they have coming in is not going to be overtaken by the money they have to spend. Unlike the Labor government, they need to meet their budgets. Unlike the Labor government, they need to make sure that their key stakeholders—parents and, moreover, students—have a properly-run school system and a properly-run school budget so that they make ends meet. That is something that could well be a good lesson for those opposite.


Danny Malone is not alone in his questioning of the Prime Minister, the school education minister and, indeed, this government about these reforms. Last week I had New South Wales Teachers Federation representatives from Griffith, Richard Wiseman and Melina Ragusa, visit me and they were very much in favour of the Gonski review. I know that the New South Wales education minister, Adrian Piccoli, was the first to sign up. Certainly, there are things in the Australian Education Bill—in the Gonski reforms—which I agree with. I can actually see that, for the schools I represent, the initial Gonski bill as put forward by the Labor government had some things in it which would have been beneficial for the schools I represent. However, that was before Labor decided to plonk on us 71 pages of amendments. I was waiting in turn, as I am sure so many other of my colleagues were, to speak on the amendments and all of a sudden—bang! The member for Lyne, just behind me, said: 'I move that the motion be put.' So, effectively, we were gagged. He made out as if it was his idea: 'I will bring this on; let the amendments be put.' Of course, he supported this government from day one. In fact, he put this government in place, and so it was no surprise that the member for Lyne wanted the 71 pages of amendments put so that the bill could be rushed through, as indeed it was. He and the member for New England have a lot to answer for in that respect.


There are huge questions over this consequential and transitional provisions bill. Individual non-government schools do not know how the proposed funding arrangements will impact upon them financially. They are writing to the Prime Minister, as Mr Malone did. The government has still refused to hand over individual school information to the sector for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, despite repeated requests.


We have heard from the school education minister that there will be $325 million worth of cuts over the next four years. The rivers of gold—the so-called rivers of gold—will be in the Gonski reform process from years 5 and 6 of this whole reform package, but that means that is at least two, if not three, elections away. The Prime Minister, who is having enough difficulty at the moment, cannot guarantee that Labor will be there next election, let alone the one after that or the one after that, to ensure that these so-called rivers of gold are in place for schools in years 5 and 6 of this package. We know that the government is trying to pass this bill and has put a 30 June deadline in place. We also know that the majority of states and territories have not as yet signed up to it. Mr Piccoli signed up to it because he got what he thought was a good deal, and that any subsequent deals done would have no financial impact on New South Wales—if they were, indeed, better than my state's deal, which was signed up some weeks ago. But again we hear that word 'deal'. Really, this government should not be doing deals to force wedge issues between the federal coalition and its state coalition partners; or, indeed, between the New South Wales Liberal Premier Barry O'Farrell and the National Party state education minister Adrian Piccoli and the federal coalition. But that is unfortunately the way that politics 2013, with this current Labor government, works. It is always about wedge issues and playing the politics, rather than doing what is right for the people who matter most in this, and they are the children who are going to school.


I note with much concern that meetings are being held to explain Gonski and that there are meetings with key stakeholders about this legislation. I also note with concern that these meetings are not going to be held west of the Great Divide. That is of great concern, because country kids matter too—and certainly, country kids in my electorate matter a lot to me. The key stakeholders in this situation—that is, the principals, the Catholic diocese, directors of schools, the New South Wales Teachers Federation and others who at their very heart want what is best for the students who go to their schools—need to have the whole reform package and process explained to them. But unfortunately it has been symbolic and typical of this government not to care about regional Australia—and I would not call it just an oversight.


This bill appears to represent a dramatic new intervention in the running of state government schools by the Commonwealth. State schools were always called just that, state schools. Now, through creeping federalism and everything else, this government is trying to take over the running of these schools, just as this government has tried to take over a lot of things in health. This is causing quite a bit of alarm in the community. It makes the Commonwealth government a significant operator of government schools, or state schools. Does any Australian think that the Prime Minister and the school education minister are better able to run their child's school from Canberra than principals and teachers are able to run their schools on the ground? I think not. 


We heard from the shadow education minister about the four key planks of the coalition policy. The first of these planks is teacher quality—very important. The second is to have a robust, strong curriculum. The third is to have principal autonomy, what I have just referred to in saying that the principals on the ground are best placed to know their students' parents' demands, needs and expectations. The fourth strong plank of educational priorities for the coalition is parental engagement. Our kids deserve the very best—we all know that. We all know that our kids deserve this, but we need to be able to afford to give those kids the best. There is nothing that I have seen in my time in this place to show that this government is capable of managing its finances and, moreover, managing the nation's finances to ensure that the sorts of policies being put forward will be properly funded.


The government is proposing policy that is the complete opposite of increasing principal and school autonomy. It is an invasive new incursion into schooling, the exact opposite of what we need to do to lift student outcomes. I was concerned to see, in a recent round showing which schools were performing best under NAPLAN and other student outcomes, that featured in the top 50 was only one regional school, and that was a private school. That is alarming, to say the least. We need better outcomes for students—all students—and certainly for regional students who are put so far behind the eight ball when it comes to student outcomes from years kindergarten to 12. And, when regional students go to get a tertiary education—and I know the shadow minister for employment participation, child care and early childhood learning agrees with me—they are behind the eight ball when it comes to getting good vocational, TAFE and other tertiary education outcomes. This is not helped by this government not doing independent youth allowance for regional students in the Riverina, Farrer and lots of other regional electorates. This government has never shown, by any stretch of the imagination, that it is concerned in any way, shape or form with the outcomes for regional students, especially regional students trying to get a tertiary education.


This bill will not be opposed by the coalition, but we should have had more time to talk about it and to think about it. (Time expired.)

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (19:42):  I thank honourable members who have contributed to the debate. The Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill is consequential to the enactment of the proposed Australian Education Act 2013. The bill amends the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 and the Schools Assistance Act 2008 to enable Commonwealth recurrent and capital funding for all Australian schools, including funding for schools participating in the reform arrangements and government schools in states and territories choosing not to participate to be exclusively appropriated under the proposed Australian Education Act 2013 from 1 January 2014. The bill also contains transitional provisions relating to certain requirements under the proposed Australian Education Act 2013 in order to ensure a smooth transition and to reduce the administrative burden on schools and governments associated with moving to the new arrangements. 


This bill supports the government's historic national school education reform agenda which will enshrine in law a national approach to funding school education that ensures that schools are funded according to the needs of their students. The reform also importantly links school funding to key school reform directions embedded in the National Plan for School Improvement. These are real reforms that evidence shows will lead to better schools and better outcomes for our students. These are reforms that include investment in quality teaching, recognising the commitment, dedication and potential of every teacher by supporting them with better opportunities for development and career progression. The national plan will continue work already underway in this area by raising entry standards for teaching courses, annual performance assessments for all teachers and providing more support to teachers in their first years in the classroom.


The reforms will invest in quality learning, ensuring that all schools are supported to provide an engaging and responsive environment, one that recognises and takes advantage of changes in technology. It is something we have started through the national curriculum, the National Safe Schools Framework which addresses student behaviour in the classroom and in the playground, and the Digital Education Revolution.


The reforms include empowered school leadership: we recognise the importance of principal autonomy—principals in their schools making local decisions that meet the local needs of their school communities—and teachers in their classrooms being exemplars.


The bill will deliver transparency and accountability, and ensures that parents and the wider community know what governments and schools are doing with school funding: what we are achieving, what we are learning from reforms and how we are sharing what works. The bill will help meet student need. The link between student background and achievement is strong, and too many students from less-advantaged backgrounds are falling behind. We recognise this and we are seeking a shared commitment by all states and territories to support the provision of a high-quality schooling experience for all students.


Better, fairer funding based on the needs of schools and students, together with these National Plan for School Improvement reforms will ensure that all Australian students get the education they deserve; not one dictated to them by what school they go to, where they live or what their parents do for a living. Having the best education possible will help every Australian child to achieve their true potential. It will ensure that we as a nation have the skills and knowledge to compete internationally.


I want to address two issues that were raised by the member for Sturt in his speech to the chamber earlier this evening. At one point the member for Sturt suggested that the government had a secret plan for means testing. Let me be clear: there will be no means testing of parents who send their children to non-government schools under the new school funding plan. The government has always ruled this out, and nothing has changed.


It is important to recognise that the current funding system introduced by the Howard government already takes into account the capacity of a school community to contribute to the costs of education. It is the government's view that reflecting capacity to contribute is the fairest approach, and that is an approach that is supported across the education sector. What the Gonski review found was that the current method of assessing the capacity to pay is flawed, and does not provide an accurate picture. The review recommended that the government should:


… develop, trial and implement a better measure of the capacity of parents to contribute in consultation with the non-government sectors.


The non-government sector itself has also requested that a more accurate method be developed. That work is now underway and it is referred to in the National Education Reform Agreement.


Another suggestion that the shadow minister made was a claim around school funding indexation. The fact is that current Commonwealth indexation for school funding is 3.9 per cent, having fallen from 5.9 per cent last year due to state government reductions in school spending. The shadow minister is basing projections from a period in which many states and territories had Labor governments which were investing strongly in school spending. But with many Liberal-National party governments having taken over the reins, state government spending on schools has fallen and that has affected Commonwealth indexation for school funding.


Page 120 of budget paper No. 2 in the recent budget shows that should AGSRC fall to three per cent, schools would lose $16 billion over the six-year period. It is important, I think, for members of the House to be aware of the facts around indexation and the facts around means testing.


I commend the bill to the House. This bill is a small part, yet an essential part, of our vision for Australian schools and students and Australia's future in the global economy.


Question agreed to.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (18:23):  It is good to see people turning up to hear this important speech. Obviously, education is something I am particularly passionate about and this educational transition bill is a part of the process towards changing Australia's education future; a future that is complemented by many of the other activities by this government—No. 1, obviously by doubling the education budget, especially the big part of that being that both sides of the chamber have been involved in, with the Building the Education Revolution component. 


I have seen time and time again photographs of people from both sides of the chamber happy to acknowledge the contribution—albeit an economic program—to schools of the new facilities. I can go around Moreton and talk to school communities who were involved in decisions to bring in new school facilities; things like learning labs, new sets of classrooms, and school halls or performing arts halls. I have seen it at the Kuraby State School. I could list every single school in my electorate that has benefited from the BER program, but the doubling of the education budget is not only about an economic program; it is also about preparing Australia for a lift in educational standards. Sadly, we can look at state governments and we can look at national governments: the reality is educational standards have dropped in Australia in the last 20 years.


I finished teaching in 1997. It is sad to think that the students being educated now have educational standards, in some areas of disadvantage, that are two or three years below where they were 20 years ago. That is a shameful legacy for any government—irrespective of their political persuasion.


The Labor government saw that we needed to do more. As I said, the initial BER program was an economic program but then, look at the other reforms that we have brought in that I am very, very proud of when I talk to my teaching colleagues—I will be seeing a lot of them in a fortnight at a bit of a reunion. To be able to talk about a national curriculum—something that was too hard for this federation for 110 years, but now we have a national curriculum. When we look at improving teaching standards, when we look at reporting on the achievements of schools so that wherever you are in the country you can click on the web—if you are lucky enough to be connected to the web; obviously, when we roll out the National Broadband Network that will facilitate that because the NBN is not all about economic infrastructure; it is also about educational infrastructure—and as a parent or a student you can see how your school is performing by comparing like with like. Whether you are from a remote Western Australian school or a big inner-city school, you can make an assessment of where you are going. 


The Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 and the Australian Education Bill 2012 government amendments are all about that rollout of educational improvements in terms of making sure that our commitment to Australian schooling provides a high-quality and equitable education for all students. That is in the Labor Party's DNA.


The government's response to the recommendations of the independent Review of the Funding for Schooling, which found—as everyone who has been lobbied by a Gonski parent, a Gonski-concerned citizen, a Gonski grandparent or the neighbour of a Gonski activist knows by now—that the previous school funding arrangements, or the current school funding arrangements, are not meeting the educational needs of all Australian children, particularly disadvantaged students. In every school, whether it be independent, Catholic or state—that is why people go into education so that we give as much advantage to students as possible. The amendments implement the National Plan for School Improvement, including new needs based funding arrangements for government and non-government schools from 1 January 2014.


Let's have a look at that. I stand here as a student who attended a Catholic primary school and a state high school, who has a child at a Catholic primary school and who taught in state schools and Catholic schools. I have also had a lot to do with Christian schools and other independent schools. I have a fair degree of background in education and I know the journey that Australian governments have made over the years from looking at the arguments about who should fund non-government schools—we go back a long time. In terms of the parliament getting it right, effectively, this Australian education bill is the pinnacle. It achieves what we are trying to do by moving funds and resources towards disadvantage. 


The Commonwealth recurrent funding for schooling will now be delivered through fair and transparent needs based arrangements, providing new investment to support reforms that will help to improve each students' achievements at school. In the past we have seen the SES model, which was an idea that was flawed from the start by extracting the census collection district data from a parent then using that data to calculate whether the funds should flow to that school. We saw when the SES model was introduced that basically half the schools were funding maintained from the start. I understand that idea of making sure that schools do not lose a dollar, but when you have a system that effectively means half the schools are not in the system you know that you are not getting it right.


Under our new arrangements the participating schools will receive additional investment. Evidence based reforms will also be supported under the National Plan for School Improvement. We will look at the things that we know work—we have seen them work. You can go to the schools in my electorate that are national partnership schools. All we are effectively doing is rolling out that national partnership model on a national scale, to all 9,200 schools. Let us look at those things: quality teaching, quality learning, making sure the data that is produced is transparent and that there is accountability. We look at student needs and we also make sure that schools make decisions based on their community. Concerned parents working with professional educators and school staff are the best ones to make decisions for their environment, whether it be in Coolangatta or Cunnamulla or the cape.


Anywhere in Queensland, anywhere in Australia, local communities need to be involved and working with the educators. How will we do that? We will do it through a new schooling resource standard that will deliver a per student level of funding based on current funding levels for higher achieving efficient schools. So we will not be dealt that cruel blow that we saw in Queensland, where every single school had their funding cut under Campbell Newman. The reality there was every state school having their funding cut, combined with the Victorian and New South Wales cuts that I do not know as much about. Then, because the way they calculate funding allocations is based on how much goes towards a state government school, the funding cut to schools by Campbell and his Liberal cronies meant that every non-government school in Queensland received a consequential cut.


The funding cuts in Queensland were through things as simple as using a rounding-down capacity. Once upon a time you calculated the number of kids on day 8 of the school year, you came up with a number and if it worked out to be 23.8 teachers you got the resources associated with 23.8 teachers. But Campbell Newman, in a cruel blow at the start of this school year, rounded down so that instead of having 23.8 teachers you ended up with 23. If you are a big school you can perhaps accommodate a 0.8 reduction in staff. It has meant a lot of principals and members of the executive have gone back into the classroom, which is tough for them. Teaching colleagues of mine—people I have taught with in the past or that I know in my electorate—have had to go back into the classroom to plug this rounding-down gap. What we are doing now with the new schooling resource standard will abolish that because we will be able to give out funds according to the costs of helping a child overcome educational disadvantage, rather than using the reasonably arbitrary figures that have floated around in the evolution we have had over the last 40 or 50 years towards the correct funding model.


I see the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is here. I did not see him at Nyanda State High School or at Yeronga State School, where I would have loved to have seen him. I wish he had been allowed to come and visit me at those schools. The kids there would have loved to have seen him. I would have loved to have taken him to Nyanda State High School, the school that the Newman government has flagged to close down, the school that produced Billy Thorpe and Lobby Loyde. How can you have a school that produced two musicians like that yet they are now talking about closing it down? That is a school I would have loved to have taken the minister to.


We know that no school will lose out under this model. We have committed that no school will lose a dollar per student under these new arrangements. Each year, every school authority will receive at least the per student funding level it received the previous year, plus indexation to cover real increases in costs. I heard today a Liberal National Party member say that Queensland schools are going to miss out under our Gonski model. I know that is not the case. The Liberal National Party member was misleading the House, as far as I was concerned. For a start we have a Premier who cut funds to every school in Queensland—and I am sure we will hear about the cuts to Victoria and New South Wales—and then there are those consequences when it comes to calculating what non-government schools in Queensland receive.


I am very proud of this legislation. I am proud to have been associated with this reform process of getting it right. Every school, from the richest school in Queensland to the poorest school in Queensland, can unpack this model, see that it is transparent, see that it is fair and see where the resources will flow to disadvantage. As a Queenslander, coming from the most decentralised state and from a little country town where the high school opened when I was in grade 8 and there were 12 people in year 12, I can say that the education I received was the only thing that gave me a decent chance in life. I understand how much it costs to get it right in a decentralised state like Queensland, because the reality is we have a lot of small schools, of little one-teacher schools, and we are changing with a moving population as the shearing population decreases and other industries are on the rise. 


This Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill will usher in a new series of changes that I am particularly proud to be associated with. I particularly want to commend the education minister, Minister Garrett, who has been a regular visitor to my electorate on this topic. I thank him in particular for a storybook he donated to St Brendan's school. On the public record, I can pass on from the principal how much they appreciated that gesture. When he turned a certain age—I will leave it to him to inform the House how old——they appreciated him coming to the school, they sang 'Happy Birthday' to him and he responded by sending them a lovely storybook. I commend this legislation to the House and look forward to it rolling out throughout the nation.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (18:37):  This Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill will put in place a framework for the implementation of David Gonski's review of school funding. I wish to draw the attention of the House to one illuminating experience from the past year in my electorate of Tangney. The petitions committee of which I am a member made the historic trip to Perth in Western Australia. It made the trip to engage with students at Santa Maria College in Applecross. It was my opinion and that of all the members of the committee that the girls who gave evidence and opinion to the committee were rational and intelligent and inimitably the epitome of a good education. So if the girls of year 12 in Applecross were so good and so enlightening, what is so wrong with education? Why would any government try to endanger the quality of education at Santa Maria that Santa Maria can offer these girls and the many other girls of Applecross today and into the future? 


The situation this bill will initiate will be that many private schools in my electorate will have a future of uncertainty and relative disadvantage. Put simply, the message that this bill sends out is clear: we want to increase the average level of schooling but we want to do this by bringing down the tallest poppy by hitting over the head the brightest and best-performing independent schools. Let us not legislate tall poppyism into our future. Tall poppyism should have no future. Why do we act on this today? We act because we know that the empires of the futures are the empires of the mind. Good education reform is important. The Productivity Commission states that reform in this area could add 1.2 per cent gain to labour productivity and gains from human capital of four times other microeconomic reforms.


The coalition will not subscribe to any plan that will negatively impact on faith in our private schools. We know that choice is the key. That is what parents want and that is what they deserve—a better way forward. Focus should be put more on the quality of teachers, parental engagement and school autonomy, so the SES or socioeconomic status is the Liberal stance on funding of education. And it is working. Let us build on this, not tear it down. A better way forward for the education bill would be to use vouchers to address preprimary and primary funding and getting real with what business models illustrate and demand cost-benefit analysis of what capital employed would indicate.  


By moving to implement this bill, the Labor recipe for education has a bitter lemon aftertaste in scrapping tax refunds in favour of cash payments. Problematically, because of the fungibility issue, how is one to guarantee that the money has actually been spent on education? Also, if it is means tested as stated, then there are administration costs and so it becomes inefficient and less equitable.


Additionally troublesome are the amounts of cash bonus. Labor appear to have got the emphasis all mixed up. Large amounts of capital should be directed at the primary level as opposed to the secondary level. The plan outlined by Labor gives $820 to secondary school students and $410 to primary students. This is nonsense as the costs associated with primary are higher and also get a better return for investment in the long run than secondary. The sense of primary investment and early intervention are backed up by the work of Blauer, Posner and Becker, noted economists of long-standing and international distinction. They have literally written books on good education and economic policy. 


Investing early and often has many positive prosocial externalities. The spillovers are many and are compounded over time by a multiplication effect. Examples are in the area of crime and democratic participation et cetera. Per dollar return on investment is greatest at the earliest stages. You have an issue otherwise of diminishing utility. This is where mandatory preschool, as in WA from 2013, has a role. Finance could be found from ceasing to commit to overreductions in class size—and I repeat that 'overreductions in class size '. Reductions in class size do not pass the cost benefit of the capital-employed test and it is subject to unjustifiably high diminishing marginal utility. We must show a brave originality to break free of orthodoxy and heuristic reasoning. It is a message that is fed by the dominant teachers unions. While no-one can doubt the good work of teachers that the teachers of this nation do every single day, this is not about teachers. It is about the children. 


So how can Liberals get smart education policy that fits with the Asian century? PISA has found that it is not the volume of money spent but the way we spend it—vouchers. Liberals believe in empowering parents through the market mechanism, expanding freedom and incentive through a Friedman-style voucher system. Performing schools will then be rewarded and incentive created. This formed part of the Liberal 2010 manifesto. We see Labor recognise this in how the NDIS will operate. Vouchers in education must also be linked with reform in personal taxation such that an earned income tax credit would recognise the value of work over welfare. Cash incentives for grades work. Fryer, Sadoff and Levitt—prominent, pioneering and visionary economic policy leaders—have shown them to do so.


Let's not waste time talking about radical change; let's just do it. We need bold ideas to tackle the declining number of students undertaking secondary studies in the hard sciences and maths and the flow-on effects this is having on the Australian economy. At present, students in years 11 and 12 are dropping physics, chemistry and maths in favour of easier humanities subjects such as history and politics to boost their entrance scores. A lack of interest in physics, maths and chemistry sees fewer enrolments at university, and this has a knock-on effect on Australia's research and development capabilities. Fostering an appreciation for the fundamentals of science will prosper a culture of excellence and create a strong base to ensure long-term economic growth. I firmly believe science and maths should be core subjects for every student right up to year 12. But the government then took two steps back, dismantling the Australian Learning and Teaching Council, which was a vital cog driving research in universities. This is a major blow to our research and development capabilities and will have economic flow-on effects.


China has made the seemingly obvious connection between investment in the sciences and maths and the multiplier effect on GDP growth. It is now reaping economic and technological rewards. More than half of all Chinese students graduate in the hard sciences and engineering, compared with a world average of 27 per cent and only 17 per cent in the US—and it is even lower here. During the period 1993 to 2003, China's R&D expenditures grew faster than those of any other nation, pushing its share of world R&D investment from 3.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent. During the same period, the European Union's share declined from 28.5 per cent to 25 per cent. Australia's R&D expenditure as a proportion of GDP remains lower than the OECD average—shameful—although it has increased in recent years. This is a terrible indictment of a nation as prosperous as ours. Given our economic and social position, our R&D expenditure should track the upper end of OECD nations. We should be in a race for the top, not for the bottom. In January 2006, China initiated a 15-year medium-to-long-term plan for the development of science and technology. The nation aims to become an innovation-oriented society by 2020 and a world leader in science and technology by 2050. Under the plan, China wants to develop indigenous innovation capabilities and leapfrog into leading new industries by increasing R&D expenditures to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2020.


Australia needs to set ambitious goals and commit funding to the long term. This is our space race moment. We need teachers trained in these areas of expertise. Paying these teachers as professionals while acknowledging the need to pay them more than other teachers and giving these subjects more weight when it comes to university entrance exams are just two measures to encourage more students to study maths and science. I congratulate the University of Western Australia, which has begun to give greater weight to these subjects. Hopefully this will help address the slide against maths and science based subjects.


Teaching, learning and advancements in research and development are at the core of ensuring Australia has a prosperous economic future. But it all starts with the basics—science and maths being a central cog in our children's learning machine. This education bill has nothing to say on this. Given the positive link between education and the economic multiplier, we have to ask ourselves what kind of economy we, the coalition, are hoping to shape through educational advancement.


I have one question for the Gillard government. It is the one question I am asked every single day in my electorate of Tangney. Young and old alike ask me: if education reform is really so important to Labor, why are they not putting any money into the Gonski review's recommendations until—get this—2022? There is no money until 2022—nearly 10 years over three governments. What hubris. What trickery. And where is this money going to come from? What a shame.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (18:50):  With considerable pride and pleasure, I rise to speak to the bill before the House, the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. We have had some rather interesting contributions here this afternoon from my colleague the member for Moreton, who, like me, before entering parliament spent a period of time as a teacher. I spent considerably more time in the classroom, I think, than the member for Moreton. The member for Lingiari, who is sitting there as well, is another teacher. I have to say that being a teacher is a professional experience in my life of which I am incredibly proud. I am one of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who became members of that great profession because, once upon a time in this country—well over a century ago—a man with vision for the future of the country, Sir Henry Parkes, responded to an understanding that grew at that time around the world about the power of education to change lives, about the importance of it for society and about the challenge to liberate children, through education, to the possibilities of reaching their full potential.


Happily, we have had a very successful range of schools on offer for young Australians to become a part of; but the reality is that in the last 40 years, since the last major inquiry into the outcomes of schooling was undertaken through the Whitlam era, we have seen a degradation of funding of schools to a point that, when the Gonski review was undertaken recently, it was found that young people who had started school together 10 years ago—young Australians born into the same country—through their experience of going to different schools and born into different families, being far away from the city, being from an Indigenous family or being born with a language other than English spoken before they entered school, when they hit school were unable to get the type of resourcing and education opportunities they needed to build up the skills to enable them to be as successful at school as peers who were from non-Indigenous family backgrounds or living in the city.


Essentially, we have a system in Australia where there is a great inequity in the outcomes of schooling. We know that there is a basic amount of funding that each school student needs. We also know that we need to provide additional funding for those five critical areas in which we can transform people's learning. The reality is that we want a fair system. We want to make up the gap of a failure to invest over many years in this country and do it in a way that ensures a great future for every young Australian who shows up at the school gate in kindergarten, no matter which school they go to, no matter what state they live in and no matter what family background they may have. It is an indictment on our country that poor children are failing at school. We simply cannot allow that to continue.


This morning I was very pleased to make some points in the public place about my hope for the young children who were starting school in Victoria. I am pleased to say that in New South Wales the Premier of our state has seen the light with at least one policy area minister. He has signed up to the reforms that we are proposing here to give to our country an option for better schools and a chance for all of our young people to have a great education. Sadly, at this point in time kids south of the border in Victoria are looking at a leadership team in the conservative leader of that state and his Minister for Education, Martin Dixon, who are deliberately going out into the public place and claiming that some schools will be worse off under the plan that we are proposing. The reality is that every school in every sector will get increases in funding every single year.


The deliberate misrepresentation of the sorts of funding options that are available for every student in every school is really mischief-making in the extreme. It is one thing for people to make claims that might give them a short-term political advantage. That is always a dangerous path to take, in my view. I think the Australian people see through that and expect us to do better on both sides of the parliament. The reality is it is totally atrocious to play with the futures of children by declaring incorrect facts and making the parents of schoolchildren, teachers, school systems and the whole community think there is something wrong with investing an additional $4 billion in the education of their children. That is quite disgraceful.


I hope that as the week continues the Victorian education minister, Martin Dixon, will really take to heart his responsibility to ensure the young people of Victoria have the right and opportunity to see a future for their own education where they will receive the funding they need to be successful and the loadings we propose to add into the baseload of funding will provide the teachers with additional resources and the schools who need additional resources in the form of teachers and practical physical resources will get what they need to make sure it is possible for kids to learn.


I could best describe the reality through the experience of meeting a wonderful young woman in my electorate just over the weekend. She has a son who has struggled at school. He has been a part of the Reading Recovery program at his school. That is a renowned education program started by Marie Clay, and the outcomes for many children are absolutely life transforming. Kids who cannot read become readers. For her son, that program has not worked. He has now been withdrawn from that program; and, because there is no funding capacity for that school, there is now no special learning program for her son. This woman in particular understands why this is so vital. In her conversation with me she declared that she herself cannot read. She has survived her life and runs her own small business using her memory in an incredibly impressive way to manage the literacy demands of our community, but she more than anyone understands why her son needs the sort of program that this investment that we will put into schools—that this money that we will give to teachers and principals to do the right thing by kids—will pay for, but only under this Labor government.


Those opposite say the system is not broken. Those opposite say they do not need to put the money into schools. Those opposite say those children do not need those resources. The reality is that, while this debate is going on and many fine ideas can be put, every single parent who shows up with their kids at school every morning expects that they are going to be able to send them to school, whatever school they are at, and have adequate resources provided for teachers to do a great job.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (18:59):  I am pleased to speak and outline the coalition's stance on this transitional and consequential amendments bill to the Australian Education Bill 2013 that the House of Representatives passed in the last sitting week and which is now in the Senate. We do not oppose this bill, as we did not the Australian Education Bill, because it is a measure of the confusion of the government that they are now passing bills through the House of Representatives to implement new school funding plans before these plans have even been agreed to by state governments. We are in the extraordinary position where the House rises on 27 June, and the agreements with the states to implement a new school funding model can be agreed to anytime up to 30 June. So the House will rise on 27 June, and five out of eight jurisdictions—three have already signed up—could sign up between 27 June and 30 June, which would make the new school funding model work. But, equally, none of those five might sign up to the government's new school funding agreement. The House and the Senate will have passed a new school funding model bill, and the consequential and transitional amendments bill that goes with it, for a national school funding agreement that has no agreement and does not have national implications because it is not agreed to by an overwhelming majority of states. 


The government has got us into the ridiculous position where we are debating a bill to implement a new school funding model when not all of the states have agreed to a new school funding model. It is very different to the way that the government and the opposition handled the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which was handled in a bipartisan way. Therefore, the states and territories knew that they could sign up to the agreement for a National Disability Insurance Scheme and that it would be implemented by either a Labor government or a coalition government. In this case, on the other hand, it is very clear that there are some states that have very strong views opposing the introduction of this new school funding model—and I will go through some of those in a moment. 


The coalition has very serious concerns about this new school funding model. The first of those concerns is that it is all far too late. For this government to try and implement a new school funding model to begin on 1 January 2014, this debate needed to be held last year, in 2012. As I travel around Australia—and I have been the shadow minister for 4½ years—principals tell me that to implement a new school funding model takes about 12 to 18 months. This government has potentially given non-government and government schools less than six months to implement a new school funding model, assuming one is agreed to by all the states. It is far too late, at five minutes to midnight, for the Prime Minister and the minister for schools to try and implement a new school funding model in Australia which would normally take 12 to 18 months to do properly—and they have given themselves six months to do it.


If we were faced with a government with a record of achievement and competence, that we knew were capable of putting pink batts in the ceilings of people's homes, or building school halls that were not overpriced, or managing the live cattle exports trade—or any of the other examples I could give—then you might give them the benefit of the doubt. But we do not have that kind of government in Australia at the moment. We have a government that we know is manifestly incompetent. The prospect of them introducing an even more complicated model than the current model, that is less transparent and has had less time for consultation and negotiation with the states and the non-government sector—and the idea of them implementing that successfully—is a long way from the expectations of the opposition. For that reason, we have very serious concerns about this minister's capacity to implement any kind of new school funding model, let alone one that applies differently in different states to different sectors. Even within those sectors and within those states, depending on whether they have achieved the student resource standard or not, it applies different levels of indexation to those non-government and government schools in the same state. It is much more complicated and much less transparent than the previous model. 


It also provides a much greater concentration of power in the hands of the federal minister for education than has ever been precedented before in Australia. The Premier of Tasmania got this right on Friday when she said that Tasmania was very reluctant to sign up to a new school funding model because she did not want the opposition having that much power over Tasmanian state schools. Now, quite apart from the fact that it appears that the Premier of Tasmania has already given up on the prospect of the Gillard government being returned—which seems to be running up the white flag rather prematurely since we have 90 days or 89 days to go before the election—the Premier of Tasmania is correct inasmuch as this new funding model would give unprecedented power to the minister for schools at the federal level. The Premier of Tasmania is right: schools are run by state governments. They employ teachers, they own the infrastructure and they make the decisions in their schools. This new model, apart from creating another new bureaucracy called the Australian School Performance Institute—yet another institute and another bureaucracy in Canberra—also devolves enormous amounts of discretionary power to the federal minister for education to intervene in state government and non-government schools. 


This is one of the reasons why the National Catholic Education Commission is so concerned about signing up lock, stock and barrel to a new school funding model that allows the federal minister for education to determine whether they can vary from the school funding model that is proposed in this legislation. The Catholic system has always been run very independently. They cross-subsidise between their schools, and they do not want to have to go back, cap in hand, to the federal minister for education if they ever want to vary those arrangements. I can understand their reticence. I can also understand Western Australia's, Tasmania's, Victoria's, Queensland's and the Northern Territory's reticence at signing up to a model which allows the federal minister for education to determine the operations and management of schools in the state systems. Western Australia particularly has been doing very well in terms of its student outcomes since it shifted to a model that had greater autonomy for school principals; they call it Independent Public Schools in Western Australia.


Why should they allow the federal minister for education to ride in over the top of the state minister for education and say, 'We don't like the way you are managing your schools and, because we now have this new power under the National Plan for School Improvement, we can tell you exactly what we want you to do.' The coalition does not support that. The coalition believes in the devolution of power to the levels of government to whom it should be devolved and that state governments run state schools. State governments should be the primary decision makers in state schools.


I have talked before about how this new school funding model is a swindle. I will not delay the House at great length about that tonight other than to remind the House that the Gonski report into school funding called for $6½ billion each year in new school funding. Over the forward estimates, which is four years, you would expect that to be $26 billion. What does this new school funding model deliver? It delivers a cut to school funding of $325 million over the next four years. 


Those states and territories that have signed up to it—the ACT, New South Wales and South Australia—have signed up to a new school funding model that cuts school funding over the next four years by $325 million. Then you have to suspend everything you know about this Prime Minister and this government to believe that, miraculously, in 2018 and 2019 rivers of gold will flow to the school sector to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. That is $7.8 billion in year 5 and year 6.


It is like your boss saying, 'I am giving a big pay rise and you should go out and plan on that basis.' Out you go and you change your mortgage or you do whatever you like with credit cards or you buy a new car and then you get your pay packet and there has been a cut. You go back to your boss and you say, 'How come you promised me a pay rise? I have relied on that to make all sorts of decisions and there is actually a pay cut in my salary.' The boss says, 'No, no, you get a big pay rise. You just have to wait five or six years for it to happen.' 


No Australian would accept that from their boss and no state or territory government should accept that from the federal government. I might be cynical, but I do not believe that the Prime Minister will win the next three elections in a row and deliver rivers of gold in 2018 and 2019 to schools when she could not even keep a promise for six days not to introduce a carbon tax before the last election. This is not the Gonski report being implemented. This is a swindle being visited on schools. Principals and parents know it. Another one of our concerns is the confused data.




Dr Leigh:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas I ask the member for Sturt to withdraw his term which appeared unparliamentary to my ears.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! For the benefit of the House I ask the member for Sturt to withdraw.




Mr PYNE:
  I am not sure what term it was, Mr Deputy Speaker. I said 'truthful'—I do not believe the Prime Minister—or 'swindle'. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member will withdraw.




Mr PYNE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly never referred to anybody as a 'swindler', but I said this was a swindle.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member will withdraw unequivocally and get back on the bill.




Mr PYNE:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, if it suits the House to do so.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is good.




Mr PYNE:
  One of our other concerns is with the confused data that is associated with this new school funding model. Every time the government gives data to the states or to the non-government sector, and the non-government sector and states model that data to determine how many of their schools will be worse off, they then publish a list showing how many of their schools will lose money. The government says, 'You have got the wrong data. We will give you the right data. We do not know what data you are relying on but it is the wrong data.'


The only data the schools are relying on is the data given to them by the federal government but, apparently because it does not spit out the responses that the government wants, it is always the wrong data. Of course, the truth is the government is giving the right data to the schools and they are modelling it and it is showing that hundreds and hundreds of schools will lose money under the new school funding model—300 schools alone in Queensland will lose money under the new school funding model if it goes ahead.


Only the coalition can promise that not one school can lose a dollar in real terms because the coalition has promised to deliver the current quantum of funds plus the current indexation called the AGSRC model of indexation. The coalition can promise every school principal and every parent in Australia that it is not mathematically possible for schools to go backwards under the coalition because we will provide the current quantum plus the AGSRC indexation. Yet this government is implementing a new school funding model and tries to pretend that it will deliver rivers of gold to school communities while it is cutting funding for the next four years by $325 million. That is putting aside higher education, early childhood, child care, apprenticeships and training. At the same time it is not keeping pace with the indexation that the coalition can promise so that only the coalition can promise that no school could be worse off after the election. This government has admitted that schools will lose money over the next four years. 


Each time I have asked the minister—and I will ask him again and maybe he will tell us in his summing-up to the second reading—how many funds will flow to schools in 2014 and 2015 and 2016, school by school, the minister fluffs the answer, obfuscates and comes up with all sorts of riddles, none of which answer the question that principals want to know. That is how much will they get in 2014, 2015 and 2016. I will give the minister the benefit of the doubt. I suspect the answer is that he does not know, and therein lies the problem. Under this school funding model, schools cannot plan for the next three years because not even the government knows how much money they will lose.


Another one of our concerns is the hidden hooks in this legislation. The hidden hook that causes me the greatest concern is schedule H to the national agreement that the government has made with the states that have signed up to it which refers to the use of the socioeconomic status data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to determine funds to non-government schools between now and 2016, but then in 2017 a new tool will be developed called an individual parental capacity to pay 


When I raised this issue, the minister publicly said what that meant was the aggregate parental capacity to pay in a school. But that is not what the agreement says. The agreement says 'an individual parental capacity to pay', so those states and territories that are signed up to this agreement have signed up to a means test on the parents of children in non-government schools.


We know Labor have a propensity towards means tests. They means-tested the pension under the Hawke government in 1984. They means-tested the private health insurance rebate. The parliamentary secretary would know this because he is a bit of a savant when it comes to dates and numbers. In 1986 they means-tested the pension against the wishes of the coalition. They then means-tested the private health insurance rebate, which we know is in their DNA to means-test. And so when I discovered that schedule H said 'an individual parental capacity to pay' and I raised it, everybody in the non-government sector realised what it was—that is, a means test. And that is where the government are going. If the government are re-elected, if this government form another government after 14 September—if this parliament lasts that long—then they will, as sure as night follows day, introduce a means test on the parents of children in non-government schools. And those people who are considering voting for the Labor Party at the election, who have children in non-government schools, cannot come back to the coalition in 2017 and say, 'Why didn't somebody warn us about this,' because I have warned about it again and again and again in this place and in the media.


One of the great failures of this new school funding model is that it does not actually address any of the transformational issues that will change student outcomes in Australia. And if the only purpose of government funding for government and non-government schools is to affect the outcomes of our students in schools, then why doesn't this bill pass that test? This bill does nothing to try to address the transformational measures that are required in our schools across Australia to bring about better outcomes for our Australian children who are of school age. I talk specifically about things like teacher quality, a robust curriculum, principal autonomy and parental engagement.


Anyone who has read up on the issue of school education will know that the Grattan Institute's report, and many other venerable public advocacy organisations and academic works, have turned themselves to the question of what are the important issues in schools that bring about the best results for our students. They are: principal autonomy, parental engagement, a strong and robust curriculum, and teacher quality. The first one of those must be teacher quality, and yet these bills before the House tonight, that follow the Australian Education Bill, do not address the fundamental issues. And the member for Griffith is right when he says that the government has not made the case for the link between new spending in 2018-19 and the impact that that will have on student outcomes.


We spend a great deal of money now on schools. In fact, we are spending 40 per cent more on schools today than we were—we have increased our spending on schools, I should say, by 40 per cent over the last 10 years, and in those 10 years our outcomes have declined. We spent 40 per cent more in the last 10 years on school education and in that time our outcomes have demonstrably declined—not just relatively with our Asian competitors and neighbours, but in real terms both our literacy and numeracy have declined. So if money was the answer to every problem, why is that so?


The answer is because this government has not addressed, and the state Labor governments—they have been mostly state Labor over the last 20 years—have not addressed, the fundamental issues of teacher quality, parental engagement, principal autonomy and a robust curriculum. Except in the last three years in Western Australia. The member for Stirling is here in the chamber tonight, and he would know that Western Australia is the only state in the entire federation that has introduced the most far-reaching principal autonomy in the country in government schools and it is the only jurisdiction since 1977 that is now seeing a drift from non-government to government schools because parents are looking at the independent public school model in Western Australia and saying, 'That is where we want our child to be educated.'


The No. 1 feature of government schools in Western Australia, independent public schools, that is different to every other state is that the principals have enormous autonomy in their schools. They are one-line budget items in the Western Australian budget—school name, amount of money; decisions are made by the principals and their leadership teams and their advisory councils. Now more than 50 per cent of all children in government schools in Western Australia are in independent public schools and the market is telling us in WA that the parents like principal autonomy. These bills do nothing to address the issues of principal autonomy and the flow-on effects to parental engagement, robust curriculum or higher teacher quality.


People are entitled to know what the coalition would do. If the coalition is fortunate to be elected on 14 September this year, we will immediately move, if there has been no national agreement—and national agreement means an overwhelming majority of states—to repeal agreements made between the Commonwealth and those states that have signed up, unless there is national agreement. We will introduce a one-page bill that will roll over the current funding model from the end of this year to the end of 2015, which gives us two years to sort out the chaos and mess that this minister and this Prime Minister have presided over in the new school funding model. That will give schools their current quantum of funds, plus indexation under the average government school resourcing standard, the AGSRC, and schools can, therefore, plan. They will get no less money—in fact, they will get the same amount in real terms because of indexation—for at least two years.


We will focus relentlessly on the four priorities that I have talked about tonight: principal autonomy, a robust curriculum, teacher quality and parental engagement. We will implement a new capital infrastructure fund for schools across Australia because we know that schools are growing and in new areas of large cities and in many regional and rural areas there is enormous need for new schools, for growing schools to get capital infrastructure and for some schools with dilapidated infrastructure to get continuing support for capital.


The so-called Building the Education Revolution, like so many of this government's policies, was just another flash in the pan—the money is gone; the money has been spent—and now the government is saying to schools: 'There's no more capital infrastructure for you. You've had your share.' The member for Riverina, the member for Stirling and I know that the needs of schools continue far beyond the so-called Building the Education Revolution so, when the budget allows because of good economic management—from a, hopefully, new government in September—we will implement a capital infrastructure fund that meets the needs of school communities across Australia.


I know I said I would speak only briefly and I have spoken instead for 25 minutes because there were so many important things to put on the record, but in conclusion one of the most important things in the Gonski report was their acceptance of the coalition's policy that the funding of children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be sector blind. Hitherto, if you were a student in a government school, you would be funded in some cases at 10 times the rate of the same child in a non-government school, for example, for disabilities. I believe that is wrong and I think most Australians do believe that is wrong. One of the good things about the Gonski report is that they accepted the coalition's policy from the last election that funding of children in non-government schools should be the same as funding of children in government schools, whether that is for children with a disability, for low-SES children, for children in remote and rural areas, for children in small schools or for children from non-English-speaking backgrounds.


We believe that no matter who wins the election in September they should implement a policy that is blind to the school sectors and that allows the funding to follow a student for disadvantage. That is what the Gonski report talked about in terms of loadings. How we will make that work is something that I think we will need two years to work out with the sector. Under the coalition, the national partnerships that have been redirected into this new funding model but short-changed on the way through will continue, the targeted programs that have been cut in this budget will continue and the current quantum will continue plus the AGSRC. We will look over the next two years at how to implement a loadings policy that is fair to everyone, where the funding follows the child with disadvantage and can be afforded by the Australian taxpayer. I am quite sure that is not beyond the wit of the new government—or, indeed, of this government, should we be unfortunate to have them re-elected.


With those few words, I point out that the coalition will not oppose this bill. Of course we cannot oppose a bill that has not yet even reached national agreement. We cannot support it and we cannot oppose it, so we will let it through and we will wait to see where the states land in terms of their support or not for a new school funding model.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-17,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (19:27):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. I endorse the remarks of the shadow education minister, the previous speaker, because, as he pointed out, the government's handling of this bill has been shambolic and chaotic. Indeed, it has been farcical the whole way through. Like everything else that this government does, it has been rushed in with indecent haste, as the shadow education minister pointed out, at five minutes to midnight. Barely a few days before the 43rd Parliament finishes, we are expected to come in here and absorb, firstly, 71 pages of amendments and, now, this consequential and transitional provisions bill. We will not have time to take it all in. It has been rushed in in typical Labor fashion. We all know that our children are extremely important. Health and education are two of the most important sectors which we deliberate on, which we try to make good public policy for and which deserve far more than what we are giving them by rushing this bill through this House and then through the Senate without the due diligence that this bill requires. 


We have gone from a situation where there was no detail contained in the Australian Education Bill to a situation where we now have the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth moving detailed and complex amendments to the bill that we, let alone the government members, have had no time to consider. We all know that the government members will blindly like sheep vote en masse because, if they do not, they will get ejected from their party for life. This is too important to not properly consider it. Our children are far too important to not give this bill due consideration.


The coalition have had very little opportunity—no chance—to consult with the schools in our electorates on how the new amendments might affect them. In saying that, it is important to note that many of these people are extremely concerned about what it is going to mean for them. I quote from a letter from the principal of the Mater Dei Catholic Primary School at Wagga Wagga, Danny Malone, who wrote to the Prime Minister on 4 June, because this is quite important and needs to be placed on the record:


In response to your recent email I, and the entire school community of Mater Dei Catholic Primary School Wagga Wagga, request further clarification. There are many facts and figures in your email and, indeed, being reported in the press. The National Plan for School Improvement adds additional information to be absorbed and worked through, but still does not provide any real clarification to four key areas which are of concern to Catholic schools Australia-wide. We seek your response to questions below:


(1) When will the final financial outcomes for each of the next six years of the rollout—2014-2019 inclusive—for each state and territory Catholic Education Commission and each non-systemically funded Catholic school be known?


(2) Would you explain your claim on Sunday 19th May that the average non-government school in New South Wales will lose $800,000 if the new funding model is not adopted?


(3) What guarantees do we Catholic schools have that the full funding for the model will ever actually be found or delivered by 2019?


(4) How can the government even predict funding for 2016 at this stage, given the 2015 review of indexation?


Mater Dei Catholic Primary School is part of the Wagga Wagga Catholic diocese which provides wide-ranging support to our systems of schools that, in turn, allows for the efficient use and equitable allocation of all funds and resources. The new model to fund schools individually would undermine our diocesan system which is already in place and working! Parents of Mater Dei Catholic Primary would like answers to their questions about how our school will be affected and what this new funding model will mean to staffing and resourcing for 2014 and beyond. Planning for 2014 cannot be waylaid until after the next federal election.


Sincerely,


Danny Malone, Principal


He is a good man, Mr Malone. He was a teacher or principal when my three children went through that particular school. But he, like so many other principals, is asking questions. He, like so many other principals—Catholic, independent, Christian and public school principals—has to put budgets in place. I know it is not important for those on the opposite side to put budgets in place. I know they do things very willy-nilly and with indecent haste. It is not their money they are spending—it is the taxpayers'. But the thing is, schools need to be able to budget. Schools need to be able to make sure that the money they have coming in is not going to be overtaken by the money they have to spend. Unlike the Labor government, they need to meet their budgets. Unlike the Labor government, they need to make sure that their key stakeholders—parents and, moreover, students—have a properly-run school system and a properly-run school budget so that they make ends meet. That is something that could well be a good lesson for those opposite.


Danny Malone is not alone in his questioning of the Prime Minister, the school education minister and, indeed, this government about these reforms. Last week I had New South Wales Teachers Federation representatives from Griffith, Richard Wiseman and Melina Ragusa, visit me and they were very much in favour of the Gonski review. I know that the New South Wales education minister, Adrian Piccoli, was the first to sign up. Certainly, there are things in the Australian Education Bill—in the Gonski reforms—which I agree with. I can actually see that, for the schools I represent, the initial Gonski bill as put forward by the Labor government had some things in it which would have been beneficial for the schools I represent. However, that was before Labor decided to plonk on us 71 pages of amendments. I was waiting in turn, as I am sure so many other of my colleagues were, to speak on the amendments and all of a sudden—bang! The member for Lyne, just behind me, said: 'I move that the motion be put.' So, effectively, we were gagged. He made out as if it was his idea: 'I will bring this on; let the amendments be put.' Of course, he supported this government from day one. In fact, he put this government in place, and so it was no surprise that the member for Lyne wanted the 71 pages of amendments put so that the bill could be rushed through, as indeed it was. He and the member for New England have a lot to answer for in that respect.


There are huge questions over this consequential and transitional provisions bill. Individual non-government schools do not know how the proposed funding arrangements will impact upon them financially. They are writing to the Prime Minister, as Mr Malone did. The government has still refused to hand over individual school information to the sector for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, despite repeated requests.


We have heard from the school education minister that there will be $325 million worth of cuts over the next four years. The rivers of gold—the so-called rivers of gold—will be in the Gonski reform process from years 5 and 6 of this whole reform package, but that means that is at least two, if not three, elections away. The Prime Minister, who is having enough difficulty at the moment, cannot guarantee that Labor will be there next election, let alone the one after that or the one after that, to ensure that these so-called rivers of gold are in place for schools in years 5 and 6 of this package. We know that the government is trying to pass this bill and has put a 30 June deadline in place. We also know that the majority of states and territories have not as yet signed up to it. Mr Piccoli signed up to it because he got what he thought was a good deal, and that any subsequent deals done would have no financial impact on New South Wales—if they were, indeed, better than my state's deal, which was signed up some weeks ago. But again we hear that word 'deal'. Really, this government should not be doing deals to force wedge issues between the federal coalition and its state coalition partners; or, indeed, between the New South Wales Liberal Premier Barry O'Farrell and the National Party state education minister Adrian Piccoli and the federal coalition. But that is unfortunately the way that politics 2013, with this current Labor government, works. It is always about wedge issues and playing the politics, rather than doing what is right for the people who matter most in this, and they are the children who are going to school.


I note with much concern that meetings are being held to explain Gonski and that there are meetings with key stakeholders about this legislation. I also note with concern that these meetings are not going to be held west of the Great Divide. That is of great concern, because country kids matter too—and certainly, country kids in my electorate matter a lot to me. The key stakeholders in this situation—that is, the principals, the Catholic diocese, directors of schools, the New South Wales Teachers Federation and others who at their very heart want what is best for the students who go to their schools—need to have the whole reform package and process explained to them. But unfortunately it has been symbolic and typical of this government not to care about regional Australia—and I would not call it just an oversight.


This bill appears to represent a dramatic new intervention in the running of state government schools by the Commonwealth. State schools were always called just that, state schools. Now, through creeping federalism and everything else, this government is trying to take over the running of these schools, just as this government has tried to take over a lot of things in health. This is causing quite a bit of alarm in the community. It makes the Commonwealth government a significant operator of government schools, or state schools. Does any Australian think that the Prime Minister and the school education minister are better able to run their child's school from Canberra than principals and teachers are able to run their schools on the ground? I think not. 


We heard from the shadow education minister about the four key planks of the coalition policy. The first of these planks is teacher quality—very important. The second is to have a robust, strong curriculum. The third is to have principal autonomy, what I have just referred to in saying that the principals on the ground are best placed to know their students' parents' demands, needs and expectations. The fourth strong plank of educational priorities for the coalition is parental engagement. Our kids deserve the very best—we all know that. We all know that our kids deserve this, but we need to be able to afford to give those kids the best. There is nothing that I have seen in my time in this place to show that this government is capable of managing its finances and, moreover, managing the nation's finances to ensure that the sorts of policies being put forward will be properly funded.


The government is proposing policy that is the complete opposite of increasing principal and school autonomy. It is an invasive new incursion into schooling, the exact opposite of what we need to do to lift student outcomes. I was concerned to see, in a recent round showing which schools were performing best under NAPLAN and other student outcomes, that featured in the top 50 was only one regional school, and that was a private school. That is alarming, to say the least. We need better outcomes for students—all students—and certainly for regional students who are put so far behind the eight ball when it comes to student outcomes from years kindergarten to 12. And, when regional students go to get a tertiary education—and I know the shadow minister for employment participation, child care and early childhood learning agrees with me—they are behind the eight ball when it comes to getting good vocational, TAFE and other tertiary education outcomes. This is not helped by this government not doing independent youth allowance for regional students in the Riverina, Farrer and lots of other regional electorates. This government has never shown, by any stretch of the imagination, that it is concerned in any way, shape or form with the outcomes for regional students, especially regional students trying to get a tertiary education.


This bill will not be opposed by the coalition, but we should have had more time to talk about it and to think about it. (Time expired.)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (19:42):  I thank honourable members who have contributed to the debate. The Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill is consequential to the enactment of the proposed Australian Education Act 2013. The bill amends the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 and the Schools Assistance Act 2008 to enable Commonwealth recurrent and capital funding for all Australian schools, including funding for schools participating in the reform arrangements and government schools in states and territories choosing not to participate to be exclusively appropriated under the proposed Australian Education Act 2013 from 1 January 2014. The bill also contains transitional provisions relating to certain requirements under the proposed Australian Education Act 2013 in order to ensure a smooth transition and to reduce the administrative burden on schools and governments associated with moving to the new arrangements. 


This bill supports the government's historic national school education reform agenda which will enshrine in law a national approach to funding school education that ensures that schools are funded according to the needs of their students. The reform also importantly links school funding to key school reform directions embedded in the National Plan for School Improvement. These are real reforms that evidence shows will lead to better schools and better outcomes for our students. These are reforms that include investment in quality teaching, recognising the commitment, dedication and potential of every teacher by supporting them with better opportunities for development and career progression. The national plan will continue work already underway in this area by raising entry standards for teaching courses, annual performance assessments for all teachers and providing more support to teachers in their first years in the classroom.


The reforms will invest in quality learning, ensuring that all schools are supported to provide an engaging and responsive environment, one that recognises and takes advantage of changes in technology. It is something we have started through the national curriculum, the National Safe Schools Framework which addresses student behaviour in the classroom and in the playground, and the Digital Education Revolution.


The reforms include empowered school leadership: we recognise the importance of principal autonomy—principals in their schools making local decisions that meet the local needs of their school communities—and teachers in their classrooms being exemplars.


The bill will deliver transparency and accountability, and ensures that parents and the wider community know what governments and schools are doing with school funding: what we are achieving, what we are learning from reforms and how we are sharing what works. The bill will help meet student need. The link between student background and achievement is strong, and too many students from less-advantaged backgrounds are falling behind. We recognise this and we are seeking a shared commitment by all states and territories to support the provision of a high-quality schooling experience for all students.


Better, fairer funding based on the needs of schools and students, together with these National Plan for School Improvement reforms will ensure that all Australian students get the education they deserve; not one dictated to them by what school they go to, where they live or what their parents do for a living. Having the best education possible will help every Australian child to achieve their true potential. It will ensure that we as a nation have the skills and knowledge to compete internationally.


I want to address two issues that were raised by the member for Sturt in his speech to the chamber earlier this evening. At one point the member for Sturt suggested that the government had a secret plan for means testing. Let me be clear: there will be no means testing of parents who send their children to non-government schools under the new school funding plan. The government has always ruled this out, and nothing has changed.


It is important to recognise that the current funding system introduced by the Howard government already takes into account the capacity of a school community to contribute to the costs of education. It is the government's view that reflecting capacity to contribute is the fairest approach, and that is an approach that is supported across the education sector. What the Gonski review found was that the current method of assessing the capacity to pay is flawed, and does not provide an accurate picture. The review recommended that the government should:


… develop, trial and implement a better measure of the capacity of parents to contribute in consultation with the non-government sectors.


The non-government sector itself has also requested that a more accurate method be developed. That work is now underway and it is referred to in the National Education Reform Agreement.


Another suggestion that the shadow minister made was a claim around school funding indexation. The fact is that current Commonwealth indexation for school funding is 3.9 per cent, having fallen from 5.9 per cent last year due to state government reductions in school spending. The shadow minister is basing projections from a period in which many states and territories had Labor governments which were investing strongly in school spending. But with many Liberal-National party governments having taken over the reins, state government spending on schools has fallen and that has affected Commonwealth indexation for school funding.


Page 120 of budget paper No. 2 in the recent budget shows that should AGSRC fall to three per cent, schools would lose $16 billion over the six-year period. It is important, I think, for members of the House to be aware of the facts around indexation and the facts around means testing.


I commend the bill to the House. This bill is a small part, yet an essential part, of our vision for Australian schools and students and Australia's future in the global economy.


Question agreed to.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (20:00):  I rise to speak on this very important motion from the member for Dawson. According to the World Federation of Neurology, as this motion notes, dyslexia is 'manifested by difficulty in learning to read despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural opportunity'. This means that students with dyslexia learn differently from most students—the traditional methods of teaching, such as phonics, are not necessarily appropriate for what Dyslexia Australia calls the 'auditory learner'.


First and foremost, it is important that the difficulties that arise from dyslexia are recognised by all Australians so that we can reduce the stigma for these students. Dyslexia is not, as some believe, simply flipping letters around. It can in fact present itself in four main categories. Each type of dyslexia includes its own set of challenges. Despite the unwavering dedication and hard work of their parents, these students can all too often be left behind. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Carlie Rice, whom I met recently with Glenys Throssell, who are both mothers of children with dyslexia. Carlie set up Brisbane Dyslexics as a support group for parents of dyslexic children and those with similar learning difficulties. As Glenys said, having a child with dyslexia means:


… a roller-coaster ride of doctors appointments, interventions, changing schools, in getting a diagnosis, sourcing the appropriate intervention and support … Often it is a lonely journey as a parent with a child who has a learning disability.


Both Carlie and Glenys are working very hard at getting the important message out to the community—that there is support and guidance out there for parents.


In education, one of their primary concerns is with the National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy, NAPLAN. It is simply not designed to accommodate the learning and reading styles of children with a learning difficulty or disability. For all students undergoing NAPLAN it can be an incredibly stressful time of the year, but especially for students who face additional challenges. Some parents simply keep their children at home during NAPLAN testing. As Glenys said:


The reason being is that we don't set up our children for failure when they have no hope of succeeding. A NAPLAN goal when testing dyslexic students should be testing their abilities, not their disabilities.


These parents know that there are improvements that can be made within the current framework of NAPLAN. As this motion notes, for example, it would be beneficial for students with dyslexia to have their NAPLAN test read to them. Given their auditory learning style, I also note that some dyslexic students with writing and spelling challenges could benefit from a scribe. These suggestions are made not to make it 'easier' for students but, rather, to ensure that NAPLAN truly fulfils the stated goal of assessing whether students are receiving the 'critical foundation for their learning and for their productive and rewarding participation in the community'.


We must therefore recognise that the current one-size-fits-all approach to national testing does not demonstrate how well a child is progressing in a holistic sense. To that end, the Brisbane Independent School in my electorate is demonstrating the value of providing choice and diversity to parents. I recently attended their open day and spoke with many parents and teachers about the enormous benefits that they feel the school is providing for their children. They recognise that not all students learn the same, and they are producing results. Their community wants to work alongside the mainstream education system in Queensland to provide the best early intervention programs for all their students so that they can overcome their learning difficulties. As the Glenleighden School in my electorate has demonstrated for over 30 years, early intervention can produce amazing results for students with primary language disorder, and I am sure that BIS can do the same for their students.


I would also like to thank the member for Sturt who, in cooperation with SPELD South Australia, tabled a petition from more than 10,000 in the House on 5 June to recognise the educational difficulties of dyslexia. As the shadow minister for education he said:


… there is no shame in a learning disability; the only shame is if it is not recognised and treated.


We all want to see that children with a disability—whether it is dyslexia, primary language disorder or others—receive high-quality early intervention. It is absolutely crucial to the students and their parents that the education system recognises and supports their needs. I commend this motion to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (20:05):  Dyslexia is a neurologically based, specific learning disability that causes problems with learning to read and spell. I do not think there would be an MP in the House who has not been lobbied or met with people who have experienced dyslexia or are the parents of someone with dyslexia. I have encountered it as a teacher; I have encountered in my work both as a teacher and as a lawyer; and I have also encountered it in my family. It is widespread. Some experts suggest that up to 16 per cent of the population have dyslexia, although that statistic is disputed. Dyslexia is the most common cause of reading, writing and spelling difficulties and, associated with that, there are often some behavioural difficulties. I commend the member for Dawson for putting this motion before the chamber.


Dyslexia affects males and females almost equally, although I found as a teacher that the responses to it were more able to be seen in young boys because if they disengaged they could then be a problem student because of the problems they had with learning. It also affects people from different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds equally—it does not discriminate.


Last month I sat down for coffee in Graceville in my electorate with a group of passionate parents and advocates for children with dyslexia. Their individual stories were heart-wrenching. I had parents coming to Moreton from all over Brisbane, happy to find a support network and some people who might be able to help on both a personal and a professional level. I was privy to their heart-warming stories of battles they have overcome and support they hope will be provided for all kids struggling with dyslexia, not just their own. I would especially like to acknowledge the work of Carlie Rice with the Brisbane Dyslexics parents support group she has established. Carlie is a constituent of mine. 


Her support is growing and, if people are listening who are concerned about this or see this speech sent out to them, if you wish to find out more about Carlie Rice's group, please contact my office especially if you live locally in Brisbane and want to be put in touch with Carlie and her great work. Carlie's initiative is extremely positive in that it aims to increase awareness, to share information and support, and provide support, to parents, teachers and students—and I say that again, parents, teachers and students—on the issues associated with dyslexia. 


The Labor government is committed to delivering world-class education to every Australian student whether they have dyslexia or not, or whether they are on the spectrum. In our schools I say upfront that we already have great teachers working with students with a range of learning difficulties and what all of these teachers and their learning support people need is further support in these schools. The specific learning needs of students involve a wide range of abilities and learning styles, especially students with a disability and learning difficulties such as dyslexia. 


The National Plan for School Improvement could radically transform the educational outcomes for the Australian nation in recognising these needs and will work towards assisting the roles of teachers and the lives of the students who have dyslexia. It encourages the involvement of parents, families and carers by recognising the important influence they hold in a child's life. Recent announcements include $100 million in Commonwealth funding into the 2014 school year under the More Support for Students with Disabilities program. This is on top of the $200 million that the government is providing to support students with disability in both government and non-government schools, because as any educator knows, it is best to provide support early rather than wait until later when behavioural problems might be an indication that someone has got a learning disability. A disability loading will be introduced in 2015, which will provide support to students with disability based on the level of adjustment they need, and not just their simple diagnosis but unpacking the diagnosis delivered by a medical expert or an educational expert. 


Given the reform program in place, it would be a little pre-emptive to support this motion put forward by the member for Dawson. Students with dyslexia will be supported with the implementation of the Gonski recommendations through the National Plan for School Improvement and, obviously, as the member for Dawson is a Queensland MP, he of course would be lobbying Premier Newman and education minister John-Paul Langbroek to make sure that Queensland does not miss out on the significant billions of dollars of funds that could change the lives of students with dyslexia, and every student.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (20:10):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on this important motion. It is very much something that is in the background, that a lot of people do not have a great knowledge of but which is debilitating as a disability for so many people. I am actually aware of a state member of parliament in Western Australia who is dyslexic and, from what I hear, that person is probably not the only one in the country who is in a parliament and is also dyslexic. I can only imagine what it must be like to struggle with it. So much of what we do is about reading and communicating and it must really be difficult for a person to have to work through the bread and butter of our profession, of our calling here, and to struggle with a disability such as dyslexia. To his credit, he is a most remarkable and excellent representative of his area, and so I really do pay tribute to him.


Dyslexia is something that I have heard of. Unfortunately I do not think that I have ever been approached by someone from the electorate who has said, 'I am dyslexic,' and has given me a personal perspective. But at least through this other member of parliament in the WA state parliament I have come to have a bit of an appreciation of just how difficult it can be. When you see someone that has risen and has been successful despite that disability, it really does say something about the character of people who have to cope with it and work with it.


It is right that it is recognised as a disability. That is good. Sometimes we wonder what more can be done, and I think that it is important that the member for Dawson has properly highlighted this disability. We are used to hearing a lot about disabilities in this place. There are some severe disabilities, and we all certainly have contact with our constituents who have been dealt a difficult set of cards with their lives and who have managed to work with, or have to live with, that disability. Again, as I said before, dyslexia is not one of those that someone has specifically approached me to talk about, but through this state member of parliament I do appreciate what a difficult circumstance it really is for people.


It is important that when we look at NAPLAN and at those assessments for children that we remember that, whilst there is a lot to be said for national testing, there are certainly limitations with that national testing. With dyslexia there are some supports provided. As I understand, readers are provided for those with dyslexia under NAPLAN. But at the same time there are challenges with those results, and I wonder whether they are properly appreciated and considered when school tables are attributed to the results that have come out of NAPLAN.


Given the fact that dyslexia is much more common than we would normally think, it is important that we look at the opportunities to help with pre-service training for teachers so that there is a greater appreciation to help teachers identify that maybe this is the problem with young Johnny or young Sarah in the classroom—maybe it is just something that has not been detected yet. So it is a good thing for teachers, as they start teaching, to be able to appreciate and identify that this is a far too common problem and a challenge for so many children in our country and that it would really be better if they could be identified earlier on and given the proper support required. Again, I appreciate the member for Dawson bringing this important motion forward and having the opportunity to contribute tonight on a very important issue that undermines the learning of so many children.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (20:15):  I would like to congratulate the member for Dawson for bringing this motion to the House tonight. Whilst I do not agree with all aspects of it, I believe it is important to ensure that dyslexia is acknowledged as a significant learning disability and that significant resources are placed into assisting young people and children that have dyslexia. I have experienced it within my own family. I have two children who have been to university and were high achievers who could cope very well with anything that was put before them academically, but I have one child who had dyslexia. His life, the roads that he took and the opportunities that he has had in life were very different to the opportunities that my two children who did not have dyslexia had. He works in a manual area, but the problem is constantly having to convince those around you that you are able to do things, because in our society we rely so much upon being able to read the written word, and following instructions is so important.


Dyslexia is estimated to affect about 10 per cent of the Australian population. In Australia the terms 'dyslexia', 'specific learning disabilities', 'learning difficulties' and 'LD' are used interchangeably as umbrella terms for a variety of difficulties which may or may not be dyslexia. Dyslexia is, I think, best understood if you look at it from the point of view of persistent difficulty with learning to read and spell. I know from my own personal experience that people with dyslexia develop different regimes for dealing with life so that they can get around their inability to read. They develop different ways of learning. 


Dyslexia has been shown to be resistant to traditional teaching methods, and there have been a lot of individualised programs that have been adopted around teaching students with dyslexia. But students need different programs. There are different causes and types of dyslexia, and it is important that teachers know how to identify a student who has dyslexia and how to develop programs and teaching methods to assist that student.


The government has recognised that there is a need to provide support for students with learning difficulties and disabilities, and that is why $100 million in Commonwealth funding will be going into schools in the school year 2014. It is well and truly long overdue, because our schools need to have the money and the resources to be able to give those students that have specific learning needs the assistance that they need. At the moment there is limited knowledge of the number of students that actually need this support, and that needs to be collected. We need to get nationally consistent data, and once we get this data we need to put it together in a way that will then be useful to develop and deliver those programs.


I think that a number of the suggestions in the member for Dawson's motion have real merit and deserve investigation, because students who have dyslexia need extra support. I think that support while they are undergoing NAPLAN, in the classroom, with their homework and in a number of different environments is very important if they are going to achieve their optimal level of learning. So I congratulate the member for Dawson for bringing it to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-17,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:20):  'Our mission is not to teach someone but to allow them to learn.' This is the mission statement of Dyslexia Australia and adequately sums up the intention of this very worthwhile, good and meritorious motion which has been moved by my friend the member for Dawson, whose advocacy in this area is to be congratulated. He recognises through this motion that dyslexia is a learning disability and does not have a cure. 


According to a 2010 report given to the then Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Bill Shorten, between five and 10 per cent of Australians are diagnosed with a learning disability such as dyslexia. As such, I commend this motion. I commend the member for Dawson and the motion's intention that this parliament address the critical need for teachers to be better trained to allow students with dyslexia to learn and have improved outcomes.


When a person has dyslexia, words jumble. They move around. They swirl. The basic skills of reading and writing, which most people take for granted, are incredibly challenging for people with dyslexia. As more research becomes available about how students and people with dyslexia are impacted and what some strategies might be to deal with them, it is important that schools and governments adapt with that research to make this task easier. In order to achieve this, we must recognise what dyslexia is and, through the research, come to understand what profound impacts it might have on students and people who are diagnosed with it. While we will never fully appreciate the difficulty of reading and writing, solutions and recommendations through research can make this challenge easier. As the rates of dyslexia increase and our understanding of it also grows, as a society we can come to recognise what some of the symptoms of dyslexia are, which is the intention of the motion of the member for Dawson.


In addition to the difficulty of reading and writing, people with dyslexia often find hearing and speech challenging. They may also have difficulty with mathematics and time management. Added to this, people with dyslexia may find memory and cognition challenging and may also have behavioural difficulties. As such, it is critical that we as a society understand what the symptoms of dyslexia are so we can gain a greater insight into how best we can help people who are diagnosed with it. Obviously, schooling and education is where people with dyslexia first experience the challenges and difficulties of reading and writing. It is vital for the sake of the people this has an impact upon that teachers are better equipped, as Dyslexia Australia's mission attests, 'to allow them to learn'.


I refer here to the comments of the shadow minister for education. In his role as the shadow minister he firmly believes that there is no shame in having a learning disability. The only shame is if it is not recognised and treated to an individual's need. I would certainly agree with him, as I am sure all members of this House would agree with him. He is calling for the use of modified curricula and instruction in education, appropriate assistance technology and extra time for learning as students with disabilities go through school. It is crucial, he says, for children who suffer from a learning disability to receive the appropriate diagnosis, treatment and support in their school. He is currently working with the Specific Learning Difficulties Association in his state of South Australia to raise awareness of this by asking this parliament to formally recognise dyslexia as a disability and to provide funding to ensure the students with dyslexia receive high-quality intervention as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed. That, along with this particular motion, will really be a great enabler for young people with dyslexia. If they receive help early, it can improve their educational outcomes and, indeed, their job prospects considerably.


It is not to discredit the passion and dedication of our teachers to say that we need to help them learn and that schools need to play an even greater role in helping to improve outcomes of children with dyslexia. It takes a special kind of person to be a teacher. We know that these days our teachers are much more than just educators; they are counsellors, nurses, advisers and people who inspire the next generation of the nation. They give this country a great service. My daughter, Georgina, is a teacher at Griffith High School. I know of the profound impact that she and so many others have on students. I know that students with dyslexia certainly need every bit of help that they can receive. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (20:25):  Dyslexia is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as 'a disorder involving a difficulty in learning to read words; also to identify numerals and symbols.' I commend Dyslexia Australia, whose motto is 'Our mission—not to teach someone, but to allow them to learn…' There is no quick fix, no cure for dyslexia. Dyslexics can correct their reading when given correct teaching methods and through adoption of resilience in a multidisciplinary approach. In fact, this federal Labor government has made child and youth health initiatives a really high priority in terms of early intervention in areas like this with preventative approaches with interdisciplinary coordination across a number of agencies. We have also seen that with our commitment of $200 million into schools in relation to disability.


Kerry Packer was one of Australia's most famous and most successful dyslexics. As a child, his father called him a boofhead and would give him a hiding because, in his words, he was 'academically stupid'. The attitudes of Australians have come a long way since the days of Sir Frank Packer. We know that dyslexics can learn differently but they are certainly not academically stupid.


I think the member for Dawson has been somewhat good in his intention in bringing this motion. In fact, I had a close look at it and commend him for his obvious commitment to this particular issue.


Dyslexics really do have a challenge. I have met a number in my capacity as federal member. They have problems with memory, cognition, writing and motor skills. They often have problems with hearing. Speaking patterns are often different. Behaviour problems often emerge, and there are personality issues. But I must say that, in terms of assistance for people with dyslexia, I did note what the member for Moreton talked about in terms of schooling, education and, particularly, funding. The member for Dawson in his particular motion actually makes the point that there is a connection with education, schooling and funding. I say to the member for Dawson: although I do believe he has a good heart on this issue, he would be better off pouring his efforts into speaking with his LNP state colleagues about signing up for the National Plan for School Improvement.


The people of Dawson would need to know that the National Plan for School Improvement would provide local schools in the electorate of Dawson with an additional $150 million over the next four years. Perhaps he should let the people, parents, friends and students at Mackay North State High School know that they would receive over $15 million in additional funding under the Gonski scheme that Campbell Newman and the LNP state government in Queensland refused to sign up to. What a difference that may make to students at Mackay North State High School who have dyslexia or other learning difficulties—or Bloomsbury State School in the electorate of Dawson, which would receive an additional 62 per cent in funding under the National Plan for School Improvement. What a difference the hundreds of thousands of dollars would make to students with disabilities and challenging learning difficulties in that school.


The National Plan for School Improvement will change the way we fund students and schools with large numbers of people with disability. A disability loading will provide support for students with disability based on the level of adjustment. That would make a big difference in the lives of kids in my electorate of Blair and also in the electorate of Dawson. There would be more one-on-one attention, more modern equipment, better training for teachers and more understanding of dyslexia. But, regrettably, the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament and the Premier of Queensland stand in the way of that additional funding in electorates like Blair and Dawson. 


This government has done more to support children with learning disabilities than any other government previously. This government has implemented child and youth initiatives to ensure that conditions such as dyslexia are discovered early. We know that early intervention is so critical. The National Early Childhood Development Strategy, developed by COAG, seeks to ensure that all children up to eight years of age have the best start in life. Our goal in this parliament must be to ensure that our children are born healthy, grow up healthy and have the support in schools to make a difference in their lives. That is why the Healthy Kids Check ensures that. I commend the government for what they do and point out to the member— (Time expired)

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (20:30):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to speak without closing the debate.


Leave granted.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I have listened to the different speakers thus far on the debate. It has been quite interesting, and I am glad that there has been support from both sides of the chamber to look at dyslexia and what can be done for students with dyslexia in our educational systems. It is probably disappointing to hear the parliamentary secretary pull the issue into a political argument. The fact is that the Gonski reforms as the government is currently touting them do very little in relation to this area. 



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I have listened to the parliamentary secretary speak, and you might listen and actually learn something from what I am about to say. I have spoken with not only teachers but also people who work in the field of educational support for students with dyslexia. While they say that Gonski has the right language in terms of dyslexia and support for dyslexia, they see little actually coming out of that system that is not already present in the current system. What we need is not just more money thrown at education; we need a fundamental change in the way that our educational system actually treats students who have dyslexia. NAPLAN is obviously an invention of this government, but the fact is that the rules for NAPLAN do not allow for significant support for students with dyslexia. Gonski will not change that system. We will still have students sitting there who have dyslexia, who have reading, writing and comprehension problems, having to undertake this momentous test with the almost certain prospect of failure on that test—because of the nature of the test—hanging over their heads. There have been repeated submissions to government inquiries and Productivity Commission inquiries by teacher organisations and by parents which actually show that the impact that that testing has on children with dyslexia is harmful and detrimental to their wellbeing and their mental health. You cannot sit a kid through that test without appropriate support and expect that they are going to pass it. 


If you go on the National Assessment Plan website and you type in the word 'dyslexia' in the search box, not a single result turns up. Dyslexia is almost not considered when it comes to NAPLAN. In fact, if you go and have a look through the examples that are listed in terms of what extra support is given for students with disability on the NAPLAN website, there is no example of dyslexia, despite it being such a widespread condition in the student community. NAPLAN rules do allow for scribes or support people to assist some students with disabilities, but students with dyslexia are, I would believe, in the main not covered by these sections. The scribes are there for people who have a problem with the physical act of writing. They are not there for students, in the main, who just have a learning disability such as dyslexia. A support person can be there for a student with disabilities, but, again, that support person has to be there in the classroom all the time to actually be there for a person sitting the NAPLAN test. Most students with dyslexia do not have a support person sitting in the classroom with them all day. So, again, that does not help. We have these students taking these written tests where they have to comprehend the words that are on it, where they have to actually write their responses, and these are the fundamental things that they cannot do. There needs to be a change in that.


We also need a change, as I said before, with preservice training for teachers. We do not have it when every other advanced country has it, and Gonski, again, will not deliver that. The government has talked about this $200 million package that is being rolled out to schools for students with disabilities, but if you have a look at the peak bodies for dyslexia, one of the problems they are saying with that is that it does not cover students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. That money will not be going to assist students with dyslexia. It is the fundamental thing that we need assistance with in our education system so that we do not have children being left behind. The government needs to really look at the report that was done and presented to the former parliamentary secretary in this area and actually get on with adopting those recommendations.


Debate adjourned.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (21:28):  In the early hours of 21 June 2010 a US Black Hawk helicopter was flying low and fast to avoid enemy detection in the forbidding mountains of Kandahar Province in Afghanistan. In the pitch-black surroundings there was no room for error, and when the helicopter crashed it took the lives of three Australian commandos and a member of the American flight crew. Commandos Ben Chuck, Tim Aplin and Scott Palmer had returned safely many times from these highly dangerous sorties but unfortunately not this time. Their deaths devastated so many people: family members, friends, colleagues and fellow Australians.


On 1 July 2010 more than 1,000 people journeyed from all corners of Australia to the shores of Lake Tinaroo in Far North Queensland to pay their last respects to Private Benjamin Chuck. They came not only to honour their courageous service man but also to salute the memory of those who continue to stand side-by-side in the defence of freedom and basic human rights. On that day, an idea was born. It was a bold concept; a national memorial to honour the men and women who served, and to commemorate all Australian soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the fight against terror in Afghanistan.


Tonight I am very pleased to report that on Saturday, 22 June, the Avenue of Honour at Lake Tinaroo will be officially opened. Stretching for 300 metres, the avenue is flanked by two rows of Illawarra flame trees. Each Remembrance Day their spectacular red blooms will represent the circle of life. A sculptured memorial depicts the contribution made by the Australian Army, the Special Forces Commando Regiment and the SASR, Navy personnel, the Royal Australian Air Force and the unsung explosives detection dogs. One hundred and thirty kilograms of rocks, flown in from Afghanistan, form the base of sculpture and the honour board lists the names of the 39 fallen.


This Saturday several thousand people will congregate for the official opening by General David Hurley, the Chief of the Defence Force. Those on both sides of politics will attend, along with representatives from Lavarack Barracks—I see my colleague the member for Herbert, whose electorate includes the barracks, is here—and the Second Commando Regiment. It is going to be an incredible event. I want to acknowledge that, to get it to this point, the commitment and efforts of numerous individuals and organisations have been crucial. They include, but are not limited to: Ben's parents, Susan and Gordon Chuck, who have been inspiring in their strength and vision throughout this whole project, and the Yungaburra Business Association and Avenue of Honour Committee, who have been instrumental in driving the community and business support.


Another individual I would like to mention is Howie Thomas for his tireless efforts in coordinating various elements of the project, including the campaign website and design. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Howie's daughter, Tahali, here tonight. Tahali is the only girl this year from Far North Queensland to get into the Australian Defence Force Academy and it is nice to see her here. I also acknowledge the Tablelands Regional Council for designating the land, providing funding and offering in-kind help with site preparation; the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Queensland state government for major funding contributions; regional and national RSLs for their fantastic donations; the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, and Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Angus Houston, former Chief of the Defence Force, both of whom have shown strong support; and many others who have donated money, expertise, material and time for the project.


However, the job is not quite finished. In order for the memorial to be properly maintained in years to come we need to have momentum to keep going with a legacy fund. I was honoured to kick-start this final appeal with a personal donation of $5,000 and tonight I am strongly urging all those in this place to play their part as well. I have been provided with 150 limited edition Avenue of Honour commemorative pins and I would like to offer one to each member and senator who contributes $100 or more to this wonderful initiative. It will be on a first-in first-served basis. If we can raise $15,000 for the legacy fund that will be something to be proud of. These pins are available in my office. (Time expired)

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (10:30):  Last week an email from a mysterious, dare I say, faceless entity known as the Labor Party caucus communications team instructed every Labor MP to stand outside a school gate to spruik the government's schools funding plan to parents.


Presumably, the entity was acting on orders from above. And so, on Friday, I decided to heed the directive of the Prime Minister and join the so called 'national school gates blitz' at a school in my community—Woodford State School. However, there was one pivotal difference. For mine, this was an opportunity to acquaint Woodford State School parents with the facts.


Established in 1882, Woodford State School caters to 400 students from prep to Year 10. It provides a proud, wonderfully committed public education to a semi-rural community and has a vision to expand up to Year 12. But there is no place on any honour roll for Woodford State School under this federal Labor government. Instead, it has been relegated to a list of shame as one of 160 Queensland schools that will go backwards under the government's school funding plan.



Mr Perrett interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Moreton.




WYATT ROY:
  The federal budget shows that, over the forward estimates, school funding will not be increased but will be slashed by $325 million. Schools will be waiting until 2019 for Labor's promised rivers of gold to start flowing. That is six years and three elections away. And from 2019, the Queensland government has confirmed that 160 schools, including Woodford State School, will end up worse off anyway.


Regional communities face enough resourcing challenges as it is. But in a rush of bureaucratic penmanship, this Labor government has chosen to assign nothing but disadvantage to Woodford's children. The lack of rationale really is mind boggling. The government cuts funding to universities in a desperate bid to bail out its schools funding program. But how can the desired aim of better educational outcomes for our children, who are lagging internationally, possibly be achieved in the face of a corresponding under-investment in the tertiary training of classroom teachers?


And in the weekend's press we learned the funding proposal is yet another hand grenade into the Labor Party leadership chaos. We read that the Rudd camp believes the Gonski school agenda is a saga of policy mismanagement where funds are pledged without prospects of better results.


The coalition parties are the only political force with a funding model for schools that will leave none worse off. The coalition's preferred plan is one that will deliver certainty by maintaining current schools funding and indexation.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (11:01):  This is a motion about a crisis in an industry which should be leading the next manufacturing revolution. We are aware that, just as the mining booms in the 1800s faded into history, so too inevitably will the dependency on minerals extraction in the 21st century. The food-processing industry is, however, a job-creating, wealth-generating enterprise that should be sustainable in perpetuity. This motion is highlighting the struggles of fruit growers in the Goulburn and Murray valleys as they and their manufacturers, SPC Ardmona, face unfair and destructive competition from imported fruit snapped up at bargain prices by the supermarkets which have the stranglehold on Australian food retailing. This unfair competition is compounded by domestic policy failures.


Coles and Woolworths should have the finest Australian processed fruit and vegetables on their shelves. They should be proud of their offerings, and they should be trumpeting the source of their ingredients on labels which stand out large and proud on every shelf and in every freezer. Instead they boast that they aim to have some 80 per cent of their offerings in home brands on their shelves as soon as they can. The dirt-cheap imports from China, South Africa and Italy—with some products directed through New Zealand—give them contents at sometimes half the price of Australian fruits and vegetables, while our shonky labelling laws hoodwink and bamboozle the shopper, who has to guess at proportions of local product in the can or bottle when the label reads, 'Made from local and important ingredients.'


Home brands full of imported product—some dumped and all of it inadequately screened for food safety—mean even greater profits for the big two supermarkets. Coles reported a 16.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profit since 2007-08 amounting to  $1.356 billion in 2011-12. Woolworths in the same period reported an increase in profits of over $2.18 billion, up 3.6 per cent in sales, with a forecast profit even higher for 2012-13. Their sales rose by 4.8 per cent. Meanwhile, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports:


It was a mixed year for fruit production in 2011-12. Nationally … The number of bearing trees for citrus fruit fell by 9% to 6.8 million for oranges, and 20% to 1.5 million for mandarins. This decline was due to growers reducing their tree numbers or exiting the industry as a result of low domestic prices and an influx of imported fruit.


It goes on:


Nationally, production was down for a number of key vegetable crops as a result of depressed prices and/or poor seasonal conditions.


I think Coles and Woolworths need to hang their heads in shame.


The value of horticulture in the Goulburn and Murray valleys has been calculated to be some $2 billion annually at the farm gate, where the value-adding and employment multiplier effects begin. The fruit-processing industry in northern Victoria alone employs some thousands of workers, who range from growers to pickers, pruners, packers and those involved in transportation and storage of fruit, its packaging manufacturing, its cool storing, and pest management and control. Then there are the 870 full-time equivalent who work directly in the three SPC Ardmona factories at Shepparton, Mooroopna and Kyabram. Together, this huge workforce has processed on average over 150,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables annually for this old company, SPCA, an Australian company which is now owned by Coca-Cola Amatil. It is not hard to understand that the regional city of Shepparton, the larger towns of Kyabram and Cobram, and dozens of other smaller surrounding neighbourhoods depend on the wealth generated by the world-class fruit growing that was established nearly 100 years ago in northern Victoria.


Fruit growing is a long-term business. Unlike croppers, orchardists make investments that take years to deliver return. They cannot pass higher costs on to the manufacturers or consumers. Orchardists growing processed variety fruits cannot switch their crop onto the fresh fruit markets without driving those prices below the cost of production, and that is something we saw last year. Orchardists have no choice but to meet the extremes of each season head-on, whether it is drought, hail, floods, high winds or tornadoes. Crop insurance is often prohibitive. They control pests and diseases with world's best practice regimes, which makes our fruit some of the healthiest, safest and finest eating in the world. But this pest control, whether it is biodynamic, organic or through some other means, does not come cheap.


In normal circumstances our orchards must and do react continuously to incremental changes in their circumstances and they manage their risk accordingly. However, the changes that processing fruit growers are currently experiencing—due to the high dollar; the flood of dirt-cheap imports, many of them dumped and snapped up by the duopoly of Coles and Woolworths, who have been joined by Aldi; and the exorbitantly rising costs of production that they cannot pass on—all amount to precipitous, sudden and unpredicted catastrophe, none of it of the orchards' own making and none of it the fault of the huge workforce which then takes that fruit, adds value to it and gives Australia some of the finest eating product in the world.


SPC Ardmona, now owned by Coca-Cola Amatil, once exported 30 per cent of their produce. Next year they expect to export none at all. They have just told their growers in the Goulburn and Murray valleys that they will take no fruit at all from half them next year, or only half of the processed varieties they were contracted to collect. That is some 25,000 tonnes less of pears and peaches. That is an extraordinary volume, and it has been calculated that if you took that volume of fruit and spread it across the MCG, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, it would go to several metres in depth.


There is an enormous job loss already in these orchards as they receive this shocking news of the contracts being cancelled for next year. Already the permanent workforce has been reduced by some 46 per cent according to the data that has been collected from growers in a very recent survey. The annual ongoing total job loss, including casual and seasonal work, in the peach and pear orchards is estimated to be more than 1,500 workers. If this were a car industry, we would be killed in the rush of politicians wanting to have their photos taken beside men in hard hats with declarations of millions of dollars of support. There would be breast-beating about how shocking it is that Ford, Holden or maybe some other brand of Australian-made car needs support, how wonderful that vehicle is, and how Australia needs that motor vehicle industry because of its value adding, its employment and its icon status. Here we have a superb industry with magnificent product on its knees due to circumstances beyond its control.


SPC Ardmona executives are aiming to present an antidumping action request to the federal government. They want to challenge the legality of the fruit that is coming from South Africa and China and also the tomatoes from Italy. They want an antidumping action which will make it fair and put duties on those imported products to even up the playing field so that Aldi, Coles and Woolworths think twice before they bring in the vast tonnages of imported product, often now at half the price. We are also begging for a safeguard action. This is another lawful WTO measure which is used by many other nations and gives a response to a sudden, immediate, unprecipitated disaster which knocks out a local industry. If ever you want to see a disaster that was rapid in its onset and catastrophic, you need look no further than at the disaster that has befallen the processed fruit industry of Australia.


We are now facing down a situation where there are thousands of people to be unemployed. Already, pruners who should be hard at work in the Goulburn and Murray Valleys are being turned away. Instead, people are turning on the bulldozers. If we do not have, in the very immediate short term, some $3,500 per hectare to bud over or remove the trees that no longer have any market for the fruit once taken to the factories, then the biosecurity disaster in terms of diseases in these unsprayed trees will be a catastrophe. None of us should take this lightly. 


We have a four-month window of opportunity to shut down the blossom production of these trees or to bud them over to new varieties. If we cannot sell the fruit and there is no support, these trees must be bulldozed. We need the funds for that emergency right now. I beg the state government to work with the federal government to deliver that support. 


We also need a comprehensive package just like the motor industry has been delivered which will give our growers an alternative way to make their living growing different varieties. These factories processing fruit need technology support so they too can better compete into the future. I commend this motion to the House. It is a crisis situation not of the people's doing.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (11:11):  I thank the honourable member for Murray. I know she is passionate about this subject and it is very close to her heart. It gives me an opportunity to speak about horticulture and also the vegetable industry. An industry in horticulture, which is growing and expanding in my area of the world, is cherries, raspberries and strawberries that are being grown in conjunction with growers in Queensland so that the seasons can be covered the year round. 


Both the small fruits and the vegetables are iconic foods in Tasmania. We have always had a very big vegetable industry, and that is expanding somewhat with our new irrigation schemes and growing out. But of course, having a business model, having ways of marketing and making sure we can continue to expand, are some of the challenges. We must hang on to all these opportunities and find ways that we can feed them into the markets. 


There are problems and there are barriers. Perhaps the most pressing of these are the proper labelling of product, and I notice in Tasmania that some legislation is being proposed to put simpler food explanation labels on products. That gives a larger and simpler explanation of the nutrition content and it would only take another small box to say it was grown and processed in Tasmania, in Australia, or half the label could say that these are peas from Tasmania. Somehow that seems to be a rather difficult thing to achieve. 


At the moment, labels on tins tend to not state where the products were sourced, only what processing has taken place in Australia. I have often checked tins of fruit and vegetables that proudly boast of being an Australian product and then read the small print to find that it is a blend or that it is grown overseas and canned in Australia. There is always the reserve of using an Australian product but we reserve the right to source anywhere in the world.  Of course that comes down to the business models that the retail sector of Australia uses, and the retail sector's business model is to put a product on their shelves sourced from anywhere in the world. If the price is right, they will shelve it. 


Australian products with a simple, local label that says that this is an Australian product seem to be opposed at any cost. They seem to want to oppose that, and we see through their organisations they seem to do that all the time. As I said, it does not seem to be possible for Tasmanian peas to be labelled 'Tasmanian peas: product of Australia'. Saying, 'This is a Tasmanian product,' does not seem to take up half the packet of peas. We have a reputation for growing really good product. We have been growing peas in Tasmania for a long, long time. So you get to be very cynical about what some people's business models are and how they impose those on the consumers and the producers. I see that they are now opposing health labelling reforms as well, because it does not fit into their business models. There will be all sorts of reasons found, but none of them will be for a healthier nation, and that is a very sad process.


While I agree with a number of aspects of this motion, I certainly do not think that we should get into these arguments that manufacturing should not be supported and that we can only do something about agriculture if we stop supporting manufacturing. We can have manufacturing and agriculture, and we need both of them in our nation. So I do not think that we should set up these false arguments and run those things; I do not think it serves our nation very well. We do need a good, thriving agriculture sector and horticulture sector. So there are a number of aspects of this motion that I do not support.


Certainly the increased costs of doing business affect the survival of these industries, but it is more the lack of accurate labelling and proper descriptive labelling that can allow products to be dumped in Australia. That is a true thing, and we need to explore that. I would agree with an immediate and comprehensive antidumping investigation in respect of all fruits and vegetables and also fish and fish products coming into the country. I believe that there is a strong chance that many of these products are being dumped because of the ability to wander through our labelling laws and through some of the other arrangements we may have with some of the connections in food labelling and food standards. We need to focus on those things.


I have been extremely keen to see that fresh food is not subject to travelling over long distances. I do not think people will want that in the future, and I have some sympathy with the Slow Food movement, being a bit of a foodie myself. Slow Food opposes the standardisation of taste and culture and the unrestrained power of the food industry multinationals and industrial agriculture. The association believes in the recognition of strong connections between plate, planet, people and culture. Slow Food's approach to agriculture, food production and preparation is based on the concept of food quality defined by three interconnecting principles: a good, fresh and wholesome seasonal diet that satisfies the senses and is part of our local culture; clean food production and consumption that does not harm the environment, animal welfare or our own health; and fair, assessable prices for consumers and fair conditions and pay for small-scale producers. I do not think anybody could argue with that. While some of this can be seen as a bit trendy and a bit far-fetched, the principles of keeping one's food fresh and typical to a region and preventing it being moved over large distances may well be something that Australia needs to consider.


I also think that somebody's label from an actual, local region should not be manipulated when a company may be sold or broken up and that label is then taken and the product is made in some other area but they still put the label on it. You can just imagine if we made King Island cheese in Victoria. I do not think that would be a good idea, but I also do not think that it would be a recognition of what made that cheese originally. It is a great product. I have always had some feelings that these things need to be given some more consideration and we should give consideration to protecting a region's viability by protecting its labelling.


We can grow fantastic food, both animal and vegetable, in Australia, but, unless it is processed quickly and cleanly, a lot of food's value can be lost. So there is a lot of opportunity here, I believe, for us to think a bit differently from how we have in the past, and we can make some major gains. Hence my objection to live animal export, as I believe that we can kill and process animals more humanely, more cleanly and more healthily than anywhere or anyone overseas, if we understand the processing where product is grown and raised. Australia has a reputation for its safe and healthy product, and we should endeavour to promote that wherever we can in the world.


I have watched in horror, as many of us have, the nonsense that goes on with live animals being carted off and being badly handled when there is no need for that. We could actually replace a lot of opportunity in other parts of the world with chiller and freezing stores. I think we need to get that business model right and not just pay shippers and agents fees to do that. With any imports that can be gained we must value add. We must certainly promote Australia's healthy food and our eating experiences and we should not let supermarket shelves simply be filled up with overseas products. We should look at this dumping that is taking place throughout Australia. I support most of the motion but not quite all of it.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:21):  It is wonderful, heartening and refreshing to hear a Labor member sticking up for regional produce, sticking up for regional jobs and sticking up for agriculture. Whilst the Tasmanian member for Lyons says he agrees with most of the member for Murray's motion, I think we concur: we agree with most of what he said—not all, but most. As I say, it is refreshing to hear a Labor member actually sticking up for agriculture. It is not very common, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would well know.


I do want to comment on a couple of things that the member for Lyons indicated. He said that we produce fantastic food here in Australia, here in regional areas. There is no argument with him there. I would actually even go a step further and say that we grow the very best food. In my area of the Riverina and certainly in the member for Murray's area, the very best food in Australia is grown. We need to do everything we can to protect and preserve those people and those industries who are growing the very best food to feed not just Australians but also many other countries and certainly those in the Pacific rim who otherwise would not have access to protein and fresh fruit unless it was coming from the member for Murray's area and certainly the Riverina.


The member for Lyons talked about the false arguments of manufacturing as opposed to agriculture—but there are no false arguments. I do not think you will find that there would be too much opposition to what the government has done to try to prop up the ailing automotive industry; however, now the government needs to stump up and step up and help the ailing agricultural industry. The member for Murray has called for support for fruit growers and workers in the local food processing industry. The motion:


(2) recognises the impact and toll that the increased cost of doing business has on local food processors;


(3) acknowledges the significance of iconic local food processors—


and certainly there is no more iconic than SPC Ardmona at Shepparton—



as key employers and contributors to regional communities;


Thousands and thousands of jobs are at risk if this motion is not passed by this House. The motion also:


(4) supports the ‘Toss a tin in your trolley’ campaign to encourage Australians to throw a tin of local canned produce into their shopping trolley, and urges supermarkets to promote this initiative; 


That is a wonderful idea and it needs to be supported. The member for Murray also:


(5) calls on the:


(a) Treasurer to investigate an emergency World Trade Organisation safeguard action in respect of imported canned fruit and tomato produce; and


(b) Government to undertake an immediate and comprehensive anti-dumping investigation in respect of the request from SPC Ardmona and the canned food industry.


Certainly you would get no argument from me on that. I hope you do not get any argument from the government to absolutely back these important initiatives.


The Treasurer is going to be a very busy man in the weeks leading up to the election, as not only should he do what the member for Murray says with respect to this motion but he should also reject outright the proposed takeover of GrainCorp by Archer Daniels Midland, the American company—because we do not need our $9 billion a year grain harvest being decided by a boardroom in Illinois.


I am filling in for the member for Gippsland, who would like to be here but is unable to do so. He was most supportive of the member for Murray, and his electorate is also very much at risk if this motion does not go through. The Gippsland food producers number many, including Patties, Vegco, Kerton Farms, Dennison Foods Manufacturing, Lion, Frais Farms, Happy Camper Gourmet and Murray Goulburn, and food processors Bonaccord, Bulmer Farm Fresh Vegetables, Riviera Farms and Covino Farms, which is also a producer. They all stand to risk their viability in the future if this food processing motion, put forward by the member for Murray, is not supported by this House.


The member for Gippsland wanted me to point out that food product manufacturing within the Gippsland electorate accounts for 2,524 jobs. We heard the member for Murray a little earlier say that many jobs are at risk. Bad public policy by this government and the global market trends that we are unfortunately suffering at the moment, with the high Aussie dollar and all the other factors, have provided a perfect storm of absolute risk for the food processing industry.


SPCA is the largest producer of premium fruit and vegetables in packages in Australia. It does a wonderful job. Production is based in Victoria's Goulburn Valley, a region with 870 full-time equivalent staff. They are taxpayers; they are good, hardworking regional people doing their best to make sure we have the very best product on our tables and doing their best to make sure that overseas countries have the very best product on their table. They are at risk because of a number of factors, but this government and this parliament can help by pushing this motion through and enabling that very necessary legislation to be passed to provide the help that they need.


SPCA indirectly supports more than 2,700 jobs in the Goulburn Valley region as well as those 870 full-time equivalent workers. The company directly injects about $63 million into the local economy through salaries and wages and provides apprenticeships, training programs, work experience programs and graduate student programs to young people in the region who want to stay in the fine area of the member for Murray's electorate. They want to stay regionally because they know that the freshest air is available in regional Australia and that the best lifestyle is available in regional Australia. They want to do what their dads, mums, grandads and grandmothers have done for decades past. They want to be involved in a great industry, but they will not be able to if we as a parliament do not support them and their industry.


In recent years, SPC Ardmona has utilised the products from more than 200 contract growers and suppliers of semi-processed fruit and vegetable products, such as fruit juice and fruit pulp, and has bought 150,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables worth $32 million from contract growers. Those contract growers need certainty. They certainly have not had the sort of certainty that they absolutely need, due to poor public policy from this place—not least of which has been the Murray Darling Basin fiasco—which has been brought to bear by this very poor government.


SPCA has invested considerably in developing its business over many years, including major investments in production equipment and warehousing. It is doing its best to help this nation go forward. It needs this nation to help it in its time of need. SPCA brands include SPC, Ardmona, IXL, Goulburn Valley and Taylor's. We all know them; they are household brands. Unfortunately, they are not perhaps always at eye level in the supermarkets because of supermarket policies, but we know that they are the freshest and the best available for supermarket customers.


SPCA is suffering under the influence of a once-in-a-lifetime appreciation in the Australian dollar, which has made cheap imported food even cheaper. The current market reality is that the strong Australian dollar allows cheap imported products into Australia at way below the cost of production here—way below the cost of production in the member for Murray's seat and way below the cost of production in the Riverina.


Our farmers need help; they need help desperately. They need this government to step up—this government which talks about feeding the Asian food century demand, says that it has a national food plan and says that it cares about regional Australia but all too often shows that it does not by its poor public policies. It is extremely challenging for SPCA's branded Australian-made products to profitably compete. The Australian food processing industry may not survive to enjoy a more balanced playing field when the dollar returns to more normal levels. That is why it is critical at this juncture for this government to stump up, help and support the member for Murray's very sensible approach—a very sensible motion that we are hearing and debating here today to give SPCA breathing space through provisional safeguards. If it is not provided, viability of that company's position in the industry will certainly be under threat and it will have a devastating flow-on effect not just throughout the member for Murray's region and not just throughout regional Australia but, indeed, throughout the whole nation.


The government stumped up and helped Ford, which has now announced that it is closing despite the amount of money being poured into the manufacturing and car industry over the years. Whilst some people have questioned it, certainly this government now needs to show that it is also very much caring for regional Australia and a wonderful company such as SPCA, and certainly to show that it cares about the member for Murray's electorate. It has not done so in the past. I call on it to do so now in the interests not just of the member for Murray's electorate but of Australia.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (11:31):  I figure I should perform the hat trick in repeating at the outset, or at some point in the speech, that there will be things we will agree on and things we will most definitely disagree on in the course of this debate. Undoubtedly, Member for Murray, I think it is a good opportunity for us to discuss a sector that provides critical support within your electorate and in others and that also provides a valuable economic contribution to the nation. I think the member for Murray is most definitely right in highlighting the importance of the food and beverage manufacturing industry to our nation.


These are exceptionally difficult economic conditions both for the food and beverages and for the broader manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector within the electorate of Chifley provides up to 10,000 jobs for locals in our area, and so anything that affects the member for Murray's electorate in this way is also something that I have a keen interest in, which is why I was very heartened that you had put the resolution forward and also heartened to participate in the discussion around this.


The conditions that are present within the food and beverage processing industry evolve and are certainly putting pressure on a sector that has a lot of potential for growth. In this nation it employs close to 230,000 people, many of whom are from our respective electorates. Like the rest of the sector, food and beverage manufacturing faces huge challenges, the most notable being what is happening with the dollar—something that will not go away anytime soon and will continue to put pressure on businesses operating within the sector. I have seen that within our area and it is something that I would like to reflect upon during the course of my contribution.


Other challenges include the small size of our domestic market—and we have variously touched upon this issue through the course of our respective contributions this morning—and the lack of manufacturing scale. The issue of the domestic market—the price sensitivity of customers and the fact that they are willing in many cases to substitute overseas products for locally produced products that they might have used for many years—is a constant challenge for the sector. Again there are those in my area that are responding to this. The availability of skilled labour and retail market concentration all contribute in their own way to putting pressure on the sector.


Ninety-nine per cent of the 13,000 food-manufacturing businesses—and this is worth reflecting on: 99 per cent—are SMEs. Ninety-nine per cent is a huge figure. The government acknowledges the challenges that face them and the other sectoral challenges that I mentioned a few moments ago and we have put in place measures to help industries to remain competitive and sustainable—not just this one but across a range of different sectors.


Look at what we are doing with AusIndustry and with Enterprise Connect. Look at the magnificent work done by the CSIRO, the cooperative research centres, the industry innovation precincts which are starting to roll out—with a specific focus of one of them on food. They all provide programs aimed at lifting innovation, investment and productivity to help manufacturers overcome and better deal with the challenges that I outlined earlier.


Stakeholders in the food industry are right to be concerned with long-term viability of food manufacturing in this country. It is the reason the government is particularly keen to encourage greater investment in R&D and to provide tax incentives and programs that increase the level of cooperation between public and business research institutions.


One area where food manufacturers in the Chifley electorate are looking to get some advantage and also to help reduce costs and improve the way they operate is in the area of clean energy. Businesses in the Chifley electorate are learning how to reduce the costs of production at the same time as reducing their carbon footprints. Since our carbon price came into effect, businesses are taking initiatives to take practical steps to improve the way that they use energy, to reduce power bills and to reduce their emissions. They are also doing it in part, as they tell me when I visit them, to respond to what consumers are expecting them to do too.


One manufacturer in particular I am very proud of in the Chifley electorate is Arnott's. They operate a plant in Huntingwood within the Chifley electorate. I was really pleased to visit them last month. It was the second time I have been there to look around their plant, not to just avail myself of free samples but to see the way they operate in a very competitive market. They produce a product that is more highly priced relative to competitors which does put pressure on them but they deliberately price to the quality of our market and also to export markets—notably Japan.


When I visited Arnott's, I was able to see a $113,000 federal grant in action improving production methods and helping Arnott's reduce their carbon footprint. It was provided to Arnott's from the government's Clean Technology Investment Program and represents a third of the total investment of $340,000 being made to upgrade refrigeration controls and also install other energy-saving equipment. This is not the full extent of Arnott's commitment to a clean energy future. Over the past six years they have invested a total of $3.4 million to complete 24 green projects just at the Huntingwood plant in the Chifley electorate alone. The majority of the investment is being paid for by Arnott's with the assistance of $610,000 in combined rebates, 18 energy-saving certificates, and five supplier grants


Since 2008, Arnott's reckon that the average cost of power has increased 7.1 cents per kilowatt hour to 11.4 cents per kilowatt hours, so these improvements are not only great for the environment but also for their bottom line. From our clean technology investment grant, Arnotts expects to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of their refrigeration equipment by 13 per cent, resulting in savings of about $50,000 in energy costs per year—that is a three per cent annual energy reduction or about 1350 kilowatt hours.


It is important that the manufacturers remain competitive, particularly in the food sector, and sustainable to protect jobs. In our area, Arnott's employ 400 people, many of whom live locally and who I know from various other walks of life and from doing great things in our community. Ninety-nine per cent of Arnott's products are made right here in Australia supporting jobs across the country, and they spend $300 million a year in raw ingredients and other services from Australian farmers and businesses. It is important that when we talk about things such as this, which was prompted by the member for Murray, we need to ensure that many manufacturers like Arnott's and SPC Ardmona have a future in this country.


The government is considering SPC Ardmona's call for emergency safeguard action and will respond consistent with our obligations to the World Trade Organisation. I understand any emergency safeguard measure will be subject to a Productivity Commission inquiry to assess whether there is clear evidence that increasing imports are causing or threatening to cause serious injury.


As much as there are a string of positives associated with what has been put forward today, I cannot avoid pointing out some other things which I think are important enough to go on the record. There are elements—not necessarily in place right now in this chamber—of the coalition that do provide some sort of confected concerned about the manufacturing sector. National party members get, Labor members get it but there are some Liberal Party members that clearly do not. Why?


You have only got to look at what they want to do in terms of manufacturing support and the fact that they want to take out $500 million in support. They failed to support the steel industry transformation plans we put forward. The member for Murray has rightly made reference to the auto industry and observed that everyone has been lining up to support the sector, and they are right to—46,000 auto industry workers look at having their jobs affected. I do not misinterpret the point that the member for Murray has made, but there are others who run the risk of dismissing the level of support for people in transition. For instance, with Telstra—a company that employed 90,000 now only employs 30, and a lot of that was shed through privatisation. There was not a single cent of support during that period of privatisation under the Howard government. Telstra have kept shedding and there has been little support.


Contrast what has been called for in this motion with the broader coalition policy. Broader coalition policy indicates no manufacturing support but, worse still, at a time when the member for Murray is rightly calling for support, another side of coalition politics is arguing for a $5 billion subsidy scheme for polluters through the Direct Action Plan. Where can you argue on the one hand that you cut support for manufacturing—the type of support that is being called for in this motion—and then hand over $5 billion in a subsidy through a direct action program advanced and advocated by the coalition? These are the types of pressures that do need to be confronted by the coalition. It takes nothing away from the member for Murray's motion. It is an important motion to discuss. It talks about jobs and it talks about having a viable sector in this country, and we all need to work to support that.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:41):  I am very pleased to strongly support the member for Murray and her private member's motion. I have seen her absolute despair for the growers in her electorate, because of the fact that there has been no reaction from this government to the plight of the SPC Ardmona growers. She lives in this community and sees their despair day after day. I commend her for this motion. 


We know that it is in the member for Murray's electorate; fruit-growing industry has also long been a mainstay of the economy in my electorate the south-west of WA and the electorate Forrest. The value of fruit production in the area was around $80 million in 2010-11, according to the South West Development Commission. The birthplace of the Lady Williams apple variety was in Donnybrook in around 1935. Our growers have to compete in some of the most competitive marketing environments in the world just to stay in business. Yet, we do know like in the member for Murray's region, the legacy of the fruit industry is under threat as the industry struggles. 


We know about rising costs on the ground. We know about the high Australian dollar. We know about tightening margins. We know that this is seeing more and more orchards being pulled out right across Australia and in my region. We have seen the impacts of the government's decisions on biosecurity and the impacts that that is having. We know the cost of labour is high and our producers have to constantly do more with less. The fruit growers in my area are paying close to $20 an hour for relatively unskilled pickers, and competitors in developing nations pay much less. The standard wage in South America is less then $4 an hour; for much of Asia, farm workers get less than $1 an hour. Yet, our Australian producers have be some of the most efficient in the world to compete at all. We know that where mechanical picking is still impossible for most of our orchard enterprises, the chance of competing with those foreign imports is negligible because of the high labour cost. 


On top of this, there are significant differences in safety and compliance that our growers have to comply with—some of the most stringent occupational health and safety requirements in the world. By comparison, occupational health and safety barely exists for many of our competitors. More importantly, there is the difference in the quality and safety of the product. Australian producers bring to the market some of the world's highest quality and safest food, recognised worldwide. The OECD's report on food safety entitled, 'Food Safety Performance World Ranking of 2008' found that Australia was one of the top five performing countries, all of whose food safety standards were rated as superior. The top five were the UK, Japan, Denmark, Australia and Canada. The other OECD countries tested were rated as average to poor. Yet can you imagine the result if the same test with the same standards were applied to the non-OECD nations?


There is no doubting the quality of Australia food production. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advise that Australia has a worldwide reputation for producing superior-quality premium food and Australia food producers are committed to providing the highest quality international standards of quality management and food safety. Yet look at the challenges they face, even with biosecurity with this government. In Australia's high-quality, high-safety and high-wage reality, is it any wonder that other nations are seeking to use their own competitive advantage, that of price? Given the reality, what is the response of the government? Ad hoc at best, with antidumping legislation and a lack of understanding of what actually happens on the ground and what you do in a fruit-growing business. There is no understanding at all. We have seen that with the whole handling of the biosecurity issue. Given the response to your SPCA growers, Member for Murray, I would ask the question: does this government actually want a fruit industry in Australia? That is the question I would ask and I am sure that is the question your growers are asking given the lack of response from this government.

Ms MARINO:
  'No evidence to the contrary,' said the member for Murray. I commend her for bringing this particular motion to the House. We need this parliament to actually stand up and take notice. This government has taken no interest in the issues facing your growers on a daily basis, and the member for Murray has to live in the same community and watch these families in these businesses suffer, and I commend her for this motion.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:46):  The Australian food industry is very important to the Australia economy and to securing Australia's future food needs. The food sector employs around 1.65 million Australians, or one in six jobs in this country. In 2011-12, primary production contributed $42.6 billion to the Australian economy, and food and beverage manufacturing earned about $91.2 billion. The sector generates $30.5 billion in exports, and the fact remains that Australia exports half the food it produces. By 2050, world food consumption is expected to be 75 per cent higher, so the potential for Australia's food production is obvious and presents Australia with significant trade opportunities. Those figures, however, are very much reliant on the production and export of grains and livestock.


A closer analysis of what is happening in Australia's fruit and vegetable production depicts a different scenario. Ninety per cent of Australia's fresh food consumption is locally produced, with fresh food imports still predominantly arising from seasonal factors, natural disasters affecting local production or fresh food which is not produced in Australia.


The situation with processed food is considerably different. According to a 2013 IBISWorld report on fruit and vegetable processing in Australia, Australian food processing is a $6 billion industry. It directly employs about 10,000 people. In 2012-13, processed fruit and vegetable product exports were valued at around $1.4 billion, or 23 per cent of industry revenue. Interestingly, imports for the same year were $1.96 billion. Imports accounted for almost 30 per cent of local consumption and imports have been rising by 1½ per cent per annum over the past five years.


It would appear food processing is cheaper overseas and that Australian major food retailers have been sourcing more processed food from overseas, resulting in some 3,000 jobs having been lost in the last decade. The problem with that is that Australian consumers are becoming increasingly concerned about the production methods and quality of food processed overseas. Not surprisingly, more and more Australians are demanding clear food labelling on packaged food, particular with respect to country of origin information. Australians, however, do want to support Australian food processors and Australian jobs. That was clearly evident recently in my home state of South Australia when iconic Adelaide food processor Spring Gully Pickles hit financial difficulties. When it became clear to the public that the future of Spring Gully Pickles was at risk, public support for the business's products skyrocketed and, rather than downsize or close, the business in fact grew and more people were employed so that production could keep up with the public demand for their products. Just a good example of how public support can make a difference to the future of companies in this country. 


What we have also seen in recent years is the emergence of multinational takeovers and the ownership of Australian food industries by global food processors. The problems and risks with that is that multinationals will ultimately consolidate their food-processing operations to the lowest cost countries, as all other manufacturers are doing and that again results in the loss of jobs. That is one risk associated with foreign ownership. Another risk is that multinationals use clever accounting and transfer-pricing schemes to ensure lower profits are made in Australia and most profits are generated in low-tax countries, denying Australia of legitimate tax revenue. 


With Australia's clean green image, the food production and processing sector presents Australia with a competitive advantage and immense potential. We can make the most of that potential or we can sit back and watch the opportunity lost. The government's National Food Plan, I believe, sets out a strategy for maximising food production opportunities within Australia. I also believe that the government's response to date with respect to the antidumping legislation that has been brought into the parliament has been very important in trying to stop the dumping of overseas products in this country. Whilst we may need to go further, and that is a matter for the parliament, this government understands the risks that dumping has presented to the food-processing manufacturers in this country and has been responding accordingly. The government's National Food Plan sets out an appropriate strategy which this parliament should support.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2013-06-17,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (11:51):  I rise to speak on this very good motion put forward by the member for Murray, Dr Stone. I do so with a heavy heart and serious concern because food processing is such a vital part of rural Australia. It is, if you like, a litmus test on the economies of what happens in rural Australia. In fact, for many towns, the food processor is, or was, the major employer, the backbone in the development of a town and integral to providing the critical mass for the town for essential services, be it schools, hospitals or whatever it is that we need. For these businesses to see a future in Australia, they also need to know that the business environment will change and that the cost will change from today, and that the cost of doing business in Australia will stop increasing at such alarming rates and in fact decrease. 


Unfortunately, we have a government whose policies have deliberately added costs and red tape, and destroyed business confidence. As a result, Rosella, Windsor Farm, SPC, McCain and Golden Circle have all closed some or all of their Australian food-processing operations in the past three years. Simplot has now announced that two of its plants are under threat of imminent closure, particularly the one in Bathurst and possibly even the one in Devonport. The high dollar is certainly a significant factor, but Labor's policies have without doubt compounded the effect, with record borrowing and record debt through the five biggest budget deficits in history putting upward pressure on the dollar and on interest rates. 


Supporting manufacturing through innovative policies should be a no-brainer for Labor to support the workers—their strongest supporter base in the past. But the demise of food processing has really highlighted how Labor have deserted its working class base. Around 140,000 Australians have lost their jobs in the manufacturing sector over the last five years. In fact, one manufacturing job is lost every 19 minutes in this country. That is Labor's legacy. Introducing 21,000 new regulations and over 30 new or higher taxes take a toll on business; they also foster a feeling of defeatism within producers, suppliers and manufacturers—no matter what you do to get ahead, the government will still whack you. I congratulate SPC, as they have been proactive with government at all levels, and they have even come to the opposition to try to find solutions to keep their plants operating. SPC have applied to the government for emergency safeguard provisions and antidumping actions to give them some breathing space to retool their business. The coalition has supported the investigations to see if there is a case for emergency safeguard and antidumping actions.


Other companies, like Simplot, are watching on with a keen eye to see if the government is going to be proactive in its support for these industries as a first step to reinvigorate business confidence. Simplot has nominated two plants under imminent threat of closure, one of which is in my electorate. For agriculture, the loss of processing capability or capacity flows through directly to the farm sector. Obviously it has, or has the potential to have, a huge effect on profitability and marketing options.


Only the coalition has the necessary solutions. We will abolish the carbon tax; eliminate at least $1 billion of costly red tape annually; reduce government waste; and provide businesses with the certainty they need to prosper, employ more people and bring back the strong economic management and business confidence that Australia so desperately needs. We will also reduce the upward pressure on interest rates by getting the federal government's budget back in shape. A root and branch review of the Competition and Consumer Act, and beefed-up antidumping measures, will help ensure arrangements for the long-term viability of the food-processing industry. Once again, I congratulate Dr Stone, the member for Murray, for this motion and ask the House to support it.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (11:56):  I rise to speak on the motion and commend Dr Stone for bringing it to the House. I forget the name of her seat now.



An honourable member:  Murray.




Mr CHAMPION:
  Murray. How can I forget Murray? Of course, it reminds me of my youth. I spent a bit of time on the Murray myself, on Nikalapko Station between Morgan and Waikerie every summer from about the age of 15 onwards, picking apricots and oranges when I could not avoid picking them—and peaches, which were not much fun. That particular station exported apricots to Singapore; it was back in the early 1990s and late 1980s. Of course, they got a much higher price for their exported fruit through quality and attention to detail, and as a result we got much better wages than you would picking oranges; in those days you were flat out getting about $30 a bin, as it were. So I think I have a fair understanding of the practical end of this industry, and it is obviously an industry which is suffering from the same challenges that are affecting all manufacturing industries—no less so the industry that dominates both Geelong and Elizabeth, and the deputy speaker would know very well about the pressures on Australian manufacturing.


These pressures are mainly due to our currency, and I think this is the great unheralded debate in Australia. We have been preoccupied by carbon prices and by the daily events of politics, and we are missing the two fundamental economic challenges that face our country. The first one is that we have had a prolonged high currency and, even though commodity prices have declined, our currency has remained higher than it otherwise should have because of the investments made by overseas investors and by central banks from around the world. Our currency has become something of a safeguard currency, which is a first in the history of our country. It tends to be a very highly traded currency and one that has followed commodity movements and acted as a shock absorber for our economy in bad times like the Asian crisis. Today, or at least in the last few years, it has acted in the opposite way. It is not a shock absorber at all; it is a shock contributor to manufacturing and it is the big issue, because of course we have other people lowering their currencies: the Japanese, the Europeans, the Chinese and the US. So it is no surprise to me that fruit growers and workers in these industries are suffering from that same fundamental economic challenge.


The other challenge is that, whereas once upon a time we lived in an age of easy money and easy credit, we now live in an age of very tight credit. It does not matter where you go in the country and what business you talk to: businesses when they talk to their banks face very, very stringent loan-to-valuation calculations and have had to make appropriate adjustments to that.


Those two big economic changes are not going to go away just because we are having a change of government. I hate to break it to members opposite, and I think they might regret some of their rhetoric in this chamber, because they think that a simple change of government will usher in this wave of nostalgia and the world will go back to the way it was pre global financial crisis and it will all be right. In actual fact, they will be dealing with the same challenges we deal with.


I think Dr Stone's motion—particularly in regard to the antidumping measure and the safeguard measures—does have a great deal of merit to it. I am on the record as calling for something similar for the car industry. I think we do have to think very carefully about the implications of our currency and the fact that the age of easy credit has gone, and nostalgia will not solve our problems; only discussion will.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (12:01):  I also wish to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Murray and congratulate her for having done so. Many of us in this place represent areas of Australia where fruit growing is a very important local industry. In the electorate of Canning, which I represent, there are many orchardists and fruit growers who are under increasing pressure on a number of fronts. They are often reminded of the pressure on domestic industries such as manufacturing. However, many of the same hindrances, such as the Australian dollar, have similarly affected fruit growers all around Australia. Other cost pressures such as wage increases and the inability to secure reliable labour have resulted in many fruit growers abandoning their orchards and looking for a more secure, less volatile source of income.


The last thing fruit growers in Australia need is a federal bureaucracy that is intent on making life more difficult for them. However, sadly, this is what seems to be occurring. I have risen several times in this House to argue against the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority—APVMA—and its continued push to ban fenthion, the last remaining effective cover spray for the control of the Mediterranean fruit fly, otherwise known as medfly. Growers in the Perth Hills, led by orchardist Brett DelSimone and other members of the Hills Orchard Improvement Group, have done an outstanding job in fighting the APVMA's attempt to ban this chemical, a proposal which is based on spurious science and no evidence that this chemical has in fact been harmful to those consuming fruit treated with fenthion. I applaud those growers who have put their operations on hold to fiercely fight this bureaucratic decision that, if it were successful, would see many orchardists have to leave their properties due to the fruit fly infestations that it would bring.


In fact, in the Canning electorate we have already seen and heard on the news about two major fruit-growing families, the Byl family and the Casotti family, who have decided that enough is enough and that their best option is to leave their orchard and have it chopped up and sold up as real estate. Keeping in mind that these orchardists have farmed the same property for generations, we can understand that such a decision is not taken lightly by those who have heavily invested in these orchards. My thoughts are with those families who have had to make this very difficult decision. The proposal by APVMA to ban fenthion has been named as one of the contributing factors to these families finally deciding that they have to leave their orchard and their income.


My frustration is born from the fact that unnecessary pressure is being placed on these growers. There are some variables that all primary producers acknowledge are out of control, and we have heard again this morning about the high Australian dollar. However APVMA's proposed ban on the last remaining cover spray that controls the devastating effects of medfly infestation is an absolute kick in the guts for these growers, who do not deserve it and do not need it. 


I am continuing to press the new agriculture minister in Western Australia, Ken Baston, to understand the implications of the APVMA's proposal and the shattering effects this will have on the local fruit growing industry. I do hope that we will have more success with him than we had with the previous minister, who lazily and blindly absorbed advice from the bureaucrats in his department, DAFWA, rather than consult with those orchardists with generations of experience—in other words, the people on the ground who actually know.


There is a significant food security issue here. Without domestic fruit growers being able to remain competitive, they will inevitably continue to abandon the industry, and this will very quickly result in international competitors filling the gap. As we know from past experience, once imports fill the place of domestic produce, this market share is never recovered. I will continue to push both the WA state government and, indeed, the federal government, to avoid the unnecessary destruction of another primary industry and preserve the use of fenthion.


I urge the federal minister, Joe Ludwig, to stand up for the industry, stand up to his department and stand up for the growers who are set to lose their orchards due to this illogical push to ban fenthion. However, given his scant regard for the cattle industry and its destruction, I do not hold a lot of faith. But I do hold faith in the shadow minister, John Cobb, who has already outlined that the coalition's position, should we be the government in three months, is that we will not ban fenthion. We will make sure that the growers do have this cover and support so that the industry can be sustained and maintained. As I have already said, nowhere in the world has anyone ever demonstrated that this spray is in any way dangerous or will cause ill health. If fenthion goes, our domestically produced fruit will go, jobs will go, imported fruit will take over and Australians will be worse off as a result.

 (Petrie—Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation) (12:06):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion brought forward by the member for Murray. We, on this side of the chamber, have no problems with the detail of the member for Murray's motion. In fact, the government is acting on one of the key points that the motion raises in relation to taking action on anti-dumping and has already put in place a number of anti-dumping measures.


It is important to have a balanced approach to this issue and to weigh up all of the sides. While there are challenges for manufacturers, including food manufacturers such as the canners referred to in the motion, it must be recognised and acknowledged that the food and beverage manufacturing industry is a growing and evolving industry. With over 227,000 employees in 2011-12, it comprised over 13,000 businesses at the beginning of that period, of which nearly 99 per cent were small and medium enterprises. The sector is also extremely diverse, covering: meat, dairy, fruit and vegetable, confectionary, beverages and baking, among others, with a wide variety of firm sizes and regional specialities. While it must be acknowledged that some firms are experiencing great challenges, others are expanding and responding to increased demand.


The government are clearly aware that a range of factors have contributed to uncertainty in the industry, such as: the current high value of the Australian dollar, increasing input costs, the small Australian domestic market, a lack of manufacturing scale in some sectors, availability of skilled labour and retail market concentration. That is why we, the Labor Party, believe in such a thing as having an industry policy. That is why we support acting to support industry and involving ourselves to assist manufacturers to overcome the challenges they face. For example, through a range of agencies under the industry portfolio including AusIndustry, Enterprise Connect, CSIRO, Cooperative Research Centres and the Industry Innovation Precincts, the Gillard government have a number of programs and policy initiatives aimed at lifting innovation, investment and productivity to help our manufacturers overcome the challenges they face.


Further, under our Australian jobs plan, we have a $504.5 million Industry Innovation Precincts Program. Through that program, the government are investing in an industry-led Food Industry Innovation Precinct to create valuable connections across the food industry value chain and help firms build the critical mass, business capacity and export readiness needed to take advantage of industry growth opportunities, especially in Asia.


However, the government have heard and understand stakeholders in the food industry who are concerned about the long-term viability of Australian food manufacturing. That is why we are particularly keen to encourage investment in research and development through tax incentives and other programs designed to increase the level of collaboration between business and public research institutions.


I have heard a range of reasons being mentioned by those opposite for the impact on the industry, not to mention that the carbon price always seems to be mentioned when we talk about manufacturing. A measured realistic reflection on this issue will recognise that the government is also providing substantial support to the food-manufacturing industry, to transition to a low-carbon future through the $200 million Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program, with $150 million of that program dedicated specifically to the food-manufacturing sector over six years. This support is funded by the price on carbon pollution. 


Since the introduction of the carbon price, businesses have started taking practical steps to improving energy efficiency, reducing their power bills and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They improve the business bottom line and help tackle climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon pollution can often be reduced with relatively simple technology. In my role as parliamentary secretary I have seen this firsthand around the country. The Gillard government is working with many companies to invest in clean and renewable technologies. 


We have announced funding for 223 projects, using the carbon price revenue from the clean technology investment program to leverage over $338 million in total investment.


Global food markets will remain critical to the ongoing success of our export-oriented food, commodity products, as well as value added processed food, particularly as a result of Asian economic growth, population growth and technological change. Progressive food manufacturers are responding to these pressures and demands and it is important that we leverage off our clean and green image and embrace a bright future for food manufacturers.

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (12:11):  I am here today to support the motion moved by the member for Murray, Dr Stone, and to acknowledge that the economic contributions of the fruit growers and workers in the local food-processing industry are vitally important to Australia and its economy. Like Dr Stone's electorate, my electorate of Flynn houses the biggest citrus farm in the Southern Hemisphere and also we have some fine lemon plantations, many of the seedless variety, which have proven popular on the international market.


Also within my electorate I have 2PH Farms in Emerald and Abbotsleigh Citrus farm in Wallaville, near Bundaberg. These are major contributors to our export market. A few years ago the Emerald citrus industry was flattened by the terrible citrus canker disease. That meant the removal of hundreds of thousands of trees on that particular plantation and many other, smaller plantations around it. It also meant that any lemon trees and citrus trees in the township itself had to be removed. So if you had an orange or a mandarin tree in your own backyard, then that had to go. There was a complete shutdown of the industry for three years. Then they had to replant. 


If you now go to 2PH Farms you will see any tree on that plantation is no older than five years. It just goes to show the resilience and the energy of these citrus farmers. Australia produces food for 60 million people in the world and, in the next 10 years, we know that number will increase to 120 million people. So we need these vitally important citrus plantations and canneries to keep on producing food as we know it today or have known it in the past.


There is plenty of competition and I believe that all states grow lots of citrus. They have enough competition amongst themselves to ensure that they are always thriving for more efficient ways in which to do their farming. I think our farmers are the most efficient in the world when it comes to citrus growing.


Some of my farmers in the Flynn electorate have moved overseas and set up plantations in South America. They are wary of the canker disease coming back and wiping them out again and they cannot afford to rebuild a second time. Because of that, they have invested some money in overseas ventures.


The problem we have, as the other speakers have said, is the high Australian dollar. We have cheap imported foods, which include canned fruit. With the cost of production in Australia, it is not easy to compete with the rest of the world. We have an uneven playing field when it comes to exporting and importing fruit. We import less fruit than we export. We face imports from South Africa, China, Spain and Greece. Italy is a big exporter to Australia of tinned tomatoes.


There are other smaller-scale players in my electorate in the Burnett region, Mundubbera and Gayndah, which are also very big producers. The Gayndah crop this year was flattened by a hail storm and then later we had those devastating floods which devastated the towns of Mundubbera, Gayndah and Monto and Bundaberg, where there was significant damage done. However, the industry is starting to get back on its feet.


It quite amazes me, when you go to the citrus plantations how much, I believe, good fruit is thrown on the ground. About 40 per cent of the fruit ends up on the ground. When you are walking around the plantation you do not want to step on it because it looks like good fruit but it gets rejected by the cannery and markets. Another high cost to Australian citrus farmers is near perfect fruit not being accepted by the canneries and associated markets. It all adds up the fact that our farmers are very efficient. They have very real problems with anti-dumping and we need to tighten up our anti-dumping legislation. (Time expired)

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (12:17):  The member for Murray has moved this motion in support of SPC Ardmona, and I think the House is very supportive of that aspiration. I note that there are a range of possible assistance programs available to SPC Ardmona including the Regional Development Australia Fund, the Clean Technology Food And Foundries Investment Program, Commercialisation Australia, Food Industry Innovation Precinct, the Industry Collaboration Fund and Austrade. I encourage both the member and SPC Ardmona to explore those possible assistance programs.


The food and beverage manufacturing industry is a growing and evolving industry. It had over 227,000 employees in 2011-12 and has over 13,000 businesses—nearly 99 per cent of which are SMEs. The government is aware that factors such as the current high value of the Australian dollar, increasing input costs, lack of manufacturing scale in some sectors and retail market concentration have contributed to uncertainty in the industry. Through AusIndustry, Enterprise Connect, the CSIRO, Co-operative Research Centres and the industry innovation precincts, the government has many programs and policy initiatives aimed at lifting innovation, investment and productivity to help our manufacturers overcome the challenges that they face.


As Parliamentary Secretary for Trade, I have become very aware of the good work done by Austrade in promoting people-to-people links. I am also aware of the high regard in which Australian food is held overseas with our reputation for quality. Indeed, I personally believe that food manufacturing in Australia has a very bright future and that we are one of the few countries in the world in a position to export significant quantities of food.


As a part of the $500-million Industry Innovation Precincts Program, the government is investing in an industry-led food industry innovation precinct to create valuable connections across the food industry value chain and help firms build the critical mass, business capability and export readiness needed to take advantage of industry growth opportunities, especially in Asia. For example, a new collaborative centre for food innovation was launched in northern Tasmania on 4 April. It brings together scientists and technologists from the University of Tasmania, the Commonwealth government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the CSIRO. The government has invested nearly $19 million into the DSTO Scottsdale facility.


As the member for Petrie pointed out, the government is also providing substantial support to the food-manufacturing industry to transition to a low-carbon future through the $200 million Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program, with $150 million of that program dedicated to the food-manufacturing sector over six years.


Global food markets will remain critical to the ongoing success of our export-oriented food commodity products, as well as value-added processed foods—particularly as a result of Asian economic growth and the government's Australia in the Asian century white paper. The work surrounding that will assist this.


The member's motion talks about safeguard action, and I can inform the member and the House that the government is considering SPC Ardmona's call for emergency safeguard action and will be responding to it. Any emergency safeguard measures would be subject to a Productivity Commission inquiry, and the role of that inquiry is to assess whether there is clear evidence that increased imports are causing or threatening to cause serious injury to the domestic industry.


The member's motion also proposes an anti-dumping investigation. The process for such an investigation is that in an application the Australian industry has to demonstrate reasonable grounds that there is dumping or subsidisation, and it must also demonstrate that it has suffered material injury as a result. If an application is received, Customs and Border Protection has 20 days to determine whether they will begin an investigation. The legislative timeframe for investigations is 155 days, although this can be extended by the minister.


From day 60 of the investigation, provisional measures may be imposed in the form of securities. This occurs where there appear to be sufficient grounds for publishing a notice and where it is necessary to prevent material injury occurring to the Australian industry while the investigation continues.


I point out that the Australian government has boosted funding for anti-dumping investigations by $24 million over the next four years. This additional funding almost doubles the number of investigators working on anti-dumping cases. In accordance with our WTO obligations, applications are treated as confidential until an investigation is commenced, but, afterwards, a public notice is issued. (Time expired)


Debate adjourned.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:01):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to continue my remarks on this matter. The anti-dumping legislation before us is a significant improvement on what we had before. I recommend, though, to the chamber, the coalition anti-dumping policy, which goes even further towards giving Australia a modern, flexible, cost-effective system of anti-dumping and countervailing measures.


The fact is that Australia has been lagging for many years behind other countries in steadfastly refusing to consider what imports were unfairly competing against our Australian products. There were 189 anti-dumping and countervailing cases initiated around the world in 2005-06. The highest number of initiated cases were by India, with 30 cases. Then came the EU with 26 cases, followed by China with 16 cases and Argentina with 16 cases. South Korea and New Zealand were not far behind. They were in the top 12 users of anti-dumping actions. 


The three countries with the most measures in force were the USA, India and the EU. Measures usually last five years but can be extended. The number of new anti-dumping or countervailing cases initiated by Australia has been low over recent years, especially compared with the early 1990s. We turned our back on our manufacturers and primary producers when it came to their pleas for anti-dumping or countervailing actions that would give them a fair go—some sort of evening-up of the duties—so that they could compete, employ, create value, generate income for their nation and export, themselves.


The petroleum, coal, chemical and associated products industry has been the largest initiator of anti-dumping and countervailing actions in Australia. China is the largest target of the largest number of anti-dumping initiated measures around the world. Around 40 per cent of all cases involve China. China also brings a lot of cases against others. 


As far as food is concerned, most countries respond to Chinese imports by imposing higher food safety standards through the sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreements. In Australia we have done neither. So there is clearly a situation where we have often seen our own food manufacturers go to the wall. We have seen numbers of them go off shore, given the combination of high costs in Australia and their belief that it is too hard, too unfair and impossible to bring an anti-dumping action. 


There is only one investigation reported that relates to measures by Australia imposed upon China or South Africa with respect to food products. This was in relation to preserved mushrooms imported from China. Interim measures were imposed on 12 January 2006. The USA has a number of anti-dumping measures in place in respect to China, including crawfish, shrimps, prawns, preserved mushrooms, fresh garlic and honey.


Interestingly, in Australia's case, we are most concerned at the plight of SPC Ardmona. They are competing with imported product grabbed by the supermarkets Coles and Woolworths and which is put into their name brands, competing unfairly on the shelves. New Zealand has long had an anti-dumping measure against China and South Africa with respect to canned peaches. Anti-dumping measures were introduced against South Africa, for canned peaches, in 1996 and continue to this day after the 2008 and 2010 reassessments. Anti-dumping duties on imports of preserved peaches from China were introduced by New Zealand in 2006 and reassessed and reimposed in July 2012.


Quite simply, our competitors, our neighbours and other signatories of the WTO have been very active in defending and supporting their own country's manufacturing or fresh-food imports. It is about time Australia got with the strength. It is a case of maturity on the part of our country. Too many people scream: 'Subsidies!'. They scream: 'Protection!' when someone talks about lawful, WTO consistent, legal, anti-dumping or countervailing duties being imposed. It is time we grew up—before we lose all of our manufacturing sector.


I commend this bill and the various elements of the bill, and I commend our coalition policy. We obviously support these amendments and look forward to a stronger regime following the next election. We say: may our manufacturers and primary producers—our fresh-food producers—take heart.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:07):  In rising to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2013 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 2013 I point out that these bills represent a fifth set of anti-dumping changes introduced by the government in reasonably quick succession. I will therefore happily use the opportunity to return to a number of points I made in previous debates; however, it is certainly not my intention to exhaustively retrace a lot of old ground or to speak for a particularly long time on these bills. I also will not use this debate to extensively restate the coalition's policy on anti-dumping that preceded any significant government action in this area. In short, we have actively been pushing for a series of revisions to the anti-dumping regime since before the 2010 election—in other words, long before Labor finally started to signal its own intentions to make changes. 


We have also consistently said that we support changes to the current anti-dumping regime, wherever those changes are sensible and practical. We are happy to accept the government's assurances that the changes embodied in these two bills meet those tests. We are comfortable about supporting the changes that free up the minister's powers and decision-making scope in connection with the lesser-duty rule. On the surface, there is also nothing wrong with the principle of amending the operation within Australia of the retrospective duties provisions, particularly if that means—as is implied by the changes in the legislation and the description in the explanatory memorandum—the main intent is to make sure that those provisions work more like those in other countries.


We also do not object to the stated reasons for the introduction of new provisions relating to anti-circumvention, given that it has essentially been said the logic behind these changes is to extend the range of options available to the government to deal with anti-circumvention, including addressing the practice of sales at a loss and other attempts to evade the full payment of duties. In other words, we are taking the government at its word—albeit it is usually an unwise approach when dealing with the current government—and accepting that its changes will provide the minister with enhanced discretion in considering the level and timing of the application of duties to those companies that are found to have dumped goods in Australia as well as allow for a greater uniformity of approach between Australia and other countries.


All of that said, it is worth restating the point that I have made many times on several anti-dumping bills over the course of the past two years—namely, that effective administration of the national anti-dumping system relies far more on political will and common sense than it does purely on legislative change, in and of itself. The coalition has a strong record on this. We have just heard from the member for Murray specifically about local concerns in agriculture and food processing and the issue of dumping there. It has had a very serious impact, particularly in our home state of Victoria.


It has now been over a month and a half since the case for the application of WTO emergency safeguard action was submitted to the government by SPC Ardmona's managing director, Peter Kelly. As far as we know there still is no decision from the trade minister, Mr Emerson, about whether the government will enforce those emergency safeguard provisions. This is an issue of critical importance to our region and also for Australia—it is an iconic company. Also, it is critical for the orchard industry as a whole. It will affect a much wider range of jobs that are linked to fruit growing, particularly in Victoria. So it is an urgent matter and I press the minister to expedite his deliberations and give us a decision in the next couple of weeks if not in the next few days. I hope the minister can take time away from the distraction of the dysfunction and division within the government, which cannot even decide who should be their leader and our Prime Minister.


There are pressing issues that this country wants the government to make decisions on. The issue with SPC Ardmona, the dumping and the urgent decision required from the trade minister are decisions far more important than the playing of games behind closed doors, continuing the dysfunction and division within a truly embarrassing government. For a moment just take a day out from that and make a decision for the people of the Goulburn Valley, for the people of Victoria and in the interests of food processing and the orchard industry in this country.


If a policymaker's heart genuinely is not in addressing the cumbersome, expensive and confusing processes that have often plagued our anti-dumping system, then it is very unlikely that serious improvements are going to be delivered. To its credit the government has finally come to the party and tried to catch up on the coalition's plan to significantly improve resourcing of the anti-dumping system, and that is eminently a good thing and something that at long last is welcome from this government. Although, it brings a wry smile to my face to recall that when the opposition released its policy there were howls of protectionism from some government ministers, including Mr Emerson, only to be silent when the government followed suit, albeit with their B-grade copy of our policy.


This is a triumph for good policy and the national interest, because anti-dumping and enhancing the quality and integrity of anti-dumping investigations are critical steps that should help to bring cases to speedier and more effective resolution. That is something we on the coalition side have said for a very long time.


But, to go one step further, let us remember that sensible policy in this area of anti-dumping represents only one part of a much wider response that is now needed to the problems and crises that are besetting Australian manufacturing. I despair when I see the statistics that say more than 140,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia over the last five years. That is an unprecedented record. It is one job lost every 19 minutes. People say, 'But we have been losing manufacturing jobs for a long time,' but listen to this statistic: under the whole term of the Howard government there were over one million people employed in manufacturing and we had a net loss of under 7,000. So there is a crisis and there are many businesses in crisis, and anti-dumping is but a small and critical part in addressing some of the issues faced by many manufacturers. On top of that, we can add the broader loss of 243,000 small business jobs under Labor, another indicator of atrocious economic policy. And possibly, from all that I can see and hear, there will be even worse to come in manufacturing and small business between now and the end of the year.


In the meantime, and against that backdrop, I reaffirm that the coalition will be supporting these two bills. Any changes to legislation that are genuinely likely to improve the decision-making process and strip away unnecessary cost and time delays from the system should be allowed to pass, and the coalition will continue to facilitate that. If we are privileged enough to win the next election, we also look forward to the potential opportunity to implement our own anti-dumping policy and agenda that we publicly announced 18 months ago to deliver to this country a world-class anti-dumping regime.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:16):  I thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2013 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 2013. I was going to make a very short speech. It is a bit rich to be lectured by the member for Indi. She is a shadow minister in a political party that wants to take half a billion dollars out of a manufacturing sector that manufactures cars in this country—which, of course, supports 255,000 jobs in her home state of Australia—so it is a bit rich to be lectured by her in relation to manufacturing.


I would like to give a bit of a history lesson in terms of legislative achievement and reform. As the Minister for Home Affairs said when he introduced the bills, this is the sixth tranche of anti-dumping legislation to be introduced into the parliament in the last two years. That is worth noting, and we should consider the reform in these two pieces of legislation in that context. The first tranche, passed by this parliament in November 2011, imposed a time limit on prime ministerial decisions in anti-dumping and countervailing cases. It also clarified that all appropriate and relevant factors which may materially injure an Australian industry are specifically listed as factors to which a minister could have regard in exercising his discretion. It clarified that parties with a clear interest in anti-dumping matters are expressly given an opportunity to participate in anti-dumping investigations. In fact, it enhanced their locus standi.


Tranche 2, which passed the parliament in February last year, established a new appeals process—the review officer panel to replace the existing appeals mechanism established in the legislation—and established the International Trade Remedies Forum in legislation. Tranche 3 made several changes, including removing the limitation to the inclusion of profit when constructing a normal value of a good and removing the need for a separate review of anti-dumping measures and a continuation inquiry when they occurred in close proximity to one another. Tranche 4 better aligned the anti-dumping and countervailing system with the system's WTO counterparts; introduced provisions designed to address the circumvention of trade measures; and strengthened the ability of the anti-dumping system to address parties' non-cooperation during the investigation process. Tranche 5, which passed parliament in March, established the Australian Anti-Dumping Commission. I would like to see what the member for Indi said in relation to that. I am pleased that they have offered their support in relation to those pieces of legislation that have passed.


The sixth tranche of legislation, to which these bills relate, pertains to three key things: removing in certain circumstances the need for the minister to consider the lesser duty rule; clarifying the application of existing retrospective duties provisions; and introducing a new type of anti-circumvention inquiry to address the sales at a loss cases. I do not propose to look in detail at those three measures. They are part of the package of reform. These bills, with the previous five tranches of legislation, are the most significant improvement to Australia's anti-dumping regime in more than a decade. We are doing what the Howard government failed to do when they were in office. We are assisting the manufacturing industry to make sure that trade in this country is both free and fair. Our economy is strong, but some industries and some regions continue to do it tough.


This legislation particularly helps my electorate of Blair where there is a large manufacturing base in Ipswich. Industry, companies and workers are damaged when goods from overseas are dumped on the Australian market. It is unfair and that is why it is important we have a fair and effective anti-dumping regime. These reforms ensure that we better align our laws with the laws and practices of other countries, particularly those in our region.


We believe in fair trade, free trade and open trade. We benefit from access to overseas markets. We are a great trading nation in terms of our goods and services, and imports also benefit our consumers and Australian businesses. The reforms in these bills will help provide certainty and confidence for business, while ensuring that we meet our WTO obligations. I commend the bills to the House.

Access to import data



(1) For the purposes of subsection 16(2) of the Customs Administration Act 1985, a person is authorised to make a record of, and to disclose to any person, protected information (within the meaning of that section) that is import data.


(2) Despite section 12 of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 and any determination made under section 13 of that Act, the Statistician (within the meaning of that Act) must publish all import data.


(3) For the purposes of this section, import data means the following information about individual shipments of goods exported to Australia:


   (a) country of origin;


   (b) the type of goods;


   (c) the volume of the shipment;


   (d) the value of the shipment;


   (e) any other details about the shipment of the goods specified by the Minister by legislative instrument.


The Greens support the measures being taken by the government and welcome the opportunity to propose an improvement to the bill. One issue that has been raised and that would be familiar to those who have been following this issue for some time is the difficulty that is sometimes faced by people who want to either bring complaints or potentially elevate that to proceedings when they feel they have been the victim of dumping.


The amendment moved by the Greens would allow persons to have access to import data. This is essentially the same kind of import data that is already required to be provided. It would assist in the enforcement of the measures contained in this bill. I commend the amendment to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:22):  I thank the member for Melbourne for his support in relation to previous legislation in this area. But the government cannot support this particular amendment, based on the advice of the Australian Statistician. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is founded on strong legislation that protects its independence. That legislation protects the confidentiality of individual and company information provided to the ABS. The amendment would significantly alter that protection, with the likely detriment to the work of the ABS. It is important that the ABS works closely with applicants and with Customs and Border Protection in anti-dumping cases. The information the ABS provides is often vital to the success of any application. The amendment is not the appropriate mechanism to support collaboration between the ABS and anti-dumping applicants. So, regrettably, I say to the member for Melbourne that we do not support his application and his amendment.

New Zealand has long had an anti-dumping measure against China and South Africa with respect to canned peaches. Anti-dumping measures were introduced against South Africa, for canned peaches, in 1996 and continue to this day after the 2008 and 2010 reassessments. Anti-dumping duties on imports of preserved peaches from China were introduced by New Zealand in 2006 and reassessed and reimposed in July 2012.


Quite simply, our competitors, our neighbours and other signatories of the WTO have been very active in defending and supporting their own country's manufacturing or fresh-food imports. It is about time Australia got with the strength. It is a case of maturity on the part of our country. Too many people scream: 'Subsidies!'. They scream: 'Protection!' when someone talks about lawful, WTO consistent, legal, anti-dumping or countervailing duties being imposed. It is time we grew up—before we lose all of our manufacturing sector.


I commend this bill and the various elements of the bill, and I commend our coalition policy. We obviously support these amendments and look forward to a stronger regime following the next election. We say: may our manufacturers and primary producers—our fresh-food producers—take heart.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:07):  In rising to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Measures) Bill 2013 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 2013 I point out that these bills represent a fifth set of anti-dumping changes introduced by the government in reasonably quick succession. I will therefore happily use the opportunity to return to a number of points I made in previous debates; however, it is certainly not my intention to exhaustively retrace a lot of old ground or to speak for a particularly long time on these bills. I also will not use this debate to extensively restate the coalition's policy on anti-dumping that preceded any significant government action in this area. In short, we have actively been pushing for a series of revisions to the anti-dumping regime since before the 2010 election—in other words, long before Labor finally started to signal its own intentions to make changes. 


We have also consistently said that we support changes to the current anti-dumping regime, wherever those changes are sensible and practical. We are happy to accept the government's assurances that the changes embodied in these two bills meet those tests. We are comfortable about supporting the changes that free up the minister's powers and decision-making scope in connection with the lesser-duty rule. On the surface, there is also nothing wrong with the principle of amending the operation within Australia of the retrospective duties provisions, particularly if that means—as is implied by the changes in the legislation and the description in the explanatory memorandum—the main intent is to make sure that those provisions work more like those in other countries.


We also do not object to the stated reasons for the introduction of new provisions relating to anti-circumvention, given that it has essentially been said the logic behind these changes is to extend the range of options available to the government to deal with anti-circumvention, including addressing the practice of sales at a loss and other attempts to evade the full payment of duties. In other words, we are taking the government at its word—albeit it is usually an unwise approach when dealing with the current government—and accepting that its changes will provide the minister with enhanced discretion in considering the level and timing of the application of duties to those companies that are found to have dumped goods in Australia as well as allow for a greater uniformity of approach between Australia and other countries.


All of that said, it is worth restating the point that I have made many times on several anti-dumping bills over the course of the past two years—namely, that effective administration of the national anti-dumping system relies far more on political will and common sense than it does purely on legislative change, in and of itself. The coalition has a strong record on this. We have just heard from the member for Murray specifically about local concerns in agriculture and food processing and the issue of dumping there. It has had a very serious impact, particularly in our home state of Victoria.


It has now been over a month and a half since the case for the application of WTO emergency safeguard action was submitted to the government by SPC Ardmona's managing director, Peter Kelly. As far as we know there still is no decision from the trade minister, Mr Emerson, about whether the government will enforce those emergency safeguard provisions. This is an issue of critical importance to our region and also for Australia—it is an iconic company. Also, it is critical for the orchard industry as a whole. It will affect a much wider range of jobs that are linked to fruit growing, particularly in Victoria. So it is an urgent matter and I press the minister to expedite his deliberations and give us a decision in the next couple of weeks if not in the next few days. I hope the minister can take time away from the distraction of the dysfunction and division within the government, which cannot even decide who should be their leader and our Prime Minister.


There are pressing issues that this country wants the government to make decisions on. The issue with SPC Ardmona, the dumping and the urgent decision required from the trade minister are decisions far more important than the playing of games behind closed doors, continuing the dysfunction and division within a truly embarrassing government. For a moment just take a day out from that and make a decision for the people of the Goulburn Valley, for the people of Victoria and in the interests of food processing and the orchard industry in this country.


If a policymaker's heart genuinely is not in addressing the cumbersome, expensive and confusing processes that have often plagued our anti-dumping system, then it is very unlikely that serious improvements are going to be delivered. To its credit the government has finally come to the party and tried to catch up on the coalition's plan to significantly improve resourcing of the anti-dumping system, and that is eminently a good thing and something that at long last is welcome from this government. Although, it brings a wry smile to my face to recall that when the opposition released its policy there were howls of protectionism from some government ministers, including Mr Emerson, only to be silent when the government followed suit, albeit with their B-grade copy of our policy.


This is a triumph for good policy and the national interest, because anti-dumping and enhancing the quality and integrity of anti-dumping investigations are critical steps that should help to bring cases to speedier and more effective resolution. That is something we on the coalition side have said for a very long time.


But, to go one step further, let us remember that sensible policy in this area of anti-dumping represents only one part of a much wider response that is now needed to the problems and crises that are besetting Australian manufacturing. I despair when I see the statistics that say more than 140,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia over the last five years. That is an unprecedented record. It is one job lost every 19 minutes. People say, 'But we have been losing manufacturing jobs for a long time,' but listen to this statistic: under the whole term of the Howard government there were over one million people employed in manufacturing and we had a net loss of under 7,000. So there is a crisis and there are many businesses in crisis, and anti-dumping is but a small and critical part in addressing some of the issues faced by many manufacturers. On top of that, we can add the broader loss of 243,000 small business jobs under Labor, another indicator of atrocious economic policy. And possibly, from all that I can see and hear, there will be even worse to come in manufacturing and small business between now and the end of the year.


In the meantime, and against that backdrop, I reaffirm that the coalition will be supporting these two bills. Any changes to legislation that are genuinely likely to improve the decision-making process and strip away unnecessary cost and time delays from the system should be allowed to pass, and the coalition will continue to facilitate that. If we are privileged enough to win the next election, we also look forward to the potential opportunity to implement our own anti-dumping policy and agenda that we publicly announced 18 months ago to deliver to this country a world-class anti-dumping regime.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:16):  I thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2013 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 2013. I was going to make a very short speech. It is a bit rich to be lectured by the member for Indi. She is a shadow minister in a political party that wants to take half a billion dollars out of a manufacturing sector that manufactures cars in this country—which, of course, supports 255,000 jobs in her home state of Australia—so it is a bit rich to be lectured by her in relation to manufacturing.


I would like to give a bit of a history lesson in terms of legislative achievement and reform. As the Minister for Home Affairs said when he introduced the bills, this is the sixth tranche of anti-dumping legislation to be introduced into the parliament in the last two years. That is worth noting, and we should consider the reform in these two pieces of legislation in that context. The first tranche, passed by this parliament in November 2011, imposed a time limit on prime ministerial decisions in anti-dumping and countervailing cases. It also clarified that all appropriate and relevant factors which may materially injure an Australian industry are specifically listed as factors to which a minister could have regard in exercising his discretion. It clarified that parties with a clear interest in anti-dumping matters are expressly given an opportunity to participate in anti-dumping investigations. In fact, it enhanced their locus standi.


Tranche 2, which passed the parliament in February last year, established a new appeals process—the review officer panel to replace the existing appeals mechanism established in the legislation—and established the International Trade Remedies Forum in legislation. Tranche 3 made several changes, including removing the limitation to the inclusion of profit when constructing a normal value of a good and removing the need for a separate review of anti-dumping measures and a continuation inquiry when they occurred in close proximity to one another. Tranche 4 better aligned the anti-dumping and countervailing system with the system's WTO counterparts; introduced provisions designed to address the circumvention of trade measures; and strengthened the ability of the anti-dumping system to address parties' non-cooperation during the investigation process. Tranche 5, which passed parliament in March, established the Australian Anti-Dumping Commission. I would like to see what the member for Indi said in relation to that. I am pleased that they have offered their support in relation to those pieces of legislation that have passed.


The sixth tranche of legislation, to which these bills relate, pertains to three key things: removing in certain circumstances the need for the minister to consider the lesser duty rule; clarifying the application of existing retrospective duties provisions; and introducing a new type of anti-circumvention inquiry to address the sales at a loss cases. I do not propose to look in detail at those three measures. They are part of the package of reform. These bills, with the previous five tranches of legislation, are the most significant improvement to Australia's anti-dumping regime in more than a decade. We are doing what the Howard government failed to do when they were in office. We are assisting the manufacturing industry to make sure that trade in this country is both free and fair. Our economy is strong, but some industries and some regions continue to do it tough.


This legislation particularly helps my electorate of Blair where there is a large manufacturing base in Ipswich. Industry, companies and workers are damaged when goods from overseas are dumped on the Australian market. It is unfair and that is why it is important we have a fair and effective anti-dumping regime. These reforms ensure that we better align our laws with the laws and practices of other countries, particularly those in our region.


We believe in fair trade, free trade and open trade. We benefit from access to overseas markets. We are a great trading nation in terms of our goods and services, and imports also benefit our consumers and Australian businesses. The reforms in these bills will help provide certainty and confidence for business, while ensuring that we meet our WTO obligations. I commend the bills to the House.


Question agreed to.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:51):  I rise today to speak about a great Australian, a great role model and a great advocate for his people. Mr Yunupingu dedicated his life to building bridges, breaking down barriers and serving the interests of his people.


Born in 1957 in Arnhem Land of the Yolngu people, Mr Yunupingu had a record of firsts. He was the first Indigenous person from Arnhem Land to receive a university degree—an arts degree. He went on to become the first Indigenous school principal in Australia in 1990. He was, though, as we all know, made famous for his music. In 1986 he co-founded the band Yothu Yindi. Through this medium, he managed to transform the musical landscape. Yothu Yindi took traditional Indigenous music and swept the mainstream. Using infectious tones and melodic rhythms, they had suburban families singing about land rights issues and Indigenous welfare. Spanning a 12-year career, Yothu Yindi released six major albums. These albums received high acclaim. winning eight ARIA awards, including the Song of the Year for Treaty. Last year, Mr Yunupingu was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in recognition of his musical achievements. In recognition of his service to connecting Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, Mr Yunupingu was named Australian of the year in 1992. 


Mr Yunupingu died at the far too young age of 56 at his home in Yirrkala, Northern Territory. He leaves behind him a wife and six daughters. The sad and untimely passing of this Australian icon again raises the grave issues facing the Indigenous community when it comes to health and life expectancy. It is not acceptable in a country such as ours with our great wealth that Indigenous Australians have to live with their current standards of living and those of the Indigenous community who live in remote and rural Australia face considerably shorter life expectancy. It is quite wrong that we have in this country Third World health conditions. There is so much that we can do to make a difference in this space, and we must not stop until we achieve the results that we need to. For now, though, we pay our great respects to this great Australian—a leader amongst men and a true inspiration for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people alike.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (16:54):  The Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land have lost a great leader. A wife lost a husband and six daughters lost their father. Australia lost a towering figure of contemporary music, culture and politics, and a great advocate for justice for Indigenous Australians right across the country. We lost a great teacher, who shared his wisdom not only with the students at Yirrkala Community School but with all of us.


Through the music of Yothu Yindi, Yunupingu introduced many of us to the lives, the history, the language and the culture of the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land. He taught us that their culture was strong and a source of great pride. He taught us about the beauty of his country, the sacred bond between the Yolngu and the land of their ancestors, and about the great struggle of his people to protect that country for future generations.


For many Australians, it was the first insight we had into that far-off world. Yunupingu's strength is that he was a great bridge-builder between our worlds. Gently, he opened our eyes and helped give rise to a new understanding between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, teaching us that a new relationship was possible and that together we could build a better future for all Australians.


Like all great teachers, Yunupingu imparted his wisdom with patience, tolerance, kindness and warmth, whether through lessons in the classroom, where he became a pioneering educator; on the stage, where he took Yolngu music and culture to mainstream audiences around the world; or at the Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures, which he established with his wife to build bridges between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.


With his passing, we pay tribute to his legacy and, of course, recommit ourselves to achieving his vision: to take what he has taught us and put it to use for the benefit of Indigenous people around Australia, to continue our work to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, and to ensure that we build a reconciled Australia, based on mutual regard and respect. I believe that recognising Indigenous people in our Constitution will be a significant part of this reconciliation—and I know that he did too—helping us, together, to forge a stronger future, and one that he would be proud of.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (16:58):  Today, I also rise, on behalf of the people of Solomon, to acknowledge the very sad and untimely passing of former Australian of the Year and lead singer of Yothu Yindi, Mr Yunupingu. We just head the minister's very moving contribution and I would like to associate myself with her words. Mr Yunupingu, as we have heard, died at the age of 56, after a long public battle with kidney disease. It is with sadness that I speak of his passing, but it is also with great pride that I am here to talk about Mr Yunupingu's achievements—many of which were firsts for Indigenous Australians.


Mr Yunupingu was a great Territorian. He was admired by so many. I acknowledge the member for Lingiari here, because Mr Yunupingu was one of his constituents. As I said, he was admired by so many and known around the world. He was a leader for his people in that he brought Indigenous issues to the forefront of the national agenda. While I never had the pleasure of meeting him, his music is well known to me and to many Territorians. Music runs in Mr Yunupingu's family, with his nephew Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu also making beautiful music that Territorians can be proud of.


As others have done here, I would also like to acknowledge Mr Yunupingu's amazing achievements. In 1986 he founded Australia's most influential Indigenous band, Yothu Yindi, which was most noted for incorporating Aboriginal language and instrumentation with western rock. It is similar to what his nephew Gurrumul has done. The band, as we have heard, released six major albums from 1988 to 2000. It won eight ARIA awards and was nominated for 14 ARIAs. The most famous was in 1991 for the hit song Treaty, which was made song of the year in 1992. 


In 1988 he was the first Indigenous Australian from Arnhem Land to gain a university degree, a Bachelor of Arts (Education) from Deakin University. In 1989 he became assistant principal of the Yirrkala Community School. In 1990 he took over as principal of that school, becoming the first Aboriginal principal in Australia. He held this until he left teaching in 1991 told pursue his career with Yothu Yindi—and aren't we pleased he did that! In 1992 he was named Australian of the Year for his role in building bridges between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. Yothu Yindi was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2012. In 2012 Mr Yunupingu used his ARIA induction speech to raise awareness of diabetes and kidney disease and he encouraged all viewers to support Aboriginal recognition in the Australian constitution.


In conclusion, the sad passing highlights the terrible truth that too many Aboriginal people die too young, a fact that the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, reminds Australians of so often. We still have a long way to go in improving health standards and life expectancy of our Indigenous Australians, and Mr Yunupingu did a tremendous job in bringing attention to the plight of his people. I would like to echo the words of the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Adam Giles. He said the territory and the nation have lost not only a great artist but also a significant cultural figure. The passing of Mr Yunupingu is a sad day for the territory, Aboriginal culture and Australian music. My condolences to Mr Yunupingu's wife, their six daughters, his people and his many fans. May he rest in peace and may his music live on for generations into the future.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (17:03):  Let me first state that Dr Yunupingu was a good mate of mine, someone I knew since the late 1970s and early 1980s, someone for whom I had the greatest respect and admiration for a whole lot of reasons. If you examine his life course as an adult you are left with no doubt as to the contribution he made to Yolngu life in north-east Arnhem Land, and to the recognition of Yolngu culture not only nationally but also globally through his music.


One of the key components of his life was his lifelong commitment to education, which began in the seventies. He gained a teaching certificate after starting his formal teaching career at Yirrkala Community School in 1978. He gained a Bachelor of Arts (Education) at Deakin University in 1987. He was the first Yolngu person, the first Aboriginal person in north-east Arnhem Land, to graduate from university. At the time this must have been some challenge because he was also very active musically. This degree led to his appointment as assistant principal at the Yirrkala school. Working with others in the field, he instituted a two-way learning curriculum at the school. That was something I became fully aware of during my time as a teacher in the Northern Territory and subsequently by the commitment that was shown by so many others in advocating for it and participating in it. It gave Yirrkala School a unique feeling to see two-way education being practised in the school, with Yolngu language, Yolngu culture as well as mainstream English and all the attendant curriculum issues that are required for our kids at school.


This two-way learning was ensuring optimal learning through Yolngu and balanda education modalities, balanda being non-Aboriginal persons. This approach reflected what Dr Yunupingu was achieving through his, by now, nationally and internationally renowned and recognised music. Dr Yunupingu's work and quality as an educator was further recognised in 1990 when he moved from assistant principal to school principal at Yirrkala School. His contribution to education was one of the areas of achievement that led to him being named Australian of the Year in 1992. Given the prominence he earned as a musician, this commitment to education had meaning for him and it was reflected in his attitude to his work and later in his music. His subsequent advocacy for renal disease is a testament to him. 


This award of Australian of the Year continued a strong family tradition of social, political and cultural contribution to the Australian identity. Significantly, his father was a signatory of the bark petition, presented to the federal parliament in 1963. This year is the 50th anniversary of the presentation of the petition and that is a very important occasion. It was this petition that led to the historic Gove land rights case and ultimately to the implementation, through other issues, of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. His brother Galarrwuy had been previously recognised as Australian of the Year in 1978. It is a unique thing to have two brothers from the same Yolngu family in north-east Arnhem Land recognised as Australians of the Year and it is a magnificent tribute to them as individuals and also to their community and to their families. Dr Yunupingu's commitment to two-way cultural learning was at the basis of Yothu Yindi, established by him and other cultural leaders from the clans of the region. 


Dr Yunupingu chaired the reference group of the National Review of Education for Aboriginal Peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. This important review, conducted in 1995 and 1996, benefited greatly from Dr Yunupingu's long-term and continuing commitment to education. This commitment was recognised in 1998 by the Queensland University of Technology when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of the university in recognition of his significant contribution to the education of Aboriginal children and to a greater understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. 


He was truly a man before his time in terms of advocacy of reconciliation through both education and music. Yothu Yindi was a vehicle for advancing reconciliation and for promoting the worth of Yolngu knowledge and culture. Yothu Yindi translates to 'child and mother'. It was founded in 1986 by Dr Yunupingu, along with others. It combined Western rock'n'roll with traditional song cycles and instrumentation from north-east Arnhem Land. 


Their first album Homeland Movement was recorded in 1988. The significance of the homeland is not lost on us and should not be lost on us because that is what outstation living and homeland living is all about. There was a great commitment by Yolngu people in north-east Arnhem Land to not only look after their homeland but live on their homelands. That continues to this very day. It is one of the reasons this government is proposing to build a boarding facility for schools at one of those homelands, Garrthalala in north-east Arnhem Land. 


The Homeland Movement album was recorded in one day and they secured a contract with Mushroom Records. They began touring in 1989 to Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, the Edinburgh Festival, Australia, New Zealand and the European Folk Festival in Glasgow. They released Tribal Voice in 1991 with hit singles Treaty and Djapana. Treaty spent 22 weeks in the national charts and was voted APRA Song of the Year in 1991. Treaty, as we know, was a plea for reconciliation with a potently political message.


They won the Human Rights Commission award for song writing. In 1992 they won the ARIA award for best Australian song and best Australian single. The film clip by Steve Johnson won best Australian video at both the Australian Music Awards and MTV International Awards in Los Angeles. In 1992 the band spent much time touring Australia, North America, and Europe, winning rave reviews wherever they played.


Dr Yunupingu won Australian of the Year for his commitment to forging greater understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, the Yolgnu and the Balanda. In the ARIA awards for 1993, Djapana won numerous awards. In that same year, Yothu Yindi joined with the National Drug Offensive to launch a campaign encouraging the sensible use of alcohol in both Yolgnu and Balanda societies.


The third album, Freedom, had three singles: World Turning, Timeless Land and Dots on the Shells. Extensive touring followed to Japan, Europe, USA, Brazil and Australia. Other albums followed including Wild Honey, One Blood and Garma. They had the great honour of performing at the Sydney Olympics and Paralympics in 2000.


Late in his life, however, Dr Yunupingu suffered from an all-too-prevalent kidney disease in Aboriginal communities across this country—that is, he contracted kidney disease and ultimately was required to be dialysed. Despite being very ill for a number of years, he was active is securing dialysis back to Nhulunbuy and returned there from Darwin so he could live at home and ultimately, sadly, die there.


He also secured, with my support and with funding from this government, an important kidney disease workshop—only a month or so prior to his death—where Yolngu leaders including himself were able to discuss how to assist their people to fight the dreadful scourge of renal failure. He was there during the course of the whole day that I was present at this conference. He showed a great interest in what could be done to address the issues to do with renal failure and its attendant diseases, the issues of prevention in particular and how to get people healthy so they do not get renal failure in the first place.


He was most concerned about so many of his countrymen and women suffering from kidney disease and being treated so far from their homes, often to die there. It is so sad that there are so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around this country who contract this disease, which is so prevalent particularly in remote parts of this great nation of ours that they are required to go and seek treatment in places like Darwin or indeed Alice Springs, Katherine or Tennant Creek in the case of the Northern Territory or Perth in Western Australia or Adelaide in South Australia. It means they leave home, often never to return. That is simply so sad. This was not the case fortunately for Dr Yunupingu. He was able to go home and be dialysed in his home community and subsequently, sadly, die—as we know.


When he returned from Darwin he spent his time eating lots of bush tucker, especially fish roe, and playing with his many grandchildren. He was a very impressive man. He once said to my young daughter, who is a dancer, 'You will have to come and dance with us.' He was such an engaging individual and he had such a prolific commitment to reconciliation, to bringing the two parts of this nation so much closer together. He did this through actions as well as words. Whilst he was not an overtly political person in the sense of being involved in great political campaigns, his campaign for recognition through his music and through education will stand the test of time. Of that, I have absolutely no doubt. I would venture to say that he has done more in that realm, particularly for his people, the Yolngu, from north-east Arnhem Land, than almost any other person. He can rest peacefully knowing that he has had an enormous impact on the lives of so many and will be forever remembered.


My very sincere condolences go to Gurruwun, his wonderful wife, his six daughters, his huge extended family, to all of his mates, whether Yolngu or Balanda, wherever they might be, his partners in the music industry and his long-time friend and manager Alan James. When we pass, there may be a blink and there may be a tear, but this man will be forever remembered. May he rest in peace.

Mr CREAN
 (Hotham) (17:15):  I too rise to pay my respects and tribute to Mr Yunupingu, who has passed away. It is a pleasure to follow my friend and colleague the member for Lingiari, who has represented the seat in which Mr Yunupingu and his family live. He has not only represented the seat but understood the culture, the issues, the causes and the fights that he has just so eloquently spoken of. It, too, is a mighty reflection of the achievements, but it is nevertheless a sad occasion on which we meet to pay these respects.


My condolences and sympathies also to Mr Yunupingu's wife, his six daughters and his extended family. Mr Yunupingu was a Yolngu man, a member of the Gumatj clan of Arnhem Land. Baru, the saltwater crocodile, was his totem. Baru, in the dreaming, is associated with fire and is the creator of law, justice and order. Baru's journey across the east possessing fire and seeking justice was Mr Yunupingu's journey, a journey that he continues without us.


Yunupingu's legacy is huge. As huge as it is, it is characterised by passion and with reconciliation being at the heart of his achievements. In his music with Yothu Yindi we witnessed his use of the music as a driver of reconciliation. He also used the power of music to educate and to transform. The world was brought into existence through song, for the Yolngu, and with Mr Yunupingu's music the possibility for a new world, a new way of living with one another, was sung.


His passion for music became the instrument through which many Australians, and indeed many peoples the world over, encountered and understood the culture and challenges of Indigenous Australians and the critical need for real reconciliation in this country.


We saw in Mr Yunupingu a vibrancy and a courage in his music. His use of it was to bring Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians together. He was therefore also an exponent of the broader importance of the arts: the importance of them to Indigenous Australians, not just in terms of an aspiration or vocation, but the passion is here about pride, empowerment, the sharing of culture and respecting the value of Indigenous people and the knowledge of this country.


Through Treaty, Yothu Yindi brought Indigenous music and culture to the world, fostering understanding and challenging necessary conversations nationwide about reconciliation and of race. Mr Yunupingu spoke out against racism, but also of the importance of race. He also spoke of his Yolngu heritage and the many and extraordinary contributions Indigenous Australians have made and can make in this country. He once said that his mission in Yothu Yindi was:


… to demonstrate the pride we take in our culture and our willingness to share ''public'' aspects of it.


This pride, this determination and this spirit of generosity are remembered today.


Prime Minister Keating presented Yunupingu with the Australian of the Year award in 1993, the United Nations International Year of the World's Indigenous People. The fight for reconciliation, of course, was central to the early nineties. Prime Minister Keating delivered the now famous Redfern address in 1992—the year the High Court rejected the concept of terra nullius in the landmark Mabo case decision, which laid the foundation for the Native Title Act, subsequently passed by his government, a government which I was proud to serve in. Mr Yunupingu of course helped in this process. He was a critical part of the momentum that recognised not just the contribution of Indigenous Australians but also the need to make amends for past abuses and to look into the future toward meaningful progress and reconciliation.


Mr Yunupingu may be known internationally as a musician, but he was also an educator. He was one of the first Yolngu people to receive a degree, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (Education) from Deakin University. He became the first Indigenous man to be appointed a principal. He was promoted to that position in 1990 at the Yirrkala School. As principal, Mr Yunupingu achieved great success in developing new approaches to education. Even after he left his job as a principal to pursue full-time his career in music, he never stopped being an educator. His classroom expanded. His lessons were in song, but Mr Yunupingu still taught in a different and creative way.


People learned of the knowledge of his people. The name of his band, Yothu Yindi, translates, as the member for Lingiari mentioned, as 'child and mother', a meaning that the demonstrates balance. 'Yothu Yindi' expresses a belief system centred on reconciliation—of shared knowledge, of closeness and of support. This belief system was expressed through music, dance and art. Mr Yunupingu founded the Garma Festival, a festival of traditional culture. It is a celebration of Indigenous music and art, and a festival that has grown in size and influence over the years. More than a music festival, Garma is a forum for thinking and speaking about issues related to Aboriginal culture, and for addressing the inequities that exist in this country and the challenges faced by Indigenous Australians. Yunupingu urged us to fight harder for his people, saying:


Those in the corridors of power—be they parliaments, corporations or schools—need to recognise Aboriginal culture and accept it as an intrinsic element of our national identity.


And, of course, we must.


I had the opportunity to meet and work with Mr Yunupingu in several capacities over my time in this parliament. I met him in 1995 in Darwin, when the federal government's Working Nation commitment allowed us to leverage agreement from the Northern Territory for education and training. I had gone to the Northern Territory to seek the views of a number of Indigenous leaders. Mr Yunupingu was one of those leaders. He travelled from Yirrkala to meet me. He supported our cause, and that of educators and communities, to work together on curriculum. We needed to develop curriculum that would directly help Aboriginal children, and improve their literacy and numeracy, and their capacity for future employment. Later, as education minister, Mr Yunupingu critically helped me to understand the importance of Indigenous languages—not just to their education but fundamentally to their culture—and to recognise that the Aboriginal cultures of this country are a necessary part of the curriculum for young Indigenous students, that English language learning was never going to adequately foster a sense of culture, of pride or of innovation in education that was and still is required in Aboriginal communities and, finally, that without the language you cannot properly express culture. These were all important lessons to me that subsequently came to bear on the development of the cultural policy, Creative Australia. But back then in that time with my friend and colleague, the member for Lingiari, I had the privilege to open schools in East Arnhem Land—a significant step not just to reconciliation but to developing that fuller education and cultural experience.


As Minister for Regional Australia, I witnessed the diversity of Indigenous nations across this land and saw the contributions and challenges of Aboriginal Australians. Our multiculturalism, which must include Indigenous cultures, is what makes this country so great. This is something Mr Yunupingu knew intrinsically. He urged us to pursue the course of reconciliation on the streets and on the playing fields, and to listen and learn from the world's oldest culture. Mr Yunupingu lived in two worlds, proudly living the balance of Yothu Yindi and giving us all the very powerful example of what reconciliation needed to be. As I have mentioned, as arts minister, I was proud to work on those concepts and announce our first cultural policy in 20 years. Creative Australia is truly an Australian cultural policy with the unique, diverse and sacred Indigenous cultures at the heart of it. It recognises the significance of Indigenous culture, the need to embrace it, to understand it, to interpret it and to learn from it. Aboriginal languages and cultures must be recognised and fostered in modern society as inspiring and essential aspects of Australian culture, and this is embedded and funded within the policy. I spoke earlier of passions, and, again, it is passion that drives and gives opportunities to young people—to Indigenous young people—and that is what we are seeking to evolve, adapt, encourage and nurture in Creative Australia.


Mr Yunupingu was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame last year. It does remind us how rich we are when we appreciate the great contributions of Indigenous culture and Indigenous Australians. 'Yunupingu' means solid rock, and solid rock he was—a foundation for true reconciliation in this country. Solid rock is also synonymous with reconciliation, through the song written by his friend Shane Howard, memorably performed by Shane's band, Goanna in 1982. Shane was inspired to write the song following a trip to Uluru where he was invited to join a group of Indigenous people from Amaba performing imma, a community ceremony. Shane paid his tribute a fortnight ago, reflecting on his own recent performance at a Sorry Day ceremony and powerfully stated:


There is still a gap between the dream and the reality. There is still no treaty.


So, reconciliation was crucial to Yunupingu, and his contribution to advancing it was huge. He saw the importance of the building of bridges between the cultures that share this land and it is up to us to continue his hugely significant work. In Mr Yunupingu's death, we are reminded that the building of bridges still remains an urgent task. Mr Yunupingu, like so many First Nation people, died of chronic disease. The incidence of chronic disease in Indigenous communities is over double that in non-Indigenous communities.


In Closing the Gap, we are committed to addressing the inequality of health care and living standards for Indigenous Australians. Yunupingu's passing further compels us to do better by the original custodians of this land. As sad as his passing is, it does remind us of the unfinished business. As a legacy to him, our resolve must be strengthened to close the gap and finish the building. Again, my sincere condolences to Mr Yunupingu's family. It is a great loss to the nation, but we are left with a great legacy upon which we must build.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (17:30):  It can be said of very few that on their passing they have unequivocally left Australia in a significantly deeper and better place, but there is no doubt that on the passing of Mr Yunupingu it can be justifiably said that he left Australia as a deeper and better place. I want to begin very briefly in Yirrkala—Yolngu territory, just south of Nhulunbuy in East Arnhem. My own experience there was through the rubric of the Indigenous protected areas, for which I had responsibility in 2005 and 2006. One of the most uplifting experiences I have had in my parliamentary time was to visit Yirrkala. Of all the Indigenous communities in Australia that I have had the honour of entering, Yirrkala had the strongest sense of identity, education and art, and it is in no small part due to the influence of Mr Yunupingu and his family. It is an extraordinary family in Indigenous Australia. I believe it is the only Australian family to have produced not one but two Australians of the Year. Of any background and any place in Australia, I think that is a unique achievement.


The point about Yirrkala is very simple: it had role models, it had leaders, and it had people who achieved and succeeded and laid out a pathway for young people to follow. That was about creating a reinforcing culture, rooted in, based on and founded on Yolngu culture but with the higher purpose of the fulfilment of each and every individual in Indigenous Australia. Of course, there were failings and challenges, as there are in any human community, but this was a beacon of what could be. It is against that background that we acknowledge the passing of Mr Yunupingu.


There are three things to recognise here: his education, his art and his health, but all in the context of supporting the grand opportunity of Indigenous Australians to be their full and best selves. Although he is best known for his music, Mr Yunupingu, to my mind, should be best remembered for his work in education. He was the first Indigenous Australian from Arnhem Land to gain a university degree, at Deakin University in Victoria. He was a teacher and then, of all of his achievements, to my mind his highest achievement was becoming Australia's first Indigenous principal in 1990 at Yirrkala Community School in the Northern Territory. He became Australia's first Indigenous principal, and that is a message to people from Indigenous Australia of all ages: you can be anything. The message about the majesty of education and the potential for advancement and participation is peerless.


Beyond education, which of course remained a lifelong passion, there was the area for which he was best known: art, music and dance. Of course, the vehicle for that was Yothu Yindi. This is not well known, but the name is the translation of child and mother, reflecting this notion of balance, harmony and connection between the ages in Indigenous Australia. So, Yothu Yindi, the band, was created in 1986 by Mr Yunupingu, and it was successful in ways beyond everybody's imagination. Ultimately, off the back of the great song Treaty, which won song of the year, there were ARIA music awards, six major albums and induction into the ARIA hall of fame, and Yunupingu became Australian of the Year in the early 1990s. And his music was more than just a celebration of music. It combined art and dance, and it made Indigenous Australia something that Australians were deeply and positively proud of, right through the ages. It shattered old barriers, and I think that was an extraordinary step forward.


In his later days, driven by his own challenges with health—with kidney disease—he became a champion for health in Arnhem Land, in East Arnhem in particular, in his own community of Yirrkala, and did his best to ensure that the services available in the cities were available in the outlying regions. That is a legacy of great human achievement. We have an Australian of the Year, we have somebody who was a community leader, a health leader, and a great artist. But, above all else, he and his family should be remembered as great educators, because that is the indispensable element in giving children of Indigenous origin the pathway to being full and brilliant participants in modern Australia.

 (Canberra) (17:36):  I want to speak briefly tonight about the loss of a wonderful Australian, Mr Yunupingu. In 1992 I had the honour of meeting Mr Yunupingu when he had just been named Australian of the Year. I was working for the Attorney-General's Department on the public consultation process for the racial vilification legislation, a bill that was highly controversial and deeply confronting to many Australians at the time. I was travelling around with a group of colleagues from Attorney-General's to consult right throughout Australia with a variety of groups and the general public to get their views on the legislation.


This public consultation was very tough. I was a relatively young and fresh public servant and during some of the consultations I was faced with some of the most confronting, difficult, and often aggressive conversations about racism that I have ever experienced. There were people who did not agree with the racial vilification legislation. In fact, there were people who were actively agitating against it, and I found this very confronting and deeply depressing. I remember when we were in Adelaide—and this was probably the most confronting of all the sessions we had—we had a group of neo-Nazis turn up to the consultation, and they basically blockaded the community hall that we were in. There were a number of other community groups and organisations and Indigenous communities who were keen to ensure that this bill got through, and the neo-Nazis were doing their level best to disrupt the proceedings. I did not even know we had neo-Nazis in Australia, with shaved skinheads and swastikas and the whole thing. It was deeply confronting.


While conducting these consultations I travelled to different parts of Australia, including Alice Springs. It was there that I met Mr Yunupingu, who was a friend of one of my colleagues. My colleague had spent quite a bit of time up north and had done a lot of work in the legal services with the Indigenous community there. It was Mr Yunupingu who reinforced to me the importance of these racial vilification laws that I was working on and the importance of the community consultation process, despite the fact that it was deeply confronting. He reminded me of the challenges faced by Indigenous Australians, and he reminded me of the challenges faced by those Indigenous Australians who were vilified—how it shattered their self-esteem, their confidence, their will to succeed—

Ms BRODTMANN:
  As I was saying, Mr Yunupingu reminded me of the challenges faced by those Indigenous Australians who were vilified—how it shattered their self-esteem, their confidence, their will to succeed. And he reminded me of the need to continue to fight against racism and hateful language and abuse. My brief conversation with him gave me the inspiration I needed to continue with the job of going out there and finishing off this consultation and making sure that this legislation was going to be introduced, and it remains one of the proudest achievements of my career. As I said before, it was in that year that Mr Yunupingu was named Australian of the Year, so there was just a lovely synergy to the whole thing. I have always been thankful to him for the inspiration he gave to me at that really critical point, and also for the inspiration he gave to the whole nation. He was a great Australian who spoke to us and exposed us to the conditions and challenges of Indigenous Australians through the very accessible and popular medium of music. What he spoke was incredibly powerful, and it was done through a medium that was easy to reach for all Australians. It spoke in a very strong way about the conditions, the situation, the challenges of Indigenous Australians. Mr Yunupingu was a great Australian and will be very much missed. Lest we forget.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:54):  Water management in the ACT is an issue that I am very passionate about. The ACT has some spectacular waterways. However, as is often the case in cities, sometimes these waterways have suffered as a result of the urbanisation of the surrounds. Since my election in 2012, I have been campaigning for the better protection and restoration of Canberra's waterways. In particular, I have been advocating the development of a number of wetlands in the Lake Tuggeranong area. I know that the ACT government, through federal funding, has received quite a significant investment to build a number of wetlands in the Tuggeranong region, but the people who spend a lot of time around that area cleaning it up, investing their time and their effort, and their heart and soul, into making sure that it is as pristine as possible believe that more wetlands are required. 


I am a huge fan of wetlands. I had the good fortune when I had only just been elected to be one of the judges for the Australian Institute of Architects awards here in the ACT. You are probably wondering what architecture has got to do with wetlands. It has a lot to do with wetlands because a lot of what architects are now doing with commercial buildings is getting rid of those huge concrete drainage systems, those eyesores, and introducing wetlands as a way of getting rid of excess water, and, in the process, purifying water and creating a lovely natural environment where you get a number of little ecosystems being established through those wetlands. I am a huge fan of them, particularly because my electorate has a seam of concrete waterways running right through it from the top of the electorate right down to the bottom of the electorate, which causes all sorts of problems with the Lake Tuggeranong catchment and also with the Lake Burley Griffin catchment because there is so much unfiltered and unpurified water going into those significant lakes.


Beautiful Lake Tuggeranong is at the heart of the Tuggeranong community in my electorate. That is where my electorate office is. I see people walking around the lake, using it every day. They may be running, walking, walking with their babies, using the parks on the shores of the lake, having picnics or catching up with friends. I join with many residents of Tuggeranong in my concern for the lake's wellbeing as well as that of Lake Burley Griffin. That is why I have supported a community initiative for the restoration of the ecosystems of the Tuggeranong catchment. It is a project that will encourage and empower the community to become directly involved with the restoration of the lake through activities such as clean-ups and tree plantings. The project also has a long-term aim of developing a wetland area by the lake, which I know would be of huge benefit to the community and to the environment of Tuggeranong.


The bill we are debating today is an important step in the water management of the ACT. The bill will enable the ACT government to complete its responsibilities under the Murray-Darling Basin plan. For over a century, the Murray-Darling Basin has not been managed with a basin-wide plan. This has resulted in environmental degradation, a lack of resilience and an ongoing layer of uncertainty for basin communities. Members will have heard many times in this chamber about the ground-breaking work this government is doing to reform the management of the Murray-Darling Basin and this bill is another part of that reform. The Murray-Darling Basin plan requires that the ACT prepare a water resource plan that covers all of the territory's water resources as well is the Googong Dam. However, currently the management of water on national land in the ACT is a Commonwealth function and is not managed by the ACT government. This bill amends the Australian Capital Territory Planning and Land Management Act 1988, or the PALM Act, which regulates the management of land in the ACT so that the abstraction of water on national land is no longer managed by the Commonwealth government and can be managed by the ACT, consistent with the Basin Plan.


This bill enables the ACT government to take full responsibility for the management of water within the territory. Cooperative, consistent and efficient management arrangements of water extraction within the ACT will have long-term benefits for the sustainability of water resources within the territory. However, this bill is about more than water. By giving this responsibility to the ACT government, this bill is further recognition that the government of the ACT has well and truly come of age. The ACT achieved self-government in 1988 and I was privileged enough to work for our first Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, shortly after that. I was there at the early stages of self-government when it was all pretty ratty and there were all sorts of interesting individuals who had been elected under all sorts of interesting party names. It was a very interesting time: the burgeoning—the early stages—of self-government. Not only did I have an interesting time in an interesting work environment, but I also got to meet my husband, which was an added benefit.


It was a privilege to be a part of the unfolding of self-government in the ACT and it has been a privilege to watch the ACT Legislative Assembly mature over the last 25 years. In 2011, I was proud to be part of this parliament when we passed laws to remove one of the most final and most significant barriers to the citizens of the ACT and the Northern Territory enjoying full democratic rights. This was the Territories Self-Government Legislation Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment of Laws) Act 2011, which removed the ability of federal parliamentarians to veto the laws made by the ACT government. This was an important step for ACT self-government, and so is the bill that we are debating today, which hands the important role of water management in the ACT to the ACT government, where it rightly belongs.


For over 25 years, the Legislative Assembly has been making laws for the peace, order and good governance of the ACT. It has grown to be a mature and stable chamber that is accountable to its constituents. As the former Chief Minister of the ACT John Stanhope said, from ambivalent beginnings, self-government is now firmly embedded in the consciousness of our community. The ACT, through its stable government and mature parliament, has embraced the social responsibilities with which it is charged. On average, Canberrans are among the healthiest, best educated and most prosperous in Australia. We are just, free and relatively free of prejudice. We have grown in population terms and as an indispensable presence in our region. We have also grown as a community and as a vibrant and engaged polity and increasingly we are recognised as such by a nation whose capital and seat of government we are proud to uphold and sustain.


Water management is an important responsibility and the ACT government has well and truly demonstrated that it is mature enough to manage this responsibility. This bill is not only an important milestone for our environment but an important milestone for the ACT. I commend it to the House.

Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (18:02):  I thank the member for Canberra for her comments. I am sure that her husband is equally grateful for the opportunity—one of those things that come in life too rarely. Australian Capital Territory Water Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 gives the ACT government the power to manage its water resources for the development of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan among other things. There would be no-one in this House who would dispute the need for that. It transfers the power to manage water extraction and use within the ACT from the Commonwealth government to the ACT government. In particular, this bill will allow the ACT to establish a water resource plan under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


The changes in this bill are a consequence of the tabling of the basin plan last year. That plan requires a detailed water resource plan be developed for the ACT. However, under the current act, that plan would have needed to be establish by the Commonwealth government. This bill, as I said, transfers responsibility for the development of that plan to the ACT government and transfers broader powers to the ACT to manage its water resources.


While I certainly agree with the sentiment of the member for Canberra in relation to this bill, I cannot agree with her comments in regards to the current government leading ground-breaking work on the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, the glacial pace of that reform under this government is a major concern to all involved. The coalition has always supported reforms to the Murray-Darling Basin that would deliver on triple bottom line outcomes to the environment, for communities and for the economy. Unfortunately, Murray-Darling Basin reform has slowed to a snail's pace—in fact, that is an exaggeration; it is probably not even glacial, let alone a snail's pace—under this current government. The latest evidence for that was made clear in the recent round of Senate estimates, where officials confirmed that under the Gillard government there still has not been a sign-off on the intergovernmental agreement with basin states, despite more than 25 drafts having been prepared and indications at the February Senate estimates that it was hoped to be completed soon. Three months on, there has still been no progress. Why aren't we surprised?


Officials also confirmed that the government still has not finalised a water recovery strategy, despite releasing a draft last November and having already recovered nearly 60 per cent of the water without a strategy in place. One wonders why people think this government does not know what it is doing. The government appears to have dumped the plan's actual implementation in the too hard basket. As the government obsesses over all of the things that do not matter to everyday Australians who want to see the country back on track, it has dropped the ball on securing vital implementation agreements.


Having already chronically underinvested in water saving infrastructure, Labor has also slashed buybacks for the 2013-14 year to their lowest level since 2007. Deferring more than $100 million in budget spending to the back end of this programs risks creating a spike in the water market, forcing prices higher and creating budgetary pressures beyond the forward estimates. And that is not unique to this portfolio. As well, this government has an appalling record on reform. It is mismanaged such a wide range of programs that there is no reason to think that it is up to the task of completing the Murray-Darling Basin reform.


In fact, the recent announcement that Victoria has signed up to the intergovernmental agreement on implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan leaves many questions still answered. While any progress on strategic implementation of the basin plan is welcome, the signing of just one state in a piecemeal step risks the process descending into chaos—and again there are plenty of current day analogies—confusion or counterproductive bidding wars by the states. The IGA was supposed to have been signed by all the states by 7 December 2012 at the 2012 Council of Australian Governments meeting, shortly after the basin plan was finalised in last November. The minister must explain why—and still has not—seven months after finalisation of the basin plan he has locked in an IGA with Victoria yet other states are still to agree on its terms. Does this mean that other states will have to sign on the IGA as agreed to be the Commonwealth and Victoria or will different agreements between the Commonwealth and each of the different states be required? These are just some of the unanswered questions raised by the government's approach to the Murray-Darling reform package.


Notwithstanding all these mistakes and blunders and the continuing uncertainty covering the government's ongoing failures in this area, the coalition understands the significance of Murray-Darling Basin reform and will support this bill.

 (Kingston—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (18:08):  I would like to thank those who have contributed to the discussion on the Australian Capital Territory Water Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I welcome the opposition's support for this bill. The bill before the House is a small but very important step to improving water management outcomes and resource sustainability. National water reform is an ongoing process. The making of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in November last year was a critical step forward. This bill will continue the improvement of water governance within the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.


I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the minister for achieving something that no other Commonwealth government has ever achieved before, and that is a plan to manage the Murray-Darling Basin. This bill will allow the Australian Capital Territory government to manage all water extraction in the ACT, including that on national land and that by Commonwealth agencies throughout the ACT. It will also allow the ACT government to manage the Googong Dam, which supplies water to the ACT. This bill will facilitate the implementation of the basin plan by enabling the ACT to prepare a basin plan compliant water resource plan covering all of the ACT's water resources and the Googong Dam. The passage of this bill through the parliament will allow the Commonwealth and the ACT to fulfil their obligations under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


This government is committed to delivering a healthy river, strong communities and sustainable food production. This bill will assist to deliver on that commitment by facilitating cooperative, consistent and effective management arrangements of the water extraction within the ACT. I thank all those who have contributed and commend the bill to the House.

Water management is an important responsibility and the ACT government has well and truly demonstrated that it is mature enough to manage this responsibility. This bill is not only an important milestone for our environment but an important milestone for the ACT. I commend it to the House.

Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (18:02):  I thank the member for Canberra for her comments. I am sure that her husband is equally grateful for the opportunity—one of those things that come in life too rarely. Australian Capital Territory Water Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 gives the ACT government the power to manage its water resources for the development of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan among other things. There would be no-one in this House who would dispute the need for that. It transfers the power to manage water extraction and use within the ACT from the Commonwealth government to the ACT government. In particular, this bill will allow the ACT to establish a water resource plan under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


The changes in this bill are a consequence of the tabling of the basin plan last year. That plan requires a detailed water resource plan be developed for the ACT. However, under the current act, that plan would have needed to be establish by the Commonwealth government. This bill, as I said, transfers responsibility for the development of that plan to the ACT government and transfers broader powers to the ACT to manage its water resources.


While I certainly agree with the sentiment of the member for Canberra in relation to this bill, I cannot agree with her comments in regards to the current government leading ground-breaking work on the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, the glacial pace of that reform under this government is a major concern to all involved. The coalition has always supported reforms to the Murray-Darling Basin that would deliver on triple bottom line outcomes to the environment, for communities and for the economy. Unfortunately, Murray-Darling Basin reform has slowed to a snail's pace—in fact, that is an exaggeration; it is probably not even glacial, let alone a snail's pace—under this current government. The latest evidence for that was made clear in the recent round of Senate estimates, where officials confirmed that under the Gillard government there still has not been a sign-off on the intergovernmental agreement with basin states, despite more than 25 drafts having been prepared and indications at the February Senate estimates that it was hoped to be completed soon. Three months on, there has still been no progress. Why aren't we surprised?


Officials also confirmed that the government still has not finalised a water recovery strategy, despite releasing a draft last November and having already recovered nearly 60 per cent of the water without a strategy in place. One wonders why people think this government does not know what it is doing. The government appears to have dumped the plan's actual implementation in the too hard basket. As the government obsesses over all of the things that do not matter to everyday Australians who want to see the country back on track, it has dropped the ball on securing vital implementation agreements.


Having already chronically underinvested in water saving infrastructure, Labor has also slashed buybacks for the 2013-14 year to their lowest level since 2007. Deferring more than $100 million in budget spending to the back end of this programs risks creating a spike in the water market, forcing prices higher and creating budgetary pressures beyond the forward estimates. And that is not unique to this portfolio. As well, this government has an appalling record on reform. It is mismanaged such a wide range of programs that there is no reason to think that it is up to the task of completing the Murray-Darling Basin reform.


In fact, the recent announcement that Victoria has signed up to the intergovernmental agreement on implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan leaves many questions still answered. While any progress on strategic implementation of the basin plan is welcome, the signing of just one state in a piecemeal step risks the process descending into chaos—and again there are plenty of current day analogies—confusion or counterproductive bidding wars by the states. The IGA was supposed to have been signed by all the states by 7 December 2012 at the 2012 Council of Australian Governments meeting, shortly after the basin plan was finalised in last November. The minister must explain why—and still has not—seven months after finalisation of the basin plan he has locked in an IGA with Victoria yet other states are still to agree on its terms. Does this mean that other states will have to sign on the IGA as agreed to be the Commonwealth and Victoria or will different agreements between the Commonwealth and each of the different states be required? These are just some of the unanswered questions raised by the government's approach to the Murray-Darling reform package.


Notwithstanding all these mistakes and blunders and the continuing uncertainty covering the government's ongoing failures in this area, the coalition understands the significance of Murray-Darling Basin reform and will support this bill.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (18:08):  I would like to thank those who have contributed to the discussion on the Australian Capital Territory Water Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2013. I welcome the opposition's support for this bill. The bill before the House is a small but very important step to improving water management outcomes and resource sustainability. National water reform is an ongoing process. The making of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in November last year was a critical step forward. This bill will continue the improvement of water governance within the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.


I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the minister for achieving something that no other Commonwealth government has ever achieved before, and that is a plan to manage the Murray-Darling Basin. This bill will allow the Australian Capital Territory government to manage all water extraction in the ACT, including that on national land and that by Commonwealth agencies throughout the ACT. It will also allow the ACT government to manage the Googong Dam, which supplies water to the ACT. This bill will facilitate the implementation of the basin plan by enabling the ACT to prepare a basin plan compliant water resource plan covering all of the ACT's water resources and the Googong Dam. The passage of this bill through the parliament will allow the Commonwealth and the ACT to fulfil their obligations under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


This government is committed to delivering a healthy river, strong communities and sustainable food production. This bill will assist to deliver on that commitment by facilitating cooperative, consistent and effective management arrangements of the water extraction within the ACT. I thank all those who have contributed and commend the bill to the House.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (18:51):  I hope my motion spurs the government to greater activity in relation to the National Business Names Register. The motion urges the House to note that the National Business Names register has been in operation since 28 May 2012. It urges the House to note that the Gillard government has failed to act to fix implementation problems with the National Business Names Register, which has left the privacy of home based businesses exposed. It also urges the House to note that businesses have been waiting on hold for up to 45 minutes to progress to an operator when contacting the ASIC hotline about these business names. And, finally, the motion urges the House to note and bring to the government's attention the large number of people who have had problems with registering, renewing, paying for and transferring business names since the National Business Names Register started.


I have spoken on this topic a number of times before, but I hope my contribution is both gripping and persuasive. I did draw to the attention of the House back in September 2011 that this is a process that started under the former Howard government. It is a good idea that deserves the support of the parliament. My contention is not about the quality of the idea, but the quality of the implementation of the idea. And that has caused much frustration and hardship to small businesses right across our continent as they seek to complete the relatively simple transactions of registering, renewing or transferring a business name, something they have done quite comfortably and with a minimum of fuss through a number of different registers.


The issue with those multiple registers was that they were not well connected and, for businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions, you had quite a challenge in renewing multiple registrations across multiple states. This was something which this measure was aimed to address and it has gone some way towards doing that. But goodness, how hard can it be! It has proven to be very challenging and a source of great frustration for people who have contacted me or corresponded with my office.


On 17 August 2011 I was briefed by the then Minister for Small Business, Senator Sherry. I am not sure whether that was four small business ministers ago or three, but he was one of five in 15 months, and that has probably caused you great concern, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, as it has me and the small business community. We had some specific issues raised with us by stakeholders, by small business organisations and in fact by some of the state and territory jurisdictions. We urged the government to make sure it understood that not all businesses are big businesses and that, for small business, the complexity of the system and the need to disclose their location of operation would be an enormous affront to, in particular, the many home based businesses, who had not been required to provide that level of detail before.


The small-business community—the home based businesses, the micro-businesses of Australia—was promised by the Labor government that its privacy would be protected. It did not happen. Those assurances turned out to be empty. They turned out to be something that could not be relied upon and this has caused great distress for the small-business community. They would go to register their names under the new system, knowing that under state based systems they were able to provide a post office box or something of that kind, something they were quite comfortable with and which facilitated the contact and disclosure that was being looked for. But no, they could not do that under the new system. It demanded they provide an address usable for the servicing of documentation, summons and the like—and for many that is their home. So that privacy issue was not satisfactorily addressed. 


It still is not satisfactorily addressed today. It is one of a six issues I raised with the subsequent minister. I would like to thank the parliamentary secretary for facilitating that meeting with Mr Tanzer, the commissioner at ASIC who had responsibility for it. It was interesting. I think it was in September last year that we had that meeting. I was assured we would have some answers in a fortnight. Six months later we got some advice. Six months later we were told that there was some work going on to increase the capacity of the call centres, to deal with the extraordinary delays. There was some fudging on whether the system's changes, needed to protect the privacy issues, would be made. 


We were told that it required more resources, policy variations and a change to systems. When we sought to find out whether those action steps had actually been taken, when this parliament considered the budget in detail for the department of industry that included the small-business budget, we could not get any answers. You know why not? The small-business minister did not bother turning up. The parliamentary secretary, who is very diligent ordinarily, did not turn up either. I had to ask Minister Combet, the minister for the carbon tax that has cruelled small business, what was going on with the business-names register. He did not have much of an idea. We got no comfort whatsoever that there is action being taken. I am optimistic that with Parliamentary Secretary Ripoll here today we might be able to get an update on whether the extra money that is being provided is going to increase the number of people at call centres and hopefully reduce the frustration that many in the small-business community are experiencing. That is what the budget paper says: we will have more money for more people at the call centres. 


That is one part of the problem we raised with Mr Tanzer and one of the six issues we were supposed to have had resolved in a fortnight but which came back to us six months later. The question is whether those system changes have been made. I note there have been some changes in the way that business-transfer operations take place. There was a 28-day hiatus where a name was taken off the register and you just hoped and prayed no one pinched your name in the meantime. Now at least there will be multiple names registered against a business name, a vendor of a business and a purchaser of a business. I hope that will work, but we will find out and I am looking for some assurances from the parliamentary secretary that it will work.


The delays in calling the centre still seem to be a problem. It might be that we have not got to 1 July and we have not got those additional staff, but I am being very modest and conservative in a 45-minute wait. Many of the businesses that contact me say, 'Gee, I wish it were only 45 minutes; it's been much longer than that.' My message has been: this national scheme has to operate on west-coast time. If you are really stuck, ring after 5.30 on the east coast. Why? The centre has to operate in west-coast times. There is capability there after normal business hours on the east coast and that is probably a good time to call, but it should not be my job to give that kind of advice. The system should work and accommodate the traffic that it is experiencing.


Another area is the complexity in having your renewal processed. I have examples here where law firms have gone out of their minds. I am talking about legal practices with extraordinarily intelligent people incapable of navigating their way through this scheme, spending hours of staff time trying to get their names re-registered and renewed so that they can get a certificate of practice. I am encouraged by the fact that the registration fees might represent a net saving, but as we have to keep outlining time and time again to this government—that would not know a small business unless it organised a picket out in front of them—time is a scarce commodity for small business. They might pay a modest reduction in their fee, and that is to be encouraged, but they need to spend hours on the system on time they will never get back. That is extraordinarily expensive. That is why we have seen 22,000 new and amended regulations introduced by this government.


This was supposed to be an improvement in regulatory burden. It is actually operating the other way. That is why we have made some commitments about a reduction of a billion dollars in the cost of regulation. Why? It is not just the fee that matters; it is the time that is spent, the frustration and the inability to conclude what should ordinarily be a very straightforward transaction—that is, registering, transferring or renewing a business name. I have case studies after case studies. I have shared those with Mr Tanzer. I have shared those with the parliamentary secretary. All we are looking for with this motion is some action. The background has been impressive. The words have been reassuring. Where is the follow through? Where are we dealing with the issues of ambush marketing where business names with a geographic descriptor are being used to cut off business and to intervene in their trade? How are we dealing with people who cannot even register a name because of system problems—problems acknowledged by the government? 


There were some stand-up issues with the technology that proved incapable of dealing with the demands placed on it. The advice provided to some small business was that there are 32,000 renewals to be processed and: 'We will get to you eventually. Keep trading even though we can't give you a validation of a renewal certificate.' It also relates to those call times: 'Best to call after hours on the east coast because it is geared up to work for west coast time.' That is kind of practical advice we should not have to provide because this should not be so complicated. It should be a net advantage to the small business community. It should respect and protect the home based businesses. But after the legislation that passed the other day, now they could get some boofhead come in and demand a meeting not in their staff room because they don't have one but at their dining room table. That is why they are concerned about their privacy. This is a good measure. I hope it is going to be executed better. I hope the parliamentary secretary will give us those assurances. I hope this motion does something to put a rocket under the government to get it right. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (19:01):  I rise to speak on this motion moved by the member for Dunkley. I think the only thing we agree on is acknowledging the start date of the system; everything after that is in dispute. The only thing he has got right is that we commence the register from 28 May last year. It has come into being as a result of an agreement between levels of government, states and territories, through our COAG commitment for a seamless national economy. Under the intergovernmental agreement that arose out of the 2008 COAG national partnership agreement, the states referred the necessary powers to the Commonwealth to enable us to establish the national system for the registration of business names. I completely reject the member for Dunkley's characterisation of the national register as being a failure, which he suggested in a media release mid last month. Sure, any new system has to find its feet, but it will get better and better over the course of time. There will be problems at the start of a scheme, but that does not necessarily mean that the entire system is judged by its early days. For instance, where a business is required to register in more than one jurisdiction, the register has reduced the cost. To register a business name in all eight states and territories, we have reduced the cost from $1,000 to $70. For a small business, that is nothing to be sneezed at. That is a significant reduction in those costs. It has also proven a much more convenient system for businesses than the paper based registration system. 


The Australian Securities and Investments Commission operates the national register and has reported that since it commenced close to a third of business name registrations have occurred after business hours, reflecting the convenience of the new online service, particularly for small business. It allows them to focus on their core business instead of going through the process of these registrations. That certainly has the potential to benefit the more than 8,000 businesses that operate throughout the electorate of Chifley. ASIC, for example, has received over 300,000 applications for a business name since the national register commenced a little over a year ago. Since October last year, it has issued over 530,000 renewal notices to businesses whose registrations were due to expire on or after 28 May 2012. Although the vast majority of businesses have used the benefits of the new online national register without significant issue, admittedly there have been some that have experienced difficulties accessing the website, contacting ASIC and renewing business names. 


These system constraints would, no doubt, have been the source of a great deal of frustration for people attempting to register their business names, but ASIC has taken steps to address those issues, particularly around congestion and call wait times. It is worth noting that they have added 150 phone lines in the call centre and have recruited additional staff to respond to those inquiries. Those measures have succeeded in dealing with the volume of calls, which has been much higher than initially forecast. That, in itself, is a reflection of the fact that this has been embraced so widely by small business. People have wanted to avail themselves of the service and it has been a lot more popular than people originally intended.


ASIC also reports that almost no customers are having their calls blocked at the exchange. Last week there was only one identified. This means that almost all business-name customers are having their calls queued and then answered. Average call times in February this year, for example, were reported to be around the 30-minute mark, but are now down to 5½ minutes. That is a significant reduction.


In last month's federal budget the government allocated $7.8 million to ASIC for further improvements to the client contact centre specifically to service business name registrations. Of that allocation, $1.6 million is earmarked for capital costs. So this will let ASIC upgrade its telephone infrastructure over the next two years, and that will help achieve a target of 60 per cent of calls answered in 300 seconds. 


The member for Dunkley has raised concerns about the privacy of some small business owners, particularly those who operate businesses from home. Certainly, privacy concerns should always be taken absolutely seriously. The privacy issue arises from the online registration system not necessarily permitting the customer to use a post office box as a registered address of the business. I understand, from what I have seen, that since the issue first came to the issue of ASIC, they have worked closely with Treasury to examine the feasibility and the legal standing of a number of options to address the concerns of home based businesses, a lot more of which will be able to open up as the NBN rolls out and allows a lot more flexibility for businesses operating from premises at home.


I am advised that the Treasury and ASIC have now agreed upon a preferred option and that ASIC is developing the IT changes that are needed to roll out that solution. And while we wait for this measure to take effect ASIC has also undertaken to address concerns by allowing customers to change their address to a postal address, which is a good move. The interim measure will not occur automatically; rather, it will happen when the customer raises concerns with the call centre, which will allow them to make that choice. On top of this, ASIC will review its escalated complaints, where these concerns have previously been raised, and will invite businesses to change their address to a postal service.


This government's reform of business name registration was aimed squarely at making it easier for business to operate across the country. We were particularly concerned that this reform would reduce the regulatory burden of small business. I do not accept the member for Dunkley's assertion that only the coalition cares for small business. From day one this government has focused its tax reform agenda on assisting business, particularly small business. As a Labor government we are unapologetic about keeping people working and about supporting jobs. I certainly note for the chamber some of these small business-focused tax reforms—for instance increasing the small business instant asset write-off from $1,000 to $6,500. We also introduced accelerated initial deduction for motor vehicles costing $6,500 or more, and the government has announced its intention to introduce loss carry-back, allowing companies to carry-back up to $1 million worth of losses to get a refund on tax paid in the previous year. 


It is particularly worth noting that—in an environment where businesses that might have an outward focus are affected by the strength of the Australian dollar—allowing businesses to restructure is an important measure. Lifting the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 on 1 July last year benefited small businesses, particularly in terms of the people they employ.


I also note the government's support for small business advocacy. I am particularly proud of the fact—and I would like to have it recorded here—that we were able to support the Greater Western Sydney Business Enterprise Centre, who are providing services for businesses all over western Sydney. In particular I note the work of David Baumgarten and people in the BEC who are providing support for small businesses in the Chifley electorate. We were able to support them with over $200,000 of assistance which, funnily enough, was cut by the state government.


The state government of New South Wales, which professes concern for New South Wales small businesses, cut the funding available to this type of advisory and advocacy outfits, and we had to step in and provide the assistance. When this was brought forward to the then Minister for Small Business, Brendan O'Connor, he was able to ensure that we could provide funding support for small businesses in our area that want advice on the best way to start a small business, to grow a small business and to take a small business to the next level through a whole range of different strategies. I have seen some of the work on the ground through what he has achieved and certainly commend the BEC for their work.




An opposition member interjecting—





Mr HUSIC:
  That is the type of practical assistance that is provided through this government at times where your coalition friends at the state level have not been entirely helpful, and it is worth pointing that out to the chamber.


Admittedly, with a system like this—a national system that is replacing state-based systems—there will be teething problems, there is no doubt about that. But when you see what has been done in terms of correcting them and, importantly, what has been done to reduce the cost on small business—as I said before, reducing the cost from $1,000 for registration to $70—this is something that small business welcomes. They welcome the reduction of the regulatory burden on them. This has been a positive move welcomed by a lot of small businesses, and will definitely be welcomed in the long term as well.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (19:11):  I have a great privilege in seconding this terrific motion from the member for Dunkley. It was great to have the member for Chifley then speak in favour of the concerns raised in this motion. I will follow from what the member for Dunkley said earlier that we have supported the direction of the national business name register.


The member for Dunkley is the shadow opposition spokesman on small business, and has been the same shadow opposition spokesman on small business for some time now. I think in his time as shadow small business spokesman he has had six Labor opponents, which I think reflects the abilities of the member for Dunkley. He has been highlighting this issue for some time. It has been operating now for over 12 months and I, like many of my colleagues, have had numerous complaints to my office about problems with the system. One, in particular, led me, after consulting with the shadow small business minister, to write to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer about this issue on 8 March this year, raising concerns of a constituent of mine, Mr Eric Newman, who has been running a small business on his property for many years. The South Australian government, to put this in context, recently decided to change a roadside numbering system in South Australia, and therefore he had—




Mr Bradbury:
  It's their fault!




Mr BRIGGS:
  The Parliamentary Secretary says, 'It's their fault.' That is the first response that we have had from the Parliamentary Secretary, because the letter goes unanswered. It is good to see we have got an 'It's their fault' coming back to us!


But in any event, what the story is with the new national registration is that they will not allow Mr Newman to upgrade his postal address details with ASIC and remove the roadside mailbox and have a registered PO box instead. The decision was a result of the new rural property addressing system introduced by the state government. However, it goes to the ASIC rules that they are putting in place, which will not allow this to be registered. Of course it is just a bit of bureaucratic mindlessness, which is causing this small business person such challenges.


I expect the Parliamentary Secretary will write back sooner rather than later and explain that it has been fixed, because it would seem to me to be an easy issue to fix—to help this small business. It is like so many small businesses trying to make a go of it in an electorate like mine, a rural electorate, largely in small, home-based businesses, as the member for Dunkley said. They are an increasing trend. The Labor Party does not like them. They do not like them; they never have.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  That is why they have attacked the independent contractors legislation that the former government brought in. They do not like the fact that people can create their own opportunities. They much prefer them in the union collective. They much prefer them to be part of the pool of workers that can be accessed—



Mr Ripoll interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  Parliamentary Secretary, I would have thought you would be looking to answer the letter I wrote you on 8 March, rather than interjecting.

Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Symon
):  Order! The member for Mayo has the call and is entitled to be heard in silence.




Mr BRIGGS:
  These vicious interjections that are trying to disrupt this discussion, which I thought was being held in quite warm good humour previously with the member for Chifley, might reflect the challenges those on the other side are facing internally at the moment.


This is a Labor Party and a Labor government that does not like small business. It much prefers a system where people who are trying to be entrepreneurial are forced to move into the workforce. Many mums returning to work after having children, our experience indicates, are trying to make a go of it but are now being exposed to the bureaucratic bungling of a Labor Party that does not care about them and does not want to encourage them. Not just on this issue but on so many other issues the Labor Party is making life harder, not easier.


The parliamentary secretary, when he rises to support this motion, should also explain to my constituent, Mr Newman, when he can expect a response to what are not insubstantial concerns. They are things that can be resolved very quickly and would make a lot of sense. This is a terrific motion. It deserves the support of the parliament and some attention from this government.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business) (19:16):  I rise today to speak on this motion regarding the national business names register. If it were not for the fact that this motion is purely a political stunt, there may be some merit in it. The only genuine piece of goodwill towards small business in this motion is the date of commencement of operation, 28 May.


The national business names register, the register operated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, is a single place for an online registration application to operate across all states and territories under companies' registered business names. At its core it is about cutting red tape and cutting costs. That is something that this government has been and continues to be committed to. The online business names system provides many benefits over a paper based system, as anyone would understand. For a start, it is a single system across all states and territories, bringing together eight disparate databases. It is also open 24 hours a day, seven days a week and provides a bit of modernity. It recognises the reality that, in this day and age, if you are going to cut costs, cut bureaucracy and cut red tape for small business, you have to start doing a few things online and making them consistent. You make sure you do it once and for less than it used to cost.


The reality is that a paper based system is no longer an adequate tool for small business, nor was the cost of more than $1,000 for registration adequate. It is now around $30 instead—a massive difference. Also, the fact that this has been one of the most popular of databases run by government or ASIC is phenomenal. Over 15 million free business name searches have been conducted. The majority of those, of course, are to discover whether a business name is presently being used. It is much simpler to do it once than to do it eight times across all states and territories, with the fact that you might get something wrong during that process. Something like 530,000 renewal notices have been issued, with incredible amounts of activity. This has been an absolute success.


But I will acknowledge that, in all of these matters, when you are bringing together a complicated set of state and territory disparate databases, there will be a few teething problems—and there have been, and we have responded to those. That has been the whole point. A problem is identified, government responds and government puts forward extra funds. So we as a government are playing our role to ensure that small business is being looked after and that we continue to provide a way to cut red tape, a way to reduce costs and a way to provide protection. That is something that the opposition have not talked about in this. Protecting people's business names is as important as their privacy. Their privacy is absolutely important.


The opposition would be happy to know that, from immediately being alerted to this issue, we began work with ASIC and with other departments to look at legal issues and rights. For a start, there was not one consistent rule across states and territories on the privacy matter that they raised about post office boxes. It is one way in some parts of the country and different in other parts of the country. We have worked to a consistent line of trying to bring forward the best possible way to deal with these issues, but it is not a simple case. There are some very important issues about protecting consumers as well as protecting business in the proper identification of people's registered addresses. That can be done through a third party—for example, a solicitor, an accountant or another third party. It does not necessarily have to be the address of where, for example, the home business is based. There are a range of areas around how this works, and that is currently being considered by government: the best way to make sure that we get this right for small business.


Essentially, the national register is about having a single database—one place where you can go at any time of day or night, when it suits you as a small-business owner, not being told by some state department that you have to turn up between the hours of nine and five, which happens to be when you are trying to do your job as a small-business owner. It protects you against people who would otherwise steal your business name in another state or territory. It is a very good thing. It is cost-saving and it is all in one place.


While I have the brief opportunity, the member for Mayo said he has not received the letter in response, dated 16 May. Perhaps he would like a copy now of the letter that I am sure he has in his office. He seems to have come in here claiming he did not receive a response from me. I have the response in my hand. It was posted, it is dated and I signed it on 16 May. (Time expired)

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (19:21):  On behalf of the small-business community of Forde, I would like to thank the member for Dunkley and shadow minister for small business—the only shadow minister for small business on the coalition side—for this motion. Once again, we see an idea that has merit being very poorly implemented by this government. I reiterate what this motion seeks to note. As we all agree, the operation of the business owner register has been in place since 28 May 2012. Unsurprisingly, once again we see a government that has taken an enormous amount of time to act to fix implementation problems when they were recognised. One of the key issues has been the issue around privacy for home based businesses. In addition, we see that businesses have been waiting on hold for up to 45 minutes. I am aware of some cases where it has taken longer, and then they have been cut off, only to progress to an operator when contacting ASIC to have their questions or concerns dealt with. Equally, there are a large number of people who have been having problems registering, renewing, paying or transferring business names since the register was set up.


As I said at the outset, the idea has merit, but, as with many things that this government has done, it is the implementation that leaves an awful lot to be desired. My office received calls from people, particularly early in the piece, around the difficulty of accessing the ASIC website, difficulty in transferring or registering names, loss of documentation that has been provided, and going on to register and not being able to save registration part way through and having to go back to do the whole process again. The government at the time assured the coalition that home based businesses would have their privacy protected, yet this, another of the government's broken promises, is leaving business owners exposed and vulnerable. As the member for Dunkley has rightfully pointed out, this is just not good enough.


Also, despite promises being made to home based business operators, we again see small business being shunned by this government. This government cannot even fake that they have any kind of respect for the small business sector, which provides almost half of our entire workforce with employment. As the shadow minister has pointed out, since the rollout of the new system the coalition has received calls from small business owners, solicitors and accountants highlighting how the new system was botched from day one. It was heartening to see that the member for—



An honourable member:  Dunkley?




Mr VAN MANEN:
  No, it was not the member for Dunkley.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr VAN MANEN:
  No, the member for Chifley pointed out that there have been some improvements over the last few months, and I do congratulate them for that. But, as with anything, it takes an inordinately long time to get to these issues and to get them fixed. For those wishing to complain to ASIC about these issues, the general waiting time has been 45 minutes or longer. You can imagine that, if you are in small business and you have customers at the counter or ringing up to order a product, and you are sitting there on the phone to ASIC, you are not doing any business. You are not getting paid for it, and business are not there to be the paymaster to help solve the government's problems. They are there to build and grow their businesses, and it is from that that we continue to build the economy so that they are able to employ people and able to grow. It is just not good enough.


The coalition have tried to do something about this. We alerted the government to the problems with the register some 10 months or so ago, yet they chose to do nothing to help people with being able to register new business names. Finally we see in the last budget another $7.8 million thrown at fixing the system, finally admitting that in fact they had failed in attempting to implement the national business register. This was on top of the $125 million they had already spent on it. But, as we will always see, it is a coalition government that has at its heart the interests of small business operators. When I talk to my small business operators, they long for a change of government on 14 September.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (19:27):  The Liberal Party is no friend of small business. I looked at what the member for Dunkley had to say when this legislation came before the chamber back in 2011. I spoke after him. Today he repeated this assertion that this national register of small business was a process that the Howard government had undertaken. I think I reminded him back in September 2011 that in fact he would have supported it, perhaps, in the 12th, 13th, 14th or 15th year of the Howard government. They really did nothing about this, and this approach has been a result of the federal Labor government's legislation in September 2011. We brought this legislation through. We brought this in and the coalition did nothing. They are not friends of small business; they never have been and never will be. We know which type of business they are on the side of: big business.


When it comes to this particular thing, we are the ones who understand business. This particular legislation that we brought in was important at the time because we had different amounts that had to be paid in different jurisdictions. For example, in my home state of Queensland a business had to pay $133.60 for one-off registration or $255.60 for three-year registration. It varied in every state and territory. Thirty thousand businesses operated in multiple jurisdictions, and that equated to thousands and thousands of dollars a year.


I know what it is like to run a business, because I ran a business for more than two decades before I came here. I wonder how many businesses the shadow minister for small business ran. I built that business up into a multimillion-dollar business, so I understand what it is like to run a business—to deal with unions, with individuals, with Telstra and with those sorts of things.


This particular legislation that we brought in and that brought in this system enhanced the attitude of this government and made a difference in the lives of small business operators by reducing red tape and costs and, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business talked about, bringing modernity to the system and getting rid of the paper trail. So that is what happened. We know that, with 1.5 million business names and 15 million free business name searches being conducted, of course there may be some difficulties in implementation.


I had a look at what the shadow minister said. Where was he talking about these problems in his speech back in 2011? He was saying the coalition were supportive of what we were doing. He was saying that they were going to support it. In fact, he was saying, 'We actually would have done it—in fact, we were doing it.' But, in fact, they were not doing it at all.


The situation is that  government have given money. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business referred to, we have provided another $7.8 million to assist in this regard. We have also seen ASIC take steps, including 150 new telephone lines in the call centre and recruitment of additional staff in the client contact centre. We have seen improvements in the average call waiting times and they have also decreased from almost 30 minutes in February this year to five minutes and 30 seconds last week.


We have seen an additional $7.8 million provided to ASIC to do improvements in this regard. We have also seen upgrades to telephony infrastructure. We have seen an increase in the rate of service for call centres over the next two years to a target of 60 per cent of all calls answered in 300 seconds—a grade of service which is comparable to other government agencies.


Those opposite who opposed small business write-offs, who want to jack up company tax, who actually opposed almost every assistance we provided to small business, including increasing the tax-free threshold for home-based small businesses, and who voted against that should hang their heads in shame when it comes to small business.


In fact, this is a disingenuous motion by the member for Dunkley, because his side of the politics would never have the wit or wisdom to do this. We have done it. We are implementing it. It helps small business. Those opposite never help small business. They are always on the side of big business. We are the ones who brought in competition policy. We are the ones who brought in trade practices legislation back in the days of the Whitlam government and who upgraded it in the days of this government. We have done a good job in assisting small business. Those opposite have not when it comes to investment, infrastructure and assistance to small business. (Time expired)

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (19:32):  I rise to speak on the member for Dunkley's motion regarding the national business names register. As this motion notes, the national business names register has been in operation since 28 May 2012. Previously, business name registers were used in each of the eight separate states and territories, which made way for the single national register administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


The new register was set up ostensibly to make it easier for small businesses to register their name and to only have to do it in one national jurisdiction. However, just as this Labor government did with pink batts home insulation and the National Broadband Network, it has made a complete hash of its introduction. As the member for Dunkley highlighted, a large number of people across Australia have had difficulty registering, renewing, paying and transferring their business names since the national business names register commenced operation in 2012.


On its website, ASIC Commissioner Greg Tanzer has acknowledged that:


… there have certainly been frustrations for some people using the new online technology or trying to ring us for help.


This has caused incredible frustration for business owners for what realistically should take a couple of minutes to do. In particular, I have been contacted by numerous constituents who have had considerable difficulty using the ASIC website.


A constituent in Keperra was contacted by ASIC in early March advising him that his business name had been automatically transferred to ASIC's business names register on 28 May 2012 and that his registration was due for renewal. Instructions were provided on how to use the website. Unfortunately, it was anything but simple. According to him, for several consecutive days he attempted to use the ASIC website, enter his ASIC key and use one of their payment options all to no avail.


When he tried to use the provided telephone number to call ASIC, he had to wait for almost an hour and then was simply told that he could not pay over the phone. Instead, he was told that he had to use the website, which of course could not process his payment.


Another constituent from Upper Brookfield contacted my office in April after experiencing a similar situation. After waiting a considerable amount of time calling the ASIC hotline, he felt completely ignored by ASIC who could not assure him that if ASIC were unable to process his payment then his business name registration would not be cancelled.


Significant privacy concerns have arisen from the new rules, which stipulate that small business owners must use a physical or street address. And if you do use your home address for service of documents, it is displayed publicly on the business names register. These concerns have been constantly raised by owners of home based businesses who have had their personal addresses appearing on the register. There have also been problems with the sale and transfer of business names. Instead of being able to seamlessly transfer from one owner to another, under the new law, business name owners have had to deregister the name, and wait for the other person to take the name without any assurance that anyone else might be able to take it.


The blame for failing to support the implementation of this scheme lies squarely at the feet of this Labor government. Since its introduction, the coalition and small business have been warning the government about the problems in transferring business names and about the privacy concerns of home based businesses, which the government has continually ignored. Finally, in this year's budget announced in May, the Labor government finally acknowledged these lingering problems by proposing to spend a further $7.8 million on the scheme. In total, the register's implementation has cost government $133 million, including the $125.2 million allocated in the 2010-11 budget.


The failure to implement the national business names register is symptomatic of this government's inability to listen to the concerns of small business. Labor promised a 'one-in, one-out' approach to regulations; instead, they have introduced more than 20,000 regulations while repealing only 200.


The Prime Minister promised that there would not be a carbon tax under a government she led; instead, with the Greens and Independents, she set about implementing the world's only economy-wide carbon tax. In this case, Labor promised to make the national business names register easier for small business; instead, they have completely botched its implementation and have only created more headaches for already struggling small business owners.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (19:36):  My parliamentary colleagues on both sides are well aware of the fact I have a distinct passion for small business. Before entering parliament, I ran my own small business for 10 years.


I am fortunate to have 25,000 small businesses in my electorate and across the ACT. That is about one small business for every 12 people so small business is a hugely important part of the Canberra economy, and Canberra is luck to have such a thriving small business community.


The disparaging comments that no-one in Labor has any small business background are complete nonsense. There is me; there is my colleague here. There is also the member for Blair. There are three of us on this side speaking on this motion who have had their own experience in small business. The member for Blair was in business for 25 years. I was in business for 10 years and the member for Robertson was in business for more than a decade so we have significant experience in this area and it is complete nonsense to suggest that no-one on the Labor side has any small or micro business experience.


Since elected, I have spent a great deal of time trying to improve the dialogue between small business and both sides of politics. I set up the Parliamentary Friends of Small Business with the coalition, and we have all found the discussions with small and micro businesses incredibly useful. I think that understanding the needs of small and micro business needs to be enhanced not just on this side but also on the other side. From the conversations I have had with those people who attended this bipartisan group from the other side, they have found it incredibly useful and it has enhanced their understanding of small and micro business.


A few weeks ago I hosted a small business forum here at Parliament House with the Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business and representatives from the Canberra small business community. It was a really useful opportunity for the Canberra small business community to explain to the parliamentary secretary the challenges they are facing in getting access to government contracts. We all know that there tends to be a favouritism towards primes. And I am concerned—as they are and as are many people on this side—that SMEs are being locked out of the government procurement process. So we had expansive discussions on the government procurement process generally, on tenders and on compliance, and it is the first of many conversations that we will be having in the government procurement arena.


In the conversations I have also had with the small business community—when I am not in this House I go out and speak to small businesses in Canberra day in day out—they tell me either that the market is steady or that it is growing. And that is as a result of the economic fundamentals that we have established for Canberra and also the nation: growth, growth, growth; jobs, jobs, jobs. We have created a million jobs in this country, and we have created the right economic environment for these businesses to be able to grow and thrive and prosper and to employ people. So, the conditions have been good over many years since we were elected. But what the small business community is most concerned about at the moment, in all the conversations I am having with them, is the huge hole that is going to be punched in their potential client base, in their potential market, in their potential business existence post-September. They are particularly concerned about coalition promises of axing 15,000 Public Service jobs—well, between 12,000 and 20,000 Public Service jobs; let us just settle at 15,000. That is whole areas of my community that will be gone, wiped out, in terms of jobs. If you want to have a significant impact on small business or microbusiness in Canberra, 12,000 to 20,000 jobs is going to do it. I do not hear much expression of concern about what your plans for the future are for the Canberra business community, getting rid of 12,000 to 20,000 public servants. We saw what you did to this community in 1996. We saw how you caused an economic downturn. You stopped growth. House prices plummeted. Remember 1996, Canberra. (Time expired)

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2013-06-17,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (19:42):  It is my pleasure to rise to support my colleague and friend the member for Dunkley on his important motion before the House today about the national business names register, which was established in May 2012. We would like to express our concerns, not about this idea of a national business names register—because it is a good idea, and it had its genesis in the Howard government—but about the botched implementation that has occurred on this Labor government's watch. During the register's short life, we have seen the privacy of many small business owners jeopardised through their residence being known. We have seen huge delays and waiting times as people have rung the ASIC hotline trying to get through to renew, transfer or pay for their business name.


This has moved what was formerly a state and territory based system to a national system. But I have had constituents call my office and detail the problems that they have had with this national business register. The member for Dunkley, who has been extremely energetic, passionate, and knowledgeable in his portfolio, told those opposite more than 10 months ago about the existing problems, but little was done. Millions of dollars were thrown at this national business names register—$120 million in the initial budget. And because of the loud outcry from small business, another $7.8 million has been allocated. But the money is not enough, because what we have seen from this government is its botched implementation. We have seen the pink batts fiasco and we have seen the school halls fiasco. We know you cannot protect our borders, and it is little wonder you cannot run a national business names register.


Small business is absolutely critical in our community. There are 2.7 million small businesses, employing more than four million people. In fact, 96 per cent of businesses in this country are small businesses, 47 per cent of those working in the private sector are working in small businesses, and 35 per cent of the country's GDP comes from small businesses. But you have taken small business in this country for granted. The fact that you have had five ministers responsible for small business in 15 months says it all.


You have introduced more than 20,000 new regulations. You have introduced economy-wide taxes like the carbon tax, which comes right off the bottom line of small businesses, as well as a host of other bits of red tape. In fact, the red tape is crippling the small-business sector. We have seen more than 240,000 jobs being lost from small business, again on Labor's watch, and we have seen a 95 per cent decrease in the amount of small business start-ups in this country. There are 130,000 independent contractors who are no longer there because of this government's poor record on small business.


Millions of people across this country have said, 'Enough is enough'. They want more certainty. They want people to run the government who care and who understand small business. Given the fact that there are so few members opposite who have actually run a small business themselves, it is little wonder that this government have been so unable to conduct themselves properly in the small business area.


What will we do if we are given a chance at government? The first thing is that the member for Dunkley, who will be the Minister for Small Business, will sit in cabinet. He will have a seat at the cabinet table. Small business will be in Treasury. We will introduce a fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave scheme which will be of great assistance to small business. Of course we will get rid of the carbon tax which, as I said, comes off the bottom line of small business. We will introduce changes that will see more than $1 billion in red tape removed. What a great burden that red tape has been on small businesses right across the country. We will ensure that the government pays small business on time, and there will be a penalty if it does not. We will extend the unfair contract provisions to small business. And perhaps very significantly, we will conduct a root and branch review of competition laws as well to ensure that small business gets fair dinkum go.


This motion before the House is extremely important because in setting up a national business names register we wanted to help small business. But this Labor Party has done everything to botch its implementation and therefore to hinder small business. Under the coalition we will do so much better for the small businesses of Australia.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-06-17,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (19:47):  I rise to oppose the member for Dunkley's motion on a national business names register. As much as I have much personal respect for the member for Dunkley, sadly this motion is off-key. He has hit a wrong note.


I am particularly proud of this national business names register, which has been operating successfully since 28 May 2012. I remember my days as an articled clerk working in a law firm. It was a small business actually, though it has grown to be a slightly bigger business. Much of the work of an articled clerk was spent running around inefficiently registering business names and working in state jurisdictions. Thankfully, the federal government has taken a step up and got rid of this red tape—this dreadful red tape—that is just a cost that small businesses do not know.


The national business names register in Australia became a reality one year ago today. Eight separate state and territory business name registers have made way for a single online register, which today holds more than 1.7 million names. This is bad news for articled clerks or for young lawyers. Obviously, they will not now be able to bill clients or businesses for much of their work. But it is a good thing for the Australian economy and a good thing for productivity.


Mr Deputy Chair Adams, since you and I were elected at the same time, you might recall that for the quarter when we were elected, productivity under the Howard government was running at zero—a big fat zero. They had run out of ideas, they had run out of anything except spending money like a drunken sailor. The Labor government has been much more efficient, has had much more of a national approach and has had much more of a 'what is good for business ' approach.


In the last 12 months ASIC has facilitated the online registration of over 260,000 new business names, made 120,000 updates to the register, done more than 14 million business name searches and issued close to 500,000 business name renewals. Can you imagine the work that articled clerks would have been doing but for the federal government's stepping up and making it a more efficient, unified nation?


The benefits of the national register include one stop convenience online to create, maintain and cancel a business name. Thirty per cent of registrations are done after business hours, making it more convenient for small business. There is only one registration needed Australia wide, from Perth to Coolangatta, instead of multiple registrations state by state. As a Queenslander living in Brisbane, it is not hard to be doing business over the Tweed. That is the case throughout Australia. It is cheaper, especially for customers with multiple business names. The national business names register has saved business $34 million in the last year alone. I am sure that the member for Dunkley touched on this often in his many speeches commending the Labor government for our contributions to small business! That $34 million in savings in the last year is through reduced fees to register or renew a name. Obviously, there is increased transparency as a result of more information being available online for free so that the general public can search to find out who stands behind a business name. Once upon a time in Queensland you would have engaged a lawyer to find out this information. Now you can find it online at a time that suits you.


Although the vast majority of businesses have utilised the benefits of the new online national register without any significant issues, despite this off key motion from the member for Dunkley, unfortunately some people have experienced difficulties such as accessing the website, contacting ASIC and renewing business names. That is because it is so popular. To address the congestion levels and the call wait times, ASIC recently implemented a range of strategies, including adding 150 new phone lines into the call centre. ASIC has now reached the maximum capacity of phone lines possible using our current Traralgon PABX. It has recruited additional staff in their client contact centre and registry operations team to respond to inquiries. Obviously, you respond to demand—that is what a good government does. These strategies have been largely successful in dealing with the larger than forecast call volumes, congestion levels at the exchange and call wait times. Obviously, it is so popular that too many people are trying to utilise. Bad for lawyers but good for the government in terms of improving productivity.


More recent data that I thought the member for Dunkley would be privy to indicates that almost no customers are having their calls blocked at the exchange due to congestion levels. Average call wait times have also decreased from almost 30 minutes in February to five minutes and 30 seconds last week. It is good to catch up, member for Dunkley. I am sure that you will be quick to appreciate the great work that the Labor government has done in improving productivity and making it easier for small business. (Time expired)

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (20:53):  Today I would like to praise the remarkable contribution that local businesses make to my electorate. Each and every day, the hard work of local business owners and their staff play a vital role in generating employment opportunities for Macarthur residents and driving our community's economy. I recently attended a presentation of the Campbelltown local business awards and was honoured to have the opportunity to recognise and support such an impressive array of innovative and hard-working local businesses in the Macarthur community. The local business awards program is a prestigious one that is held each year. It highlights businesses across the Campbelltown district that offer outstanding customer service, products and innovative approaches to business challenges. It has become a major competition in the community and is conducted over an 11-week period.


I believe the Campbelltown Local Business Awards are essential to the Macarthur community because they offer residents a meaningful way to show their support and appreciation of businesses that offer exceptional services and products to the local community. Local businesses are the backbone of our local economy. They generate employment for thousands of Macarthur residents, provide services to our local area and drive the local economy as well as the country's broader economic development. 


The close link between local businesses and the community is also important to the education of young people in my electorate. Many local businesses in Macarthur actively contribute directly through financial support and indirectly through social support to local schools. Partnerships between local businesses and schools provide resources to enrich student learning and improve education through upgrading facilities and equipment. For high school students, local businesses provide opportunities for students to explore different career paths, make contact with future career opportunities, develop workplace skills and integrate into the labour market. Helping to deliver educational services to schools substantially enriches student development and learning. In so doing, local businesses are supporting the future of Australia because, after all, young people are our future leaders.


Local businesses also provide vital support for grassroots sporting clubs in the community. Sport is a central part of the Macarthur community. The commitment of local businesses in assisting sporting and recreational clubs plays a vital role in improving the health and wellbeing of Macarthur residents and in offering a number of social and personal benefits. Businesses assist clubs and organisations to maintain and improve facilities and sponsor a wide variety of amateur and professional sports men and women across a broad range of clubs and associations. A number of netball, soccer, rugby and hockey clubs in Macarthur could not exist without the support of local businesses. For example, when the Macarthur BMX club first began, they had no facilities, no track and no funds. However, with support from a range of local businesses they were able to open a track in the local community.


For those reasons, I take great pleasure in commending all Campbelltown Local Business Award finalists. To be nominated and acknowledged for offering excellent services and products is a great achievement, both personally and professionally. I would like to especially congratulate Minto's Fruit Orchard for taking out the prestigious Business of the Year Award in 2013 and Susanne Taylor from Southwest Automotive who was awarded Business Person of the Year.


The following local businesses stood out to Macarthur residents and judges as having offered an outstanding service and approach in 2013 in their respective categories. The local business winner of the antiques, art, crafts and gifts category was awarded to Sentiments Cards & Gifts. The winner of the automotive services category went to Macarthur Ford Service. The winner of the bakery/cake shop category went to Waminda Bakery. The winner of the beauty services category went to Oceana Day Spa. The winner of the bedding store category went to Sleep Doctor Holy Sheet! The winner of the butcher category went to Blue Ribbon Quality Meats. The winner of the cafe category went to Dahlia's Cafe. The winner of the childcare services category went to UWS Unique Kids Early Learning. The winner of the education service category went to the Australian Institute of Childcare Training. The winner of the electrical appliance store category went to Factory Seconds Warehouse. The winner of the fashion shop category went to Katies Campbelltown Mall. The winner of the fast food/takeaway category went to Kings Charcoal Chickens Campbelltown. The winner of the fitness services category went to Fit H.Q. Campbelltown. The winner of the florist category went to Petals and Blooms Ambarvale. The winner of the general bulky goods category went to Bunnings Campbelltown. The winner of the hairdresser category went to Strands of Colour. The winner of the home furniture store category went to Room Decor. The winner of the jewellery store category went to Michael Hill Jeweller Campbelltown. The winner of the new business category went to Campbelltown Country Fresh. The winner of the pet care category went to Macarthur Veterinary Group. The winner of the pharmacy category went to Chemist Warehouse Campbelltown. The winner of the professional services category went to Donna Fuchs Conveyancing. The winner of the real estate agency category went to Dunsheas United Realty. The winner of the restaurant category went to George's On Queen. The winner of the service and trade category went to Aussie Farmers Direct North West Campbelltown. The winner of the specialised business category went to Red Dragon Alternative Medicine. The winner of the specialised retail business category went to Minto's Fruit Orchard. The winner of the long-serving business category went to De Hall Dance Studio. The winner of the Youth Award went to Aldi Macquarie Fields.


I would also like to congratulate the competition organisers and sponsors. They do a terrific job year in and year out in promoting and celebrating the much-deserved achievements of local businesses in the Macarthur community. The publicity generated from the competition provides local businesses with wonderful exposure in the community. This includes editorials in local newspapers, which keep readers and voters up to date with their products and services. This type of support for local business is more important than ever, considering that data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics census on population and housing showed that, in 2011, almost 50 per cent of Macarthur residents travelled outside the electorate for work.


I want to see local business industry in Macarthur supported by the federal government so that they can become large employment centres that attract a local workforce. This will not only strengthen Macarthur's local economy but also decrease the time residents spend travelling to and from work so that they can spend more quality time with their families. However, local businesses continue to get overlooked and overtaxed and are over-regulated. Under the existing Labor government, the number of employed in small business has declined by 243,000 across the nation and the rate of small business formation has halved.


Unlike the Labor government, the coalition recognises that it is tough running a small business and it has been made even tougher because of Labor's carbon tax and red tape. These are the two main issues raised in my regular meetings with business owners across Macarthur. Local businesses across the nation have to carry the full weight of the carbon tax without the compensation or the carve-outs afforded to others. At the same time, local businesses have been disadvantaged by more red tape and compliance costs than ever before. Labor has introduced more than 20,000 regulations and only repealed 104, despite promising a one in, one out approach to regulation in 2007—another one of Labor's broken promises.


I recognise that café owners, fruit and vegetable shops, butchers, tradies and retailers are the backbone of the Macarthur community. Yet the Labor government is doing nothing to offer them the support they need and deserve. Businesses in Macarthur should be concerned about the revolving door of Labor's federal small business ministers—with the appointment of the sixth person to the role in six years. This is not a portfolio that Labor has ever taken seriously. Local and small businesses in Macarthur deserve better than a divided and dysfunctional Gillard government that is more interested in itself than the country. In comparison, a coalition small business minister will be included in the cabinet to ensure that small business interests and concerns are represented during decision making at the highest level.


I want to be able to see more and more local businesses in Campbelltown and the Macarthur region participating in the annual local business awards and, more importantly, achieve personal and professional success in sustaining and growing their businesses. However, local small businesses need a strong, stable and reliable government to give the community confidence in the economy—and a coalition government plans to do just that. Last year I held a small business forum with our shadow minister for small business, Bruce Billson, to give our small business people the opportunity to have their voices held. Shadow minister Billson and the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, have been talking with small business across Australia to understand what you want a coalition government to do to better support you. The coalition has real solutions for reversing the Labor government's gross negligence of small and local businesses. A coalition government is determined to double the rate of small business formation by cutting the carbon tax to boost consumer and business confidence and by cutting $1 billion worth of red tape out of the economy.


The government should be doing everything it can to help our local businesses stay competitive, because they are the backbone of our successful local economies. They employ more than seven million Australians, which is over 60 per cent of our workforce. They are significant investors in the education of young Australians and the sporting life of our communities. Therefore, it is about time the Labor government starting making the prosperity of local business a priority.

Ms Plibersek:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) As at 1 February 2013 Australian Hearing had 2,152 clients over the age of 26 with at least one cochlear implant.


(2) The Australian Government Hearing Services Program (the Program), funds free hearing aids and rehabilitation services for children and young adults under 26 years of age through the Community Services Obligations (CSO) component of the Program, and for Australian citizens or permanent residents who are 21 years of age or older and in one of the following eligibility groups:


Pensioner Concession Cardholders;


Gold Repatriation Health Card holders;


White Repatriation Health Card holders issued for conditions including hearing loss;


people receiving Sickness Allowance from Centrelink;


a dependant of a person in one of the above groups;


a member of the Australian Defence Force; or 


a person in an Australian Government Disability Employment Services Program and is referred by an approved Disability Employment Services Provider.


Eligibility to receive free hearing services under the Program is prescribed by the 



Hearing Services Administration Act 1997. 


Children up to the age of 21 years, and Young Adults aged 21 to 26 years inclusive can receive cochlear implant speech processor upgrades and replacements, and batteries and maintenance for their implants as CSO clients of Australian Hearing. 


For eligible clients over the age of 26 years, the Program supports the provision of cochlear implant maintenance and minor repairs through Australian Hearing under the CSO. 


The Program does not support the provision of replacement speech processors or upgrades, maintenance or repairs for those over the age of 26 years who are not eligible for services under the Program.
