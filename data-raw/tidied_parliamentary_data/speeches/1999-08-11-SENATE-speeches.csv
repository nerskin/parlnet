"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—Yesterday I addressed the Senate in reply  to the second reading debate on the bill before the chamber, the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 , and I would like to clarify for senators the fact that we do not have the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  before the chamber. We are debating the bill which will in effect deal with the referendum on 6 November, and without the passage of that bill the referendum cannot take place. Consequential to any move to a republic is the passage of the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999, which I have mentioned. I note that Senator Brown has moved amendments to the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill, but that bill is not before us at this time.
I can say, however, that the government has considered its response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, and in that report there were recommendations in relation to the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999. The government proposes tabling its response, which sets out the government's attitude to those recommendations of the joint committee which deal with the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  and with the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999. We are covering two pieces of proposed legislation—one which is before the Senate and one which is not—but we want to 
 be able to tell the Senate and the community what we as a government will do in the event that we move to a republic on 6 November this year.
During the course of the committee stage in the debate of this bill it would be useful if we canvassed the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill as well. This is not an usual procedure, but we are dealing with something that is quite extraordinary—namely, a referendum dealing with whether this country should become a republic. There is nothing untoward about this; it is simply a matter of procedure and a matter I wanted to draw to the attention of senators. At the conclusion of my reply I will seek to table the government's response.
As well as that, I draw to the attention of senators the fact that the research which I mentioned in my speech last night was tabled. That was made public previously, but nevertheless it was thought appropriate to table it yesterday so that anyone who did not have a copy of it could obtain one for the purposes of the ensuing debate.
The government has amendments which I believe have now been circulated in the chamber. These amendments relate to the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 , which is the bill before us.
I conclude by once again thanking senators for their contributions yesterday and stressing to the Senate that the government is approaching this in an open-handed and objective manner and that it intends to engage in a full campaign to educate the community in relation to aspects of our current system, the proposed changes and the procedure of the referendum. We are taking on board the comments made in relation to informing the public. We realise from our research that there is some work to be done—approximately half those people surveyed said that they needed more information. More particularly we will be looking at those sectors of the community with a non-English speaking background, particularly Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. I conclude with those remarks, and I table the government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-08-11,"—I have today written to the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which is currently reviewing the recommendations by John Reeves QC on the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (Northern Territory) 1976, and also to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron. I have referred to the committee and the minister important evidence and documents from a recent Supreme Court of the Northern Territory case before Justice Angel. The case, Peter Julian Hansen v. Northern Land Coun 
 cil, raises additional questions for the committee's examination of the Reeves report and the administration of Northern Territory land councils, particularly the Northern Land Council.
The evidence presented in this unfair dismissal case, which includes documents subpoenaed from the Northern Land Council, shows that the executive officers of the NLC developed a sophisticated scheme to misappropriate moneys from the then Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account (ABTA), now known as the Aboriginal Benefits Reserve (ABR). The illegal and immoral actions of the Northern Land Council and its executive relating to this scam initially took place in 1991. Unfortunately, the Labor government turned a blind eye to proper scrutiny and supervision of the land councils for obvious political reasons.
These activities were nothing more than a series of corporate raids by some Aboriginal leaders and their legal advisers. It amounted to a scheme to gain control of assets in case the land councils were ever to be taken out of legislative existence. The scheme revolved around the purchase of a building in Darwin, Mitbul House, by the NLC and four regional offices in Borroloola, Daly River, Timber Creek and Ngukurr. It involved a complex creative accounting scheme and utilised a veil of companies and trusts.
A dummy organisation with charitable status was set up, called the North Australian Aboriginal Corporation (NAAC). This organisation channelled  the misappropriated funds from the ABTA through the North Australian Investment Corporation (NAIC), acting as a trustee through the Northern Australian Aboriginal Charitable Trust (NAACT). A sum of $1,667,726 was initially misappropriated from the ABTA and used to purchase Mitbul House, the current NLC offices. A further sum of approximately $500,000 was misappropriated and relates to the regional offices. Let me quote from the chronological review of trial evidence by the plaintiff's lawyers, which was submitted to Justice Angel:
At 23/7/91
 ""Between this date and 31 December 1991, in breach of s.35(1) and s.36 of Aboriginal Land 
 Rights (NT) Act, the Defendant paid $1,667,726 of its available funds to NAAC (an inappropriate recipient set up by the NLC and NAIC and in fact a sham entity) being payments not approved by the Minister under s.34, and being $501,238 in excess of any payment that could be authorized by s.35(1), on any interpretation.""
The boards of these front organisations were largely composed of the same people and, astoundingly, this is even acknowledged in the 1991-92 Northern Land Council annual report with the following line:
The members of N.A.A.C. are the Trustees of the North Australian Charitable Trust and the Trustees of the Trust are the Directors of the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation (N.A.I.C.).
The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs at the time, the Hon. Robert Tickner, gave specific instructions regarding the use of surplus funds from the ABTA and, unfortunately, the NLC executive actively conspired to deceive the minister. Rent was charged by the NAAC to the NLC at the rate of $340,000 per annum, a further misuse of moneys which should have been going to Aboriginal people throughout the Northern Territory for their benefit.
But, in a further damning indictment of these sham organisations, the directors of the NAAC—of which Mick Dodson was one—approved the rental moneys that the NAAC received from the NLC being treated as a grant to the Northern Aboriginal Investment Corporation (NAIC). Let me quote again from the trial evidence:
""No more cogent evidence of NAAC's sham character could be adduced. The defendant's ""rent"", in the order of $340,000 per annum, did not begin until 1/7/91 and this record clearly shows that from that date the Defendant paid its ""rent"" to NAIC not to NAAC and even more importantly NAIC treated the money as belonging to it.""
It is interesting to note the conflicts of interests of many NLC officials. Mick Dodson—who subsequently became Labor's appointed Social Justice Commissioner—as director of the NLC played a big hand in this scheme. He was aware of it, he condoned it and he worked actively with others to achieve it.
Another of those whom Mr Dodson worked with was his mentor and predecessor as director of the NLC, Mr John Ah Kit. Mr Ah 
 Kit, now the member for Arnhem in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, was the director of the NLC when the scheme was concocted. He is one of those responsible for this misuse of power and ABTA funds. Mr Ah Kit should resign from parliament, as the very people he claims to represent are those that have suffered due to the fact they have not received funds that are rightfully theirs.
I have recently called for the activities of the then, and now, Labor Northern Territory federal member, Warren Snowdon, and the Northern Land Council to be investigated by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. There is evidence from the Hansen v. Northern Land Council trial judgment that shows a close and improper relationship between Mr Snowdon and the NLC, particularly in relation to the drafting of correspondence for the NLC by Mr Snowdon and assistance during elections.
One wonders just how far this close relationship goes, what involvement Mr Snowdon had with the NLC in-group and whether he knew of any cover-up with the Labor minister for aboriginal affairs. If he was involved, like Mr Ah Kit, he should resign from parliament. The particularly worrying aspect of this scheme, apart from the obvious improprieties, is the fact that it took a Supreme Court case for the evidence to be forthcoming. At no stage was an effort made by any subsequent executive of the NLC to resolve the issue and return the misappropriated funds to the Aboriginal benefits reserve.
In fact, over the course of several years there has been an active effort by many at the NLC to cover up this conspiracy. This is a despicable state of affairs and those involved should hang their heads in shame. The hypocrisy of these so-called Aboriginal leaders is absolutely breathtaking. They should apologise to their Aboriginal constituency in the Northern Territory for the wrong that they have bestowed on them. This is not simply a case of money being misused and abused by those who felt they did not need to be accountable to anyone, including their own people, but much more. It is an example of the misuse of `surplus' funds leading to the need for subsequent budget and staff cuts, 
 with a resultant lack of service to the NLC's constituency—the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.
It is an example of Aboriginal leaders and their policy advisers misleading their own people and doing what they think is best for them—paternalism at its worst. Worst of all, it is an example of people in positions of power abusing a trust that is placed in them to serve honourably. It is a pity that this type of thing makes it much more difficult for honest Aboriginal leaders to overcome the stereotypes and prejudices created by such crooks.
The matters raised in evidence to the Supreme Court now require urgent attention by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Further detailed inquiry must be undertaken as a matter of urgency to correct past breaches of trust and to ensure that the future administration of land councils is on a proper footing.
In his judgment on the NLC v. Hansen case, Justice Angel made very discerning and concerning comments about the honesty, reliability, motives and characters of Mr Mick Dodson and the former NLC staffer, now spin doctor to Warren Snowdon, Mr Tony Haritos. In his judgment, Justice Angel said the following regarding Mr Dodson's evidence:
Mr Dodson, whilst having the opportunity to refresh his memory from contemporaneous records of the defendant, did not do so. He lacked a memory for detail, was not as conscientious as he might have been, and I regret to say, on occasions, did not give honest answers.
This is extremely strong and damning language from a Supreme Court judge, particularly when it concerns a person of Mick Dodson's public standing—a former Australian of the Year and Social Justice Commissioner. With regard to Tony Haritos, then media officer for the Northern Land Council and now Mr Warren Snowdon's spin doctor, Justice Angel said:
Mr Haritos, a former employee of the defendant, was a biased and untrustworthy witness who was quite unreliable. I do not accept the truth of Mr 
 Haritos's evidence, save where it is consistent with the evidence of the plaintiff.
Yet again, that is a damning condemnation of a witness by a Supreme Court judge. Mr Haritos was obviously willing to put so much spin on anything that he was told, regardless of the facts, that it would have made Shane Warne proud.
I contend that the fiddled trust moneys should revert to the Aboriginal people through the Aboriginal benefits reserve and that Mitbul House should be vested in the ABR, where it rightly belongs. I table Justice Angel's judgment of 12 July 1999 and the plaintiff's written submissions and chronological review of trial evidence.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Administration of Northern Territory Land Councils</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-08-11,"—My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Trade. In view 
 of the APEC meeting in September and the upcoming World Trade Organisation meeting in November-December, will the new protectionist Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, be offering to brief other APEC and WTO member nations on the virtues of slowing down the pace of tariff reform, as he believes Australia should do? Does the government believe that Minister Vaile will get international support for this view? How many of Australia's export industries are in support of Mr Vaile's preferred policy position?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-08-11,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that assurance. It is different from what Mr Vaile told Laurie Oakes in his Sunday  interview. In view of that answer, is it still the government's policy to pursue the goal of `aggressive bilateralism' at the expense of multilateralism as outlined in the coalition's 1998 election policy? Does the government believe that aggressive bilateralism is preferable to trade multilateralism, and will this be Australia's position as it enters the APEC and WTO trade round discussions? How is aggressive bilateralism of more advantage to Australia's exporters than the opening of many markets under a multilateral approach?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-08-11,"—I think that Senator Cook might have misunderstood Mr Vaile's position in this matter. Mr Vaile obviously reflects the government's position—and that is that ongoing trade liberalisation is in Australia's interest. We are burdened by trade barriers in our markets, and the more they can be reduced, the better off Australia is going to be. I even recall that being a position advocated by Senator Cook when he was the minister in this area, so he will be pleased to hear my answer in that regard. At the forthcoming trade discussions Australia will be taking the position that further liberalisation should be encouraged and supported, and we will be endeavouring to persuade others to that position.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-08-11,"—Regrettably, again I fear that Senator Cook has misread or misunderstood the government policy. Government policy is to take all opportunities to reduce trade barriers and open markets—whether it can be achieved on a bilateral basis or on a 
 multilateral basis. What the coalition did say was that the previous government, of which Senator Cook was a member, erred in putting too much emphasis upon multilateralism at the expense of taking full opportunity under bilateral occasions as they present. In its bilaterals this government has vigorously sought—and I think Senator Cook need only refer to the record of Mr Fischer in this regard—to open markets at each and every opportunity as it has presented. Through the WTO and other venues, it has similarly sought to persuade a broadscale opening of markets. So it just requires a correct interpretation of the policy.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-08-11,"—My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Vanstone. Would the minister advise the Senate of the current status of Australia's efforts to get Christopher Skase to answer the criminal charges against him in an Australian court?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,"<title>Skase, Mr Christopher</title>",Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-08-11,"—I thank Senator Payne for her question. As all senators know, Mr Skase has been the subject of serious criminal charges—company and bankruptcy charges—under Australian law since 1991. A number of warrants have been issued by Australian courts for his arrest, and those warrants remain active. The Australian government is committed to bringing him back to Australia to face these charges. Given the failure of the previous government's attempts to extradite Mr Skase from Spain in 1994, we know our best shot at bringing Mr Skase back to Australia is if he leaves Spain for one reason or another.
I would have hoped that this is an issue on which all Australians agree. We could all pull together on this. At least in this instance, we could all be batting on the same team. We could hope that everyone at home wants to bring him home. After all, life is a confidence game. You would not want to think anyone in Australia would be giving confidence to the Skase team. However, on 20 July 1999, the Majorca Daily Bulletin quoted Mr Kerr—the opposition spokesman on these matters—as saying a number of things. Firstly, they quoted him as saying that `the only way Skase will finally be forced back to Australia is if new charges are laid'; secondly, that we, the Australian taxpayers, are wasting our money at the moment; and, thirdly, that `Skase will continue to run rings around the Australian authorities'.
If you want to give comfort to people who are overseas who think they can evade authorities, get yourself quoted overseas as saying that the Australian government is wasting its money and that the other side is a bit smarter than the Australian government. It is almost breathtaking, because these comments come from the man who was justice minister at the time the extradition proceedings failed. He was in government at the time. Now we can see why the then Attorney-General would not let him anywhere near the Skase matter: he would have messed it up even more than the Labor government messed it up at the time. For the people who gave Mr Skase a brand spanking new passport and who failed in the extradition proceedings to be now quoted in Spanish newspapers as saying that Mr Skase will run rings around Australian authorities is somewhat breathtaking.
Who does Mr Kerr think he is? He goes on and says that we are wasting our money. He does not seem to understand—the proceedings in Spain are between the Spanish government and Mr Skase. We are not funding these proceedings. It is just ludicrous. He does not even understand that much. As to the suggestion that new charges should be laid, Mr Skase would have to commit some new offences. You cannot charge people with something for the fun of it. New charges were laid in 1997, I think, but they related to the same criminal conduct. There can be no new extradition proceedings—Mr Lavarch, as Attorney-General, clearly understood that. We are not wasting taxpayers' money, and Mr Skase is not running rings around Australian authorities. The only upsetting thing is that we have headlines like `Chase for Skase Waste of Money' in the Majorca Daily Bulletin. That undermines the confidence of Spanish authorities in our determination to chase Skase, and it gives a boost to Mr Skase and to all his clan of hangers-on. My view is that Mr Beazley should bite the bullet now and sack Mr Kerr, because he does not understand his job.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,"<title>Skase, Mr Christopher</title>",Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-11,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
(1)	 That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Constitution Alteration (Preamble) 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
(2)	 That standing order 110 be suspended to enable the third reading of the bill to be passed without a roll call.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1999 SPRING SITTINGS
CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999
Purpose of the proposed law
The Constitution Alteration (Preamble) 1999  would insert a preamble into the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The preamble would be located just after the title. Enactment of the 
 proposed law is subject to the outcome of a referendum proposed for 6 November 1999.
Clause 4 of the proposed law would insert a new s.125A into the Constitution to provide that the preamble would have no legal force and not be considered in interpreting the Constitution or any law in force in the Commonwealth or any part of the Commonwealth.
Reason for urgency
The Government proposes to put the proposed law to the people at a referendum on 6 November 1999 in conjunction with a question on whether Australia should become a republic. The cost of a separate referendum on the preamble would not be justified.
Section 128 of the Constitution requires that a referendum be held not less than 2 and not more than 6 months after the passage of a proposed Constitution Alteration. This requirement, in conjunction with statutory requirements for the holding of referendums that need to be met by the Australian Electoral Commission, require the proposed law to be passed by 20 August if a referendum is to be held on 6 November. The last scheduled Parliamentary sitting before 20 August is 12 August. If the proposed law is not passed by then, it will not be possible to have a question on a new preamble at the 6 November referendum.
For the above reasons, it is necessary that the Constitution Alteration (Preamble) 1999  be introduced and passed in 1999 Spring sittings.
(Circulated by the authority of the Prime Minister)
Senator O'Brien to move, on the next day of sitting:
That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services (Senator Macdonald), no later than 5 pm on 23 August 1999, the following:
(a)	 the report by Mr Stephen Skehill on the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Mr Laurie Foley to the position of Assistant Director Aviation Safety Compliance in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and all material considered by Mr Skehill in his investigation;
(b)	 all minutes of the CASA Board and the Board Safety Committee relating to the process of establishing the position of Assistant Director Aviation Safety Compliance and the process of recruiting Mr Foley for that position;

Motion (by Senator Allison)—as amended, by leave—put:
That the following matters be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in August 2000:
The progress and adequacy of Australia's policies to reduce global warming, including:
(a)	 the effectiveness of Australian policies to reduce greenhouse emissions, in the light of Australia's commitments under the Framework Convention on climate change, including:
	 (i)		 whether Australia is likely to meet its commitments under the framework convention December 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and the potential costs if it does not, 

	 (ii)		 the international response to the Framework Convention,
	 (iii)		 the development of an effective international and domestic emissions trading system,
	 (iv)		 the effectiveness of Australia's policies in comparison to international practice, such as emissions trading regimes and other measures,
	 (v)		 the level, and greenhouse implications, of the direct and indirect economic incentives currently offered to both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects,
	 (vi)		 the effectiveness of existing local, state and federal government policies and programs and their implementation,
	 (vii)	 the economic, employment and development consequences of greenhouse abatement measures, with particular reference to regional Australia and the differential impact on each state and territory,
	 (viii)	 the social and equity consequences of greenhouse abatement,
	 (ix)		 the effectiveness of industry programs and policies in actual emission reduction,
	 (x)		 Australia's contribution to global greenhouse gas abatement through export of alternative energy sources,
	 (xi)		 additional measures, including, but not limited to, carbon trading,
	 (xii)	 the adequacy and effectiveness of greenhouse gas emission inventories, and
	 (xiii)	 the potential for carbon leakage associated with energy intensive industries to countries not party to the framework convention;
(b)	 whether Australian government programs and policies, both state and federal, are sufficient to provide for the development in Australia of emerging renewable energy, energy efficiency industries, the more efficient use of energy sources, the implementation of new energy technologies (eg fuel cells, hydrogen), including:
	 (i)	 the effectiveness of Australia's efforts in relation to other governments, and
	 (ii)	 the potential of these technologies to contribute to a reduction in Australia's greenhouse emissions; 

(c)	 potential improvements to Australia's policies to reduce greenhouse emissions, in the light of available studies of:
	 (i)	 current and projected fossil fuel use in Australia, taking into account the effects of current greenhouse reduction policies, trends in transport use of fuels, the use of energy by high-demand manufacturing, and changes to electricity ownership and generation,
	 (ii)	 projected climate change impacts on Australian industries, such as fishing, tourism, agriculture and others,
	 (iii)	 estimated costs of such economic impacts, to assist cost-benefit analysis of various climate change abatement programs and policies,

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—Before we go further, I was just about to answer a question put to me by Senator Brown in relation to the question of the time of qualification and how it related to nomination. I dealt with those aspects of disability which would disqualify someone from being able to be put forward as a President of this country under the proposed legislation. The amendment is not designed to give politicians a 
 chance. It is designed to give a chance to a wider class of people, such as judges, people who are in the public service and teachers. That was really the means to open up that class of person and say, `Whilst we are deciding the question of nominations, we are not precluded from doing so simply because they happen to be a judge or in the employment of the public service.' It is not a question of getting politicians into the position of President; it is more a question of widening the choices at the time when nominations are considered. That is the government answer in relation to the previous amendment which has now been dealt with.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—I have a brief comment on what Senator Ellison has just said. It has been dealt with. I hope that my opposition to it will be recorded. Senator Murray was quite right when he said that it puts paid to the argument that this is an alternative which will prevent political appointments to the presidency. I simply put it this way: if there is a candidate, be they in the field of the judiciary or in politics, who is an aspirant to the presidency, they should stand down to be available for nomination to the committee and not just stand down when they know that they have gone through the process and been selected. Because of that situation, we are going to see in the future without doubt prime ministers nominating favoured members of cabinet to the presidential post and then having the people stand down both from the cabinet and from the political party. I do not think that is a good precedent. If somebody is really going to put their career on the line for this post, they should stand down before the nominations are sorted out by the Presidential Nominations Committee. That is why I opposed that last amendment.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I have great respect for Senator Brown, who has contributed much to this chamber, but it seems to me that the provision under discussion is a reasonable one. First of all, I think it is wrong for us to downplay politicians. As soon as I say that, everybody will say, `Yes, you're supporting politicians.' The thing to remember is that, by and large, politicians— 
and we have heard maiden speeches today and earlier in the week—come here with the intent of doing what is good for the country. The category of politicians, for a start, is not a category that should be condemned as such. If you look at their performance overall, they are a category that have striven to do well by this country. There are great examples of politicians in the past. The people who wrote the Constitution were, by and large, politicians. In my view, it would be wrong to make people give up a political allegiance before they had to. I can see nothing wrong with a person who is a member of a political party being appointed to the judiciary, as now happens, and then giving it up on being appointed, having been warned.
In other words, if we take the approach suggested by Senator Brown, people would have to give up a right, an entitlement and a contribution that they were making to the community to take the position. Once appointed to the position, they should—as this requires—give up allegiances which may in fact make them biased or give them the appearance of being biased. But I do not think that, simply because a person has been a member of a political party or a member of this chamber, the other chamber or any other parliament, they should be disqualified thereby.
I come back to the issue of the way politics works and the fact that there are forces that would prevent happening what Senator Brown quite properly raises as an issue for us to discuss. It is proper for us to make sure that things are done properly and appear to be done properly. This provision enables that to be done. I do not want to see us talking ourselves down, discounting the currency, as it were. Senator Brown, for example, makes an excellent contribution to the country. He is a politician. He has done much for this nation, and so have many others here. So I make the points that the term `politician' should not be a derogatory term, that there are political forces that operate to ensure that whoever is appointed is a good appointment—in a democracy, people are subject to elections, which are every three years in this case—and that there are protections in the 
 political process of an open society where everything is patent and out in the public arena, where there is accountability and where that accountability is impressed.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-11,"—I move amendment No. 5 on sheet 1472 revised:
(5)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (line 12), at the end of the paragraph, add:
		 ; (iii)	 the person must not have held office as President for more than one term of office.
As the clerk rightly points out on the running sheet, amendment No. 5 can coexist with the government amendment just passed. This amendment adds a stricture to the tenure of a President and therefore disqualifies any President who has reached the appropriate tenure term from being put up as President again. In the background of this amendment is an issue which probably needs a brief airing and needs to be noted for the record. That is the issue as to whether a member of the executive—which, whether a President is independent or not, he or she is, because they have executive authority—should have open-ended and unlimited tenure at the discretion of the Prime Minister of the day. To my reading of the proposal, that appears to be the case.
As we know, the tenure of parliamentarians is restricted by the process of regular elections which are set out in law. We know the tenure of the judiciary is restricted by age. There are very few situations where tenure is not properly confined and expressed. It is my view that it would not diminish the office or in any way harm the concept of a President—in fact, it would improve it—if their term were limited. However, this is not a recommendation from the Constitutional Convention. I do not think it is a recommendation from the committee. I merely express this as something about which we should be concerned as yet another flaw in this model.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—The government opposes this. It was not something which came from the convention model, as Senator Murray has mentioned. Furthermore, it was not a matter that the joint com 
 mittee raised in its recommendations either. It is a situation where a President would have his or her term limited to two such terms. I do not believe they need be consequential; they just have to be two terms in total. The government's view is that this could prevent a very popular President from commencing a third term, and that option should be available. It could also prevent a removed President being chosen again as President if that President had exceeded the limit concerned. It basically limits the flexibility of this. Flexibility is something that was commented on by the joint committee. I do not think there is anything to be had by limiting the terms of a President.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—It is quite the contrary; it increases the flexibility for the people of Australia. If we cannot provide a different President every 10 years out of the 18 million to 30 million Australians in the next 30 to 50 years, we are something short of flexible. I agree with this amendment. I think 10 years as a term for a President is a maximum. I am also very well aware of the way in which these terms can be potentially altered so that a real limitation is put on the turnover and the variety of presidents and on the input of the Australian people. The fact that this has not come through the Constitutional Convention should not worry the government. It has not found itself restricted in this legislation by recommendations from the Constitutional Convention or anybody else. It has taken it as a guide, and that is it. The fact that Senator Murray has come in with an extremely good suggestion should not discount it from being taken up. It is a good suggestion, and I support it.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—The opposition does not support this amendment, essentially for the same reasons as the government. It has not been part of the process that has been recommended through the ConCon or through the committee and we do not know whether it is going to be an issue at the end of the day—that is, as to whether a President will be seeking a third term. As the minister says, I am sure they will not be, but we do not see a need to amend the 
 legislation in the way suggested by Senator Murray.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—Yes, I am. I move Greens amendment No. 3 on sheet 1480:
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (line 30), at the end of the second paragraph of section 61, add ""or until the expiration of thirty days after the end of the term, whichever first occurs"".
This amendment is to ensure that a limit is put on the term of office. It is self-explanatory and again it is a clarification of the issue of turnover of presidents.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—The opposition supports this amendment. It adds a little bit to the machinery. Once again, it is not a matter of principle but one that makes it clear that action has to be taken before the term of the President is up so that following arrangements can be made. Thirty days is a fair period.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-11,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendment before us to impose a time limit of 30 days on the end of the term of a President where a replacement has not been appointed. As Senator Bolkus indicated, this has been a 
 topic of discussion and investigation by the committee. It follows the advice given by some distinguished witnesses before the committee, such as Professor George Winterton and Dr John Hirst and also my distinguished colleague, Senator Andrew Murray, in his submission to the joint select committee. We recognise that this amendment would substantially have the same effect as those that were going to be moved—but have been withdrawn—that would delay the vacating of the office by 30 days. To the extent that it is an incentive to future governments to set the nomination and appointment process in train early, we will be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—The government opposes this amendment and does so for a number of reasons. Firstly, this is a matter of detail not specifically addressed by the convention model. It is something which is perhaps best left out in such a thing as a constitution because it adds detail which complicates matters. Page 38 of the report of the joint committee—and we are talking about how the term of office of the President ends—states:
The Committee therefore agrees that there should be a mechanism to ensure that there is an occupant of the office if the nomination and appointment process has not been finalised before the end of the incumbent's term. The Committee recognises that this objective could be achieved in a number of ways, including by permitting an outgoing President to continue in office until the next President is chosen. However, the Committee takes the view that this is not the best option. Rather it would be preferable if a President's term of office were to end after five years, at which time the office would fall vacant.
The government's view is that the committee did canvass, as an alternative, the continuation of the incumbent until the replacement by the incoming President. On balance, it opted to fix the term at five years, saying that the office would fall vacant. It is preferable, the government believes, that that not be adopted. Under the proposed changes, a new President 
 could be chosen in advance of the end of the incumbent's term so as to allow a seamless transition. The process might, for one reason or another, be delayed. You would then have the situation where there is a finite term for the incumbent and you find yourself having the incumbent's term expiring whilst the incoming President has not yet been installed.
I think it is important that there be allowance for the incumbent to continue as it reflects the realities of the appointment process. I am not saying that that would be a regular occurrence, but you do have to cater for these situations and that is what you do in constitutions. I think the government's proposal that there be this seamless transition is reasonable. If this amendment were passed, it could truncate that seamless transition.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—I thank the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats for their support on this. I think it will actually encourage the seamless transition that the government is concerned to ensure and it will discourage a government which has not got on with the business of moving to the appointment of a new President at the expiry of a term of presidency. Again, it just clarifies the issue and prevents a government from allowing a presidency to continue way beyond the five years without any definite limitation. It is a good amendment and I am glad that it has the support of the other two parties on this side of the House.

(7)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 4 (line 31), omit the paragraph, substitute:
	 A person may not serve more than two terms as President.
I will be brief with this. We have already had the discussion about tenure. This amendment limits the tenure of the President to two terms as President. You have to take a philosophical view in these matters as to whether you believe section 61 should allow, as it does at present, an open-ended tenure or whether you believe a limited tenure is appropriate.
All of us who have read a bit of history know the difficulty of prying out of jobs people who may have become a bit aged, 
 infirm or incapacitated in some way. In those circumstances the Prime Minister would be obliged to eventually decide to dismiss somebody. It is far better from a practical point of view to have limited tenure so that those kinds of eventualities do not arise. I add those remarks to my earlier remarks as to the desirability of limiting the tenure of anyone who has an executive role and the kinds of powers—as limited as they are—the President may enjoy.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—The opposition opposes this amendment. Much of the debate over recent days has been about how easy it will be to get rid of a President; now we have the reverse from Senator Murray. He is now concerned that the President may be appointed for more than two terms. We do not think it is going to happen, but we also do not recognise the need to amend this legislation to ensure that it does not happen. It is something that did not come up at the Constitutional Convention nor was it a matter of major concern for the joint parliamentary committee. It is one of these issues which, I suppose, if the government were inclined to pick up would be a matter that you could incorporate in legislation, but it is more of a superfluous type of irritant and we do not see a need to support it.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-11,"—Similarly, on behalf of the Democrats, I will be supporting the findings of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum on this issue. I certainly appreciate the evidence given to that committee outlining concerns on this matter from individuals such as Mr George Williams. The nomination process is in many ways an adequate safeguard against some of the concerns that have been raised. For a President to serve successive terms he or she would have to undergo the same nomination processes with all the other prospective candidates. As such, he or she would be considered for nomination against the new publicly nominated candidates and would then have to secure the support of the Leader of the Opposition and two-thirds of a joint sitting of the federal parliament.
If the President had come to be closely associated with the government of the day and was therefore considered no longer neutral, it is unlikely that he or she would secure the opposition's support, for a start. The Democrats consider it unlikely that the nomination process would re-nominate a President for a second term let alone for a third or fourth or indefinite period. Therefore, I suggest that this amendment is not a necessary amendment and that it is perhaps an unnecessary fetter on the nomination process and the safeguards contained therein.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I would like to raise another issue here. This is a concept that runs through the American Constitution. It was brought in after President Franklin Roosevelt was elected four times. Up until that time the people had followed the precedent set by President Washington of filling the office for two terms only, that is, for two four-year terms. Senator Murray's amendment is reflecting that. One of the reasons for opposing this is that the President who will be appointed under this system will be quite different from the President who is elected under the American system. There the President has executive powers—is the executive—whereas here the President is to be a symbolic head.
Senator Murray interjecting—
—He will not have the executive power that resides in the Prime Minister, and that is the point. Under our system it is the Prime Minister who has the executive power that the President has in the United States. If the President is to have some executive powers, reserve powers, that is good, but he will not have the extent of the powers that the American President has, nor the full range of those powers, and will not be able to exercise those powers in the way that the American President can. It is important that, even though we are using the title President, everybody understands that the President we talk about here is entirely—I use the word advisedly—different from the President that occupies the White House in Washington. It is important to keep that distinction alive.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—Once again I find myself agreeing with Senator Murray. The Greens worldwide have had long debates about rotation, that is, limitation of the terms of elected representatives. At one stage in Germany they closed it down to a two-year term. They found that was not such a wise idea because it did not give the incumbents time to really get used to office before they were facing the door out. That, of course, is a limitation that is too extreme. To use in reverse the argument that Senator Cooney has just been putting, the Americans with an elected President moved to change their constitution to limit the elected President to two terms. Here we have got a non-elected President, because the direct election option is not being given to the people of Australia, and we are saying that we should not limit that to two terms. I do not go along with that. I think that Presidents will certainly have varying degrees of popularity and some of them are going to be extremely popular, but that is not to say that at any given time in this nation there will not be a range of other extraordinarily accomplished and potentially very popular people as well.
I think the office of President is going to be one that will be greatly honoured by its incumbents and I think it is in the interests of the nation that at least every 10 years we allow another citizen to take that high office. To not do so is to move in the direction of stultification. By the way, as with the United States, those Presidents who have served their five- or 10-year term in office are going to be part of the group of elder statespeople, if you like, of the nation. They will continue to have their influence and they will continue to be honoured. But I think the moving aside once a decade for a new face is an extremely healthy thing, and I support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—The government opposes this amendment on grounds previously outlined. I would agree with the comments made by Senators Bolkus and Cooney. I might point out that the committee in its report at page 37 stated:
The Committee accepts that there are good policy reasons for permitting a person to serve more than one term as President. It also notes that the process set out in the Republic Bill for the selection and appointment of the President involves a number of steps and requires input from a number of persons and bodies. It therefore considers that, in order to ensure that the best candidate is ultimately appointed, the process should incorporate maximum flexibility.
What we have here is a situation where the President serves a term and would then have to be reappointed through the appointment process. That is a safeguard against any situation where there might be just a rubber-stamping of the return of the President. That President would have to go through a process and would succeed only if he or she had bipartisan support. Leaving it open-ended does not pose any risk, because of that requirement of appointment at the conclusion of each term.
Furthermore, the question of flexibility arises, and this does allow flexibility. It does not say that after a period of time you are not eligible to return to office or to run again for that office. If the people want you, they can have you. A comparison to the United States President I do not think is really appropriate, because we are dealing with two very different creatures, if you like. The President who is being envisaged for Australia is not one who has the same powers or manner of election as the President of the United States. They are very different roles indeed. This is a role for Australia where the people of Australia might want to have someone there for three terms. If they do not, that person would not be reappointed. The community opinion would be gauged by the Prime Minister of the day and the Leader of the Opposition. For those reasons, the government opposes this amendment.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—The people of Australia are not empowered to vote for the President. Let us get this straight. We are here dealing with a system where the ultimate appointment is by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition; it is a political appointment. The big parties might live to rue the day they turned down this sensible amendment. After two terms, if they 
 want to change the President and do not select a renominating President, it is going to be seen as a political act extraordinaire to remove the President, effectively, and put someone else in place. I would have thought that this is a very sensible move. I do not think it has been well thought out by the big parties. I think it is in their interests.
The last argument that can be resorted to here is that the Australian people will at some stage or other want to have the President kept in office because she or he is popular. I reiterate that that is not going to be their prerogative. That option is not what we are dealing with. We are dealing with a system where ultimately the Prime Minister puts forward the nomination and has to get the agreement of the Leader of the Opposition. I think under those circumstances it is even more important that we have some end of tenure so that there is a smooth and politics minimised—it cannot ever be politics free—turnover of Presidents at least once a decade. I put it to both the Labor Party and the coalition that they should reconsider.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—Opposition amendment No. 4 is actually in the same category as the previous amendment. It is one that we would have liked to have seen accepted by the government. It does not really add a great deal. It adds the words `as soon as practicable after the removal but in any event not later than 30 days'. At the moment there is a requirement that there has to be report back to parliament no later than 30 days. We thought it was important to try and make that as soon as practicable after the removal and not have the Prime Minister or the government wait for 30 days. However, it would seem as if the government is not prepared to pick this amendment up, and as a consequence we do not see any real value in pursuing it. As I say, it fits in the category of a minor amendment and not one that really affects the structure of things in a great way.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-11,"—I move:
(R2)	 Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (lines 4 to 16), omit section 62, substitute:
62  Removal of President
	 The Prime Minister may, by instrument signed by the Prime Minister, remove the President on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity, with effect immediately.
	 A Prime Minister who removes a President must, within thirty days after the removal, seek the approval for the removal of the President of two-thirds of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives in a joint sitting, unless:
			 (i)	 within that period, the House of Representatives expires or is dissolved; or
			 (ii)	 before the removal, the House of Representatives had expired or been dissolved, but a general election of members of that House had not taken place.
	 The failure of a two-thirds majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to approve the removal of the President does not operate to reinstate the President who was removed.
It gives me great pleasure to move this amendment on behalf of the Australian Democrats. That is because we believe it seeks to restore the Senate to its rightful role in the dismissal process and to give protection to the President in an Australian republic.
The amendment before the chamber offers similar protection to a President as is currently afforded federal judges under section 72 (ii) of the Constitution. The President of an Australian republic would otherwise be placed in the invidious position of being able to be dismissed by the Prime Minister without a stated cause. Much was made of this issue at the 1998 Constitutional Convention—as I said in my address to the Senate last night—and of the need to balance the powers of the Prime Minister and the President. The Democrats have concluded that the power is very much weighted in favour of the Prime Minister. It is not only our opposition that supports this analysis, it is the view of a number of prominent witnesses before the select committee; that is, the balance is tipped too far in favour of the Prime Minister, potentially undermining and undervaluing the role of an Australian President.
The Democrats are conscious of the safeguards that are in this model which the committee sought to strengthen in some ways. But we do not believe that the requirement, that a Prime Minister who dismisses the President must seek the ratification of a majority of the House of Representatives within 30 days, is an adequate protection against a politically motivated or peremptory dismissal. It would be highly unlikely—and I would be very surprised if anyone in this chamber would suggest this—that a Prime Minister of the day could not command a majority vote in the House of Representatives. The Democrats believe that the lower house alone would merely act as a rubber stamp to the actions of the Prime Minister of the day.
So we think it is appropriate that the Senate be included in this process of ratification. That is a view which we have held for a long time. That is a view which we sought to have incorporated into this original model during the Constitutional Convention proceedings. Obviously, we were not successful. We recognise that the intent of these bills is to reflect as much as possible the communique, the outcome and the model that was voted on at the Constitutional Convention and so we acknowledge that this is a diversion from the model. But we think it is an appropriate diversion.
We are aware of comments from witnesses who gave evidence to the select committee that, in fact, they think perhaps a minority of delegates at the Constitutional Convention—this is perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, and I do not know if it is a bit presumptuous—would these days support a role for the Senate in that dismissal process. So we view that divergence—or diversion, if you like—as disappointing and unfortunate but we do believe that this model has undermined the role of the Senate as an equally representative and sovereign house of the parliament. We also believe that this undermines the security of the tenure enjoyed by a President. We are very keen, through this amendment, not only to elevate the Senate to its rightful place but to ensure a degree of protection and security for an Australian President.
As I have mentioned previously, we also seek to ensure that grounds for dismissal—that is, that a President can only be dismissed for proven incapacity or misbehaviour—be incorporated into this legislation, as well as the support of a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the federal parliament. We believe, and I have stated this a number of times in the last couple of days, that the Australian President will be a unique figure, a symbolic head of state—a constitutional empire—and that we should not seek to undermine or undervalue in any way these important qualities.
If the Senate is left out of the dismissal process, we would be doing that. Similarly, if we fail to give appropriate constitutional protection to an Australian head of state or afford the security that we give to, say, Federal Court judges, the importance of that office will be underestimated and potentially undervalued. So we think there are natural justice principles as well as other important principles in relation to democracy and the role of the two houses of parliament. That is what we seek to do through the Democrat amendment to this legislation. I do hope, especially because we are debating this in the Senate chamber, that government and opposition senators will respect their office—and the chamber in which we all work and legislate—and consider supporting the Democrats in this endeavour.
—I would just clarify, Senator, that you have moved amendment No. 2 on revised sheet 1474. Is that correct?
—Yes.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—The opposition opposes this amendment. This issue was deliberated upon at length at the Constitutional Convention last year and was canvassed by the joint parliamentary committee as well. It is obvious that a different form of dismissal was embraced by both those forums and it is that form of dismissal that the opposition also supports here today.
The proposal put up by the Democrats once again gives us the gridlock situation. It means a substantial shift in the balance of power 
 from where it is now and basically has deep-seated implications for our constitutional system. Basically, the Democrats would like the approval of a two-thirds majority, not just of the House of Representatives; they want a joint sitting. They want to ensure that the Senate has power in the process as well. That does, in a sense, provide for the buttressing of a President who may be keen to take on a Prime Minister and a government. But you just cannot read this amendment on sheet 1474 in isolation from the rest of the Australian Constitution to which the words of this amendment are sought to be added.
Basically, under the Constitution, we have the powers of the current Governor-General, reserve powers and the like, and in a sense those powers would also be buttressed by the impact of this particular amendment. As the Constitutional Convention did, we see this sort of proposal as leading very quickly to a substantial shift in the power balance. Like the ConCon and the government, the opposition is keen to ensure that we do not move from a position of a ceremonial head of state—President or Governor-General—to a situation where the President might have powers buttressed by a Senate which is more keen to cause political havoc than it is interested in the ordinary affairs and transitions of government. We oppose this amendment and, unfortunately, we cannot support you at this time, Senator Stott Despoja.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—There are three similar amendments here. There is the Democrat one that Senator Stott Despoja is putting forward, there is an amendment from Senator Murray and then there is the Australian Greens amendment, which I have put forward. All of them involve the Senate in the dismissal process. So it should be. The Senate is involved in the appointment of the President through the requirement for a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of both houses. The Senate should be involved in a dismissal, should that unhappy event come to reality.
Cloaked in what we are hearing yet again from the government and the opposition is the wish to concentrate powers ostensibly in the representatives, but that sheets it right home 
 to power, in particular, in the office of the Prime Minister and in the office of the Leader of the Opposition. They already have an extraordinarily powerful position in the process of appointment of the President. I think it is extraordinarily important that there be a whole-of-parliament approach to the dismissal of the President. I will support each of these proposals, but it worries me greatly that the Labor Party is not going to.
I think the people of Australia would want us to support it as well, just as the people of Australia support very strongly the retention of the Senate and the powers of the Senate. I cannot help but think that the big parties are very happy to have the Senate involved in the two-thirds vote for the appointment of a President because it gives some validity to the naked reality—which is that, in the main, it is going to be left to the offices of Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition to make that appointment.
When it gets to the dis-appointment of the President—the dismissal of the President—they do not need that cloak of respectability of involving the Senate anymore, so the process is to knock it out. Senator Stott Despoja is right. The Senate should be involved in both the appointment and a dismissal if it occurs. One of these three formulas should be used. They involve either a joint sitting with a two-thirds majority, as in Senator Stott Despoja's amendment, which is the same as the appointment process, or the houses separately coming to the conclusion that, due to misbehaviour or incapacity, a President ought to be removed from office.
Unfortunately, there is the need for a dismissal process. There is not the need for the power to be concentrated at that time in the hands of the two offices of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I support this motion. If this fails, I will be supporting the one from Senator Murray and, if that does not succeed, I will, of course, be supporting my own motion on behalf of the Australian Greens.
I also say to the opposition and to the pro-republican members of the coalition that, by not adopting one of these alternatives which involves the two houses of parliament approv 
 ing the dismissal of a President, you will make the campaign that much more vulnerable. This is its most vulnerable point. The Prime Minister made that clear the other night. He is already onto it. He made a road with potholes in it and his job now, as a monarchist and an opponent of this nation becoming a republic, is to try and make those potholes appear as deep as possible. I have criticised him before for his role in the process.
I say to the Labor opposition that this is the biggest pothole of the lot. If the campaign were not to succeed because of concentration on this dismissal process, be that on your heads. I think you are wrong. The Senate should be involved if Australia finds itself in the terrible situation of having to dismiss a President. It is as simple as that.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I understand what Senator Brown is saying. He is saying that, as the debate about the republic is presently situated, what is in this amendment is something that the Australian people would find attractive. However, when we are arguing the issue of the constitutional framework in which the country is going to go ahead, we really have to look at what is going to give good government that will be properly scrutinised and kept in check by a parliament. As Senator Stott Despoja said, this President is a symbolic figure with, as Senator Murray said, some—but really very little—executive powers. It is a model that is quite distinct from the situation in the United States of America. This particular amendment is based on the concept that the President-to-be in Australia would be like an American President. It would not.
Senator Stott Despoja said that we have provisions to protect judges. But that is a different issue, because judges are people who make decisions which have far-reaching consequences for governments and other people who come before them. They must have tenure of position because they are making decisions which clearly are going to be unpopular—at least with one side—and they are going to make decisions between states, between the Commonwealth and the states and between other people. It is funda 
 mental to the proper democratic functions of government that judges be secure.
To use Senator Stott Despoja's words, a symbolic figure is not in that position; a symbolic figure is there to personify the good things about the country. The executive power, whether we like it or not, is with the Prime Minister. Yet the argument goes forward on the basis that somehow that is wrong—it is all right for a President to have executive powers but not for a Prime Minister. That really is an argument to change the whole system of government under which we now operate—to change what is called the Westminster system into the system that operates in America. And we cannot have that concept going around without a lot more debate than we presently have had.
We argue about the effect of what is called the lack of security for the President, but it has to be looked at in the general framework of the balancing of powers. Under section 59 of this bill, the President has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister, which was done in 1975 and caused at that time all sorts of consequences and all sorts of problems. So we must decide as a nation where we are going to repose our power. The United States says it should be with the President; we say it should be with the Prime Minister, subject to all the consequences. The Prime Minister will be appointed or otherwise, depending upon the numbers in the House of Representatives. That is a matter of reality.
If we raise the status of the President above what will give a proper balancing of powers within the community then we have some trouble. That point has been made again and again. I speak now in respect of the amendment put forward by Senator Stott Despoja. Why go through all that trouble, when this appears in the amendment, at least on the sheet that I have? It finishes off:
The failure of a two-thirds majority of the total number of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to approve the removal of the President does not operate to reinstate the President who was removed.
So we go through all this crisis for no outcome of any consequence. If the Prime Minister seeks to dismiss the President under 
 the scheme put forward here by Senator Stott Despoja, what is to stop the Senate and the House of Representatives talking about that and criticising the government about that as it is? So to a certain extent this amendment attacks a straw figure—raises an issue which seems to give the House of Representatives and the Senate power but in the end does not, because the amendment finishes up by saying that the failure of the two-thirds majority to come to a conclusion that the Prime Minister is wrong does not in any way negative what he in fact has done.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-11,"—Many people think that the fate of this referendum will rest on the question. I personally think that the fate of the referendum will also rest on the failure of the Labor Party to accept one of these three amendments: that put by Senator Stott Despoja on behalf of the Democrats, which I fully endorse and support; that put as a variant on that by me; or that put by Senator Brown. I say that because there are three main groups of people opposed to this referendum question: the first group are monarchists, the second are direct electionists, and the third are those republicans who will support an appointed model but find this model fatally flawed.
Right at the heart of the fatal flaw is this issue that unfair dismissal is possible for the President—that there is no role for the Senate in that matter. Right at the heart of Senator Cooney's response is this very dangerous and scary scenario whereby we are attempting to move to reinforce an elective dictatorship. The separation of powers concept requires that the President or the Governor-General be as independent as they can be from the executive. If you put the President into the status of a junior minister, subject to  unfair dismissal, it is the Prime Minister in this country who has supreme and absolute power. And that is not a wise thing.
The Americans understood this problem and they took the President out of the parliament. The parliament is distinct and separate from the executive—and should be. The British—they are a cunning lot, the British—had the Crown, which was distinct and outside of 
 parliament, so the Crown devised matters so that elected representatives would have allegiance to the Crown, but always at least there was sufficient separation of powers to protect the people from an over-mighty executive. That is the thing that direct electionists fear more than anything. That is a thing which monarchists fear—an over-mighty executive. And when you allow this Constitutional Convention model to go through you are giving greater and greater power to the Prime Minister, whoever the Prime Minister might be in the future—and none of us in this place can foresee that.
That is why I say that this question lies at the heart of the possible failure of this referendum and the very real gamble the Labor Party is taking on this matter. If it were not for this dismissal issue, supporters of the appointed model who find the model fatally flawed might be with you and might get it over the line. When the Leader of the Labor Party, the very experienced Kim Beazley—from my state of Western Australia—puts his weight and authority behind this, if this referendum goes down I think it will cause some difficulties for the Labor Party.
In my judgment, this decision is a very material one. People try to tell us, `This is merely replacing the existing system.' It does not, because at the moment there is a third party involved in the dismissal of the Governor-General, and that is the Crown. There has never been a dismissal of a Governor-General, so we do not know how the Crown would behave in that instance. We can take a very informed and intelligent view based on likely precedent, but we do not actually know. Conceive a position where 49 per cent of the House of Representatives petitioned the Crown not to accept the removal of a Governor-General because it was done wrongly by an overmighty Prime Minister. Conceive the same position whereby maybe two-thirds of the Senate also petitioned the Crown on the same basis. I could not imagine that the Crown would not hesitate over accepting the advice of an overmighty Prime Minister to dismiss the Governor-General.
It is that sense of uncertainty, that sense that the Crown is ultimately there as a protec 
 tive mechanism for our constitutional system, which has helped give us stability and certainty over 100 years of Australian nationhood. That is why the monarchists support it. That is why the direct electionists have common cause with the monarchists. They want that protection. This model takes away that protection, and it is a fearful thing. That is why somebody like me, if these amendments go down, will oppose the referendum.
I cannot support enough the concepts here. Section 62 creates an unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister. There are no stated grounds for dismissal and no mandatory parliamentary oversight. Look at the protection that Senator Stott Despoja's amendment provides. Firstly, the removal of the President is determined on known grounds which are used constitutionally with respect to the judiciary. Secondly, the Senate is involved, and we have used the same mechanism of the joint sitting.
The other points have been well made by previous speakers. If the parliament is to be good enough to appoint the President, the parliament is good enough to oversee the dismissal. The parliament is the representative of the people, not the executive. I cannot stress strongly enough that I think this is the watershed moment for this bill and the prospects of the referendum going up or down. That is why, Senator Cooney, the government will oppose this amendment. They know that this is the linchpin which will guarantee the referendum failing.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-11,"—Thank you for that, Senator Murray. You say at the moment there is a separation of power. If you read the Constitution in terms of its black-letter law, that is hardly the situation. Section 1 of chapter I of the Constitution states:
The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called ""The Parliament,"" or ""The Parliament of the Commonwealth.""
Section 61 of chapter 2 states:
The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, 
 and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.
The Constitution says that the Queen is part of parliament. So she has legislative power to that extent. She also has full executive power under section 61. They are the terms of the Constitution.
If you look at it in those terms, you could hardly say that that mixture of powers, which has operated over the last hundred years, has brought about dictatorship. But what is going to happen under the new regime is that the Governor-General, as he is now, who would become President and take over the functions, is going to have a much sturdier base on which to stand because of the way he is to be elected. I say that because section 2 of the Constitution reads:
A Governor-General appointed by the Queen—
who, as I said, has a legislative and executive function—
shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.
She has power both legislatively and executively. The Governor-General can be dismissed at the Queen's pleasure. She has to act, as I understand the constitutional position, on the advice of the government of the day. You talk about dictatorship of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is in effect elected by a majority of the House of Representatives and represents the House of Representatives. Who elects the members of the House of Representatives? The people who elect the members of the House of Representatives are the people of Australia.
Every three years the Prime Minister is subject to that sort of check. When you look at the Constitution and the way it is spelt out at the moment it is not right to say that the way we are going is much less democratic. It is much more democratic. It might not be democratic enough. I can understand someone saying, `You have not gone far enough,' but the position of the President, as he or she will 
 become, will be more secure under the new scheme than the old.
—That is rubbish.
—Senator Murray, can you explain to me what sections 1, 2 and 61 of the Constitution mean if they do not mean that there is a very strong connection in the Constitution between the executive power and the legislative power of the Commonwealth vested in the Queen and exercisable by the Governor-General? What else does that mean? If you say it is rubbish, you tell me what that means in terms of the debates that were held during the 1890s.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-11,"—I will respond to Senator Cooney's question. Senator Cooney would know, because of the warmth of our relationship, that the shouting of `That is rubbish' was not aggressively intended.
I will simply encapsulate it in this manner. The proposal says that the Prime Minister can dismiss the President out of hand, immediately. He will give that President a letter and at that instant that person is dismissed. It is an immediate, one-to-one transaction. Of course, I understand what the Constitution says about the present relationships between the various sectors of the executive, but right now if the Prime Minister attempted to dismiss Governor-General William Deane he would have to ask the Queen of Australia's permission. There is no `instant' about it. She could take a day, a week, a month, a year. There is no time frame in the Constitution which specifies that she must act immediately. We have no knowledge, no experience, no precedent of how the Crown would react if there was a hotly disputed dismissal.
I accept absolutely, Senator Cooney, that if the Prime Minister said, `This particular Governor-General unfortunately has a terminal illness which has affected their capacity to perform the job. They will not go. I must dismiss him or her,' the Crown would no doubt be extremely helpful in resolving the matter. But we have no precedent or understanding of how it would be dealt with if it was hotly disputed. The particular point is that there is no immediacy about it.
That is what the Labor Party fears. That time delay was what enabled the Governor-General to dismiss a Prime Minister. That is as it should be because a dismissed Prime Minister can go back to the people but a dismissed Governor-General or President cannot. That is the simple answer. That is why I responded in the way I did. I am sorry if it was slightly offensive. It was not intended so.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-11,"—No offence was taken, Senator Murray. People have been trying to struggle through this. No matter what position you take in this debate, everyone seems to have agreed that the Prime Minister is going to be the head of the executive. This particular amendment continues the position of 1975 whereby the Prime Minister can be dismissed by the President, as he or she will be. In my view, that is one of the great issues in Australian history. Those of us who were there at the time still suffer some shock from what happened in that period—or at least I do.
Instead of concentrating on the elected government, people are talking about a symbolic figure—namely, the Governor-General, as he is now, or the President, as he or she is to become. To me, it is a topsy turvy argument. It is all right to dismiss an elected government, but it is not all right to subject a Governor-General or a President to any force because he or she cannot be re-elected. He or she can be appointed again—there is no doubt about that.
The whole argument seems to be that the elected parliament, the government and the Prime Minister have a taint of evil about them and are not competent or able to carry out the duties they should, whereas the President will, by taking on that office, be sanctified in some way and therefore worthier and carry more weight, even though he or she is only a symbolic figure, than the executive which we hope will run this country.
In 1975 Australia was in near chaos. It was the steadiness of the people of Australia and the steadiness of the government that kept us going. To now say that somehow a symbolic figure, the President, with very limited executive power, should be elevated above the 
 system and that what we are proposing to do here will make us closer to a dictatorship than under the present Constitution is not right. Senator Murray, you have put forward some powerful arguments, as you always do. I simply say that I do not think those arguments, if acted upon, would get the result we wanted.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-08-11,"—I do not intend to speak for long. We are under time constraints. As I understand it, we need to get this measure through this chamber by 7.20 this evening so that the matter can be dealt with by the House of Representatives. Of course the time frame is governed by the proposed date of the referendum. So it is not my intention to speak for very long. I just want to put forward arguments that have already been put forward against the very great power the Prime Minister has in this particular area of the dismissal of the President.
There are a couple of things that need to be said, however. Senator Cooney mentioned the symbolic office of President. Yes, it is symbolic but the President also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister. I think the situation was outlined very cogently by Senator Murray whereby under the current Constitution the Governor-General would have a window of opportunity to dismiss the Prime Minister. Again, the Prime Minister could appeal to the people, as was stated by Senator Murray, whereas the new President could not if the legislation is put forward unamended.
I think this is a very important issue to a lot of  people. I do appeal to the Senate to ensure that the Senate has its rightful place. After all, the appointment of the President is not by the Prime Minister; the appointment of the President is by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament sitting together. If that is a method of appointment, why is that not also the method of dismissal? Furthermore, should we remove the Senate, the second chamber, from this process all together? The second chamber is a house of review, but it is also the chamber where the interests of the state are protected and promoted. Isn't it interesting that under the referendum legislation a referendum can only be passed if a 
 majority of people vote for the question in a majority of the states? Yet when you come to the question of the dismissal of the President the second chamber of parliament has no role at all. I do not think that is going to go down too well in places like Tasmania, for example.
—Or South Australia.
—Or South Australia, as indicated by Senator Stott Despoja. There are quite a number of people who have for some reason or another asked me how I will vote in the referendum. I am sorry that I did not speak on the second reading of this legislation. I thought that speeches on the second reading were going to continue to take place this morning. Unfortunately, I was not able to speak on the second reading. There are a number of issues I would have liked to canvass, including the question of sovereignty—the sovereign states or Australia as a sovereign state, a sovereign nation. In whom is that sovereignty vested? There are a number of other major issues that I would have liked to canvass.
I want to make it very clear that I am a supporter of Australia having its own head of state in the nature of a President. Therefore, I am a republican—I am a supporter of a republic. Yet this measure will be defective. Whether it will be so seriously defective as to influence voters in their choice when they come to vote in the referendum I do not know. I hope not. But at least I would appeal to this chamber to consider this matter very carefully indeed. I know you have, but you need to ask yourselves the question: is it appropriate to remove this chamber altogether from the process of dismissal when it has a clear mandate in the legislation to be involved in the appointment procedures? I offer that for what it is worth. I will not continue at great length because it looks as though things are a fait accompli, but I do appeal to those on the government side and those on the opposition side to give consideration to this.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—Senator Harradine has been reiterating quite clearly the point of view that the Greens and the Democrats are taking here. This is a sidelining of the Senate by the big parties. 
 Senator Cooney said a little earlier that, in effect, the presidency would be largely ceremonial. But behind this—the big parties getting together to block the Senate from being involved in the dismissal of a President—is the theory that, in some way or other, a President who is under some sort of suspicion or who is facing potential dismissal or real dismissal by a Prime Minister is going to go to the Senate to try to have that decision by the Prime Minister overruled. You cannot have it both ways, Senator Cooney. You cannot say, on the one hand, that this is a ceremonial post, in which case that would not matter, and, on the other hand, that the Senate ought not be involved because it can in some way or other thwart the wishes of the Prime Minister.
Both houses of parliament are involved in the appointment of the President. Both houses of parliament ought to be involved in the dismissal of the President. This makes the positive outcome of this referendum most vulnerable. The Labor Party will be responsible if it goes down, because of the argument that will be raised on this very point. I have told Mr Turnbull of the Republican Movement in no uncertain terms that his movement, the ARM, should be behind these amendments, because this does make the yes case vulnerable. But there has been an apparent failure there; there has certainly been no public support coming from the ARM on this.
I have made it clear, moreover—I share the home state of Tasmania with Senator Harradine—that the Greens will be pivotal in the campaign down there, not least Christine Milne, former leader of the Greens in the parliament, who was a delegate to the convention. I said, `Mr Turnbull, if you want the Greens to be in full flight in support of this positive outcome in the pivotal state of Tasmania, remembering that you do require a majority of votes in a majority of states, then make sure that the Senate is involved in the dismissal process as well as the appointment process.' I have not heard a word since then. I might add that we are going to shortly get to the need for a consequent convention, with the people involved, and I hope that we 
 will be getting more support there from the Labor Party.
The Labor Party are making a big mistake in not supporting any of the options which would involve the Senate as a safeguard in a process of dismissal of the President by a Prime Minister. It is the major mistake that the Labor Party are making in this process, and they cannot escape responsibility. If they were to support this and, indeed, if the Australian Republican Movement, the ARM, were doing its job on this, we would be getting a different result here and we would be much more assured of a positive result on 6 November. It is a real lapse by the Labor Party. I cannot help thinking that it is because of this feeling that the Senate ought to be sidelined. That is not what the people of Australia think.
It is all the more important that the Senate be involved here, because the option of an elected President is not on the table. We are talking about an appointed President, appointed by the two big political parties, by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, then getting the stamp of approval from a two-thirds majority of both houses. When the reverse process occurs—and that is when you have a crisis in politics—it is all the more important that the two houses of parliament are then involved. That is why the Greens have put up the option of having a majority of each house of parliament. It is in the Constitution, it has been there for 100 years—fortunately it has never had to be used—in the case of High Court judges misbehaving or being incapacitated. It should be the same for a future President. It is a necessary, commonsense safeguard and it ought to be supported.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-11,"—I wish to respond to some of the comments made about the amendment that I have moved. Firstly, I will not be holding only the Labor Party to account on this matter; I do not think the Labor Party is the only party culpable in this chamber. Clearly, the government—both the members of the National Party and the Liberal Party—had the opportunity to show their support for the houses of parliament by supporting the amendments before us.
I think it is important to put on the record that this is a changed position from at least one political party in this chamber, that in fact the previous models advocated by the Australian Republican Movement and the Republic Advisory Committee, which was established under the Keating government, allowed for the inclusion of the Senate in the dismissal process. So this is actually a changed position. At the Constitutional Convention I moved comparable amendments to these to include the Senate in the dismissal process; I was not successful. The numbers in the Senate and the indications from party representatives today suggest that again I will not be successful.
This represents a changed position from not only the ALP but also one of our foremost republican advocacy groups, the Republican Movement. That saddens me, because I am a patron of the South Australian Republican Movement, but they are aware of my differing views on this issue.
To respond belatedly to Senator Cooney on a couple of points, I agree with him on one point. I cannot argue for the superiority of the current system, perhaps unlike my colleague. I am not going to defend the status quo—I do not wish to. I think the model being proposed and some of the safeguards incorporated into this legislation in relation to the dismissal process are an improvement on the current system. For that reason, as many people know, I will be supporting this referendum. But I do not like supporting legislation that has some defects and that is flawed. Here is a perfect opportunity, with the amendments I move on behalf of my party today, to rectify that particular problem.
In relation to Senator Cooney's comments on the Australian head of state being symbolic, I am aware that I used that word, but I have also pointed out repeatedly that an Australian head of state under an Australian republic would be in a unique position of power. Not only would they perform the role of a symbolic and constitutional head of state but they would also be a constitutional umpire. That has been pointed out by Senator Murray, Senator Brown and Senator Harradine.
That brings me to the other part contained in these amendments on the issue of security of tenure and on the rights as well as the responsibilities of the President. We support the comments made by committee witnesses such as Mr Williams regarding the impact that uncertain tenure would have on the independence and the status of the President. We know the evidence presented to the committee strongly argued that the independence and status of judges, for example, had evolved from their security of tenure. That is why the Australian Democrats are equally anxious that the independence and the status of an Australian head of state be fostered and protected as much as possible. There are worthy comparisons between the role of judges as legal and judicial umpires, if you like, and that of an Australian head of state.
I come to Senator Cooney's last point—a good point—in his first contribution in this debate. Senator Cooney, I hope I do not misrepresent you on this. You looked at the amendments and noted that a vote by that total number of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to approve the removal would not reinstate the President. You would be aware, I hope, that this simply reflects the current provisions of the proposal. That wording is the same wording used in the proposal before us, which is supported by both the government and by Labor. This was something I grappled with at the Constitutional Convention. Was that issue of natural justice a dilemma? Is it a problem that, even if the President were dismissed and that ratification were not approved, that person would still lose their job? That is something that I have grappled with, but I think your bringing that up supports the inclusion of the Senate in the dismissal process. I hope I do not misrepresent Professor Zines, but I think his arguments also bolstered the inclusion of the Senate in the dismissal process simply because it provided further disincentive for the Prime Minister to embark on such a course of action unless he or she ensured that he or she would be supported, but supported by a majority and a more representative and diverse group.
Senator Andrew Murray likes to refer to this dismissal process as an `unfair dismissal'. 
 In many respects, he is right. The Australian republic's President would have the dubious honour of being the only public official in this country not entitled to rely on natural justice principles in the event of a move to dismiss that person, and the term `unfair dismissal' comes to mind. Not only would he or she not have the opportunity to hear or answer reasons for the dismissal but half the body responsible for the appointment of that person would have no say in that dismissal process.
Finally, Senator Bolkus said initially that this changed the balance of power. He used the term `gridlock' again in his argument—a point that was picked up by one of the witnesses to the joint select committee, Professor Galligan, who said:
All the more reason—
to involve the Senate—
because if it is that sort of stand-off between the houses, why give the whistle to one house?
There is a change in the balance of power. This proposal not only entrenches the primacy of the House of Representatives but also—as we have seen in earlier debates and unsuccessful amendments—entrenches the power of the bipolar political system, or the old two-party system, and the power of not only the Leader of the Opposition but the Prime Minister. We seek to move away from that. We seek to restore the Senate to its rightful place in this process. For that reason, I urge honourable senators to consider the amendment before them.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I thank my good friends Senator Harradine, Senator Murray and Senator Stott Despoja for what they have said. But Senator Stott Despoja said that the only person who would be subject to an unfair dismissal if this goes through would be the President. That is not quite right because the Prime Minister would be too, under this. I want to take up that balance. Given the power that the Prime Minister has and the sorts of functions that he or she is going to perform and given the power that the President will have if this goes through and the functions and power he or she will perform, who is more likely to want to get rid of the other? I would suggest it is 
 the President, because the President—beyond his or her power of dismissal—has very little power. The main thing is that he or she is a symbolic figure. The Prime Minister is the sort of person whom, as history has shown, a Governor-General or President might get rid of. As you say, there is no precedent so far for a Governor-General having been dismissed. There is a precedent for a Prime Minister having been dismissed. In the whole of this, that is to be remembered.
The last point that I want to make is this: you talk about the House of Representatives moving without the Senate, but of course the Prime Minister is made by the House of Representatives without the Senate. If you want a balance between the President and the Prime Minister, that is to be remembered. The Prime Minister is both made and unmade in the House of Representatives. It is true enough that, under this system, the President will be made in both houses. However, the fact that the House of Representatives will unmake him or her is not as bad as may first be thought, when you realise that the Prime Minister is subject to the same sort of process—except that, in the case of the President, two-thirds of the parliament has to dismiss him or her whereas, in the case of the Prime Minister, 50 per cent plus one can get rid of him or her.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—The government's position is that it does not agree with this amendment. This amendment shares some similarity with two other amendments that are to be moved. In this instance, the Democrat amendment provides for the Prime Minister to remove the President on the ground of proven misbehaviour or incapacity. A similar sentiment is expressed in relation to the Greens amendment. The government finds that this is perhaps both legalistic and vague. The question is one of how you judge misbehaviour. Is it justiciable?
In the United States, we have seen the conduct of a President come under scrutiny and there have been all sorts of conjectures as to whether that has constituted misbehaviour. There does seem to be something of a subjective aspect in the whole matter. There is of 
 course the involvement of the Senate and there has been much debate about that. The government has taken the view that this was not a matter which was contained in the convention model. Indeed, there was no recommendation by the committee that there be any dismissal, or removal of this sort, of the President by the Prime Minister. I refer to page 73 of the joint committee's report:
The Committee notes that the draft legislation substantially implements the dismissal model recommended by the Constitutional Convention.
I have just referred to that. It was, after all, an undertaking by this government to carry out the model as recommended by the Convention. The committee went on to state:
The Committee is not persuaded that any of the alternative dismissal mechanisms suggested was better than that contained in the Republic Bill. In particular, the Committee considers that the proposed `quasi-judicial' dismissal procedure, which is appropriate in relation to a judicial officer who must be independent of Parliament, would not be appropriate in respect of the President, who would be part of the executive arm of government. Furthermore, the Committee feels that most of the alternative dismissal mechanisms put forward would probably, in practice, be extremely difficult to satisfy.
I think that really sums up the position. For those two very strong reasons—that this is not contained in the convention model or one put forward by the committee—the government does not accept or agree to this amendment. In any event, there are aspects of both this amendment and the other—perhaps I am debating it cognately, but I think that is wise in view of the constraints we have on time—that approve misbehaviour, and that is something which I have said is perhaps both legalistic and vague at the same time.

	 The President may address a house before that house votes on a resolution to remove the President from office.
I advise the committee that I will take the vote on this on the voices. I believe we have had the debate on this issue so I do not intend to speak at any length. I merely want to point out that the addition I have put in this amendment to the wording put earlier by Senator Stott Despoja is that the parliament would appoint a commission to inquire into any alleged grounds for the removal of the President. To me that was the addition of a natural justice process. The second addition was that the President may address a house before that house votes on the resolution to remove the President from office, again a second natural justice safeguard, if you like. That is the key difference between that and the earlier amendment put, but I think we have had the debate and I will take the vote straightaway, if the committee so wishes.

This is the third alternative to involve the Senate in the dismissal of the President. This Australian Greens formulation would mean that the removal of a President would require the same process as is currently in the Constitution—and has been for 100 years—for the removal of a High Court judge who either misbehaves or becomes incapable, and that is that each house of parliament would have to vote to approve of that dismissal in the same period of the sitting of parliament. This formulation is taken, as I said, from the Constitution. Fortunately, it has never been used for a High Court judge. I hope it does not have to be used for a President in the future, but it does give a check on the executive. It does mean that the parliament which appoints the President is also involved in the dismissal. We have had the debate; we are not going to succeed with it, but let that not diminish the importance of this amendment. It is crucial, as far as the Greens are concerned, to this legislation.

This amendment at least puts some pressure on a Prime Minister, who now is given this extraordinary power to remove the President with effect immediately. It would mean a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister if the Prime Minister failed to get a vote in the House of Representatives within 30 days of that removal. This is an amendment to ensure that the Prime Minister does not ever undertake the dismissal of a President too lightly and knows that, if they were not to succeed in a House of Representatives vote, which Prime Ministers ought to be able to command, they in turn would be dismissed and the matter would be put to the people in an election. That would be the effective outcome of this amendment. It is a backstop amendment. It does not get over the problem of the Senate not being involved in a dismissal, but it does add some very important gravity to the actions of a Prime Minister and may have a sobering effect at least on a Prime Minister who is not giving due weight to the seriousness of an act to dismiss a President.

The government submits that this would enhance the technical operation of the bill.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—I move:
(6)	 Schedule 3, item 1, page 14 (after line 32), after clause 3, insert:
3A  Constitutional Convention to be held
	 Not less than three years and not more than five years after the commencement of Schedules 1 and 2 to the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 , the Prime Minister must convene a Constitutional Convention to consider, and report to the Parliament on, the following:
			 (i)	 the operation and effectiveness of the alterations of this Constitution made by the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 ;
			 (ii)	 any other matters relevant to the operation of Australia's federal system of government including (but not limited to):
		 (a)	 the roles of the Commonwealth, State and local governments; 

		 (b)	 the rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship;
		 (c)	 the need for the Commonwealth to have the power to make laws with respect to the environment;
		 (d)	 the electoral system and, in particular, the use of proportional representation to elect the members of the Parliament;
		 (e)	 the method for making alterations to this Constitution;
		 (f)	 constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation;
		 (g)	 equal representation of men and women in the Parliament;
		 (h)	 options for enhanced involvement of the people in the processes of governance.
	 Not less than two-thirds of the total number of delegates to the Convention must be directly chosen by the people of Australia voting as one electorate.
This is a very important amendment being put forward by the Australian Greens. It holds faith with the Constitutional Convention itself. It is a crucial amendment from the Constitutional Convention to ensure that a further convention would be held, two-thirds elected by the people of Australia, within three to five years after the convention last year and after the establishment of the republic. I might add that without this recommendation going forward the Constitutional Convention would not have succeeded in the outcome of recommending the republic in the way that it did. There were critical votes in that convention which depended on this further convention to look at the whole of the Constitution, to involve all of the Australian people and to look at sections of the Constitution not just restricted to the presidency, with a view to improving the Constitution as we move into the 21st century. I am moving this amendment in good faith from that convention. It is extraordinarily important that it be supported. It is an act of faith with those people who were disappointed with the options coming out of the convention.
The amendment opens up with a definitive type of time line preceded by an information and education program and then an information seeking program from the Australian people for further review of the Constitution. 
 It would be an act of bad faith for this not to become part of this legislation. It is not good enough to leave it to some other political mechanism; we need it built in as part of this legislation. To not do so is to not keep faith with those members of the convention who expected this as an outcome and went along with the outcome of the convention with this as a condition. So it is a very important amendment.
It would enable, for example, the review of the Constitution, taking into account delegates from all across Australia, on such matters as the roles of the Commonwealth, state and local governments. I particularly note there local government, which is currently left out of the Constitution. Another matter is the rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship. There has been a lot of talk of a bill of rights in this country. The United States has one and many other countries do; we do not. Another matter is the need for the Commonwealth to have the power to make laws with respect to the environment. This is crucially important for the majority of Australians, particularly in a situation in which the reverse is happening, where the Commonwealth is devolving laws away from itself regarding the environment at the moment.
It would look at the electoral system, in particular predicated on the notion of one person, one vote, one value in this country. Other matters are methods of altering the Constitution, constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation, the equal representation of men and women in parliament and options for enhanced involvement of the people in the processes of governance—that is, to improve democracy. These are very important matters, and I think it is incumbent as an act of faith that the government and the opposition support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-11,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting this amendment. We think it is important that there be another opportunity—in fact, ongoing opportunities—for Australians to be involved in the debate about constitutional reform and indeed modernisation of our Constitution. I think you will 
 find that Australian Democrats in this chamber and around the country have been at the forefront of a lot of constitutional debates and advocacy for constitutional reform. We have long favoured broad ranging constitutional changes. An Australian head of state and the move towards a republic is just one of those changes. Senator Brown has referred to everything from a bill of rights to the roles and rights of the states to the republican issue and reconciliation. There is a whole range of issues that we would like to see examined. We believe that extensive community consultation processes, as referred to in the Constitutional Convention communique, are also appropriate.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—The opposition does not support this amendment. In doing so we do not think we are breaching faith with many people at the Constitutional Convention. Labor has indicated its support for the concept in principle. There needs to be a greater understanding of the Constitution and the need for change to it. Opposition Leader Kim Beazley has in recent days specifically indicated that he would support this sort of concept, and Labor members, as did the majority in the joint parliamentary committee on the republic referendum, indicated support for this concept as well.
We think it is inappropriate to be put into legislation, particularly this legislation. However, we do think Senator Brown should—and we would encourage him to do this—move a motion in the Senate. We would support that. If you are to introduce this sort of concept in this legislation, once again you may find it may have some unintended consequences. For instance, the concept of delegates being elected by the people of Australia voting as one electorate throws in a snag which, once again, would imperil the chances of the main question being successful. If you are telling the people of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia that they will come at the end of the list of all other people when voting for delegates to this convention, you will minimise your chances in those states. They will recognise that there is no way that their combined population would match the popula 
 tions of New South Wales and Victoria. So, Senator Brown, there are some matters of a technical nature that need to be canvassed. I do suggest you pursue this as a motion in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—The government does not support this amendment. I might say at the outset that the Prime Minister's commitment to put the model to a referendum did not extend to the convention's proposals for other changes which are not necessary to implement a republic. Of course, the convention resolved that, if a republican system of government were introduced, the government should convene a further Constitutional Convention. This question, the government believes, is best addressed in the event that Australia does vote to become a republic. A further Constitutional Convention, in that case, would be one option that the government would consider as it looked for practical means of progressing the public debate on important constitutional issues.
The government does note that the joint committee did take the view that further community discussion on constitutional reform would be beneficial. I think the government would not take issue with that. However, it does not see its way clear to support the inclusion in this legislation of a further convention. It was just pointed out to me that a former French monarch, apparently Napoleon III, said he would be baptised by a referendum but would not live with his feet in it. That is a good point, because here we are looking at future change and future engagement with the people of Australia, which can be done by policy and not by an amendment of this sort which is casting it in concrete.
Through the chair to Senator Brown: we are not breaching faith at all. In fact, we are demonstrating good faith. We said we would take the convention model to the people of Australia and we are doing just that in the event that this bill is passed. That will be done on 6 November.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—Senator Ellison has got up repeatedly during the day and said the government was voting 
 this way or that way because the Constitutional Convention found in favour of this way or that way. But when it gets to the opportunity—moved by delegate Tim Costello, if I remember correctly, and seconded by Christine Milne—that the Constitutional Convention felt so strongly about,  that there ought to be further consultation with the Australian people, suddenly it is reverse gear. It is the same with the Labor Party. Senator Bolkus gets up and says, `Chair, there are technical difficulties with this.' Why aren't those technical difficulties being dealt with by the Labor Party right here and now so that this amendment can be got through? That is a cop-out.
The ALP, by the way, supported a motion to this effect put forward by Senator Margetts when we were dealing with referendum legislation back in March this year. But what happens time and time again with the big parties is that, when they get to the point of keeping faith—with having to consult with the Australian people and give a bit of power back to the electorate—faith is breached, and this is a breach of faith. Those people who were at the convention will know it is.
We would not be sitting here tonight debating this matter had this commitment not been made, through the convention, that a further convention would be held further down the line to resolve so many issues which that Constitutional Convention wanted to deal with but could not. `Yes, Senator Brown can move a motion in the Senate,' says Senator Bolkus. `Leave it to us. Trust us. Trust the big political parties.' Well, I am saying that if you have trust in the people, if you are going to give faith to the people, you would be supporting this amendment and you would have overcome the technical difficulties that you see in it.
In not supporting this amendment, Labor and the coalition are welshing on the Constitutional Convention outcome. It is welshing on the good faith that the delegates expressed at that time to get a resolution, part of which was this pivotal commitment to the establishment of a further Constitutional Convention. No wonder people lose faith in politics. No wonder people lose faith in the big parties. As 
 the government has done today, you just use the outcome of the Constitutional Convention when it suits you but you turn your back on it when it involves people getting a further hearing down the line. Why? Because the big parties want to keep that power to themselves; they want to restrict it to themselves. They do not want to be tied down by any commitment to a gathering of the people which was not totally under their control, much as that effect was attempted. This is a shameful outcome. It is a breach of faith. Again, it must make people wonder about the health of the big parties and the respect that they have for the people when they can break an agreement coming from a convention as important as this one. So be it.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-08-11,"—The government and the opposition are quite capable of defending themselves, but Senator Brown has accused the government of welshing on a commitment that it has given. Similarly, Senator Brown has indicated that the opposition is welshing on a commitment. We have heard from Senator Ellison that the government has given no such commitment. We have heard Senator Bolkus indicate that Senator Brown can move this sort of resolution in the Senate. Accusing people of welshing on commitments does not advance the discussion, especially when the government, for example, has indicated that such a commitment was never ever made. You suggest that this is a shameful outcome. Clearly that is not the case in respect of what has been said to us here by both the government and the opposition.
Serious questions have been raised in my mind about the matters that have been suggested in this amendment—for example, the suggestion of a bill of rights. The chambers have debated this on previous occasions and a considerable amount of concern has been expressed by members of parliament and others that the incorporation of a bill of rights, either into the Constitution or as legislation through both houses of parliament, tends to remove power from the people. That is, it tends to clothe judges in powers to make judge made laws—and judges are not accountable to the people. That is an argument. 
 I have heard that sort of argument over many years and I think there is some validity in it.
On another point on Senator Brown's amendment, I seriously suggest that the last sentence should certainly not be moved by a senator from a smaller state—a senator from Tasmania. As has been indicated by Senator Bolkus, leaping in uncharacteristic fashion to the defence of the smaller states—
—Where did I come from? Not far from Peterborough.
—I apologise, Senator Bolkus. We are grateful. The amendment says:
Not less than two-thirds of the total number of delegates to the Convention must be directly chosen by the people of Australia voting as one electorate.
I agree with Senator Bolkus that that certainly minimises the power and likely influence of persons from the smaller states and regions. I do not think that is appropriate, particularly in the Senate, which is supposed to be the chamber which protects the rights of the states.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—Clearly Senator Harradine was not at the Constitutional Convention. I did not draw up this outcome. The delegates at the Constitutional Convention did. Senator Harradine, I believe in calling a spade a spade. I also believe in honouring outcomes and not being selective about them. I have my own opinion on a bill of rights. Your opinion and my opinion do not come into this. It is the people of Australia who have the right to debate the matter and to have another convention look at that matter. The fact that it has been debated in this chamber over the last few decades does not put a halter on it being debated in the future.
—Yes it did. You are accusing me of something you did.
—You entered into this debate; you defend yourself. The fact is I am bringing forward in good faith a pivotal outcome of the Constitutional Convention and the big parties—and now Senator Harradine—are saying no to it. I cannot do any more than that. Let that be on the record.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—I move:
(3)	 Schedule 3, item 1, page 15 (after line 24), at the end of clause 4, add:
	 Despite the alteration of section 117 of this Constitution made by the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 , that section continues to apply for the benefit of subjects of the Queen who were resident in a State immediately before the alteration took effect.
This amendment is a somewhat technical aspect in that it provides continued protection for subjects of the Queen. This matter was brought up during the course of the hearing before the joint committee. I will refer to that part of the evidence which is relevant. On page 83 of the committee report, in referring to the previous amendment, the committee stated:
. . . the main objection was that the substitution of the term `Australian citizen' for `subject of the Queen' effectively narrows the scope of s.117 in its present form. Mr Jeremy Buxton—
who was from Western Australia—
stated that the
amendment apparently fails to recognise those `subjects of the Queen' who enjoy such rights of citizenship as voting in State and Commonwealth elections but who are not formally Australian citizens. These people will presumably lose the protection of s.117 that they currently have through this amendment.
I might just recap from there. Section 117 of the Constitution currently precludes a subject of the Queen, resident in any state, being subjected to any disability or discrimination in another state that is not equally applicable to a subject of the Queen resident in that other state. The republic bill would substitute `Australian citizen' as the most equivalent expression for `subject of the Queen' in section 117. The term `Australian citizen', although an appropriate replacement expression, arguably has a slightly narrower meaning than `subject of the Queen' in the Australian context. I hark back to the evidence given by Mr Jeremy Buxton in that regard. The government would maintain that the conversion to a republic should not remove rights already accrued to individuals under section 117 of the Constitution.
The amendment that is being proposed, therefore, would alter schedule 2 to ensure that the bill does not remove any right accrued under section 117 at the time of the conversion to a republic. This issue was addressed by the joint committee in recommendation 13, which recommended:
. . . that the Republic Bill be amended so that no person who currently enjoys the protection from discrimination on the basis of residence afforded by s.117 of the Constitution would be deprived of that protection as a result of the amendment to s.117 proposed in the Republic Bill.
I believe that this is an appropriate amendment. It is technical in nature. It is something that was not specifically considered by the Convention but, certainly from the spirit of the discussions at the Convention, I do not think delegates thought that in the transition to a republic any Australian should lose any rights thereby. I therefore commend the amendment to this chamber.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

(4)	 Schedule 3, item 1, page 16 (lines 1 to 11), clause 7 to be opposed. 

This relates to the amendment of the Australia Acts. In relation to this, the government would submit that section 7 of the Australia Acts should be amended as part of any move to a republic to rule out any argument that it entrenches Crown links at a state level. This can be done either following a request from all states or by constitutional amendment. The republic bill as introduced included a fall-back provision which would have facilitated the amendment of the Australia Acts by the Commonwealth parliament.
However, all states have passed legislation requesting the Commonwealth parliament to amend the Australia Acts if the republic bill is approved at the referendum. With that in mind the amendment removes that fall-back provision from the republic bill. This proposal honours the government's commitment to the states on the preferred procedure for amendment of the Australia Acts. The states had preferred that the amendment be done at the behest of a request from all the states, and that has now been done. Therefore, this fall-back provision is of no consequence. I would submit to this chamber that this is an appropriate amendment, one which has the support of the states and goes to the efficacy of the legislation and the transitional arrangements to a republic if it is voted for.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—We are now dealing with a new amendment which has recently been circulated. It is on sheet EE211 and relates to schedule 3, item 1 on page 16. I move:
(1)	 Schedule 3, item 1, page 16 (line 15), after ""conventions"", insert "", including those"".
This deals with the evolution of constitutional conventions. This is an amendment of a technical nature. Proposed clause 8, schedule 3, provides that the constitutional conventions in relation to the reserve powers are able to continue to evolve. This amendment will 
 make it completely clear that any other constitutional conventions will also be able to continue to evolve. These other conventions may deal with issues such as who advises the President in particular circumstances. This amendment will therefore simply confirm what the government believes to be the case: that any constitutional conventions in relation to the non-reserve powers will continue, and that these conventions will be able to evolve. This amendment will deal with the issues raised by the committee in its recommendations 8, 9 and 10. This amendment will make opposition amendments (1) and (6) unnecessary. I might just refer to recommendations 8, 9 and 10 of the joint committee. Recommendation 8 stated:
The Committee recommends that consideration be given to amending the Republic Bill to state that the conventions which currently determine the appropriate source of advice for the Governor-General apply in respect of the President.
Recommendation 9 then goes on to state:
The Committee recommends that, if Recommendation 8 is accepted, consideration be given to making specific provision in the Republic Bill to maintain the capacity of the conventions which currently determine the appropriate source of advice to evolve.
So those conventions which currently determine the appropriate source of advice will continue to not only exist but also evolve. Recommendation 10 states:
The Committee recommends that cl.8 of proposed Schedule 2 of the Republic Bill be amended to provide for the continuing evolution of all constitutional conventions, including those not associated with the reserve powers.
What we have is the continuation of the evolution of constitutional conventions, which is the case at the moment. They are evolving over time. They are in existence. This is a proposition which the government believes will maintain as much as possible the status quo in relation to these conventions. The government does not believe that this is inconsistent with the convention.

Senator Ellison is therefore right when he says that this amendment, if carried, would also replace an opposition amendment which was carried earlier in the debate. I indicate now that if this amendment is carried I will seek to recommit—probably immediately so we can do it all in one bundle—opposition amendment No. 1 and indicate that we would not be pressing that amendment.

8A  Justiciability
	 The enactment of the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  does not make justiciable the exercise by the President of a reserve power referred to in section 59 of this Constitution if the exercise by the Governor-General of that power was not justiciable.
This amendment deals with the justiciability of reserve powers. The government believes that this is an important amendment. The traditional view is that the reserve powers and 
 the conventions which govern their exercise are high political matters which are not justiciable. That view, however, has been questioned. Proposed section 59 of the Constitution is not intended to resolve the existing uncertainty. It has been designed to leave things as they are while keeping faith with the convention model and ruling out any argument that the reserve powers or conventions are lost with the removal of the Crown. This could be clearer, however. Clause 8A has been added to rule out any argument that the enactment of proposed section 59 of the Constitution would, in articulating a requirement that the reserve powers are to be exercised in accordance with the constitutional conventions, make the exercise of a reserve power by the President justiciable.
Clause 8A is intended to ensure that the changes made by the bill do not of themselves make justiciable the exercise of a reserve power that was not justiciable when exercised by the Governor-General. The government would say that this clears up the matter and maintains the status quo, again keeping faith with the sentiments of the constitutional model and recommendation 7 of the joint select committee. Recommendation 7 states:
The Committee recommends that consideration be given to including in the Republic Bill a provision which makes it clear that the amendments made by the Republic Bill to the Constitution do not affect the justiciability or otherwise of anything concerning the reserve powers or the associated conventions.
I would submit that this amendment is intended to put beyond doubt that the enactment of the bill does not affect the question of whether a reserve power may be justiciable and that the status quo remains.

	 1  After the heading ""THE CONSTITUTION""
	 Insert:
Preamble
Having come together in 1901, relying on God, as a Federation under the Crown, and the Commonwealth of Australia being now a sovereign democracy, our people drawn from many nations, we the people of Australia, proud of our diversity, celebrating our unity, loving our unique and ancient land, recognising indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land, believing in freedom and equality, and embracing democracy and the rule of law, commit ourselves to this our Constitution.
This amendment seeks to insert into the legislation the favoured preamble.
—The bill is coming in tomorrow so why not do it then?
—I will do it now because it is here. It is here as an amendment.
—Why not do it tomorrow?
—Senator Bolkus, in the spirit of goodwill, if the opposition would prefer me to hold this over until the morning, I will. We will also be dealing with the new government and Democrat preamble tomorrow. I would be quite happy to deal with it then. However, because this amendment is here tonight I would like it dealt with first 
 tomorrow. If Senator Bolkus can see a means of doing that, I would be happy to hold it over. I will make a couple of comments on the alternative preambles. This preamble has a much greater commitment to the relationship not only as custodians of the land—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. The suggestion I make, Senator Brown, is that we deal with this amendment tomorrow because my understanding is that the actual legislation will come before the Senate tomorrow. We may have a debate about it tonight and then have to address the whole issue again when the preamble bill is introduced in the Senate tomorrow. I am told it is expected that we will debate this tomorrow. That is why I suggest that we debate it not in the context of this legislation but in the context of the preamble bill, which will be before us tomorrow. I add that for Senator Brown.
—That is not really a point of order. I call Senator Brown.
—I think the alternative argument, Senator Bolkus, is that we deal with this amendment tonight so that we know where we stand. In the spirit of goodwill, let me say that, if the opposition is keen for me to hold this over until tomorrow, I will. I will speak for a few moments on the matter while the opposition comes to a determination about that.
There are two points I want to make. The preamble that the Greens are putting forward—and this is the one that came from Mr Evans and was discussed with Senator Stott Despoja early in the year—states:
Having come together in 1901, relying on God, as a Federation under the Crown, and the Commonwealth of Australia being now a sovereign democracy, our people . . .
This deals with the historic relationship between the Australian people and God at the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1901. It does not pass my notice that the current Constitution, in which we rely on the blessing of the Almighty, is very different to the wording of the preamble which has come up today, which puts hope in God. Goodness gracious, isn't it better to leave reference to 
 God out of the preamble than to descend from relying on God to hope in God?
I believe in a secular society like ours that it would be better if the first phrase in the proposed government and Democrat preamble were removed, and I will so move at the appropriate time tomorrow. I also underscore and highlight the difference between the preamble that I am putting forward and that which was released today, in so far as recognising indigenous Australians. The preamble released today does not have the strength and validity that the words in my proposal have, those words being `recognising indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land'. How important those words are. How much stronger they are than the preamble today, which says:
honouring Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, the nation's first people, for their deep kinship with their lands and for their ancient and continuing cultures which enrich the life of our country . . .
That falls very short of recognising indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of all our land. For those two reasons, I believe the preamble that I have moved to have adopted is better and stronger. It better represents the feelings of Australians. Maybe it would be worth the Democrats reconsidering this matter overnight, in particular with regard to the strength of recognition of indigenous Australians which is in the preamble that I am proposing here.
I will wait to hear what Senator Bolkus has to say. I think the timetable we have is much less important than getting the better resolution and that we stand by the better proposal, which I put forward on behalf of the Australian Greens but which I have no difficulty in attributing to the Labor Party and Gareth Evans and, more particularly, the hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians who, over the last couple of years, contributed to it through the process of gathering opinion on how they thought the preamble to the Constitution should be worded.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I understood that the preamble bill is being debated tomorrow. Senator Brown, we do not want to vote on this tonight in the 
 context of this legislation but would rather debate it tomorrow in the context of the preamble legislation. As you have quite rightly said, there is joint parentage of the preamble that you have moved, though some parents have abdicated in recent hours, if not days. I would suggest to you that it would be best not to proceed with your amendment now, but to debate it tomorrow. By that stage we will be in a better position to digest the issue and develop a different position. If you choose not to proceed with this amendment now, then we can proceed with the rest of the bill and tackle the amendment in the morning in the context of the preamble legislation.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-11,"—I support Senator Bolkus in that and ask Senator Brown to bear in mind that tomorrow we will have a discrete debate, if you like, on the preamble. Deferring it or not voting on it tonight will not limit in any way the debate on the preamble, Senator Brown, but it is perhaps better placed when the preamble bill is introduced, and the government would agree to it being debated then.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—I hear those sentiments and I concur. I think it is better that in that circumstance we do hold it over to tomorrow and have a preamble debate on the merits of the two options with the benefit of overnight thinking. I seek leave to withdraw the amendment, and in doing so I give notice that I will move this amendment effectively to the new legislation tomorrow.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-08-11,"—No, not at the moment. I think it is important to speak to some of the things that have been said by Senator Brown. Senator Brown is really indicating that he wants God out of the Constitution effectively. Senator Brown is moving a preamble which relegates God to history. If you analyse what is before you, that is precisely what this does. He mentioned the word `God' but he relegates God to history, because his preamble says:
Having come together in 1901, relying on God, as a Federation under the Crown, and the Common 
 wealth of Australia being now a sovereign democracy . . . 
He is referring to a historical event in 1901 when, he says, those people who came together relied on God—nothing to do with what we now should be doing. I think people looking at this particular proposal by Senator Brown should realise, as he I think admits, that he wishes to have God effectively taken out of the Constitution. We could discuss the matter but let us be very clear about it and not hide it by using the word `God'. He is actually using the words `relying on God' to refer to a historical coming together in 1901.
—Is leave granted for Senator Brown to withdraw his amendment?
Amendment—by leave—withdrawn.
—We now turn back to page 1 of the bill and the title. (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I move:
(1)	 Title, page 1 (lines 11 to 16), omit the title, substitute ""A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President"".
The committee now turns its attention to the central element of the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999 , which we as parliamentarians know as the `long title' but which the Australian people will become familiar with as the actual wording of the question on their ballot papers on Saturday, 6 November this year. As such, the set of words which is now before the committee will become the public face of the referendum. The Australian public understands very well just how important it is that these words accurately and fairly reflect the fundamental issues being put to the vote at the referendum.
For any holder of office in the Commonwealth government to propose a referendum question which is inaccurate or biased would, in my view, be committing a considerable disservice to the Australian people and to the Australian Constitution itself. The Labor Party believes that that is a very reasonable descrip 
 tion of the Howard government's actions in relation to the wording of the question to be put before the people later this year. The Labor Party will continue to stand up for proper constitutional reform in this nation, including the fundamentally accurate and unbiased wording of referendum questions. It is for this reason that I have moved this amendment on behalf of the opposition.
As I indicated in my speech at the second reading stage, Labor prefers the long title recommended by the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. The committee's brief description of the outcome of the referendum process was an accurate and a very well formed description. It is a long title born of compromise on an all-party committee representing all sides of the republican debate. It is unquestionably the fairest and most accurate description of the change that Australians are being asked to vote on. First, it says what we all accept; that is, if the referendum is passed, then Australia will become a republic.
Secondly, it provides a brief description of the type of republic that we will become. It says that the President will replace the Queen and the Governor-General. We believe that this is important because it distinguishes the type of republic proposed for Australia—if you like, a Westminster system republic where executive government is responsible to parliament, as opposed to the United States style of executive presidency. The committee's and Labor's version of the question focuses on the powers of the President—an issue that we believe is more important than the process by which the President is chosen.
Finally, it makes it clear that the President must be an Australian. As we know, the Queen is not an Australian; the Governor-General need not be an Australian. These are the reasons that we prefer the long title recommended by the committee. We are keen to see whether anyone in this place, particularly those who are proposing alternative questions, is able to explain to the chamber why they believe the Labor Party's amendment is in any way inaccurate or biased.
I turn to the preferred version of the long title that is being sponsored and supported by 
 the Australian Democrats, to what we understand will be the proposed long title of the Democrats. We were told during the Prime Minister's press conference this morning that the Democrats were not successful in changing the government's mind on this particular question. I have got to say that it seems to me that the Democrats did not fight very hard for their preferred option, and I think that does throw a little bit of doubt on perhaps their willingness to follow through with their stated agenda. I made what I believe were some generous comments in my speech at the second reading stage in relation to the Democrats' approach—
—That was out of character!
—I would have thought that it was in character, Senator Evans. But you are entitled to your opinion, which I doubt would be shared by many. I think I mentioned that, although we do not think that the Democrats' proposed form of the question is as good as the all-party select committee's version, we did indicate that we believe that the long title proposed by the Democrats is reasonable. I understand that the Democrats' preferred long title was considered by the joint select committee and was an alternative compromise to the one that was actually adopted by the committee. While it is not as good as the one ultimately recommended—because it only provides the briefest description of the outcome of the process; namely, that Australia becomes a republic—we believe it is accurate. It is not misleading. I do not think a reasonable person can say that it is weighted in favour of either side of the debate on this important issue.
I turn to the government's proposed version of the long title and the question because, in its present form, that long title is unacceptable. It is clearly biased in favour of the monarchist cause. It neglects to state that the President will be an Australian, which is an essential feature of the republican model that would result from the successful vote of the referendum. It describes only part of the selection process—naturally, the most unpopular part of the selection process—without describing the participation of Australians in the process.
This has been done to deliberately and cynically bolster the monarchist argument that this model will see the President chosen by politicians. This is rather ironical, given that our current Constitution vests the choice of Governor-General in the most partisan of all political figures—that is, the Prime Minister. Similarly, the current referendum proposal has built-in safeguards, again relying on the institution of the parliament, in relation to the termination of a President's term. Under the current system, as Gough Whitlam has noted on a number of occasions since 1975, there are no safeguards regarding the termination of a Governor-General's commission. As we all know, the necessity of having the Queen herself withdraw a commission is no effective safeguard at all. The Australian Constitution requires the monarch to act on the advice of her ministers.
The opposition has not seen or heard anything which can change our view that the Howard government's referendum question, in either the original form or the amended form, does not accurately or fairly reflect the proposed constitutional alteration. In this way, the government's proposal fails the basic fairness and accuracy tests for any referendum question. The inaccuracy and bias have been deliberately pursued by the Howard government with a clear objective in mind, and I mentioned this last night. The government understands implicitly that, in any form of polling, manipulation of the framing of the question is a sure-fire way to manipulate the end result.
Madam Temporary Chair, you would recall the AC Nielsen poll earlier this week which offered concrete proof of the scope to dictate an end result. When the government's question was put to respondents, the question was lost. But when the joint committee's question was put to the sample group—that is, the same question that we are moving via this particular amendment today—there was a resounding win for the proposal. I have no doubt that the government's internal polling has told them exactly the same thing. We have a situation where the Prime Minister has probably snowed the genuinely republican members of his own frontbench and his own 
 party room. He has dudded genuine republicans throughout Australia in the framing of the referendum questions. I believe a poll like the AC Nielsen poll has outed the Prime Minister on this issue. I would urge members of the coalition in the Senate, and perhaps I should include the Australian Democrats in this—they are emerging coalition partners; I think that is a fair thing to say—
—At least we're not the fourth faction of the ALP!
—I would urge the coalition parties to consider the results of the Nielsen poll and the very clear message it contains about the motives and manipulations of Prime Minister John Howard. I say to Senator Woodley: if only you would be so honourable as to be the fourth faction of the Labor Party, you would also be welcome. The Prime Minister should not be allowed to dictate the result of constitutional reform. He should not be allowed to do it in the shabby and deceptive way that he has. We are going to work as actively as we can against these tactics.
The bipartisan joint select committee made a clear compromise recommendation on the long title. It is a compromise that is fair to all. In my view, to give in to the tactics of the Prime Minister would be absolutely unacceptable. Further compromise would mean giving in to the Prime Minister's tactics and the tactics of his monarchist supporters. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, has often spoken of his own passion for the republic. I reckon that is a passion that is a feature of the Labor Party as a whole. It reflects the view of the significant majority of Australians. We also passionately believe all Australians deserve to be presented with a fair and accurate referendum question. We are committed to ensuring that a proper choice is put before the people, and I would urge all senators to support the amended long title that I have moved on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-11,"—The Australian Greens are also moving an identical amendment. Therefore much of what Senator Faulkner had to say applies. The hour is late, so I am not going over that territory again. This amendment is the outcome of a

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-11,"—The Australian Democrats will not be supporting the amendment. However, I wish to put on record an acknowledgment of the joint select committee's good work, not only in its advisory report but also in its recommendation that is before us. I signed off on that recommendation. I certainly felt that the wording was acceptable and worthy, but the amendment before us does not have the total support of my Democrat colleagues. We believe that the following amendment will provide an equally simple and accurate, but we think also a new and improved, version in this debate.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-11,"—I want to go through a little bit of history in respect of the opposition's amendment and Senator Brown's amendment, and also to reflect for a moment on the Democrat amendment. We are concerned here about getting a real outcome. Our concern is that there has been a long period of consultation and development of the amendment that both the Labor Party and the Greens put up today. It is the amendment that basically came from the bipartisan joint parliamentary committee. It reflects both the concerns and the desire of that committee—the desire being to get a fair reflection of the process.
Before going back to analyse what we have done as a committee, can I say to the Democrats that this debate will obviously go on until the morning—we have got only three minutes to go and I am sure that other people want to speak in respect of this—but I am sure that the chamber would like to be apprised of how serious you are in respect of your amendment. If you are not going to support the Labor amendment and the Greens amendment then, as you of course have your own, you can tell us how good that is. We do not want to be victims of a charade here. We do not want to be taken down the garden path by the Democrats and then be told, `Oh, we were not really serious. The Prime Minister does not like it. Therefore we will not persist 
 with it.' The Prime Minister has not liked quite a number of things about this process, all the way through. He did not in fact like having the process. He is obviously no republican.
What we have at this stage of the debate is a Prime Minister who is saying to us, `Either take what I want or take nothing at all.' We should make him blink. The Senate should stand up and say, `Prime Minister, your proposal is not fair. It is not balanced against fairness in outcome in this debate.' But we do not want to be led by the Democrats, who in one sense I suppose, if you look at the statements over the last 24 hours, have graduated from being fairies at the bottom of the garden to developing their own child-care centre down there when it comes to negotiations.
—Ha, ha!
—Senator Murray, you may laugh but, if you are serious about your proposal, do not tell us that you are going to be serious about it for 24 hours. If we are going to support it as a second best to ours, we want to know that you are prepared to take the Prime Minister on in respect of it. We also need you to know that on a number of occasions so far he has said, `No, this is not on'—but he has had to move in the interests of fairness and in response to public reaction. He looks very much like a spoiler when he says, `You will take what I give you and nothing else.' He has said that consistently through this debate; he says it again now. But what should be motivating you, as Democrats, and also the whole chamber, is how we get a fair and balanced question, and how we persist with it. As I said, the messages were somewhat mixed last night as to how serious the Democrats were in respect of their amendment. For instance, we are not going to be victims of a charade, if we have to support second best, and find ourselves supporting the Democrat amendment and then being told by the Democrats, `Well, the Prime Minister has said all or nothing and he may defer the referendum.' This issue is not the plaything of this Prime Minister, and that is a view that the public has expressed time after time in reaction to the way that he has played this debate.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-08-11,"—I rise tonight to speak about an exceptional young policeman who died tragically last week in the Northern Territory: Sergeant Glen Huitson. By all accounts he was a remarkable person with a great capacity for giving and caring, and a strong love of life. He was the sort of person who holds a community together and makes it strong and good. Now, unfortunately, he has been lost to us. On Tuesday, 3 August at 11.45 a.m., Sergeant Glen Huitson was shot by a gunman in a cowardly attack while manning a roadblock on the Stuart Highway. He died in Royal Darwin Hospital approximately an hour after the shooting and is survived by his wife, Lisa, and their two children, Joseph, aged 2, and Ruby, aged six months.
Sergeant Huitson was based at Adelaide River, a small and important community on the Stuart Highway, approximately 100 kilometres from Darwin. He had served in Alice Springs, Nauiyu Nambiyu and other communities throughout the Northern Territory, and was respected as a good cop who looked after people in his community with a gentle but firm hand. Sergeant Huitson was at the forefront of active policing with all its rewards and dangers. He was given a full police funeral on Saturday morning at St Mary's Cathedral in Darwin. As a mark of recognition and respect, over 2,000 people—family, friends, fellow officers and the general public—attended the funeral of this most well-known and loved man.
For such a fine young man to have died in such a senseless attack is an absolute tragedy which now impacts so cruelly on his family, colleagues and the community. Sergeant Huitson had everything in life to live for, but he gave his life for the community of the Northern Territory doing his duty as a police officer. He was a brave man. In February of 
 this year, without drawing his gun and with no lives being lost, Sergeant Huitson disarmed a drug-crazed gunman who had hijacked a tourist bus. His medal of valour for this extraordinary act of heroism was presented at his funeral to his widow, Lisa, by the Police Commissioner in a most moving ceremony.
This tragic event has shocked the people of the Northern Territory to the core. It has made many reflect on the sacrifices that our police make in the interests of the public good and the risks they are called on to face courageously in carrying out their duty. This young officer and his family have made the ultimate sacrifice for the community. Sergeant Huitson was an exceptional police officer with an outstanding career to date and so much to look forward to. Most importantly, he was a husband, a father, a son, a brother and a friend to so many. His great loss is shared by the whole Northern Territory community. He will be missed.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Huitson, Sergeant Glen </title>",Adjournment,30,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-11,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) Yes. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) has advised that an Electronic Safety Incident Report (ESIR) was received on 27 March 1999. On the basis of that ESIR, BASI commenced an investigation of the incident and is currently reviewing the appropriate radar and voice tapes. A copy of the final report will be forwarded when completed.
(2) Airservices has advised that the supervisor on duty was not in the aerodrome control position at the time and was therefore unable to determine if an incident had occurred. An ESIR was subsequently submitted by the Aerodrome Controller (see 6 below), and BASI has advised the ESIR was received on Saturday, 27 March 1999.
(3) BASI has advised that no action was required as an ESIR on the incident was received.
Airservices Australia has advised that:
(4) The circumstances surrounding a possible breakdown of separation was discussed at a team meeting later on 24 March. It was not possible at that meeting to determine as to whether an incident had occurred.
(5) No. The Aerodrome Controller was advised to submit an ESIR if he considered a breakdown in separation had occurred.
(6) No, as the responsible Aerodrome Controller submitted an ESIR three days later and this was investigated by Airservices.
(7) (a) Yes. The incident was discussed with the controller by the Team Leader. The investigation of the incident showed that the controller acted properly in accordance with established procedures when he observed separation decreasing between the two aircraft.
(b) Beginning of April 1999.
(8) Yes.
(9) (a) The most experienced Cairns Area Terminal Team Leader.
(b) The Team Leader has over thirty years air traffic control experience in all facets of Check Control and Standardisation. Also, he had participated in previous investigations. 

(10) No. the nature of the incident was such that an investigator from another unit was not warranted.
