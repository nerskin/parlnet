"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-20,"—by leave—I move Democrats amendments Nos 80 to 82, 84 to 88 and 92:
(80)	Schedule 1, item 11, page 61 (line 11), at the end of paragraph (d), add:
	; or (v)	the escape of a live plant.
 (81)	Schedule 1, item 11, page 61 (after line 19), after subsection (4), insert:
	(4A)	For the purposes of subsection (3), a person is taken to have allowed a plant to escape if:
	(a)	the plant has grown or propagated in the wild; and
	(b)	either:
	(i)	the person allowed the plant to escape; or
	(ii)	the person failed to take all reasonable measures to prevent the plant from growing or propagating in the wild.

These amendments relate to various offences and the action required when people contravene conditions of permits. They are fairly self-explanatory. I commend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-20,"—Given the hands-off approach of the government on these sets of amendments, the opposition indicate just that we go along with them, subject to the review process. Some of these penalties look draconian, and I would ask the minister to consider whether there may be some need for discretion—for instance, under amendment (82), where we are talking about a withdrawal of permit for 10 years. That may be justifiable but there may be circumstances where a degree of discretion on the part of the minister is appropriate. This is probably not the best way to go about amending this legislation but, subject to us having time to review it between this house's consideration of it and that of the House of Representatives, we will let this go through.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-06-20,"—Having had 24 hours, we are now in a slightly better position. Amendments (80) and (81), which extend existing offences to cover the breach of a condition which results in the release or escape of a live plant, seem to us to be okay. In the bill at the moment, it applies only to the escape of a live animal and there is no logical reason why it should not also cover plants. Amendment (82) provides that, if a person breaches permit conditions, the permit is automatically cancelled. The person cannot get another permit for 10 years. That seems to me to be unduly onerous. It may be that in some circumstances the person should not, but to put it in such absolute terms is unwise. In a practical sense, the consequence would be that governments would be likely to prosecute for minor offences. I would be pleased to hear Senator Bartlett's response to that but, on the face of it, I would be opposed to that particular amendment.
I turn to amendments (84) to (87). Our bill contains an offence of the possession of an illegally imported specimen. The Democrats are seeking to remove the defence of reasonable excuse and the requirement that a person is reckless as to the fact that a specimen is a CITES specimen, or the mental element. I am yet to be convinced that it is a fair thing to remove the defence of reasonable excuse. I would not say that, in relation to wildlife offences, my record is one of being too lenient. I have increased a large number of penalties, you will recall, in relation to medicines used by some cultures utilising the parts of animals. We have reversed the onus of proof and have made a number of changes that some people might have even argued went too far.
To that background I nevertheless think that what the Democrats are suggesting in relation to these provisions is a touch unreasonable. On that basis, I am yet to be convinced on those changes as well. In relation to amendment (88), the government's bill contains an offence for cruel treatment in the course of importation or exportation, but it only applies to regulated exports or imports—that is, those requiring a permit under the act. The Democrats amendment seeks to create a similar offence of strict liability, and to broaden the provisions to apply to all exports and imports, not just those regulated by the act. For example, the Democrats amendment would apply to the import of all live animals, but the bill does not otherwise regulate the import of all live animals.
For example, if you are importing a racehorse, you do not need a permit under this piece of legislation. I might think there should be a provision somewhere in the law that says that, if you treat the racehorse cruelly in its import, you might be committing some form of offence—but it does not seem appropriate under this piece of legislation, which is designed for a different set of circumstances. The Democrats are seeking to add a new concept to the legislation through the medium of these amendments, which, if treated as a single issue, might have some merit. But it seems to be inappropriately placed within this piece of legislation. Democrat amendment (92) extends the existing offence relating to false and misleading information to wildlife provisions, and that one seems to be reasonable.
—Minister, are you wishing to vote different ways on some of these amendments? I am after your contribution because I am now a bit confused as to how I should put the question.
—Yes. It might be that Senator Bartlett wants to have another go at persuading me I am mistaken in some way, but otherwise I would prefer them to be voted on separately. I would prefer (80) and (81) as a single vote, (82) as a single vote, (84) to (87) as a single vote, (88) as a single vote and (92) as a single vote.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-20,"—That is probably a bit too detailed. The minister has picked up the concerns that I was expressing in respect of (82) and (84) to (88). Why don't we treat (82) and (84) to (88) as one single vote and the rest as one single separate vote?
—Are there any objections to that?
—That is okay.
—That appears to be agreeable to everybody.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-20,"—I would like to speak briefly to Democrats amendment (88) and request a response from Senator Bartlett. I agree with Senator Hill's comment that the way the amendment appears to be drafted may not allow any ability for the judiciary to assess a case on its merits. It appears that the judiciary would be locked into only being able to apply 500 penalty units. I am seeking clarification from either Senator Hill or Senator Bartlett on: first of all, whether that is the case; and, second, if it is the case, whether the Democrats would consider adding words to each of the relevant sections so that it would read `Penalty: up to 500 penalty units'. I seek clarification on whether I am correct in that the judiciary would have no ability to vary the penalty under the amendment that the Democrats are proposing and, if that is the case, whether the Democrats would consider an amendment that would allow for the judiciary to vary the penalty by up to 500 penalty units.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-20,"—My understanding is that that is not the case. There is still discretion there, in the same way as there are penalty provisions in the bill as it currently stands—for some other offences it has a penalty of imprisonment for two years—and they are not an automatic requirement for every offence. But it is academic, given that this is one of the amendments that the minister and Senator Bolkus indicated they would not be supporting. In the interests of not delaying the proceedings I will not press the issue by looking to amend it further.

These are the last of the various Democrat amendments put forward. They basically seek to establish an animal welfare advisory council. This bill, and particularly some of the amendments that were agreed to, including the objects of the act itself, seeks to ensure that humane treatment of individual animals occurs, and these amendments establish an advisory council to advise the minister in relation to the operation of the act as it relates to animal welfare. 
I believe that this would be a useful advance in ensuring that better consideration of animal welfare issues occur. It is an important component of the whole movement of wildlife both imported into Australia and exported from Australia. Animal welfare has not had enough focus, I believe, at a national level and this would assist the environment minister to ensure more effectively that the objects of the act will be met.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-06-20,"—Again, this is an attempt to implement an agenda which may have merit but under an inappropriate piece of legislation. This piece of legislation basically looks to conserve native species and to do so in relation to the regulation of trade. There are animal welfare issues that are incidental and, in an incidental sense, we have said that we must be conscious of those issues and take the opportunity of trade to seek to ensure that within trade animal welfare considerations are taken into account. 
What the Democrats are seeking to do here is to transform this piece of legislation into an animal welfare act and, as I said, no matter how meritorious it might be—perhaps there should be a Commonwealth animal welfare act, and that is something for debate for in the past we have primarily seen it as a state responsibility—whether there is merit in that objective is not the primary purpose of this piece of legislation. Therefore, I think it is inappropriate to attach to this piece of legislation yet another advisory committee dealing with an issue that is not one that is primarily related to the purposes of the act. 
I should remind Senator Bartlett that there is already an advisory committee which advises the minister on matters concerning the utilisation of native species in Australia. It looks at state management plans, for example, in relation to the harvesting of kangaroos, wallabies, possums and the like, and I know from experience that it gives the Commonwealth minister very good advice on these matters. That committee is also very sensitive to animal welfare issues, so incidentally it does address these particular issues. In terms of the piece of legislation before the Senate, the committee that currently exists is more than adequate to give the Commonwealth minister the advice that he or she needs. So I am not persuaded that under this piece of legislation we should be setting up a new committee to deal with an issue which is not the primary purpose of the act.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

(1)	Schedule 1, page 110 (after line 2), before item 83, insert:
82A  Section 11
Omit “Regional Forest Agreements or”.

Repeal the definition.
The thrust of these amendments is to remove the provisions in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act which, in 1999, was passed by the government with the support of the Democrats. It effectively removed the minister's ability to intervene on the protection of forests, and therefore wildlife, in areas where regional forest agreements have been signed. We know that that includes essentially all the unprotected native forests of Tasmania, including the tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere and the biggest temperate rainforest in Australia, as well as extensive forests in Victoria and New South Wales, and these are matters of great contention.
It is very pertinent that, when amendments to this bill are being introduced to protect wildlife, committee members consider the fact that federal intervention to protect wildlife, where regional forest agreements have been assessed, is essentially not there. It is not available. Every time an area of forest is destroyed—for example, by Forestry Tasmania or by Gunns, the biggest woodchipping corporation in the Southern Hemisphere—massive destruction of wildlife is involved. There is emerging evidence that this includes extinction of species that have not yet been described by science—for example, insect species—yet the minister is not able to intervene because the regional forest agreement section, passed by the government and the Democrats, says that the forests are out of bounds. That is a terrible shortcoming in this legislation. It should not be the case.
The amendments I have moved make forests—the richest terrestrial ecosystems as far as wildlife is concerned—part of the minister's responsibility and bailiwick. It is a Commonwealth matter. We are talking about national wildlife repositories and nationally important forests. I do not need to remind the minister that, under the Prime Minister's signature on the regional forest agreement in Tasmania, this year alone 150,000 log trucks will take native forests to the woodchip mills and will create thousands of hectares of totally destroyed ecosystems. The balance to that, surely, is for the minister to at least be able to intervene to protect areas that are important. 
I also draw the minister's attention to the news in today's Mercury, under the headline `Senator may be parrot's last hope', which is very much to do with the regional forest agreement. Under that agreement, the trees upon which the swift parrot feeds and depends in Tasmania ought to be totally protected. The agreement essentially lays down that that species of eucalypt should have a total prohibition as far as destructive activities are concerned. Yet in Hobart, the Hobart City Council is in the business of selling one of the last areas of these eucalypts to a hospital developer, who is going to clear part of that land—two hectares of that land upon which swift parrots depend particularly when there is a failure of alternative and usual feeding resources. So it is a very important habitat on Mount Nelson in suburban Hobart. It has been a matter of great contention.
A local group is fighting to protect the small area that is involved there. It is an important feeding ground, with adjacent nesting grounds for the swift parrot, which is an endangered species. The minister, under law, is required to have a recovery plan for that endangered species. The news from Tasmania is bad. Effectively the Premier has said that, as the minister for local government, he has got legal advice. As far as I know, he has not shown that advice, but he will not intervene. He said that he will leave it to the ministers for environment at state and federal level. Then we read that, at state level, environment minister David Llewellyn confirmed in an answer to Denison Tasmanian Greens MHA Peg Putt—this is yesterday—that a recovery plan for the parrot had not been finalised. He agreed that without the recovery plan Tasmania's Threatened Species Protection Act could not be used to intervene at this important swift parrot site at Olinda Grove on Mount Nelson; in other words, the Tasmanian minister for the environment has yet again failed to do his job. David Llewellyn, the honourable minister for the environment in Tasmania, repeatedly fails to protect the environment, which is his job. Fortunately we have a backstop: that it is the responsibility—under the regional forest agreements and in terms of this endangered species—of the federal minister to use his powers to intervene.
There are alternative places for the installation that the developers want to put in; there are a number of alternative sites. There are not alternatives to the habitat of the swift parrot, which is down to a few per cent of the original habitat in Tasmania. The swift parrot is dependent upon that. The article finished with a reference to Friends of Mount Nelson member Janet Henderson, who said she was stunned by the news from the Premier yesterday and expected that a big community protest meeting would be convened within the next few weeks. 
About 50 swift parrots return to Mount Nelson each year to nest, feeding on the mature Eucalyptus ovata at the site. Birds Tasmania spokesman, Denis Abbott, said that in a decade the parrot population had dropped from 1,320 pairs to 940 pairs. That is very worrying stuff. The regional forest agreement did say that all Eucalyptus ovata would be protected. This legislation says that the minister cannot intervene where a regional forest agreement is in place, so we are in a position that, if we do not clear this up, the government will effectively fail at a very important first test of this legislation—the minister's power to intervene to protect a very important and dramatically beautiful species and its habitat.
I am sure my friends the Democrats will support these amendments and I would ask the Labor Party to reconsider its objection to the environment minister's powers to intervene on regional forest agreements and to support my amendments. Moreover, I ask the minister whether he can extend to the residents of Mount Nelson—and I add for the record that I live in the same suburb myself, so I have an interest in this—and to those citizens near Olinda Grove some hope that this totally unnecessary move by the Hobart City Council and the failure by the state government to act will be met with an appropriate response from him to save this area.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-20,"—I want to put on the record that, as Senator Brown correctly indicated, the Democrats will support these amendments. They were amendments that we moved at the time the EPBC bill went through and which were not supported by the ALP. Certainly we are supporting the amendments and the aims of them.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-20,"—The opposition will not support these amendments. They do go very much to the heart of the RFA repealing definitions. I just wish to make one further point to Senator Bartlett: my recollection is a bit different from yours, Senator Bartlett. You did have an opportunity to do this in your negotiations with the government when the EPBC legislation first went through the parliament in 1999. You did not insist on them then; you sold out on what you have claimed to be so important since that day. It is a bit rich for you to come in now and say that you are trying to rewrite history and trying to assert that this was something that the Democrats tried to do but did not get support for in 1999. You were at that secret negotiating table with the government. You dropped these amendments; they were not core amendments when you made those agreements with the government. Then you come back into the Senate and ask other senators to do the work for you on something that you were not prepared to make core fundamental concerns in those negotiations. So it is a bit rich to be rewriting history to that effect.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-06-20,"—I am tempted to note that Senator Brown now seems to be recognising the merited value of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in the circumstance of yet another abdication of responsibility by a state government. Senator Brown, it is not unusual to find state governments discovering legal advice that excuses them from interfering in a matter that is obviously, primarily, their responsibility— that is, endangered species. But I will not go down that path. However, I do think that Senator Brown is mistaken in relating the regional forest agreement issue to that of the proposed old folks home in Mount Nelson. The forest agreement is primarily related to forestry operations and, certainly, endangered species that may be affected by such forestry operations are relevant. That is why advice had to be received on endangered species issues and taken into account before the state and the Commonwealth signed off on the regional forest agreement. What we have here is an issue of a nationally endangered species—that is, the swift parrot—and I agree with Senator Brown that any further threat to nationally endangered species is of concern. It should be of concern to all Australians. It is proposed to build in this particular location—I called it an old folks home but that sounds a bit aged, doesn't it?
—It is an aged care facility.
—An `aged care facility' is the modern terminology, apparently.
—Yes. That sounds better, Minister, thank you.
—An aged care facility is proposed to be constructed, which would cause the loss of some native vegetation, and the issue is whether that loss would have a significant and detrimental consequence upon the swift parrot, a nationally endangered species. I have written to the relevant authorities in Tasmania and indicated that if such an action could have that consequence they should consider referring it to us, because we have a responsibility in relation to nationally endangered species. I do not think I have had a response as yet on that matter. Now that the state government has washed its hands of the issue, the proponents will no doubt revisit my letter and give further consideration to that matter. Because I might ultimately have to make a judgment, I think it would be inappropriate if I gave a preliminary reaction, except to say that it was on the basis of the advice I had received that I wrote in such terms to the proponents. But, again, I think this is an occasion to say that, while I believe the Commonwealth, on behalf of all Australians, must accept a role and responsibility in relation to nationally endangered species, that should not be used as a justification by local and state authorities to abdicate a primary responsibility. We will only get a more effective outcome in this country in relation to endangered species if all levels of government and the broader community are prepared to accept that we all have a responsibility in this regard.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-20,"—The minister indicated that he has written to, I think, the proponents, suggesting that the matter should be referred to him or, if not, to the state government. I have certainly written to the minister indicating that he should take it up. I get from what the minister says that he will be making a decision on this matter at some stage in the future, anyway. I just want to have it made clear that that is not dependent upon what somebody else does—dependent on a letter coming from the state government or from the proponents—and that, now that the minister is aware of the issue, and failing proper action by the state government, he will be taking the matter up himself. That is not to say what his decision is going to be, but those people who are alarmed about the loss of the Eucalyptus ovata and the swift parrot habitat at Mount Nelson need to know that the minister is giving it very serious consideration, that a decision will be handed down some time in the future and, if so, what the likely time reference is. 
While the minister is considering a response to that, let me just say that the Hobart City Council stands condemned for not taking up its obligations. It wants to appear to be running a green city, but we are talking about a prime piece of endangered bushland in a suburban area with an endangered species that still goes to that suburban area and is dependent upon it. We are looking at a rapid decline in the number of swift parrots, which of course migrate to the mainland, and that is very much related to the loss of their habitat. So the question for anybody looking at this is: should any more habitat be forgone? And the answer is no, because you must further endanger the species and push it further towards extinction if you remove any of the remaining habitat. 
I remind senators that something less than five per cent of the Eucalyptus ovata habitat is left in Tasmania. So it is a pretty dire situation. The aged care facility can be built in other places, but you cannot get that habitat back—once it is gone it is gone. I note that Alderman Freeman, from the Hobart City Council, in a rather frivolous offhanded manner has said, `Well, what's another couple of hectares? There's 20 hectares behind this block.' You have to say to such insensitivity, `Where do you draw the line, Alderman Freeman?' He will draw the line, I would imagine, when the last developer has put their hand up to get more land.
We have to have a more responsible attitude to rare and endangered species, and I think Minister Hill is capable of having that more responsible attitude. We are left with the state Premier having ducked his duty and the state minister for the environment having failed again—adding this one to a long list of failures on the environment—and people looking for a responsible attitude from the national minister for the environment. I commend the minister for taking the matter seriously and for giving it further deliberation. 
I do not have to point out to the minister that he has it within his means to put a lot more pressure on the state minister for the environment and the state Premier as far as this issue is concerned. The state is a recipient of a lot of Natural Heritage Trust funding. It is a recipient of funds earmarked for the environment, and it has to act responsibly in return. Both parties know that. The state government is very remiss in this situation. So we have a domino effect, with the city council falling to the developer's wishes and the state Labor government failing in its duty, and now the hope rests with Minister Hill. I ask the minister whether he might outline what the process is from here, so that people attending that meeting, if there is a meeting in Mount Nelson, will have an idea of what the process is from here and when a decision might be made on the matter.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-06-20,"—We encourage a cooperative approach to these matters, because a cooperative approach, as I said, from all levels of government and the community will achieve a better outcome than a legislated minimum. We are not going to get an optimal outcome in relation to endangered species without a community that understands the importance of the values that we are talking about and properly takes account of those values in determining the appropriate location for aged care facilities, for example. Nobody is opposed to the construction of further aged care facilities; the argument is whether it is an appropriate location for this development if it adds to a threat to an endangered species. 
Having said that we encourage a cooperative attitude, the proponents do have legal obligations under the Commonwealth legislation, and it is their responsibility to make themselves aware of those obligations and to act within the law. To assist them in that regard we have drawn to their attention the provisions of the act. So the ball is back in the court of the proponents at the moment. From memory, I think they were awaiting the appeal that had been made to the state government by opponents to this development. I presume the lack of a response to the Commonwealth has been because they have been focusing on the state issue. If that is no longer an issue, in terms of the state government being unwilling to intervene, I assume that they will now address my correspondence.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-20,"—I thank the minister for answering the questions. In this case the proponent is, presumably, developer Mr Jeffrey Markoff. But I wonder if the Hobart City Council, which is selling the land, is not also a proponent. The council has not sold it yet, but it is moving swiftly to finalise that sale. In the sale itself is part of the proposition—and the sale has very much dealt with the proposition—to allow the development to take place. So, in that sense, the Hobart City Council itself can be seen as a proponent. It has adopted and is proposing the development on this site and is actively selling the land as part of that development.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

But to ensure that all relevant parties were aware of the provisions of the Commonwealth legislation I wrote to the city council.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-06-20,"—This debate is on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001. The purpose of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 is to amend the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to restrict the application of the provision of all excisable goods other than petroleum fuels classified to items 11 and 12 of the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act. As a consequence of these amendments, the Customs Tariff Act 1995 is also amended to remove certain excise equivalent imported petroleum fuels from the table of paired customs subheadings and excise tariff items in subsection 19(1) that are subject to indexation.
According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill has substantial financial implications. The cost to the budget of the abolition of petroleum fuels indexation is $150 million in the next financial year, 2001-02, $425 million in 2002-03, $785 million in the year 2003-04 and in the year 2004-05, $1,135 million. So it is a very substantial change to the Commonwealth revenue.
These bills form part of the government's warm embrace of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. This measure forms part of the backflip crammed acrobatic extravaganza that the government hosted earlier this year. There have been many parts of this great show put on by the ringmaster, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and his nimble chief acrobat, the Treasurer, Mr Costello. As part of this circus, we have seen the deferral and abandonment of many of the measures announced as part of the government's highly prized Ralph Review of Business Taxation. These backflips include the indefinite postponement of the Mr Costello commitment to tax trusts as companies, a commitment the government botched in the first instance because it refused to listen to those who were going to be most damaged by the changes and then it put it into the too-hard basket, possibly for good. It is clear that the government regards the entities regime—the taxation of trusts as companies—as simply too hard and too hot for it to handle.
We have seen changes to the administration of the GST and the PAYG entities, which included the introduction of less frequent reporting obligations. These changes were curiously similar to those proposed only weeks before by the Australian Labor Party, although the government lacked the courage to adopt our proposals in full. As a consequence, businesses are still burdened by a compliance regime that takes them away from what they do best—that is, running their core business. Ask any small business person about compliance costs and you will get some idea of how much this sector resents the time they have to give up from their core business responsibilities to work for the government.
But back to the backflips. We also saw the government cave in to repeated demands for the excise on beer to be reduced, despite their best efforts to escape on a technicality. We have seen the government announce last-minute rescue attempts for some of the industries damaged by the GST, including the building and car manufacturing industries. This was attempted by the doubling of the first home buyers grants for the purchase of new homes and the recent scrapping of the input tax credit phase-in mechanism for business acquisitions of motor vehicles. 
So one is left to ask: why have the government done all of this? They would have us believe that they had turned over a new leaf; that suddenly they were lifting the shutters and letting the light of public sentiment shine through; that they had become a government who were listening. But the facts paint a very different picture of the drivers behind these backflips. It was not the businesses, the families or the industry groups that the government were listening to; it was their party heavyweights who, after the embarrassing losses in the by-election in Ryan and the state elections in Queensland and my home state of Western Australia, finally got the ear of Mr Costello and Mr Howard. These heavyweights, realising that the coalition were on a direct collision course with certain electoral defeat in the federal election due this year, demanded that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer put their tails between their legs and make changes. It was to these powerbrokers that the government listened and they made the changes, many copied from the policy positions of the Australian Labor Party, positions we had announced previously. 
Nothing in the government's behaviour indicates a true commitment to what they have done. I am certain that, if they had the opportunity to govern again, they would reintroduce some of the policies and procedures that they have so recently dismantled. Their behaviour represents a desperate and a cynical attempt to win back those the government have alienated for so long.
I now turn to the issue of fuel prices more specifically. The first issue about petrol prices is the question of world parity pricing. The crude oil market was deregulated a number of years ago and that ended import parity pricing, but effectively we now have the prices of domestic crude oil and petroleum products reflecting world market prices. The ability of companies in Australia to trade internationally ensures that the domestic price reflects the international price, since differences between the two will always result in exports or imports, as the case may be. The bad news is that I do not think Australia has any alternative.
The next question that people ask is: who benefits from the higher world prices for petrol which we have been seeing, and where does the extra money that people pay at the petrol pump go? The answer is that the major beneficiaries of higher prices are the Australian and international producers of crude oil. These are multibillion dollar profit makers who have no interest in seeing fuel prices reduced. The second main beneficiary of these higher world prices generally is the Commonwealth government. It would always get some extra revenue through the petroleum resource rent tax, the PRRT, every time the prices go up. The petroleum resource rent tax is levied at the rate of 40 per cent of taxable profit from a petroleum project.
The next element in the petrol pricing equation and the next chapter in this saga relates back to 1998. On 1 August 1998, the Howard government removed the wholesale price cap on fuel. The ACCC ceased to have any role in monitoring wholesale petrol prices. This was exactly what the oil majors wanted. Labor opposed it at the time, saying that deregulating the petrol industry was a gift to the major oil companies and would lead to higher prices. The Treasurer claimed at the time that deregulation would `promote greater competition which would lower prices over time' and `put downward pressure on petrol prices to the benefit of consumers'. These claims have been proven to be a nonsense. What Labor claimed at the time is exactly what has happened, and the government's 1998 changes have been a failure.
The third stage in the petrol price saga came last year with the introduction of the goods and services tax, the GST. Liberal campaign headquarters said in September 1998:
There will be no increase in the price of petrol as a result of the GST. The reason is that the Government will reduce the Petrol Excise by an amount equivalent to the GST.
And Prime Minister Howard had said in August 1998:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
In fact, what happened was that the GST had a very substantial impact on petrol taxes. The reasons are as follows. On 1 July last year, the excise dropped by 6.7c per litre, but when the GST came in it added 8.2c per litre, so the cost to motorists was 1.5c per litre and there was a government windfall of $270 million. We then had the August 2000 indexation of 0.65c per litre, which added to government revenue of the order of $115 million. We then had the February 2001 indexation which was another cent or so per litre. That added a further $155 million of government revenue. Added on top of all those things was the fact that, during this period, international prices went up and the GST increased as well. So, as petrol prices rose to $1 per litre, this added an extra 2c in GST—additional costs to motorists, 2c per litre; government windfall, $360 million. So the total increase in petrol tax during this period was around 5c a litre, and the windfall gain for the government was around $900 million. No wonder there was a public outcry concerning the petrol price.
I now turn to the question of why the Howard government were forced to backflip on this particular issue. In the past, when it was put to the government by motoring organisations and others that they should abolish fuel indexation, they said, `No, you can't do that. Fuel indexation is necessary to maintain Commonwealth revenues. On the one hand, you want to index pensions and the benefits, but you won't be able to index the pensions and the benefits unless you are also indexing things like the fuel excise.' They vigorously resisted that type of change. What happened to change their mind? It was the establishment by the federal parliamentary Labor Party of a petrol price inquiry, which I had the honour to chair. At the time, the government said, `This is a stunt; this is of no consequence.' The coalition and the Democrats refused to support a Senate inquiry into petrol prices. We would have preferred an all-party Senate inquiry but, in the absence of that, we initiated and proceeded with our own inquiry into the economic and social effects of higher fuel prices and the significance of the fuel excise indexation adjustment which was coming through in February this year. As part of our inquiry, a number of Labor members and senators visited many locations around Australia. By the time we issued our interim report, the inquiry had conducted hearings in 35 locations, had heard evidence from 180 witnesses and had received hundreds of written submissions. The petrol price inquiry has since received many more submissions, and we remain committed to the task of exploring options that will bring about fairer outcomes on petrol pricing for all Australians.
Labor's petrol price inquiry heard evidence from Australians from all walks of life, including motoring groups, trucking firms, drivers, farmers, fishing representatives, small business proprietors, taxi operators, tourism operators, community groups, volunteer groups, disability service groups, those looking after aged and welfare sectors of the community, and many individual witnesses. Industries for which fuel was a substantial cost component had been adversely affected by rising fuel costs caused by a combination of rising world oil prices, the falling Australian dollar, non-competitive industry pricing behaviour and, of course, rising fuel taxes led by the GST. Some of the most affected industries were trucking, taxis, tourism, farming and fishing. 
Taking the trucking industry as an example, owner-drivers in the trucking industry had increasingly been making long journeys for little or no income above their costs, just to enable them to avoid repossession of their rigs by finance companies. Drivers told the inquiry that they could not afford to stay in the industry but that they could not afford to get out of it either because the price of second-hand rigs had been so badly depressed owing to the large number of repossessions. I was particularly concerned that all this was indeed compromising driver safety, as drivers were working for longer periods without breaks in an effort to recover the large increases in fuel costs. If the government defence was that businesses could claim a rebate—that is the defence, and that defence is in part true—the problem for owner-drivers was that they had to pay their fuel costs up-front. Initially, there was a substantial delay in obtaining the rebate after they had diverted themselves from their core business activities by filling out the necessary forms, and many of them were driven into overdraft on which they paid higher interest rates than was the value of the rebate when it belatedly arrived. Even now, there remains a continuing problem in meeting these issues.
I think the following quote from Coral Davidson of Concerned Families of Australian Truckies in NSW sums up the impact that fuel prices was having not only on trucking businesses but on the families of those involved:
Daily I am getting calls from families, not just drivers any more, from their families, their wives and their daughters; `Dad has just lost the truck, the finance company has been out. We can't pay the fuel bill, we can't even operate the truck any more.' The fuel here has just overtaken every boundary that we had left.
Another area that the inquiry heard a lot from was voluntary organisations. In a whole range of areas—volunteer bushfire brigades, Meals on Wheels, aquatherapy groups, senior citizens self-help organisations—we heard from witnesses and representatives about the adverse impact of the GST on all of their organisations. The committee recommended that the federal parliamentary Labor Party propose and support the waiving of the fuel excise increase due on 1 February this year, that we call upon the Howard government to prevent the 1 February indexation from occurring, that we pledge legislative support to achieve this outcome and, in the event that the government fails to act and fuel taxes rise, pushing prices even higher, that we introduce a private member's bill at the first parliamentary opportunity to remove this excise increase. This is exactly what happened. The government, yet again, failed to act, even in the face of the overwhelming evidence that had been adduced. 
In response to the government's inaction, I introduced into the Senate and the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, the Hon. Kim Beazley, introduced into the House of Representatives, on 7 February this year, Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill (No. 2) 2001. That bill sought to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to prevent the February 2001 indexation of rates of excise duty applying to various petroleum products.
When I introduced the bill, I said that I was seeking not only to ease the pain of high fuel taxes caused by the government's attempt `to leach millions of dollars out of Australians through its fuel tax squeeze' but also to stop this government `lining its pockets at the expense of families and communities, industries, businesses and voluntary organisations, both in the cities and the bush.' The debate on my bill was adjourned, but we now see quite clearly what the pattern of events has been.
Labor have also acted to redress some of the other problems, beyond indexation, with fuel pricing. We introduced the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999—a bill that contains measures to address the lack of wholesale competition in the petrol industry by giving service station franchisees the legislatively guaranteed right to shop around for up to 50 per cent of their petrol. The measures in the bill would also increase competition at the wholesale level, curtail the influence of oil majors over retail prices and produce lower retail prices for customers. Finally, the initiatives in the bill would provide the ACCC with enforcement powers, and thus give retailers the protection from retribution that they need.
Labor has also called on the government to bring petrol prices back under the surveillance of the prices watchdog, the ACCC. In contrast with the quite tough approach it takes to many other retailers, the ACCC has accepted manipulation of petrol prices as a fact of life. While the ACCC has released a discussion paper on reducing fuel price variability this month, it goes a long way to fixing the real problem with fuel—that it is simply too expensive.
I should also note that in the budget there is $4 million for a government inquiry into fuel taxation. The review is supposed to recommend changes to the tax arrangements for fuel, but in a revenue neutral way. That means some fuel taxes up, some fuel taxes down—there is no other way to do it. A copy of the inquiry's terms of reference fell into our hands, and it made for very interesting reading. The inquiry is to examine `the total structure of fuel taxation in Australia', and the only tax quarantined from change is the petroleum resource rent tax—the super-profits tax for oil producers. Therefore, in line for cuts are the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme for regional and remote motorists and the diesel fuel concessions.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-20,"—I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001  and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, both of which have the effect of reducing duties on fuel. When governments go back on their promises, they inevitably run into trouble. Such was the case when the coalition government decided that they would let the cost of petrol rise by more than they were perceived to have promised the community, and in the process they would take an increasing amount of revenue. On 1 March this year, the Prime Minister made the most rational of political decisions: he decided that the increasing cost of petrol was causing a substantial reaction in the community, which was harming the coalition and could be partly ameliorated by government action. It is unfortunate, however, that it took such a long time, because the political damage was sustained for far too long. As our then leader, Senator Meg Lees, said at the time:
The Government is finally giving back to motorists the 1.5 cents a litre it took from them last July. The Democrats opposed the `grab' then as a broken promise and we were determined to reverse it when the legislation hit the Senate ...
It is positive that the government made that decision, recognising the significance of the issue, and it is positive that we have legislation to give back to motorists those 1½c. But the significance of the bills is not simply that of meeting a promise which individual motorists perceived to be made; it is also the government's coffers—forgone government revenue will increase from $150 million in 2001-02 to over $1.1 billion in 2004-05.
Someone said to me the other day that motorists are amongst the most extraordinary consumers of all when it comes to price sensitivity. He said that if you work in a service station you will find that people driving in the opposite direction will suddenly swerve across double lines, yellow lines, or whatever the impediment is, to save an extra cent in the service station, and then they will happily buy a packet of Tim Tams at, say, $2 more than they would pay at the local supermarket. He believed that that sensitivity was driven by the continual daily reminder of exactly what the price at the service station is.
It is that continual daily reminder that I, amongst many others, think is a reason that the oil industry really needs to be turned upside down in terms of its pricing systems. It is quite extraordinary and virtually impossible, in a rational sense, for prices to move up to 9c or more on a daily or weekly basis when international or local prices do not shift by as much. You do not see that kind of price manipulation with any other consumer good. That indicates, in my belief, a real failing and a real corruption of the price mechanisms in that industry.
Returning to the bills, to implement the Prime Minister's announcement which accompanied the 1½c reduction there was an announcement that the indexation of excise tax on all petroleum fuels is to be removed from the indexation period commencing 1 August 2001. That cost, as I have said, is $150 million in the coming financial year, 2001-02; $425 million in 2002-03; $785 million in 2003-04; and $1.135 billion in 2004-05. It is important to note how quickly those lost revenues mount up—they multiply sevenfold in four years.
The Democrats welcomed the decision to reduce the excise by 1½c and we noted the point made by the shadow minister that both Kim Beazley and Senator Cook had put legislation in the House and the Senate which dealt with this issue. Of course, that legislation is now redundant as a result of these bills, but the key issue is yet to be attended to because, while the government has now kept its promise, it has done so in a way that has a substantial impact on future revenue growth. The promise was that the price of fuel would be reduced by 1½c, not that excise would never increase again.
In the House of Representatives, the Treasurer has been baiting the opposition to be precise about how they feel about indexation. I, too, would like them to be precise about that, because the Democrats have perhaps a different perspective on this matter. To the extent that the removal of indexation reduces the growth in petrol prices, it will serve to increase the consumption of fossil fuels. There is an environmental consideration to that, but of course we have to recognise the importance of fuel prices to the ordinary person going about their daily business. That price matters enormously in terms of household budgets. To restore indexation is not to be considered lightly, but neither should the revenue loss be considered lightly. 
One of the key themes that I have been developing over some time, and which I recently reinforced, is that there is a huge difference—a huge gap—between community demand for goods and services and community expectations of what they want from government, and what governments feel they can deliver. People are constantly demanding more expenditure on education, health, infrastructure and research and development—the list goes on and on—and you can only meet those needs if you raise additional revenue. Here is a situation where what has been a standard revenue device has been taken away.
I find myself in the odd position of being, I think, a lone voice against indexation in principle on the grounds that it is inflationary and that it denies parliament the oversight of tax increases. I think indexation says to parliament, `We are going to do it automatically and we are not going to come back to you and ask you about price increases.' However, I also hold the view that if indexation is now widely accepted as public policy—which it is, and it is accepted by all parties, as I understand it, as public policy—it should apply to as many taxes and income measures as possible. Here we have a situation where indexation is coming off something which it has been on for a long time—and which, as a matter of public policy, it has been on for a long time.
There are other areas which are not indexed and there are strong campaigns that they should be indexed—for instance, income tax rates. All of us have received material campaigning about bracket creep which, I am told, within 10 years, without the indexation of tax rate scales, will result in an additional $16 billion burden on income tax payments by taxpayers. Here, with petrol, is an issue where, in my perspective and in the perspective of the Democrats, we have a high demand for additional expenditure by government and yet indexation has been cut out, with the effect that it will be over $1 billion in 2004.
All tax cuts have the direct consequence of reducing the funds available to government to pursue their social, environmental, economic or strategic priorities. That is an opportunity cost. Taxpayers and consumers have to recognise that, if they want more from government, it has to be paid for from somewhere. So what could be done with $1 billion per annum? Pensioners who have just received their $300 bonus could receive such a payment every year forever with that money. Alternatively, as a nation, we could perhaps pay the farmers to stop all land clearing in Australia; or perhaps, with that money, we could double expenditure on the fight against salinity and land degradation; or we could remove all trawling in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area; or we could provide subsidies to public transport; or we could increase our investment in education by that amount; or we could increase our investment in aged care funding, especially capital investment.
I am saying to the government and the opposition: if ever you were to consider putting back indexation, if you were to tell us what you would use that money for, we would consider whether we could support it.
—Are you advocating that?
—You know I advocate greater revenues for government. I am not a person who is afraid to say that we do need more taxes or revenues—not remotely. I think it is about time that people started telling the truth.
There is another area you could attack. I have indicated that indexation of tax rate scales would cost $16 billion by the year 2009, and that looks unaffordable. But if, for instance, you wanted to index the tax-free thresholds, which would be of great benefit to lower income persons, the cost by 2009 would be $2.9 billion—that is just in respect of the tax-free threshold, not in relation to the other income tax rates—and in 2001-02 it would cost half a billion. You can contrast almost directly the abolition of fuel excise indexation at $1.1 billion in the year 2004 with a $1.2 billion cost if you indexed the tax-free threshold.
In every tax cut, you have to recognise that you lose an opportunity to provide something else. I have given you a sample list: you could pay pensioners, you could stop land clearing, you could double the expenditure on salinity and land degradation, you could subsidise public transport, you could increase our investment in education, you could increase investment in aged care funding, or you could introduce indexation to the tax-free threshold. I am sure either side can come up with another wish list, but the point I make to you both is that, in the sterile debate that is going on about who will or will not increase their taxes or revenues, I know and the Australian public know that you are both going to see an increase in revenues in the coming years and that some of that will come from taxes, fees, charges or surcharges. Name them what you will—government revenue will increase. But with this measure you have reduced government revenue and, in so doing, you have sacrificed the opportunity to spend money in areas where it is being demanded by the public, particularly in terms of education and other issues.
I hope to indicate through my remarks that the Democrats are not afraid to say that we have severe doubts about the cut to petrol indexation. We recognise the great importance of fuel prices to consumers. We do not think that, if it is ever put back, it should be put back without specifying exactly where it is going to go. We do think that the government is quite right in asking the Labor Party where they stand on the issue of whether they will restore indexation or not. I think it is incumbent upon every political party to make its position clear. I think the government has made its position clear. We will not consider it unless there is a better use to which the money can be put, and I have spelt out some of those better uses. For those like Senator Sherry who might want to know whether I put my money where my mouth is, I recently made a speech—
—I did read reports of it.
—It is probably why we are a minor party and not a major party.
—That is a very good point.
—Nevertheless, if we are in this chamber and either of you consider putting back the indexation, tell us what you are going to do it for and we will consider the matter carefully.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 and a related bill. Our frontbencher and deputy leader, Senator Cook, contributed to the debate earlier and outlined the legislation we are considering in some detail. It goes to the excise treatment of petroleum in this country. Firstly, I find myself in the unusual position of strongly disagreeing with my deputy leader, Senator Cook, on one matter, and that was his description of the government's performance on fuel. He described the antics of the Treasurer as `nimble acrobatics'. I could not disagree more strongly. The performance of this government—on the excise tax treatment of petroleum products and beer products and on a number of other matters relating to promises given prior to the last election with respect to the tax package that the government presented—is not nimble acrobatics. I would describe the performance of the Treasurer as one of an apprentice clown in a circus ring, characterised by numerous roll forwards, numerous roll-backs and numerous backflips—and ultimately he has fallen flat on his face. I would describe it more appropriately as in-your-face acrobatics rather than nimble acrobatics.
Excise taxes, and in particular excise taxes on petroleum products, still represent a very major contribution to total government revenue. If we look at page 5-9 of this year's Budget Paper No. 1, we have an outline of total Commonwealth government revenue— exclusive of the GST, and I will come to that a little later—to be collected in the year 2001-02. The total is $158.8 billion. Of that, the excise duty on petroleum products and crude oil represents $12.6 billion. That is a significant proportion of tax revenue to be collected by government in this country in the current financial year. Interestingly, despite the legislation we are considering in the Senate, the revenue derived from the excise duty on petroleum products and crude oil will increase from $12.4 billion to $12.6 billion in the current financial year. Despite the legislation, there is a 1.4 per cent increase in revenue derived from excise duty on petroleum products and crude oil.
Page 11-13 of Budget Paper No. 1 lists some historical data and gives the percentage of gross domestic product of revenue collection by the Commonwealth government over the period 1969-70 to the current financial year, 2001-02, and then projected forward to the financial year 2004-05. In the current financial year, the percentage of gross domestic product of revenue totals 23.2 per cent. We compare that with the last financial year, when it was 23.7 per cent; the year 1999-2000, when it was 26.2 per cent; and the last full financial year of a Labor government, when it was 23.9 per cent.
This Liberal-National Party government is fond of making the claim—and I would contend it is a false claim—that it is a low-taxing government. If you compare the government revenue figure for the current financial year of 23.2 per cent of gross domestic product with that for the last year of a Labor government, 23.9 per cent, it is a lower figure. But that is a very superficial comparison and a superficial analysis. It is an analysis on the basis of which the Liberal-National Party makes a false claim. The historical data omits one important tax, and that is the GST. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, in preparing this year's budget—and I understand he did the same thing last year—excluded GST revenue from Commonwealth revenue as a percentage of the tax revenue that the Commonwealth collects.
The GST is a Commonwealth tax. The money might end up in the hands of the states, but it is a Commonwealth tax, collected under a Commonwealth head of power. The government proudly boasts of its implementation of the GST, although we notice that references made by the government—including the Assistant Treasurer, who I see sitting on the benches opposite—to the GST have been moderated somewhat in recent times. The government's bubbling enthusiasm for the merits of a GST has waned significantly in recent times. If we are to maintain the government's historical comparison about the level of taxation in this country, it is grossly misleading on the part of the Liberal-National Party to exclude GST revenues. If we include GST revenues in the list of Commonwealth revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, this Liberal-National Party is the highest taxing government since World War II, contrary to its claim that it is a low-taxing government.
Let me go back to the issue of excise revenue. It is important to mention in this context the flat-on-your-face acrobatics we have seen in the recent past with respect to beer excise. Many people in Australia would recall that, in the lead-up to the last federal election, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, made a number of claims about the price impact of the GST on beer in this country. On the John Laws program on 23 September 1998, the Prime Minister said:
There'll be no more than a 1.9% rise in ordinary beer.
The Prime Minister reiterated that commitment on the Alan Jones program. He told Mr Alan Jones that there would be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in the price of ordinary beer. That was on 14 August 1998, in the lead-up to the last election, when the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and others were very anxious to play down the impact of the GST on a variety of sectors of the Australian economy. Mr Howard said categorically that there would be a 1.9 per cent rise in the price of ordinary beer. This was applauded by beer drinkers around Australia. The Herald Sun at the time, on 28 July 1998, screamed in a banner headline: `Drinks all round'. Pub drinkers would pay about the same with the goods and services tax as they would prior to the implementation of the GST.
The ANTS package was the government's tax bible that they produced prior to the last election. In the ANTS package, the commitment that the price of beer would not rise by more than 1.9 per cent was a promise made in respect of packaged beer. Most beer drinkers in this country did not have the ANTS package handy. I cannot recall a pub or a club that I visited at that time having the ANTS package sitting up on the bar for the beer drinkers to flick through, to make sure that the Prime Minister's commitment was correct. This commitment was a promise made in respect of packaged beer.
The Prime Minister did mislead the Australian public—most importantly, Australian beer drinkers—when he claimed that the price of ordinary beer would increase by 1.9 per cent when that figure related to the price of packaged beer. I would also argue that most beer drinkers in this country who heard the reports of the promise given by the Prime Minister would regard a reference to ordinary beer as a reference to the price of a glass of beer that they would consume over the bar in hotels and clubs in this country. So, during the election campaign, the government made a grossly misleading comment about the price of beer. The incorrect commitment given by the Prime Minister was finally exposed for what it was when Treasury officials at Senate estimates committee hearings last February—on 8 February, to be precise—finally admitted, under questioning from Labor senators at that hearing, that the price of a glass of beer in pubs and clubs would rise by around seven per cent, not the 1.9 per cent that the Prime Minister indicated during the election campaign.
In fact, by way of analogy, the price of a glass of beer across the bar was to go up by seven per cent, and Treasury officials confirmed that the price of imported French champagne would only go up by two per cent. This was the sort of appalling inequity associated with the introduction of a GST in this country. The Liberal Party were looking after the top end of town by making sure that the price of French champagne would only go up by two per cent but were delivering an increase in the price of a glass of beer of some seven per cent, and that gives a real indication of the priorities of the government in this country.
Further to that, there were some interesting comments by a former Liberal federal member of parliament who was defeated in the 1998 election. Mr Eoin Cameron, following his defeat, repackaged himself as a radio talkback show announcer. Mr Eoin Cameron, who was a member of the government until 1998, said on 8 March 2000:
The government has no mandate to increase the excise by the amount it is proposing. To do otherwise is to let down the battlers that it purports to represent. And I note that a bottle of an expensive imported champagne will go up by less than a middy. If, after the first of July, beer goes up by more than 1.9 per cent, not only will the government have misled the community but it will also have misled its own members because no one was told that a middy of beer would be going up by nine per cent.
Here is Mr Eoin Cameron, a member of the Liberal-National Party government—at least until his defeat in 1998—who participated in the creation of the GST package, pointing out the deception by the Liberal-National Party, at least as enunciated by the Prime Minister at a later date in respect of the price of beer.
It got worse. When this deception was pointed out by the Labor Party in respect of the price of beer, the brewers also pointed out the problems that were arising. The Treasurer then proceeded on a tirade of abuse at certain segments of the brewing industry in this country. He referred to Lion Nathan, a major part of the brewing industry in this country, as being foreign owned. Big deal! There are lots of companies in this country that criticise government policy that are foreign owned, but it is the first time I can remember the Treasurer—any Treasurer, for that matter—attempting to rebut the campaign by the brewing industry by abusing them and referring to them as foreign owned. 
He then went on and got stuck into Mr Kevan Gosper, who apparently is a director of Lion Nathan, and proceeded to lecture the beer industry on their ethics because Mr Kevan Gosper was a member of the board of Lion Nathan. After the unrelenting campaign led by the Australian Labor Party to hold the government to its promise that the price of beer would not go up by more than 1.9 per cent, the government finally backed down in respect of its commitment on the GST and ensured that the price of a glass of beer in this country would not rise by more than 1.9 per cent. 
Finally, in conclusion, whilst earlier I touched on the list of government revenue as outlined in the current budget paper on page 5-9, I do have to comment on the revenue as listed for superannuation taxes. I am pleased the Assistant Treasurer is in the chamber, and I ask him to answer the point I am now going to make. Taxes from superannuation funds are listed for 2001-02 to raise $4.3 billion.
—Has this got anything to do with the bills, Nick?
—It is to do with government revenue, and it is to do with government honesty.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Minister, you are not in your seat. Interjections, in any case, are disorderly.
—Okay, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—You were not called, Minister.
—I hope that, at the appropriate time, the Assistant Treasurer can respond to my request on this issue. With respect to taxation and government revenue, superannuation taxes are listed at $4.3 billion. There is, I note, a reference to this including the infamous superannuation contributions surcharge, a tax by another name. In passing, I note the superannuation surcharge was a tax and was another breach of the election commitment in 1996 that there would be no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. We have ended up with a further tax on superannuation.
I understand that the superannuation surcharge tax raised $577 million in the last financial year. However, nowhere does it disclose what it will raise in the current financial year. I did ask for this information at Senate estimates. It has been detailed in previous budget papers. It highlights the level of cover-up and the level of dishonesty in the budget papers when the revenue to be derived from this new Liberal Party tax is not disclosed. I do have it on confidential advice—from a leak from Treasury—that the superannuation surcharge tax will collect some $750 million in the current financial year. I would appreciate it if you would confirm that figure, Senator Kemp, whilst you have the opportunity.
Before I sit down, I should indicate that the Labor opposition are supporting the legislation that is in front of us. It represents the successful culmination of holding this government accountable and holding it to the commitment that the GST would not mean an increase in the price of petroleum products in this country.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-06-20,"—Normally ministers stand up and thank senators for their contributions to the second reading debate. I am going to break with that precedent. Senator Cook's speech on the tariff bills was ordinary, to say the least. It went through the usual tired old lines that the Labor Party comes up with. I listened to Senator Sherry's speech in vain to hear anything that related to the bills. Now he is trying to pin me on superannuation. The word `superannuation' does not appear in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, which is not surprising as it deals with fuel and fuel excises. Senator Sherry then wanted to discuss the overall government spending and collection of revenue, then he wanted to discuss beer excise and then he wanted to discuss superannuation. He did not turn his mind to the bills until, I must confess, the last couple of sentences. We waited in vain for that.
Senator Sherry, I know that you have certain obsessions in relation to superannuation. I think we should have a good debate on superannuation. Why don't you move an MPI motion one day so that we can have a debate on superannuation? Frankly, like everyone else, I am trying to discover what your policy is. I notice that the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, was asked yesterday—and I think that he is responsible for superannuation in the Labor Party, but you and I know that you are really responsible for superannuation—
—No.
—Be fair, Senator Sherry.
 (Senator McKiernan)—Order! Minister, you should be directing your remarks to the chair. When you make the comment `you are really responsible' you are actually talking to me, and I have no responsibility whatsoever. So address your remarks to the chair. Senator Sherry, if you could restrain yourself as well.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Of course your ruling is quite appropriate. My remarks should be addressed through you. Unfortunately, despite my well-known self-control, I was provoked just slightly by Senator Sherry. But I will try to ensure that it does not happen again.
—I will assist you.
—I wanted to indicate what Mr Kelvin Thomson said yesterday. The Labor Party have been in opposition for five years. Senator Sherry has spent a lot of time on superannuation. I do not say that he knows much about it, but he has spent a lot of time on superannuation. One would have thought that after five years a policy could have been produced on something. I would bet that, because of Senator Sherry's interest in this matter, and because of Kelvin Thomson's interest in this matter, the Labor Party could have, after five years, come up with a few policies on superannuation. That would not be unreasonable to expect. Senator Murray knows what is coming, and that is why he is smiling. He has worked it out. Yesterday, Mr Kelvin Thomson was asked in relation to superannuation: what will the Labor Party be doing? Do you know what he said? He said, `We are going to have an inquiry after the election.' I do not know whether this is the ninth inquiry or the 10th inquiry or the 15th inquiry. Could someone in the Labor Party produce a policy on something?
—What is your policy other than to increase taxation?
—Order, Senator Sherry!
—Senator Sherry got me speaking about superannuation, but I just want to get that on the record because I think it is important. Senator Sherry, I think you have to take over the superannuation portfolio. 
—Minister—
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I know what you are going to say and I stand corrected. I have to say that it is time for Senator Sherry to take over that portfolio. He has worked hard at it. I made an unkind comment and maybe he can prove me wrong—maybe he does know something about superannuation. After five years the shadow Assistant Treasurer says, `Yes, we are going to have an inquiry after the election on superannuation.' It was a very ordinary effort, I thought. It is time that Senator Sherry was called back onto the list to deal with this matter.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The Assistant Treasurer referred to relevance earlier in the context of superannuation. He has now spoken for five minutes on superannuation; I think my reference went for one minute. Surely, he is condemned by his own words in terms of relevance and should come back to the issue of excise tax.
—Thank you, Senator Sherry. I note your comments, but I do suggest that he is responding to remarks that were made in earlier speeches and there is a degree of latitude extended to further speakers. But I would remind the minister of the matter that is before the chamber at the moment.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for your wise ruling, as always. Now that I have responded to Senator Sherry on superannuation, let me deal with some of the other matters. 
I have to say that the vast amount of Senator Cook's comments were essentially a political rant, but there was one issue that I would like to respond to. He was worried about the time taken by truckies to access the rebate. Senator Cook was talking about the road grant delivered under the government's Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. The advice that I have received—and I think Senator Cook would be interested in this—is that the majority of claims are paid within 14 days. Claimants can claim via the ATO electronic interface to reduce the payment time. I can also inform Senator Cook that the ATO is examining the point-of-sale solutions to further improve the payment system. Senator Cook raised what he saw was an issue, and I hope that comment provides some comfort to him.
In response to Senator Murray's contribution, I have to say that Senator Murray tries to get into the issues, and sometimes he succeeds. Senator Murray and I do not agree on a lot of things, I have to say. Senator Murray openly admits that he is a taxing man and a government spending man. He is frank with those views. I am not sure that they are views that are in line with the majority of the Australian community, but Senator Murray has had the honesty to inform the Senate of his views—which puts him in stark contrast with the Labor Party, from whom it is extremely difficult to get any views on any particular issue. Their solution to any problem is, `Let's have an inquiry.' That is a bit like the Bracks government, because that is the general line that Mr Bracks takes on any problem.
Let me make a few comments on the bill. The bill is widely welcomed. It gives effect to the government's commitment to abolish the automatic six-monthly indexation of fuel excise to increases in the consumer price index. On 1 March this year, the Prime Minister announced a package of government measures to cut diesel and fuel excise. Included in that announcement was an immediate reduction in the excise on unleaded petrol of 1.5c per litre, with proportionate cuts in other fuels. In addition, the Prime Minister announced that legislation would be introduced in the parliament as soon as possible to abolish indexation of excise and customs duty for all petroleum fuels. These fuels include leaded and unleaded petrol, diesel fuel, aviation fuels and burner fuels such as fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene. The amendments in this bill give effect to the government's announcement by offering the indexation provisions of the Excise Tariff Act to exclude all petroleum free products from the application of the provisions for the indexation period commencing 1 August 2001 and any subsequent indexation period.
Automatic six-monthly indexation of excise was introduced in 1983 by the Hawke Labor government. Its abolition in respect of petroleum fuel products will be a significant discipline on governments now and into the future. Under the previous Labor government, for the historical record, it is worth mentioning that fuel excise rose from some 6c per litre in 1983 to 34c per litre in 1996. From 1983 to 1996, the excise went up from 6c per litre to 34c per litre. This was due to a combination of excise indexation and discretionary budget increases in fuel excise such as those in the notorious 1993-94 budget. For example, in the final three years of the Keating government, fuel excise rose roughly 8c per litre, consisting of discretionary budget increases of 5c per litre and a further rise of 3c per litre due to indexation. I think those figures alone put into context some of the remarks of Labor senators, who have tried to convey a completely different impression.
By contrast, the Howard government has made discretionary cuts to the excise rate. The excise on diesel and unleaded petrol was reduced by 6.7c per litre on 1 July 2000 to ensure that the pump price need not rise with the introduction of the goods and services tax. The excise rate was cut again, following the Prime Minister's announcement of 1 March, by 1.5c per litre, effectively offsetting the indexation that took place in February this year. On top of these discretionary cuts, the automatic indexation of fuel excise will be abolished by the bills before this Senate. Complementary amendments for equivalent imported goods are contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-20,"—This package of bills, which comprises the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001, the Import Processing Charges Bill 2000 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2000, represents a substantial change in the way that Customs interacts with the import and export industries. The bills do four broad things: they create the legal framework for mandatory electronic reporting of cargo movements, they make provision for compliance management tailored for different industry sectors, they alter controls over cargo movement and they create new cost recovery arrangements to support the changes to cargo processing. The main bill in this package is the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001. This is a large, dense and complex bill in both subject matter and drafting. The evolution of this particular legislation is not, we believe, an example of efficient government legislation.
I think there is another sign here that the government is operating on automatic. We saw signs of that this morning with the environmental legislation and we are seeing it again now. For instance, the explanatory memorandum does in fact do little explaining. It is extremely confusing. I think industry groups have made a pertinent point that the explanatory memorandum contains errors. There has been a cut and paste exercise from previous discussion papers and it is not an accurate guide as to the provisions of the legislation. This sort of explanatory memorandum is not acceptable because it shows a contempt for parliament, and it also shows a real lack of understanding of the importance of the explanatory memorandum in the statutory interpretation process that courts get involved in. As I say, this is a sign that the government has taken its hands off the wheel and that other people are running the agenda.
The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry. During the inquiry's hearings it became quite clear that, although the intent and framework of the legislation were welcomed and supported by industry, there are a huge number of problems with both the form and the process. It disturbs the opposition, and it should disturb parliament, that so many industry groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which Customs consulted with industry on the legislation. The bill has had something like a 10-year gestation period, yet it appears that, in the last 18 months, Customs has disposed of a long history of cooperation and, as such, produced a bill that has so many problems it simply is not possible to address them all in the context of a second reading speech.
We are aware that Customs disputes industry claims that consultation was inadequate. However, we have to confront the fact that so many industry representatives are expressing disquiet about the way in which the bill has emerged in its present form, and it is not possible to dismiss those concerns as being without some substance. So we believe the government should be condemned for the way in which the legislation came before parliament: with poor consultation, allowing an atmosphere of suspicion and doubt to develop between Customs and industry and for the less than satisfactory drafting of both the explanatory memorandum and the legislation itself.
We also believe the government should be condemned for bringing the bill before the parliament when it contains yet another example of the government's disregard for the burdens it continually places on small business. For instance, the bill provides for the Customs compliance reporting date to be one day after the end of every month. At the same time, the GST compliance reporting date is 21 days after the end of every month. This means that there are two different reporting cycles for revenue collection activities—more bureaucratic red tape, more paperwork and more and more problems because of this government's GST and insensitivity to the plight of small business. When it comes to this legislation, the victims we are really talking about are involved in the huge and diverse range of small businesses across this country, an ever-increasing number of whom are involved in the import and export business. The government is showing a lack of sensitivity to their plight. As I say, two reporting dates in one month is an example of that.
I understand the government has agreed to support the Democrats amendment to the bill that allows Customs to prescribe an alternative reporting date through the regulations. In a sense, that is really not good enough. The government should have been aware of this problem for quite some time and it should not have left it to the last moment to be forced into a response. It should have planned for it. Leaving it up to Customs to have the ultimate power as to whether that date is set and when it is set is also something that should not be allowed. This is a problem of the government's own making. It is the GST, it is a lack of regard for the processes of small business and a lack of any real understanding of the enormous tasks involved in import and export businesses. The government seems to be intent on throwing up more problems, not removing those that are there now.
There are a number of other flaws within the substance of the bill. Once again, inadequate consultation is relevant. We have received representation after representation from industry groups disgruntled at the way in which the trade modernisation process has taken shape in the legislation. We—and I am sure we are not the only ones—are constantly told that it is substantially different from the models discussed with industry during the consultation phase. So that is another problem. It is clear from the Senate committee process that that committee did not have enough time to uncover or inquire into the depth of all the issues associated with the legislation. So I think that puts the parliament, the opposition and I think the Australian Democrats in a very difficult situation. This is the biggest legislative reform package to the Customs Act since its introduction in 1901. There is broad support for the intention of the bill and for the majority of the reforms it contains. But there are serious flaws within the bill that raise the question of whether or not it should actually proceed as it is currently drafted. The industry working group on Customs went so far as to recommend to the Senate committee that the bill be held up until it is substantially redrafted.
We have given great consideration to this matter. We are faced with a situation where we cannot possibly micromanage this legislation for the government. It has huge drafting problems in the legislative process that really cannot be cured from opposition. Yet we acknowledge the importance of reforming many of the processes of Customs. We do not want to hold up the legislation—in a sense, we do not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater—so we will allow the passage of the legislation. In doing so, we signal that we have concerns with it. We signal that, specifically, we have two major concerns. There are two major proposals and aspects of the bill that the opposition will not support. In fact, we will move amendments in the committee stage that address these concerns. Unless the government supports these amendments, we will not support the legislation.
The first aspect is the use of strict liability offences in the penalty regime. Strict liability offences have been used by Customs since 1998. However, there has always been the availability of an appeal mechanism, an appeal to the AAT. The current admin penalty system is limited to duty related errors appearing on import entries and refund applications only. The government wants to introduce a new strict liability regime via this bill that removes the avenue of appeal. Anyone who has had any experience with business and its relationship with Customs must, I think, be very afraid of this sort of proposal. Over the years as a member of parliament and senator, I have had quite a number of instances where I have had to make representations on behalf of business. The degree of arrogance, the self-claimed immunity and the unresponsiveness that these people find time and time again is something that we should be curing, not giving a green light to. Once you remove these avenues of appeal, you basically endorse that sort of conduct. You let it off the leash.
The government claims that this regime is needed to preserve appropriate border control and at the same time facilitate the move towards the anticipated self-assessment regime for Customs clearance. Essentially, Customs—and through them the government—argue that a strict liability regime is necessary to uphold the integrity of a self-assessment system. It is also important to uphold the integrity of the public sector and its processes. To quote the words used by Senators Lundy and Cooney in the committee's minority report on this bill:
Due process should never be confined to accommodate even the noblest of causes. Its attenuation in the present instance ought be rejected.
When they say `the present instance', I think they very much had in mind the experience small business across this country has with Customs.
This bill will repeal the current administrative penalty provisions and replace them with a three-tiered system of strict liability offences for a range of regulatory breaches: (1) Customs may prosecute for a strict liability offence where fault must be proven; (2) Customs may prosecute for a strict liability offence where an infringement notice is not appropriate or where the person elects not to pay an infringement notice; and (3) Customs may issue an infringement notice in lieu of prosecuting for a strict liability offence, which will attract a penalty of one-fifth of the maximum that a court could impose with a matter successfully prosecuted.
There is no indication in the legislation as to how this regime will be administered. Customs have advised that there are non-binding draft principles for administering the proposed penalty regime. Given that this has had a 10-year gestation period, you would have thought they could come up with something better than draft non-binding principles. The committee recommended that these guidelines become a disallowable instrument. It is our understanding that the government may very well be forced into accepting that recommendation—and so it should. We will support such an amendment, but it is not sufficient for us to address the problems associated with the proposed strict liability regime. Such a regime would confer an unfettered discretion on decision makers in relation to the imposition of penalties. The absence of merit review is of concern to us. The cargo reporting offences prescribed relate in the main to data provided by unrelated parties. Local cargo reporters are primarily a conduit for this data; they are not originators of it at all.
The government comes up with the claim that it needs this to protect the community as part of the National Illicit Drug Strategy. I am sure we will hear that argument during this debate, but it has no foundation. Strict liability, as it is being proposed, is being applied to the accuracy of paperwork—to data reporting. Let us face it: the Trimbolis of this world are not known for their propensity to declare their cargoes. The government is drawing a long bow here. It is the view of the Law Council that the penalty provisions were drafted in haste and without proper consultation. I think the concerns of the Law Council hold substantial weight. They are: that the strict liability penalty regimes are not appropriate in areas such as Customs, where the complexity of the legislation in practice can lead to many inadvertent errors; that the availability of the defence of strict liability in the Criminal Code is of little comfort to members of industry whose breaches are either inadvertent or caused by others; and that the ability to invoke those defences is adversely affected by the cost to legally challenge prosecutions. 
We also need to take into account the fact that, although the Attorney-General has granted a reference to the Law Reform Commission's review on civil and administrative penalties, it seems that another arm of his bureaucracy, Customs, are moving to pre-empt that inquiry. We find that quite curious. It is, in a sense, putting the cart before the horse. We do not believe the bill should proceed and pre-empt the findings of the ALRC. We can invoke the experience of the New Zealand Customs Services, where they have tried a similar approach and it has proven not to have worked. 
In conclusion on that point, the opposition will not support the introduction of the strict liability regime. At the committee stage we will move amendments that will allow these offences that currently operate as strict liability offences to remain as such, but the amendments will remove the strict liability element from any new offences introduced under this bill. 
The second aspect of concern to us in this current debate relates to the introduction of new arrangements through which clients will be able to communicate electronically with Customs. Section 126D of the bill would enable the CEO to gazette the information technology requirements that must be met by those wanting to communicate with Customs. This section was the subject of concern during the committee inquiry. The majority report recommended that Customs should be required to consult with industry pursuant to section 126D being gazetted. We agree with that recommendation. We are concerned, however, given Customs' track record, about the quality of consultation that we can expect. It appears that there is a real mistrust between industry and Customs, and I think we have substantive grounds to be concerned that issues will not be discussed in a meaningful way during these consultations. 
In addition, there is a range of other issues associated with this aspect of the bill which are causing a great deal of anxiety within the industry and which we are extremely concerned about. The inquiry did not cover all relevant associated issues with Customs information technology and communications facilities. The existing Tradegate system is an industry-Customs owned system run through contract by Connect.com. Tradegate was formed 12 years ago as part of the government's waterfront strategy to facilitate electronic commerce to service the transport, handling and clearance of Australia's trade. This system is going to be replaced. How it is going to be replaced by Customs is unclear, as is the involvement of EDS—an organisation which seems to have Customs well and truly trapped within its sphere of influence. 
Under this legislation, the communications interface will change from being owned by industry—Tradegate and its contractors—to being owned and managed by the Customs department and its outsourcers, EDS. And haven't Customs had enough problems with EDS and their system so far—enough problems for us not to have real confidence in the way this might proceed! During the inquiry, the committee heard evidence that the bill would increase costs on small business, including exporters, importers, agents, brokers and forwarders; that the technology relied on in the bill will not take Australian industry forward; and that the removal of Tradegate will restrict industry choice and hinder the development of industry based services. These are serious allegations, and we believe they should be fully explored.
The Custom Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia have raised serious concerns about the cost implications for industry of adopting the Customs Connect Facility proposed by Customs. Specifically, the council have accused Customs of paying insufficient attention to the downstream cost implications of compulsory communications with Customs through the CCF. They claim that the hardware and software requirements of the new system, when combined with staff retraining, would cost industry more than $17 million in the first year, on top of the document retention costs of $2.5 million plus existing cost recovered Customs charges.
That council has called for a separate Senate inquiry into Customs electronic information and transaction systems, existing and proposed. The Australian Federation of International Forwarders have informed both the Senate committee and the opposition that they are strongly opposed to the new arrangements. They also claim that there is doubt as to whether the present state of connectivity would suit the peak demand of air freight exporters.
There is also a range of issues relating to outsourcing Customs IT which we believe warrant further scrutiny. These issues have been raised time and time again in this place but also in the estimates process. In a submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, the industry working group representing a whole list of organisations stated:
The IWGC is mindful that the original urgency attached to the passing of the Bills may well have been overtaken by the time lag in development of the IT systems that underpin the “Trade Modernisation” initiatives of the ACS.
The IWGC submitted that the bills be deferred and be subject to an urgent, detailed, joint Australian Customs Service and industry review under the auspices of the Senate. This is not just a little irrelevant organisation; it is an organisation that represents a substantial proportion of the industry. Its concerns cannot be taken lightly. While we are not convinced that the entire bill needs to be held up, we do believe it is important to have the sort of inquiry that the group recommends. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for:
	(i)		introducing important legislation without conducting adequate consultation with industry; and
	(ii)	placing yet another burden on small business in the form of the dual GST and Customs compliance reporting dates and failing to find a solution to this problem before the Parliament considers the legislation; and
	(b)	resolves that the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report by the last sitting day in December 2001:
	(i)	the processes involved in, and the consequences of, the outsourcing of the Australian Customs Service's (ACS) information technology;
	(ii)	the benefits and problems associated with the current and proposed ACS communications systems, including (but not limited to) Tradegate and the Customs Connect facility;
	(iii)	the needs and capabilities of all sections of industry in respect of ACS information technology and communications systems;
	(iv)	the way in which the ACS has conducted consultation with industry in relation to information technology and communications systems; and
	(v)	issues associated with the involvement of the ACS in e-commerce”.
I recommend that amendment to the Senate.
As I said earlier in my speech, this legislation is very much about maintaining accountability and ensuring the processes that an ever growing part of Australian industry have to work with are suitable. To give Customs unbridled power in some areas and to allow them to move into a new IT system without adequate scrutiny I think would be letting down that large portion of Australian industry.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-20,"—We are dealing here with the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001 and related bills. These bills have long been in gestation—over the period of both the Labor and coalition governments' tenure—and have been subject to reasonably thorough consultation and have been through Senate committee review. There is broad industry support for these bills.
The bills seek to modernise Customs' interaction with import and export activity and to increase their capacity to target tax avoiders and unlawful activity. As stated in the second reading speech, the package of bills attempts to achieve modernisation through four key strategies: establishing a legislative framework for mandatory electronic reporting of cargo movements, providing for compliance management that avoids a `one size fits all approach' to the multiple industry sectors which Customs affects, improving controls over cargo and cargo movements, and introducing new cost recovery arrangements to support the changes to cargo processing.
The legislation introduces a new regime for the operations of the Australian Customs Service and related activities. The legislation introduces improved IT processes. It also increases the number of offences under the legislation and makes a number of those strict liability offences. That is a matter which has caused us some concern. The government's stated intentions are also: to complement other initiatives under the Tough on Drugs strategy by improving border surveillance, to enhance the system of reporting to Customs by introducing electronic business management, and to improve cargo control where there has been a failure to meet regulatory requirements.
This package of Customs legislation relates to one of the most important aspects of a national government's responsibility to its people: the defence of its nation's borders. Given we live on the earth's largest island, that responsibility presents an even greater challenge than might be the case for other countries. While this responsibility obviously extends to a whole range of government agencies, in peacetime the role fulfilled by the Australian Customs Service is perhaps even more important than that of the military. This is because of the nature of the activities it monitors.
The role which Customs fulfils involves the supervision of activities which potentially represent a much more subtle but a much more dangerous invasion of our borders. Customs responsibilities are more important because they are exercised every day at a wide range of locations with a large number of industry partners—over 95,000 such partners a year, in fact. Much has been made in recent years of these responsibilities, in particular with regard to the fight against the illegal drugs in our community. In my reference to the dangers that invade our borders, people would obviously have picked up drugs as being a key part of the danger.
It is a campaign that, while sometimes overstated, still remains an important element of the harm minimisation approach that Australia has adopted with regard to drugs. Illicit drugs, however, are by no means the only goods that we are concerned to prevent from entering our country. Illegal firearms, other weapons and harmful and dangerous substances also have the potential to cause serious harm to Australians, to our industries, to our society and to our economy. The role of Customs in preventing the entry into this country of these types of goods or problems is, for that reason, very important.
Customs has for decades fulfilled this role effectively—some would argue not effectively enough. But there is always much more to be done: sometimes it is a question of culture; sometimes it is a question of legislation, which these bills seek to improve; sometimes it is a question of resources; and sometimes it is a question of political will. But, overall, Customs has attempted to fulfil the role effectively. However, the legislation we are considering today is an attempt by the coalition government to further improve and make more effective the exercise of a customs role. 
As the explanatory memorandum states, the aim of this package of bills is to support the modernisation of Customs' processes by: establishing a legislative framework for mandatory electronic reporting of cargo movements, and that gives the opportunity for the speed of access and understanding as to what is going on; providing for compliance management that recognises that the current `one size fits all' approach is no longer appropriate to the many industry sectors which deal with Customs, and that allows for some discretion and flexibility in contractual arrangements; improving controls over cargo and cargo movement—that is probably the most critical element of all; and introducing new cost recovery arrangements to support the changes to cargo processing.
While its main aim is to introduce improved cargo movement and management, the test with this legislation is for the Senate to assess whether it will meet the needs overall of enhancing the protection of our community. The task comes down to balancing the interests of our community generally with those of the people involved in importing and exporting goods to and from Australia. That balance is best represented in this legislation through the introduction of what is known as the accredited client program. The supporters of this program believe it will allow streamlined processing by Customs for those clients who can demonstrate that they are able to provide accurate information to Customs regarding their transactions—in other words, those with a good history will be allowed as much freedom as possible to get on with their business. 
It is a positive step in that those companies who put an effort into the provision of precise information and whose behaviour profile is a good one will be rewarded for such efforts. It is highly likely that such companies will benefit significantly from the ability to retrospectively account for their imports in a periodic declaration, rather than the current system which requires that documentation be lodged prior to their goods being released by Customs. One of our concerns, however, is the timing of the lodgment of such declarations. Despite the concern of some in the industry, the Democrats are persuaded that this program is unlikely to disadvantage small clients or those who have not participated in the pilot program. 
The `apply and be assessed' nature of this program will mean that access to it is balanced between those importers and exporters who do a large amount of trading and have a developed relationship with Customs and those who do a small amount of trading but, nonetheless, can demonstrate that they meet the criteria to become part of the program. It will be no news to the Senate to recognise the 80:20 principle is at play yet again in this industry where a small number do the vast bulk of the business. Underlying this trust based client accreditation program is the enforcement `stick' in this legislation—that of strict liability offences and increased penalties. 
My own minority report to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill shows that I have consistently been concerned at the significant increase in strict liability offences in legislation. But we have to recognise that we do have a system whereby there are three grades of liability: absolute, strict and fault liability. If we accept that those three grades are there, then we have to determine that there are circumstances in which we will agree that they should be present. Customs legislation is one area where, in our view, strict liability provisions are properly present; the issue, of course, is in which provisions. We felt that the government bills had clearly gone too far and, accordingly, we will be moving amendments to excise a number of strict liability provisions. 
The original bill obviously represented a desire for the wholesale implementation of a strict liability regime in the customs environment without sufficient thought given to a more effective, targeted use of such a penalty system. I do not quite think they were trying it on but they were certainly going too far. We were able to, we think, persuade the government that some of the strict liability offences proposed in the bill might not be as important or necessary as previously thought. We will be interested to see in the debate if they accept our position on that basis. We have agreed that we should support those provisions in the bill which are either a transition from the current legislation or essential to protect the integrity of the revenue base or those that support community protection objectives. 
I should make the point that we have seen large numbers of bills coming through the Senate which have had strict liability provisions attached to them, because the model criminal code now requires that we, as legislators, should be explicit about whether something is a fault liability, a strict liability or an absolute liability. That clarification has been coming through. By and large—in fact, I do not recall any occasion when it has not happened, but I might have missed it—the Senate has taken the view that those strict liability provisions that are transitions from current legislation should be allowed through. So we have kept to that principle. We have also had to take a view on those others that are in the bill which are there, in the terms of the government's explanatory memorandum, to protect the integrity of the revenue base or to support community protection objectives. 
When considering this legislation and listening to what witnesses before the committee inquiry had to say, I was particularly concerned to have those provisions relating to an alleged breach of administrative procedures removed from the ambit of strict liability provisions. Today I will move those amendments to remove from the strict liability regime provisions relating to: failure to keep or produce records or commercial documents; failure to answer some questions; failure to communicate with or make electronic payments to Customs after information systems failure; and failure to report about stores, prohibited goods as well as a number of other areas. We believe these amendments should strike a better balance between the need for enhanced customs compliance through a strict liability regime and the need to apply penalties appropriate to the type and significance of the offence committed. We would welcome both the government and the opposition's support for our position, but I am sure there will be a debate concerning it.
There are a number of other important aspects of the bills that are being introduced to facilitate cargo management and border control which are being considered today. These aspects include new export control measures, enhanced electronic communication mechanisms, replacement monitoring powers, duty payments and repayments, and document retention requirements. The Democrats support these measures as complementary to the major changes being proposed in the bills. 
I must make one comment on the new export control measures. As I indicated in the Democrats' supplementary remarks to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on this legislation, I am very concerned about the level of goods allegedly being diverted into the domestic market from export cargo facilities. As I have already outlined, it appears that the level of forgone revenue for whisky alone could be around $25 million per annum. The Democrats are seriously concerned that such a high level of apparent revenue seepage has not apparently provoked a serious investigation from the government either through Customs or through the Taxation Office. It would appear that at least some sort of analysis of the veracity of the claims represented by the submission from the United Distillers and Vintners Australia and Ernst and Young to the committee's inquiry into the bills is warranted. I have put a set of questions on notice concerning these matters. I think Customs' coverage of those matters during the inquiry was weak, and I would expect a far fuller response on that issue to be forthcoming.
I am again calling on the government to consider the prevalence of these sorts of activities and to assess the impact on forgone revenue, as well as with regard to effective cargo management and monitoring. At the least, I would hope that the review of this legislation, which is another committee recommendation strongly supported by the Democrats, contains some detail in relation to these claims and the impact of the new legislation on this issue. In making that remark, I note that people such as UDV and Ernst and Young believe that the legislation will in fact tighten up a number of the areas that they are concerned about. 
A further three amendments will be proposed by the Democrats, with the aim of enhancing the smooth implementation of the bills and the practical operation of the Customs system. Another of the concerns that I raised in our supplementary remarks was one that relates to the personal carriage of over-the-counter or prescription pharmaceuticals by airline crew and passengers. It appeared from the bills that these would have had to be reported to Customs for every journey, which clearly would be an unreasonable burden. I suspect it is an unintended consequence, and we will be seeking to have the provision modified in order to make the system work as it should. 
With regard to the new section relating to the power of Customs officers to seek answers to questions when they are executing a warrant issued under the provisions of the bills, we are seeking to ensure that the most appropriate person within the company answers those questions, if they are available—and I stress `if they are available'. It is obviously the intention of the bills that in serious matters Customs must be able to get answers to questions which could affect the immediacy of the matter, and in a serious way. The Democrats do not believe that it is appropriate, for instance, for a junior staff person to be questioned by Customs officers when the most suitable person to answer questions in those circumstances might be a more senior person available. Our amendments in this area seek to address this issue and place the obligation to answer questions about a company's affairs with those in the position with the responsibility to answer them. However, we recognise that in their absence questions will have to be answered on the spot by whomever is present and available.
Our final amendment of the three that I mentioned will seek to change the date on which periodic declarations are to be lodged with Customs. There was support in the committee's inquiry, most specifically from the Australian Importers and Exporters Association, for an alignment of the reporting dates for the ATO's business activity statement and the periodic declarations required of accredited clients by Customs. This is an area of some contestability because the Australian Bureau of Statistics are very tough about the dates they want material by and seem to have great influence with the Treasurer. I think these matters need to be resolved. They obviously cannot be resolved in the short time frame available to us and, therefore, they will need to be addressed by further consultation between industry and Customs and the ABS. The principle should be absolutely clear. As far as possible, reporting dates required by legislation of businesses should be coordinated such that they are consistent, and in this case they are not. 
The Democrat amendment will allow the minister, by regulation, to alter the reporting date. Frankly, it would have been more satisfying to be prescriptive about it, but we do not think the time available allows that. So should the minister, after consultation, consider that a better alignment of the reporting date is possible and achievable, we would expect the needs of industry and government to be met by doing that. I hope the government will agree to consider that issue favourably. We will obviously discuss further amendments as they arise on the floor of the chamber. I must say that I am pleased that the government has accepted the final recommendation of the legislation committee report. I am pleased that it has reiterated its intention in the chamber to review the legislation within three years of its royal assent. I am pleased that it has taken notice of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's recommendation. That is very important to us. 
In closing my second reading contribution, I turn to the opposition's proposed second reading amendment, which was circulated just prior to my rising to my feet. From a quick glance, I need to dissect some of its elements. It asks that the Senate condemn the government for introducing important legislation without conducting adequate consultation with industry. I am not sure that that is an accurate statement. As I said, and as I heard Senator Bolkus say, the legislation has been in gestation for 10 years, over the passage of two governments. It seems to me from the evidence we got that the consultation was reasonable. Whether it was adequate, I am not in a position to judge, but I did not hear anybody squealing that they had been affected by consultation. There is also the question of what `adequate consultation with industry' means. I have found throughout this debate a conflict between service providers, or people who think service providers are part of industry, and industry itself. To me, this is all about import and export, which is industry. Whilst service providers, customs agents and others are important, they are service providers and not the main proponents.
I have covered item 2 in my speech. On item (b), it is a failing to present such a reference without its being previously tabled and opened to consultation. We are not necessarily opposed to reviews of IT processes of this kind, but this is not the occasion to rush it through when I have had literally a few minutes to glance at it as it comes up. I say to Labor that if you want to resurrect—
—We have been talking to you about it for 10 days.
—I have not seen your item (b).
—We have been talking to your office about it for 10 days.
—You may have been talking to my office, but I had not seen it until it came through today. I am more than happy to discuss item (b) at some other time. We will oppose the amendment. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT AND REPEAL (INTERNATIONAL TRADE MODERNISATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-20,"—As has already been said, the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001, the Import Processing Charges Bill 2000 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2000 affect the way in which Customs is to carry out its work. I would like to start by, perhaps, being non-political. You gasp, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, but this chamber is shaped like an elongated horseshoe and it is structured so that there will be opposition.
—It is filled with horse manure.
—Senator Chris Evans says that it is filled with horse manure. I do not accept that, but I understand from where he comes. In the second reading speech the following appears:
The final element of this bill that I wish to emphasise is the revision of the powers of Customs officers to monitor compliance by industry. 
These powers are a vital adjunct to the controls I have mentioned. 
They have been drafted in accordance with the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills dated 6 April 2000 which examined entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation. 
I stress that the audit powers set out in this bill can only be exercised with the consent of the occupier of premises and without that consent, only on the basis of a monitoring warrant issued by a Magistrate.
I have to declare an interest: I am Chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which I think does great work, but its profile is not as pronounced as the profile of many another committee. On 6 April 2000 the committee produced a seminal report—as Senator Murray will agree, and so will the other members of the committee—on entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation. We on the committee thought that that report, like many a fine report that is produced by parliamentary committees—and, indeed, reports produced by other committees elsewhere—had gone into obscurity and that, even though the report contained profound words of wisdom, those words of wisdom were lost. But they had not been forgotten, and the minister for customs has referred to them in his second reading speech and has made use of them in the legislation now before us.
In those circumstances, it is proper to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Ellison—a fellow Western Australian senator to you, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles—in finding the proper balance to be struck between catching the people who breach the law and allowing the proper processes to take place so that we remain the society that we picture ourselves as being. It may be that the minister who is now looking after this legislation was also a party to this, because it is only recently that she left the portfolio. In any event, I would like to acknowledge that. You have to listen to people to gain the knowledge that you need to conduct this debate—indeed, any debate—in this chamber. I oftentimes get up in the Senate on issues to do with trying to find the balance between enforcement of the law and protection of people who are subject to it so that we can go ahead and be the decent society that I have talked about.
I now see in the chamber Peta Murphy, a very wise adviser to the shadow minister Mr Kerr, to me and to others on this side of the chamber. I suggest to people in the advisers box on the government side of the chamber that it would be well worth talking to Peta Murphy on occasions such as this.
As I have said, this is another bill that seeks to strike the right balance between bringing to justice or bringing to book people who break laws that are set in our society— that is essential, particularly when drug related offences are committed—and preserving the sort of society that we want to live in: one in which people cannot be accused falsely and cannot be put into prison without there being due process.
There is a tendency in the community at the moment to think that, for any crime that is committed, someone should end up being punished for it. That is the wrong way of looking at things. Some very terrible crimes are committed in the community and the people who committed them ought to be punished for them. However, we have to be sure that the people who committed the crimes are the ones who are punished for them. There are occasions when the wrong people are taxed with the crime—and that is a proper expression to use—when they should not be. In other words, people are punished for crimes they did not commit and, for that reason, we have a process set out to avoid the dreadful mistake where someone who did not commit a crime is punished for it. That is the first thing about due process.
The second thing about due process is that there are some things that we, as a decent society, would not do. As a society, we do not resort to torture to find out who committed a crime. In days gone by, the society from which we developed did use torture, and torture is used around the world today. That is the sort of thing we would not do. There are just some things that we would not do as a society. That is the second reason why we have due process.
While I am on this topic and talking about the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I must say that there is a presumption somehow that parliament cannot really look after civil life, or proper process, or ensure that civil rights are maintained. The presumption is that you need courts, tribunals and a good legal profession that is interested in these things, and that somehow parliament is to be left outside this. I notice that in many conferences about due process, about matters of rights and about conventions such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, there are people from universities and law schools, lawyers and learned professors from overseas giving talks on the subject, but rarely do you get a parliamentarian speaking at these conferences, making a contribution and outlining what has happened in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, for example, or in the Senate committee that looks at regulations and ordinances. You rarely get that.
There is a division—and I think a false division—created between the mechanisms that parliament uses to maintain our rights and the mechanism used by people outside parliament, mainly lawyers. Being an old lawyer myself, and my wife being a lawyer and practising as such when she is not in Ireland, as she presently is, I simply say that I am not lawyer bashing now, but there is an inclination to think that we do not do as much as we ought to as parliamentarians. These comments arise out of the fact that, on this occasion, this legislation has been framed with the report of 6 April 2000 from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee very much in mind. I make this point to the minister who is responsible for the bill and to the minister at the table who preceded him: note was taken of that report in this legislation.
Much has been said about the strict liability provisions in the bill, and what has been said need not be said again. However, a lot of this arises from the fact that Customs has two functions to perform, one of which is to facilitate the export and import of goods. That function should be carried out with the great desire and ability to help people trade across Australia's borders. We are a trading nation, as has often been said in this chamber, and it is proper that trade be done as well as possible and Customs helps people trade. The bill contains provisions that deal with that and, if there is time at the end of my speech, I will come back to that point.
The other function of Customs is to enforce the law. That is a regulatory function. So Customs has a facilitating function and a regulatory function. Oftentimes one function affects another and, in this case, the regulatory function may well have affected the facilitating function. As a result of that, we have these provisions about strict liability. Strict liability offences have their place and the classic case of that is, of course, on the roads. That is done to maintain the safety of our roads. Much is at stake on the roads and that is why we have strict liability. People know what that is all about. If you go more than 60 kilometres per hour in a 60 kilometre per hour zone, you have committed an offence. The fact that you did not intend to do that is not the point. 
As has been said by speakers before me, the area dealt with in these bills might not be an area where that is applicable. You have people who have all sorts of things to do. For Customs to have the ability to punish people who have done wrong no matter what their intent is somewhat harsh. When we come to the committee stage, that may be well worth talking about. Then there is the issue of the facilitating functions of Customs, which has arisen from the change contemplated by these bills. There is to be an electronic communication between customers and Customs. That change is to go a particular way. I think there has been much said about that. The notes that Peta Murphy has given me say:
The existing Tradegate system is an industry/customs owned system, run through contract by Connect.com.
Connect is the company that provides the actual machinery by which the communication is made. The notes also state:
Tradegate was formed 12 years ago as part of the government's waterfront strategy to facilitate electronic commerce to service the transport, handling and clearance of Australia's trade.
That is about to be changed. Tradegate is to conclude its contract, which has only a limited time to go. When that has finished, it is proposed that another system will be set up. That is to involve EDS, another firm that is to provide this electronic communication. Customs is to outsource it to EDS and EDS is to carry on this work.
It has never quite been explained why there should be this change, and it has never quite been explained how this change is to be made. In the committee stage of these bills, the government would perform a great service to the people who use Customs, to Tradegate, to Connect and to us all if it would explain exactly what is the mechanism contemplated to enable people who want to use Customs to communicate with it electronically. Minister, you would know— because you were the minister at this time, before you went on to become a cabinet minister—that there has for some time been a particular way of dealing with Customs, and that is to be changed. The Labor Party has been told by the people concerned that there is an attempt to find out exactly what the new system is to be, and that explanation has not been forthcoming. It is hoped that that can be teased out in this debate. There are amendments to be made to these bills which have been discussed by Senator Bolkus.
—They have not been circulated, though.
—Senator Murray says that they have not been circulated yet.
 (Senator Knowles)—They have been circulated in the chamber.
—Senator Murray puts forward his hands and says he has not got them. Let us not have a great fight about this. Senator Murray, I think Senator Bolkus was saying to you that you understood the general thrust of this, that there is no doubt you are a man of some brilliance, that you are a man with a keen mind and are able to comprehend these things very rapidly, and that although you were not given the precise words in black-letter law you knew their intent and were therefore able to prepare yourself for this argument. That would be right. You comprehend the general thrust of it all. You are saying that you did not have it in black print, but you knew what it was all about. The nodding of the head indicates that. Having established that, I think I will sit down.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2001-06-20,"—Over the last day or two since the tabling of the report of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters there has been a curious reaction by the Labor Party to at least two important recommendations that were made by the committee. These recommendations cover proof of identity at the time of enrolment and the question of one vote, one value. You may ask: what could be more simple than these principles? It is a question that my colleague Senator Nick Minchin has been asking for some years since his term as a distinguished member of this electoral matters committee. And at this point I would like to acknowledge his advocacy of voter ID over a long period of time—interestingly against the views of some other members of the committee in the past. So the need for voter identity should be a simple matter of amending legislation. Indeed, it should. Proof of identity at the time of enrolment is surely a simple fundamental of democracy. The video shop asks for it; airlines ask for it for electronic tickets; you need it to open a bank account. So why would the ALP not support it for enrolment on the electoral roll and the privilege of voting in our elections?
Senator Faulkner claimed on the 7.30 Report on Monday night that voter ID would mean that `there'll be people who won't be able to vote in our electoral system' and that it would affect people `who are marginalised and disadvantaged in our community'. But the evidence to our electoral matters committee may give a clue as to the real reason the Labor Party is running this patronising and misleading line in relation to voter identity. For example, we heard evidence from 189 voters on the federal roll in New South Wales who all used the same post office box for their address on the roll.
—You want the Australia Card, do you?
 (Senator McKiernan)—Order, Senator Schacht!
—We uncovered a number of examples of blatant electoral fraud including the electoral roll registration of the now infamous Curacao Catt and a voter whose name curiously translated to Mickey Mouse. In fact, well-known roll rorter Lee Birmingham considered that false enrolments were possible and that not only did they take place but also the AEC appeared to be incapable of detecting them. This is the reason that Karen Ehrmann went to jail and maybe why the former deputy premier of Queensland, Jim Elder, resigned, and why perhaps just yesterday it was announced that four charges have been laid against Mr David Barbagallo, a former adviser to a Queensland Labor Party Premier. 
There is no doubt that the faith of the Australian community in the integrity of our electoral roll has been profoundly shaken by the evidence about Mike Kaiser, Tony Mooney, Shane Foster, Andy Kehoe and Grant Musgrove as well as Jim Elder and Karen Ehrmann. Of course these people all have one common characteristic: every single one of them is, or was, a member of the Australian Labor Party, the party of Senator Schacht, who has consistently and constantly interjected on this issue—and I am wondering why Senator Schacht would not join with us in trying to clean up the integrity of the electoral roll.
—You are talking about an Australia Card.
—Order, Senator Schacht!
—Some of these people have been convicted of electoral fraud. Some resigned with a lengthy mea culpa and others are awaiting the decision of the DPP in Queensland following evidence to the Shepherdson inquiry. So isn't it almost unbelievable that the current ALP Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, can claim that he knew nothing about electoral rorting when there was a senior adviser in the former Premier's office allegedly involved in such behaviour? 
—Acting Deputy President, can you please call Senator Schacht to order? He is being disorderly.
—What did they do in Queensland? Sixty-six seats to three was the election result in Queensland.
—Have you concluded your remarks, Senator Ferris?
—I have not concluded my remarks. I am having difficulty being heard.
—Before you continue, I have on a number of occasions called Senator Schacht to order. I am not sure that you would have heard that because you were on your feet and speaking. I would remind Senator Schacht that interjections are disorderly and when he is called from the chair to cease interjecting he is required to cease injecting. I hope that I do not have to call on you again during the course of Senator Ferris's contribution.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. David Barbagallo has now been charged with four counts of forgery. Now I understand—absolutely and perfectly—what Ms Karen Ehrmann meant when she said in her Townsville evidence that she was a `bit player in a well-known scheme'—`a very small fish', I think she said. So far from helping the marginalised and disadvantaged, could it be that Senator Faulkner's reason for opposing voter ID was actually much closer to home?
The second recommendation which I would like to cover this afternoon is one vote, one value, which is also, curiously, being opposed by the Labor Party. It strikes at the heart of our democracy, but does it strike at the heart of the democracy of the Australian Labor Party?
—Order, Senator Schacht!
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. If Senator Ferris is going to be so provocative with misleading facts, we are going to respond, even in the form of interjections.
—Order! There is no point of order. If there were to be a point of order, it would have been about your interjections. I have asked you to cease interjecting. I hope that I do not have to ask you again. There is no point of order.
—The second recommendation in relation to one vote, one value, which is being opposed by the ALP, strikes at the heart of our democracy. But does it also strike at the heart of the Labor Party's democracy? With union members barely making up 25 per cent of the work force now, it is hard for me to believe that they can still have 60 per cent of the vote within the ALP. It is pretty obvious to me why the ALP is so bitterly opposed to the implementation of this vital recommendation, when unions still have such a disproportionately high level of influence within the Labor Party.
Our one vote, one value recommendation guarantees greater power and representation to the rank and file members of the ALP and will at least try to restore fair and honest proportional representation. There is no doubt that this recommendation will cause some grief in the Australian Labor Party because the Senate and the House of Representatives are filled with trade union loyalists who have had the ultimate promotion and who will face something of a conflict of loyalty when this particular recommendation is debated in the chamber. The integrity of our electoral system must be more important than union power in the ALP. Surely there can be no greater democracy for the Labor Party than to give power back to their own rank and file. 
There are a number of other very important recommendations in this report, which was tabled in this chamber on Monday. The recommendations cover issues such as the timing of the closure of the rolls when an election is called, a streamlining of the process by which questionable voting takes place and, importantly, a doubling of the penalties for electoral fraud. The committee also recommended that, to test the integrity of the electoral roll, there be a roll cleansing in the federal seat of Herbert in Queensland, which covers the Townsville area, where the infamous Karen Ehrmann and her team operated so fraudulently but so successfully and initially undetected.
The integrity of the staff at the Electoral Commission is of the highest priority. The committee recommended that not only should the staff involved in the prevention and detection of fraud be appropriately trained for that job but those who have access to the roll be required to obtain a position of trust security clearance. There can be no more important priority for a government, and in fact for all political parties, than to ensure that our voting processes are clear and are cleansed of any possibility of fraud or covert manipulation. I urge all political parties to join with the government in implementing, as a matter of urgency, the very important recommendations of the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Electoral Matters</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2001-06-20,"—Senator Ridgeway asked me a question yesterday about the expansion of fuel volumes delivered to service stations, and I undertook to get him further information. I seek leave to incorporate a detailed response into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
SENATOR ADEN RIDGEWAY asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, on 19 June 2001:
“My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, are you aware that oil refineries are currently permitted to sell fuel to service stations at temperatures as high as 52 degrees, which results in the significant expansion of fuel volumes? Minister, given this fact, is it true that service stations sell fuel to motorists at about 15 degrees, after the fuel has significantly contracted? Is it not also true that, due to the contraction, an average of 2.5 per cent of the fuel the service station paid for disappears and that this is known as `phantom fuel'? Why hasn't the Minister stopped small service stations from being cheated, motorists from being ripped off and the government failing to receive large amounts of excise revenue, estimated to be in the vicinity of $200 million a year? Minister, isn't the phantom fuel practice a direct result of the government's failure to put in place proper legislation to prevent this ludicrous situation continuing?”
SENATOR MINCHIN-The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
The claims of intentional rorting by oil companies through sale of “phantom” fuel represent an unjustified attack on the integrity of petroleum suppliers in Australia. For example, I am advised that your reference to media reports of fuel being, sold at 52°C was the result of a faulty temperature gauge rather than fuel being exchanged at that temperature.
The volume of fuel delivered to a service station by fuel tankers will not necessarily correspond to the volume loaded into that tanker at the terminal due to changes in volume arising from variations in temperature during delivery. The difference in temperature along the distribution line is typically quite small and has a near negligible impact on the volume of petrol supplied. An 8°C fall in temperature is required to decrease the volume of petrol by 1 percent, however the temperature change along the distribution chain is typically less than 8°C
The issue of temperature correction of fuel is principally a matter for State and Territory Governments and will be discussed by ministers at the next meeting of the Ministerial Council of Consumer Affairs on 13 July 2001. This discussion will include consideration of the introduction of mirror legislation in each State to address the issue.
I understand the oil industry is supportive of temperature correction at the wholesale level as action at this level will capture the majority of volume changes without unwarranted expense.
Measures to address temperature correction at the retail level are not supported by the oil industry or this Government. Several reports were undertaken in the mid 1990s by the National Standards Commission, the Industry Commission, the CSIRO and Access Economics into the issue of temperature correction. From these reports it was concluded that fuel temperature correction measures at the retail level would result in consumers paying higher petrol prices and that from the national perspective it was not justified.
I note that variations in fuel temperature often work in favour of service station proprietors. On occasion the temperature in underground fuel storage tanks is found to be greater than the temperature at which the petrol left the refiner's or distributor's terminal. In such instances the service station proprietor has a greater volume of petrol to sell than was purchased. Nevertheless, as I mentioned earlier, the effect of temperature correction on volumes is typically negligible.
Although the majority of sales of petrol at the wholesale level are not currently corrected for temperature, it is not uncommon for temperature related volume changes to be taken into account when negotiating terms and conditions of these sales.
Finally I note that the use of a 15°C reference temperature for the collection of excise ensures that there is consistency in the taxation base and is in-line with international practice.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Petroleum Industry: Phantom Fuel</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
This bill implements a number of recommendations of the Intellectual Property and Competition Review (Ergas Committee). There has been no formal Government response to this review, and further, a number of recommendations from the Ergas Committee came after the consultation process and relevant bodies have therefore not been consulted on all recommendations. There is a lack of clarity as to intent of some changes and there are a number of changes to definitions in the Bill which may have quite important legal consequences. These changes to definitions go to the very heart of the patent system and need further scrutiny.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The emerging crisis in the provision of aged care and the failure of the Minister to properly provide for the needs of the elderly.
I have moved this matter of urgency today to raise serious concerns about the administration of aged care in this country. In fact, when considering what to concentrate on today, I had a multitude of issues that could be brought to the attention of the Senate and the Australian public. I think the Australian public are well aware of many of those issues. They include the bed shortages and the phantom aged care beds; the failure of the government to properly fund care standards; the budget black hole in the provision for aged care in future years; the critical shortage of skilled staff, particularly nursing staff; and the inadequate indexation of care subsidies which brought about that situation. 
There are a whole range of other issues, but I want to concentrate on the inconsistent application of accreditation standards within the aged care industry, the vast disparities in the treatment of various aged care providers and the failure to protect the interests of residents and their families. In particular, I want to concentrate on the Minister for Aged Care's treatment of provider Mrs Millie Phillips in Sydney and the way that the Department of Health and Aged Care and the minister have handled concerns about two of her nursing homes: the Ritz and Yagoona. 
The Yagoona story is a long and complicated one, but it raises very serious public policy issues about the administration of aged care in this country. On 10 November last year, the Yagoona Nursing Home, operated by Mrs Millie Phillips, was granted three years accreditation. That is the highest possible level. It received satisfactory ratings on all four care standards. But in April 2001, just five months later, an assessment team from the aged care status agency visited the home after concerns were raised about the care of the residents. The assessors spent three days inspecting Yagoona, and the 96-page report, which documents their findings, makes for shocking reading.
Five months after Yagoona received a clean bill of health, it failed all four of the key care standards and 20 of the 44 substandards. The home failed to meet standards on clinical and skin care, behavioural and continence management, nutrition and hydration, fire safety and record keeping. I do not have the time today to read the complete list of the failures at Yagoona. On two key standards, staffing and environment, Yagoona's performance was not only unacceptable; it was given the worst possible rating: that of critical. The accreditation guidelines state that any nursing home with one or more standards rated critical will not be accredited. Those are the formal accreditation guidelines which guide the work of the agency. In accordance with those guidelines, the report of the assessment team recommended:
... that the accreditation of the Yagoona Nursing Home be revoked.
The revocation of the nursing home's accreditation would stop its Commonwealth funding and effectively close it down. 
But some time between 23 April and 10 May, the recommendation was overturned. Yagoona's accreditation was not withdrawn; instead, it was reduced from three years to 18 months. This leaves a series of unanswered questions. Why were the accreditation guidelines ignored? Why was the assessment team's recommendation overturned? Why did the Yagoona Nursing Home, a home that had slid so far in just five months, receive special treatment—unprecedented and special treatment? Why did Mrs Millie Phillips enjoy the favour of the government in having the decision to close her nursing home down reversed? 
Labor put these questions to the Minister for Aged Care on 4 June. The minister stood before the federal parliament and said it had nothing to do with her. In her words, it was not a matter for ministerial judgment. Labor then asked the minister, Mrs Bishop, to confirm that the provider of the Yagoona Nursing Home, Mrs Millie Phillips, had donated $14,000 to the Liberal Party and asked whether that donation had in any way influenced decisions taken with respect to the nursing home. Before the minister could answer, the Speaker shut debate down. 
Mrs Bishop was so concerned to establish her ignorance and inaction with respect to Yagoona that she went on 2GB radio the next morning to wash her hands. She told Terry Willesee that she knew nothing about Yagoona until she `saw it in the paper'. She acknowledged that she had met Mrs Phillips, but claimed to have `no power under the act' to do anything about her case `nor would I, nor did I'. The minister, who was once the doyen of ministerial accountability, had certainly changed her tune. 
Later that day in parliament, Labor MP Julia Irwin asked the minister about Gordon Smithers, a 78-year-old veteran and ex-POW who was admitted to Yagoona for respite care in May this year. Mr Smithers and his family were so distressed by his care that his mates from the Liverpool RSL had him moved out of there within 24 hours. The minister claimed to be unaware of the case, despite the letter sent to her by the member for Fowler alerting her to Mr Smithers's distress.
But it is the history of the Yagoona Nursing Home that makes Minister Bishop's claims that she was unaware of problems with this home and this provider so implausible. The problems at Yagoona did not start in the early months of this year. It is a home with a troubling record of substandard care. On 15 February 2000, a Yagoona resident died at Bankstown Hospital of sepsis, caused by infected pressure sores. Her son has written to me about what happened. His mother was admitted to Yagoona due to dementia but was otherwise in reasonable health. While in the home, she developed a pressure sore, first documented in the clinical records on January 27. Neither her son nor her medical practitioner were notified of the severity of the pressure sore until her admission to hospital 12 days later. One week later, she was dead. But the son did not only write to me. He filed complaints with the Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme and the New South Wales health department and he wrote to Mrs Bishop. I have here a copy of the letter he received from the minister on 20 June 2000, expressing `regret that your experience of aged care has been distressing' and referring his complaint to the department.
Clearly, the minister knew about serious problems with Yagoona. The more important question is: why did Yagoona again get special treatment? In the same month as the minister was informed about the death of a resident at Yagoona, she was claiming to be a proactive minister. According to Minister Bishop, on hearing of the kerosene baths at Riverside, she worked through the night, sent the inspections teams in and used her powers under the act to impose sanctions and shut the home down. But when she receives a letter just a few weeks later advising that a woman had died after developing pressure sores in Yagoona she does not act at all. She does not phone the family. She does not send in the inspection teams. And four months later, her chief of staff sends the son an expression of regret and refers the complaint to the department.
Fortunately, the New South Wales Department of Health took the complaint seriously. They had a complaints investigation officer visit the home and by 27 March the findings of the investigation were in the son's hands. And they were serious findings. There had been another death in Yagoona due to failure to recognise the severity of a pressure sore just six months earlier. The investigating officer stated:
The fact that the same members of staff were involved in both matters is of extreme concern.
The two deaths at Yagoona and the subsequent failure to care properly for Mr Smithers raise a series of very serious questions about the care standards at Yagoona and about the roles of the department and the minister in ensuring the protection of the residents and those facilities. Why was one of the nurses being investigated by the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission still in a senior role at Yagoona until a few weeks ago? How could a home where two residents had died from infected pressure sores in a six-month period and that was under investigation by the New South Wales Department of Health receive the highest possible accreditation rating? How could a home granted three years accreditation fail on all four key care standards just five months later? If the New South Wales Department of Health found that the seriousness of the complaint and the fact that it was the second such incident warranted close and continuous monitoring of the `care, safety and quality of life of residents in the Yagoona Nursing Home,' why did Minister Bishop do nothing?
How can the minister claim that she first heard about problems at Yagoona when she read about it in the SydneyMorningHerald two weeks ago? Why was the recommendation to revoke Yagoona's accreditation rating overturned? Why weren't any sanctions imposed on Millie Phillips over her clear and repeated failure to provide proper care to the frail residents of Yagoona, yet other nursing homes with similar problems had been sanctioned? When did the minister first know about her own agency's serious concerns about the care of residents in Yagoona? Why didn't the minister intervene, as she claims to have done in relation to Riverside, to ensure that the serious concerns of the son of a deceased resident were properly investigated earlier last year?
Why was the Ritz, the other home owned by Mrs Millie Phillips, exempted from the government's care standards late last year, only to fail them again six months later? How many chances will Millie Phillips be given to meet care standards? Ultimately, the question that has to be answered here is: why have the government and the minister been so keen to bend the rules so that Mrs Millie Phillips's nursing homes stay in operation?
These are very serious concerns about the Yagoona and Ritz nursing homes. These are not just my concerns. These are concerns raised by the Aged Care Standards Agency officers—the same officers who recommended that accreditation of the Yagoona Nursing Home be revoked. They recommended it be closed down. They were the officers charged with the responsibility under the act to make the assessments. Having made the assessments, having spent three days there and having written a 96-page report, they said that it ought to be closed down. But some time after filing their report, somebody made the decision that it should be allowed to stay open—not only did they make the decision that it stay open but no effective action was taken to ensure the care of the elderly residents of Yagoona.
We made amendments to the Aged Care Act last year which gave the minister greater powers to send in care teams, to send in an administrator or to send in nursing personnel to ensure the care of the residents. These added to her powers to impose sanctions on providers. But none of those powers have been used in relation to Yagoona. There is no shortage of nursing homes around the country who have had sanctions imposed upon them. They, like the rest of the industry, want to know why it is that this Mrs Millie Phillips and the Yagoona and Ritz nursing homes have received special treatment. Why are they different? Why haven't they had to meet the standards of aged care that all other providers have to meet? Why haven't they received the punishment and the sanctions that all other providers are supposed to receive if they fail to meet those standards?
These are questions that remain unanswered. These are the questions that the families of the two deceased asked. These are questions that the family of Mr Smithers asked. These are the questions that a lot of people who have worked at Yagoona and the Ritz asked because they too expressed concerns about the standards and some of the operations of these two nursing homes. Originally, I thought that the answer may well be that, because of the severe bed shortages in this country—because of the minister's failure to supply enough aged care beds to care for those elderly that need them—the reason she failed to take action against these homes is because they are both large homes. She may have thought the fact that she did not have any alternative accommodation to care for the current residents of those homes meant she could not close them. I thought that the pressure of the unmet demand for aged care meant that she was afraid to take action against them. 
But clearly she had other powers; she had options other than to close them, which she has not exercised. She has not taken an interest in this matter. In fact, her public defence has been to say that all she knows about it is what she read in the paper. We must contrast that with the Riverside case where she claimed to be a proactive minister using her powers and intervening to care for the residents. But when it came to Yagoona and the Ritz her response was,  `Well, I read about it in the paper. That is the first I knew about it.' We now know that she knew about a lot more. 
We now know that she knew about the deaths, because the son of one of the residents who died had written to her and he had got a response from her office. They had taken four months to respond and they had not dealt with it adequately, but they finally did refer it off to the department. We know her office was contacted. She knew about concerns at Yagoona. We also know that she would have known about the New South Wales health department's investigations and their serious concerns. But, despite all of that, the minister did not take any action, and her department then gave Yagoona a full three-year accreditation later in the year. 
How can a nursing home under investigation receive the full three-year accreditation when these serious concerns remain unresolved? These are questions that have not been answered. The minister has failed to seriously try to answer any of these questions. So the families, friends and many former staff members are left wondering what it is about Yagoona and the Ritz that allows such special treatment. Their concerns were heightened by the fact that, when they were talking to the accreditation staff during their last visit and they were asking about whether or not Yagoona would be shut down because of its failure to meet the standards, they were reassured when told, `Don't worry. We know that Millie Phillips has contacts in high places. Nothing will be done that would injure her interests.' This is the evidence of senior staff at Yagoona. This is evidence, which they are prepared to provide, that says they were told that they knew no serious action was going to be taken because of Millie Phillips's connections. That provides one explanation because there is no other plausible explanation as to why they have received this special treatment.
We know that Millie Phillips, Liberal Party donor and friend of Bronwyn Bishop, has received special treatment while the elderly residents of Yagoona and the Ritz have received substandard treatment. One of her nursing homes, the Ritz, was exempted from the government's own care standards for six months. The other, Yagoona, remained open and without sanction despite failing all four care standards. Complaints of shocking, painful deaths have been made to the minister herself, yet she claims to know nothing of matters at Yagoona until she reads about them in the paper. 
She claims to have no responsibility for the agency. However, her most senior political campaign worker sits on the board. The aged care industry knows that Millie Phillips is a person that they do not want in their industry. The minister claimed that the accreditation process would clean up the industry, rid it of those providers not interested in providing high quality care. It appears the minister never intended that those standards apply to her friends. Her friends are more important than the elderly residents who have been left to suffer in Yagoona are. 
What we want to know is why the minister has allowed such favourable treatment to be meted out to Yagoona and the Ritz when other nursing homes have received much more severe treatment, have been the subject of sanctions, and have had administrators and nursing personnel appointed to ensure the care of the residents. None of these measures have taken place here. None of the sanctions have been applied in these cases. It really undermines confidence in the standards when people say that they are not being applied fairly or equitably. These concerns abound in the industry. The industry are most concerned by what they see as the failure to apply the standards. 
The industry generally support accreditation, support the accreditation standards and have worked very hard to meet them. But they are very disappointed when they see that some providers, who have not made the same sorts of efforts and who have not played by the rules, are receiving favourable treatment and not being required to meet the standards that all others are required to meet. They want to know why, because it gives the whole industry a bad name. They want to know why the Ritz and Yagoona got special treatment on this occasion. 
It is important that we get a proper explanation from the minister about the events at Yagoona and the Ritz, because the families of the deceased and the families of the others who made complaints, who have concerns there, deserve a proper explanation. The industry and the public deserve an explanation about why the standards have not been applied equitably and why Mrs Millie Phillips and in particular the Yagoona and Ritz nursing homes have received special treatment. You cannot rebuild confidence in the aged care industry; you cannot rebuild confidence in the integrity of the aged care industry if those standards are not maintained without fear or favour. You cannot choose to apply sanctions to some and not to others without bringing the whole system into disrepute.
A number of very good nursing homes have fallen foul of the accreditation process and have been downgraded. And for some of them it has been quite harsh. They are basically very good homes which, on some technical issues or because of various circumstances, have had their accreditation status downgraded. They have paid very severe penalties for that but they have generally responded positively to those penalties, saying that they know those are the rules and that the rules are there to improve the standards of the industry. But that is not the case at the Ritz and it is not the case at Yagoona. These are examples of where the standards have not been applied and where preferential treatment has been given. They undermine the credibility of the aged care standards and they certainly undermine the credibility of the minister to properly administer the portfolio.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Aged Care</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-06-20,"—I do not know why Senator Evans has moved this motion, because he did not address the matter of urgency as outlined. He came into cowards castle and made accusations about the minister's motives. I think he should go outside now and say them publicly. As Senator Ray says, it is five yards to courage—go outside and make those statements publicly and see how they are tested outside. You can come in here and, under the protection of privilege, you can make accusations about the motive of the minister and about her influencing decisions. Go outside and say them. 
It may have paid the Labor Party, when they were in government, to actually do something about aged care. They sat on their hands and did nothing. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is absolutely staggering. When I was in opposition, I spent week after week after week visiting nursing homes, and they were absolutely disgraceful. There were situations that were totally abhorrent and unacceptable in a civilised society. I will take you on a trip down memory lane. Senator Evans does not even have the good grace to stay in the chamber to hear this matter that was so urgent for him to debate. In 1994 Professor Gregory produced a report, which the Labor Party commissioned, on Labor's record on aged care. The report found that 75 per cent of homes did not meet building standards, 70 per cent of homes needed fixing or rebuilding to meet Australian design standards, 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with four or more beds, 13 per cent of homes did not meet safety standards and 11 per cent did not meet basic health standards. It also showed that $540 million was needed to upgrade nursing homes to meet basic Australian building standards and that $125 million was needed to tackle existing problems. When Dr Lawrence got the report—she was then the minister responsible—she did nothing. She sat on her hands and did nothing. Labor did nothing. They said that they were going to give a miserly $33.4 million over four years, which is less than $10 million a year. That was a drop in the ocean of what was needed. They left a system that was not financially viable, as evidenced by the Gregory report, and there was a lack of a funding stream for capital improvements. 
The coalition had put a policy forward before the election. When the legislation came forward—I was overseas at the time at the United Nations General Assembly—I have to say to you that I was appalled by Ms Macklin's behaviour. I have some respect for some people on the other side. They are doing a job; I do not always agree with them, but Ms Macklin went down in my estimation to zero because she went around frightening older people and the children of people who required aged care, telling them that they would have to sell their homes. I will never forgive her for that. Had that policy been accepted in a bipartisan way similar to a policy for hostels that was initiated by the then Labor government, which we supported and so enabled capital funding for hostels, we would have had capital funding that would have improved nursing homes. However, on our policy, no, the political route was taken. As Richo said, `Whatever it takesto win government.' It does not matter if you frighten older people. The Labor Party would not have that policy. So we lost an opportunity to have capital funding that would have improved nursing homes.
Given that, the coalition have had to turn around and find other forms of funding because we were not able to leave nursing homes in the appalling state that they were in under Labor. I have to tell you that it was disgraceful. Senator Evans talked about one or two nursing homes. I can tell you that I visited nursing home after nursing home after nursing home that failed what I call my mum test—that is, my personal accreditation test: `Would I put my mother in that nursing home?' The answer was: no, no, no, over and over. They were disgraceful, because Labor had let them run down. This will be an ever increasing problem into the future for Australia—it is not going to go away; the baby boomers, who are corporately 55 years of age, are knocking on the door—and unless we find an answer to it in a bipartisan way, unless we can address it, it will not get better and will be a drain on the public purse. But, oh no, Labor will do anything. They will scare older people. We were left with not only nursing homes that were run down but also funding that was run down at an amazing rate. In the Labor Party's last four years in government, capital funding for nursing homes was reduced by 75 per cent. So three-quarters of the money needed to maintain nursing homes had been taken out—mind you, the Labor Party were borrowing $10 billion in that last year. I do not know why they could not find a bit more. They could have borrowed a bit more. That is what the Labor Party seems to do: if you do not have the funds, borrow them; borrow them off the next generation. They left it. They left a divided industry where residents had to move from one service to another—from hostels to nursing homes—when they were at their most vulnerable. The Labor Party failed to address the issue of dementia care. In the 1998 election they promised to abolish fees and charges and to replace them with a $500 million fund. That represented a cut of $45 million in funds available to build, repair and maintain nursing homes over three years. The Labor Party had no policy then, and they have no policy now. What they need to do is work on a policy and tell the public what they would do if ever they got into government. I suppose they would not do much more than what they did before—run nursing homes down. 
Since coming to office, the coalition have increased funding in the aged care sector from $2.5 billion in 1995 to $5.4 billion. We have allocated almost 31,000 places to meet the needs of older Australians. The current ratio, including allocated places, is 108 places per 1,000 people aged 70 and older. The Labor Party was aiming at 100 places, but it did not even get near that. We have gone to 108 places.
In January 2001, the Minister for Aged Care announced the creation of over 14,000 aged care places worth $156 million. Between 1996 and 2000, the coalition created 24,000 aged community care packages. Those are packages so that older people can choose to stay in their own homes and receive care. We have increased home and community care funding by 34 per cent—from $423 million to $565 million—to assist older people to have facilities in their homes, to be given meals on wheels and to enable them to stay at home for as long as possible. At the start of 2001, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency advised that 99.3 per cent of homes had received accreditation.
Other achievements have included the unveiling of a $280 million staying at home package. We have recognised the needs of carers for people with disabilities, with additional funding of $82.2 million, and there has been some respite and other services funding of up to $56 million for people with dementia and other behavioural difficulties. We introduced funding of $37.8 million for aged care assessment teams—an increase of 4 per cent.
For the Labor Party to come in here and say that this government has failed to provide care for older people is hypocrisy. They need to look at their own record. They need to address the fact that this issue is bigger than parties. It is an issue that needs to be addressed by the parliament itself, to see how we are going to fund the increasing demand on aged care. But it is not going to be done the way the Labor Party did it—that is, by frightening older people, by lying or telling untruths about policies. That is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to look at the issues, work out how it can be done and how we can have sustainable funding of aged care.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-06-20,"—If it were possible to amend an urgency motion, I would do so, because that is what is needed in this debate, but I understand that under the standing orders it is not possible to do that. However, if we were able to amend the urgency motion, it would read `the failure of successive governments to provide adequate funding to properly provide for the needs of the elderly'. That is the proper motion that should be before this chamber today.
The Democrats are intrigued by the motion and by the use of the term `emerging crisis' in this matter relating to aged care. If we accept that the term `emerging' implies `coming out after a period', the motion moved today by the Labor Party is indeed very short-sighted—or should I say `very short-memoried'.
The Democrats know that the aged care problems are ongoing, and they have been ongoing for many years. We have long highlighted these problems over the period of successive Labor and coalition governments. My colleagues have been receiving desperate, sad, pleading submissions from constituents for a long time. They are not new, and they are certainly not `emerging' at this time. We received them during the 13 years that the Labor Party was in power. At the end of 1996, as identified by the Auditor-General's report, the number of operational aged care places was approximately 6.5 per cent below the official target of 93.5 places for every 1,000 aged persons, which resulted in a critical shortage of 10,000 aged care places in Australia. That was Labor's record. In June 2000, there was a national shortage of 9,700 aged care beds relative to this government's own targets, and in many regions across the country shortages are chronic.
I do not necessarily want to lay the blame at the feet of either government. I agree with the previous speaker, who said that the only way that this crisis can be addressed—and it is a developing crisis—is by having some kind of multiparty agreement about how to solve the problem. The number of aged people in Australia is growing and the number of aged care places that are needed continues to escalate, and without some kind of agreed commitment to solving the problem we will not solve it, no matter who is in government.
Publicising recent aged care allocations when those allocations are phantom beds in facilities not yet built and therefore not likely to be filled for more than a year is also not addressing the issue. Nor is it a newly emerging crisis that there are bad providers in the aged care sector. I listened carefully to Senator Evans give us a number of anecdotal examples, but you could give those examples forever. You could give them under the Labor government, and you will be able to give them under successive governments in the future. This is a serious issue that cannot be addressed simply by trying somehow or other to take one case and say that it is an example of the whole situation. In a sense it is, but, in another sense, we cannot arrive at a solution by such anecdotal examples.
The problems of bad providers existed during the 13 years from 1983 to 1996 under a Labor government, and they have existed under the six years of the current government. Nobody in this place could give more examples than I could, as a person who was a director of a nursing home at one stage and also, for many years, a chaplain who visited many nursing homes and had to deal with many of these situations.
Of course, nobody wants to witness again in the media the appalling scenes of elderly, frail Australians being publicly removed, under the glare of the media spotlight, from their aged care facility because of poor management and because standards are not being met. The closure of nursing homes is nothing for this government to be proud of, but neither is ignoring the problems that existed, as happened under the Labor government. The Democrats supported measures in this place late last year which would provide for notice for residents to allow them some warning and a measure of dignity in the process. Also, where closure could be prevented, the parliament in that legislation provided for a much better level of care with ongoing monitoring.
The crisis being debated today is not new. Under the Labor Party, it was swept under the carpet. This government can be criticised for its failure to respond to the recommendations of the January 1999 Productivity Commission report. However, Labor is equally guilty of commissioning the Gregory report and failing to act upon it. The Productivity Commission's recommendations are still being ignored today, despite the repeated calls of the Democrats to heed them and act upon them.
No-one was more disappointed than the Democrats at the recent budget's failure to provide a much needed injection of capital funds into the aged care industry. This is where the greatest need lies. Prior to 1997, however, the sector was under the same kind of pressure. Providers were calling out for a review of funding arrangements, and a reference was finally given to the Productivity Commission. In 1999, the Productivity Commission described the funding of aged care as inappropriate and inequitable. What is Labor going to do about it? I have closely scrutinised their five-point plan for quality aged care which is silent on the issue of capital funding. A benchmark of care alone will not provide the much needed purpose built facilities, nor will it provide for special facilities to cater for the needs of dementia sufferers or elderly Australians for whom English is not their first language. Nor will it provide the facilities to meet the increasing standards requirements which must be met in 6½ years time, when many of today's facilities will simply not meet the mark. It will be too late then to consider capital works, and it will be too late at that point to finally accept that not all Australians can continue to be cared for in their own homes.
Over the past years, no government has done enough to address the crisis in aged care capital funding. Where is the legislation to provide wage parity for nursing staff and to address the growing divide in pay between aged care nurses and their acute care counterparts? Aged care nurses are paid 15 per cent less despite the same levels of training, and that is causing a staffing crisis in aged care facilities. Labor's five-point plan talks about staffing ratios. That is an admirable goal but is of no value when the ratio positions simply cannot be filled because qualified nurses have left, and continue to leave, the industry in droves because it does not remunerate them adequately. A ratio will not help a resident to be toileted, bathed, fed or medicated if there are no qualified staff to do that, or if those staff simply do not have the time.
Let me reiterate that the Democrats understand that there is a crisis. It is not new and it is not simply something that arose under this government. It is something that has been with us for a long time and it is increasing because of Australia's ageing population. I believe that we should be moving a motion which refers to the failure of successive governments to provide adequate funding. I call on everyone in this place to get together and come up with an agreed means whereby we can begin to tackle properly the crisis in funding which really lies at the base of all the problems. What is in crisis is the failure of successive governments to recognise that advancing age brings with it increasing needs for care and support, particularly for Australians over the age of 80. We would support an amended motion. However, as our amendment cannot be put, we will not support the current proposition.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Aged Care</title>,Matters of Urgency,14,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-06-20,"—Today we are debating the most scandalous motion put forward by Senator Evans. I say `scandalous' because clearly it is a total and utter misrepresentation of the facts. I want to go through three main areas. First, I want to refute the allegations Senator Evans made in this place today about Yagoona Nursing Home. Secondly, I want to go through what the coalition has done to provide funding for aged care since it came to office and had to pick up the threads of the disgraceful legacy left by Labor. The third point I want to cover, if I have time, is a brief summary of the independent two-year review of aged care reforms conducted by Professor Len Gray.
I turn first to the issue of Senator Evans's claims about the Yagoona Nursing Home. He put out a press release on 4 June which said much the same as he said in the chamber today. One of his claims is that the government reversed a decision to close down Yagoona Nursing Home. Wrong. The government is not the decision maker. The decision maker is the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. Senator Evans is the shadow minister, so he should know that. But, no, he comes in here, and he puts out press statements, claiming that it was the government who did it. It was not the government; it was the agency. The agency did not reverse its decision. The New South Wales state manager of the agency decided not to revoke the home's accreditation, taking into account all the things that the agency is required to take into account under the relevant legislation, including the review audit report on the home.
Secondly, Senator Evans wrongfully claimed that the nursing home failed all four standards, with two being rated as critical, and that it was recommended that the nursing home be closed down. There was no recommendation that the nursing home be closed down. Why has Senator Evans come in here and again misrepresented the truth? The agency operates under a detailed legislative framework and these legislative principles were designed to ensure that the agency operates in an open and transparent manner. The process for granting, varying and revoking the accreditation of a home is clearly articulated in the legislation. It is such a shame that the shadow minister will not go and look at the act. He will not understand what the truth is before he comes in here and puts out press releases accordingly.
His third claim is:
The Government's own Accreditation Guidelines state that a nursing home with one or more standards rated critical will not be accredited.
The guidelines were issued in 1998 to assist the industry to prepare for first accreditation. These guidelines became redundant when the accreditation grant principles passed through both the Senate and the House of Representatives in 1999. These principles, as subordinate legislation, must be and are adhered to. Once again, one would suspect that the shadow minister would know that. Clearly, he seeks to misrepresent the position. 
His fourth claim is:
... the Government allowed the nursing home to remain open, it failed to impose any of the sanctions it has available under the Aged Care Act.
The government, once again, is not the decision maker. The agency is the decision maker in relation to accreditation. The secretary to the department or his delegate decides whether sanctions should be imposed. The secretary's delegate is currently considering the question of the imposition of sanctions. Once again, Senator Evans has misrepresented the facts of the matter and come in here and wilfully said something that is not truthful. 
He went on to make the further claim:
The Minister has powers to appoint an independent administrator to ensure that the residents receive proper care, but has failed to use them.
Once again, you would think the shadow minister would know that the minister has no such power. Why does he come in here and say that she does? One sanction available is for the provider to be required to appoint an administrator or adviser from one of the established panels. The power to take sanctions under the Aged Care Act rests with the secretary to the Department of Health and Aged Care or his delegate, as I have said before. 
The sixth wrong claim that Senator Evans has made is:
... The Ritz in Leura, owned by the same provider was exempted from the Government's accreditation standards.
It was not exempted in any way, shape or form. That just puts to rest some of the scandalous things that Senator Evans has wilfully come in here and not told the truth about. He has misrepresented the facts.
 (Senator George Campbell)—Order! Senator Knowles, I think you are sailing pretty close to the wind in the language you are using in impugning Senator Evans's motivation. I draw your attention to it.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will certainly maintain my position, and I will rephrase it if necessary. I do believe it is the responsibility of honourable senators to come in here and be honourable. I have demonstrated that Senator Evans has clearly not said it as it is. If that is going to be deemed unparliamentary then so be it, because quite frankly we have a responsibility to come in here and tell it as it is, not as you might want it to be for political purposes. Senator Evans's position is appalling.
His position on the funding levels is even worse. After this government came to office in 1996, the Auditor-General found there was a 10,000 aged care place deficit left by the Labor government. In the last two approval rounds and in the 2001 round, over 31,000 new places will have been released to make up for the deficit. The former Labor government spent $2.5 billion on residential aged care. As of this year, it is expected that $3.9 billion will be spent. Senator Evans says that funding has been cut or has not been increased. That is wrong. The total income to providers of residential aged care during the five years following the reforms is projected to increase by some 41 per cent. The industry demonstrates confidence about its future and is engaging in extensive building and upgrading refurbishment work which it could not undertake under the Labor government, and $1.4 billion across Australia has been committed by the industry on capital building works. Twelve per cent of all aged care homes in Australia have been either newly built or completely rebuilt, and the list goes on. 
In the limited time I have left, I will go on very briefly to the review by Professor Len Gray, who said:
In general, the fears that were expressed prior to the implementation of the reforms have not been borne out by the evidence ... Substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of residential buildings was a specific objective of the reforms. The evidence indicates that considerable progress has been made towards achieving this objective.
	...	       ...	                 ...           
However, it can be acknowledged that the reforms have introduced processes that are clear improvements on the previous system.
And I will put in there the words `under Labor'. The analysis shows that income has increased, government outlays have increased, demand for residential places has increased and the value of places has increased. The financial analysis conducted by the review indicates that significant resources are being generated by the new arrangements to meet the industry's capital requirements. There is also evidence that homes are moving steadily towards meeting the 2008 privacy and space requirements. The accreditation process appears to be widely endorsed as an appropriate approach to ensuring standards of care across all homes.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I want to start by making it very clear that The Ritz Nursing Home in New South Wales was granted exceptional circumstances. It was one of the 19 or 20 that had to be given extra time to meet the qualifications. Aged care is an issue of major concern to everybody in this country. We are all going to get old. The government's problems with aged care started the day they said they were going to lay legislation on the table with plenty of time for the industry and interested bodies to comment. They laid it on the table for 10 days. The peak bodies were flat out getting copies of the legislation at that stage, let alone getting it out to their affiliates.
—It is on the Internet.
—Senator McGauran has made a wonderful interjection: it is on the Internet. It was not on the Internet. Not only did they not lay all of the legislation on the table at that stage; they left out the 64 key pieces of information that you needed to know about how it was actually going to operate and be implemented.
—It has made him look like a goose.
—Absolutely. I suggest to Senator McGauran that he keep out of the aged care and health debates. Leave it to those of us who have some knowledge of the issue. Ever since that time, the government have been struggling to get their aged care reforms appropriately done.
Senator Patterson spoke about the mother test. A lot of people in this country would not have been able to undertake the mother test using the Internet site of the accreditation agency over the past six months, because the agency was not putting the review results on the web site. It happened only in the last two weeks—so much for people being able to undertake their own mother test. This government has not allowed them to do that. It is the government's responsibility, because the government is ultimately responsible for the activities of the department. There are such a things as Westminster responsibilities, transparency and accountability. If the government does not want to make accountable the actions of its departments, it will be seen as failing the people of this country abysmally.
I am glad Senator Knowles mentioned the two-year review by Professor Len Gray. He raises the issue of staffing. On page 96 of that review, he says:
Staffing was clearly one of the major areas of concern for stakeholders in the first and later rounds of consultations. It was suggested by staff, consumers, providers, and State and Territory governments that the reforms had seen a decrease in the overall level of residential aged care staff and the hours they devoted to direct care. It was also felt that there had been a negative change in the skills mix, with many staff not having the necessary training or qualifications.
To me, that is the most telling thing to outline when talking about the provision of any type of aged care or health service. If you do not have adequate numbers of staff to undertake these procedures and adequate skill mixes, you are not going to get proper skin care, proper nutritional care, proper patient ambulation, proper patient mobility and all of those sorts of things.
I also apply a test to this, and it is the care that my father was given in a nursing home last year before he died. It was good care. I know the pressure those staff are under and I know that those staff are paid less than they would be paid if they were doing similar sorts of work, with the same qualifications, in acute hospital care. When you look at the figures in the work done by the ANF—and I do claim former membership of that union— you will see that, in some states, the differential is 12 per cent and 13 per cent. In our own state of New South Wales, Acting Deputy President George Campbell, the differential is two per cent. In other states it is 12 per cent or 13 per cent. That is not fair; that is not going to do anything to attract qualified nurses.
I am aware of situations where people with enrolled nurse aid qualifications are being employed at the lower rate of personal care assistants. They are required to work at the enrolled nurse aide qualification level, they are paid at the lower rate and they are not given recognition for that work within the programs that each of the state registration boards have that keep them registered.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2001-06-20,"—I was surprised to see Senator Evans's motion, which implies that there is a crisis in the aged care service and that it is about to collapse. Because of my cultural background, I have a particular interest in aged care. Since June 2000, in the last 12 months or so, I have found my way to visit 38 aged care homes in Victoria. I am scheduled to visit five more in the next two months. I am not sure how many such homes Senator Evans has been to, but perhaps he has not had a similar experience.
When I listened to Senator Evans, I found that he was not worried about the aged care service as a whole. He was taking an opportunity to denigrate and single out a particular home, using parliamentary privilege to blacken that home's reputation. My experience gives me a much better idea of the quality of care that aged Australians enjoy than Senator Evans could possibly have. From talking to residents, visiting families, volunteer helpers and dedicated staff, I have a much better idea than Senator Evans could possibly have of how much better the quality of life for aged Australians is under this government's aged care management regime.
If Senator Evans spent some time visiting the aged care homes in his electorate, perhaps he would get a better idea of the real state of aged care services in Australia as well. Perhaps, if he were honest with himself, he would acknowledge the excellent outcomes this government has achieved in providing the kind of care, the quality of life and the security in old age for those Australians who contributed so much when they were young and able to the development of this country and to the lives and pleasures that we now enjoy. Perhaps, if Senator Evans were honest with himself, he would direct his energy to persuading his colleagues in the ALP to give some thought to how they might help make the lives of senior Australians comfortable and enjoyable while they are still with us, instead of trying to create mischief in their cups for everyone.
Perhaps not—that might be too hard. Old habits are hard to break. After five years of inactivity, it would be too hard for the Labor Party to start thinking about policy development again. Perhaps Senator Evans will prefer to continue to drag inconsequential and unsubstantiated issues before the Senate in the hope that much motion will substitute for action. The Labor Party will not get away with that, because this government has been doing a good job to provide more places, more funding, better homes and better care for senior Australians. No amount of scaremongering will distract from the Howard government's achievements in this area.
—Which minister wrote this speech for you?
—It is common knowledge, Senator Bolkus, that after this government came into office in 1996 the Auditor-General found that there was a 10,000-place aged care deficit left by the previous Labor government, in which you were a minister. In the five years since then, the Howard government has provided 19,771 new residential places by 2000 and 18,858 new community aged care packages. In the year 2000 allocation round, 7,642 additional residential places and 6,156 new community aged care packages were created. In the 2001 round, 5,612 places and 1,569 community care packages will be added. These add to a total of 33,025 residential places and 26,581 community care packages provided by this government in five years. This is a record of achievement that is remarkable enough standing alone and more remarkable when matched against the previous Labor government's negligence.
My experience also gives me a good idea of the commendable level of competence, the dedication, the probity and honesty of the carers and the providers managing these aged care homes. If Senator Evans's colleagues maintained the same standards of competence, dedication, probity and honesty in their jobs, the Australian Labor Party would probably disappear—they would be able to hold their national conference in the proverbial phone booth. Given that Senator Evans has picked a single instance of an aged care home out of nearly 3,000 accredited aged care homes across the nation to denigrate the commendable effort of the government, the aged care service industry, the professional carers and the families of the aged care residents, Senator Evans ought to start looking at himself and question his own motives.
Of course, we do not live in a perfect world. Among these 3,000 accredited aged care homes providing 142,805 operating residential aged care places, not all these places will provide the same standard of care, not all the carers will be of the same standard of competence and not all the providers will have the same standard of management skills. Some will be on the margin. That is where the government's certification and accreditation process plays such an important and integral part in ensuring the quality of aged care services. This is a point which Senator Evans obviously missed. There are processes in place to judge this standard which are objective and quantifiable. Apart from the certification and accreditation process, the government has also provided for an aged care complaints resolution scheme, an office of the commissioner of complaints, advocacy services and community visitors.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-20,"—Prior to the matters of public interest debate, I moved the first Democrat request for amendment to the Family and Community Services Legislation (Simplification and Other Measures) Bill 2001. I will now speak to that request and will do so at some length, partly to enable the minister's representative and Senator Evans to get here but also because it is an important issue, and I think it is appropriate to put it on the record. The minister made fairly dismissive and somewhat unfair comments prior to my moving this request, suggesting that it was a case of the Democrats trying to make people feel warm and fuzzy. I would certainly reject that. It is a significant issue. The people who are affected are small in number but have a legitimate claim. I think it is appropriate to take that claim seriously. The minister also indicated that there are some ongoing discussions and consideration of the issue by the government. Therefore, we should wait to see the outcome of those and basically leave it up to the government as to whether or not they do it. She said it may come about anyway, and we should just butt out, sit back and wait and see if it comes about.
I will speak briefly further to the request for amendment. It is quite simple: it relates to amounts paid by the Republic of Chile under the laws of that republic by way of compensation to victims of the military dictatorship which ruled during the period 1973-90. During that period under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, thousands of workers, both men and women, were forced from their jobs in Chile for political reasons. Ten per cent of the population were expelled or exiled from Chile after the coup d'etat. More than one million people were forcibly expelled. Those citizens who were known, or suspected, to have sympathies with the democratically elected and overthrown government were forced to suffer one of the most brutal cases of persecution and institutionalised terror that the world knew at that time. They were held in concentration camps where torture was practised as a matter of course and from which both men and women disappeared without trace. More than 3,000 people were killed in cold blood. Most of their bodies are still missing. Others were forced into work gangs for political prisoners.
When democracy was restored to Chile, the government of the Republic of Chile enacted three acts through congress which would indemnify and compensate Chilean citizens who suffered the traumatic experience of exile or disappearance, those who had unjustly lost their jobs for political reasons or those who were deprived of their freedom. These acts were to further compensate financially the spouses and parents of persons imprisoned or who disappeared, presumed dead. These acts from Chile were legislated exclusively for those victims who suffered during the reign of terror that began in 1973, to pay them a special compensation named `pension of mercy without contribution'. I am sure all senators would equally acknowledge the significant and serious suffering that those people went through and the appropriateness of that payment. I am certainly not trying to suggest that we have some mortgage on recognition of that. I think that is widely acknowledged.
Of the one million people forced to leave that country, I understand that there are approximately 400 people of Chilean origin living in Australia who are eligible to receive, or are receiving, the pension of mercy without contribution. We already have a precedent for this in that money paid to victims of Nazi persecution by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Austria is exempt from the income test for social security purposes. This request for amendment seeks to provide that exemption from the income test similarly for those from the Republic of Chile who receive that pension of mercy without contribution. 
Our understanding is that none of the countries in which Chileans found political sanctuary during the military dictatorship, or which have the relatives of missing people eligible for this compensation, treat this payment as additional income for the purposes of additional income tax or for the withholding of the benefit. That is due to an understanding of the international community of the victims of the military dictatorship. We believe that it is appropriate to accept that in Australia. That is why we are proposing to exclude the pension of mercy for these people of Chilean origin from the income test in the Social Security Act.
I was aware, as the minister indicated, that there are ongoing discussions with the Chilean embassy, and also with others, on this issue. They are welcomed. It certainly would be useful to hear an indication from the minister as to how long those discussions will continue. From the Democrats' point of view, it is good that the government is considering not just this issue but other payments that may be appropriate in this area, such as those from France and the Netherlands. The issue comes back to consistency. If there are arguments—and no doubt there are, or it would not be being considered—for payments in relation to other countries, the Democrats think it would be appropriate for those to be included in the exemption. We do not think that it is a reason to not proceed with this one. The numbers of people are fairly small, but the issue is appropriate.
Whilst it is good that the government is considering it—and, as the minister said, this may well come about anyway, and it would be good for the government to accept that— the Senate is a legislative chamber. As part of this legislation relates to compensation, we think it is appropriate for the parliament to propose changes to legislation. That is a role of the legislature. Obviously the government is in the position to put forward legislation and to decide whether or not to accept legislation in the form passed by the parliament—and it can express that viewpoint in the House of Representatives—but the Democrats certainly reject any inference that it is somehow inappropriate for us, or any other senator for that matter, to put forward legislative amendments on issues that we think are significant. The role of the legislature is not to just sit back and hope that the government does what it says it will do or to hope that the government will address problems without the legislature putting forward amendments. If we were all to just sit back and wait for the government to address issues, we may as well not spend time assessing, considering and amending legislation. So the Democrats believe it is quite appropriate to put forward this request. If the government is looking at it anyway, that is good.
Certainly we hope the request for amendment is passed. We believe the issue is sufficiently significant and that there is no reason why it cannot go forward now. We believe that this is as good a time as any to make it happen. The principle is clearly established and is appropriate. Whilst the minister's indication is that it is under active consideration—and I think there is at least some indication that it is sympathetic consideration— nonetheless these people are in this situation now. I am not convinced that it is necessary to simply sit back and wait for the government to do as it sees fit at an indeterminate time down the track, particularly with an election coming up in the not too distant future and the potential change of government which would mean that people would have to go back to square one on the whole issue. I still hope that the request for amendment will be given consideration. I could understand it if the opposition felt it appropriate to give the government a bit more time, although I believe that it is an appropriate time to pass it now. I urge the government to reconsider and accept this now. The onus as to whether it accepts it is obviously on the government.
As I indicated in my second reading remarks, the Democrats support the bill as a whole. We think it has positive measures in it, and we certainly do not want to jeopardise it or hold it up. I guess that puts the onus on the government as to whether or not it will accept this request for amendment. The Democrats  believe it is a good request for amendment and appropriate to put forward now.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION (SIMPLIFICATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I am very sympathetic to the arguments put by Senator Bartlett, and the Labor opposition in general are keen to facilitate some resolution of this. We agree that people should be treated equally. If these compensation payments for people from Chile are comparable to those made by the Federal Republic of Germany to victims of the Nazi regime, it seems to us appropriate that we support the Chilean people's treatment in the same manner. If there are other compensation payments from other countries that need to be considered, we need to pick those issues up as well. I think the minister indicated that there might be a couple of instances where that might be the case.
The minister did indicate in response that there was a process occurring; effectively she asked for more time for that process to continue. I would appreciate an indication from the minister on the likely timetable to be applied and when we could expect some resolution of these things. While I am happy to take the minister's word that these things are being resolved, I think it is only appropriate, if the government is asking us not to support amendments, that we get some sort of indication as to not only the timing but the process of how this matter will be resolved. There are people who are waiting on this matter to be resolved. They have suffered very badly and are looking to us to help resolve these issues for them.
While I accept that the government wants to get it right and that there does need to be formal resolution of the issues surrounding whether they are appropriate compensation payments and whether the people are treated in the appropriate way, I think Senator Bartlett's point about it being perfectly appropriate for them to raise the issue here is right. That is how you get these issues on the agenda. For the minister to say, `We don't want to do it now because there are processes in place,' is perfectly okay as well, but I would like to hear from the minister as to when those processes will reach fruition and how the government intends to resolve the issue.
I think the parliament needs more than an assurance of, `Trust us; we're working on it,' if we are to be persuaded not to support Senator Bartlett's request for amendment. At least Senator Bartlett's request for amendment gives us the option of saying, `Well, here's a way of resolving this issue.' The government is saying, `We don't want to do it now because there are other issues.' I understand from the briefings from Mr Swan's staff that those issues are relevant, but we do want to know how they are going to be resolved. We would like some indication from the minister as to the process from here if the request for amendment is to be defeated.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION (SIMPLIFICATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-06-20,"—I thank Senator Evans for his remarks. Senator Evans, I think it would be a folly to offer you a time frame when I do not know that I can guarantee to deliver in that time frame. What I do know is that Senator Newman, who was the minister in January, wrote in January to the Chilean ambassador. I am advised that we do not yet have a response. The best I can do is tell you that we are committed to resolving this as quickly as possible. I do not see that it has any particular effect on the Chilean budget. It is one that would affect ours, so I do not see that there is any immediate need for any delay in a response. I am not suggesting there has been a delay. Ambassadors can ask for information and not necessarily get it back from their head office quickly.
We want to resolve this as quickly as possible. We just want to make sure that this compensation payment is treated in the same way as others and that we do not create an anomaly by responding to something that is, as I say, a serious issue but also an emotive one and, because of the emotion involved, by responding in a way that could be seen by others to be unfair as a consequence of the way that their compensation payments are treated. In order to resolve this, we think we need more information from the Chilean government. That is why Senator Newman, as I am advised, wrote to them in January. We do not yet have a response. All I can do is tell you that it will be dealt with as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION (SIMPLIFICATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I appreciate the frankness with which the minister responds. I certainly do not want to ask her to set time lines if she then cannot deliver them, because that does not advance us at all. So, on behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will not support the request for amendment on this occasion but that we will support it on a future occasion, subject to those issues that the minister is seeking clarification on being resolved. So it is our intention to support this type of amendment, but we do think it appropriate that the proper information be gained from the Chilean government to facilitate that. 
In addition, all I can say is that, while we do not support the request for amendment on this occasion, we indicate to the Democrats that we share their concern and that, if we feel there is undue delay and if the matter is not resolved satisfactorily in a reasonable time frame, we would be prepared to help advance the issue on another occasion. But we are prepared to accept the minister's assurances that she is attempting to have the matter resolved in a proper way. On the basis of that advice, we are prepared to not support the request for amendment on this occasion. But, as I say, we support the sentiments and the direction and we support getting it resolved as soon as possible.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-20,"—The Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001 and other measures is a momentous change for Customs. In fact it involves one of the greatest reforms for Customs since Federation. The bills that we have before us have been the subject of intense scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. At the outset, I want to thank the senators who served on those committees and also the senators who contributed to the debate on the bills. In relation to those two Senate committees, we have adopted the amendments that relate to the recommendations made by those committees.
The reforms in these bills will provide benefits to business, government and the Australian community at large. The bills underpin cargo management re-engineering, which is intended to modernise cargo processes to improve efficiency in the movement of cargo and the early detection of high risk cargo. It is about the creation of an environment that is intended to reduce the cost of communication and to provide choice in how that communication occurs. It establishes an environment that relies on commercial information rather than something specifically created for government. But there are other benefits as well. 
In addition to creating a better business environment, the government also has a responsibility to protect the community from threats posed by drugs, firearms and other dangerous goods that are imported into Australia. The bills, therefore, also provide improved mechanisms for the early identification and control of such goods. In this way, their objectives are to intercept high risk cargo while allowing low risk cargo to flow unimpeded. The provision of timely and accurate information is fundamental to achieving rapid movement of cargo across our borders. For this reason, this proposed legislation supports good compliance through initiatives such as the accredited client program and associated administrative mechanisms. At the other end of the scale, it also provides necessary censure for noncompliance through strict liability offences.
The legislation also proposes the replacement of Customs' current commercial auditing powers with contemporary monitoring powers. These powers, along with new record keeping obligations, will apply to communicators of information to Customs, as well as to the owners of imported and exported goods. This extension acknowledges that the accuracy of trade data is vital in a self-assessment scheme that has the objective of intercepting high risk cargo while allowing low risk cargo to flow unimpeded. The new powers are more consistent with the preferred model for monitoring compliance with Commonwealth laws by ensuring that entry to premises is only by consent or under a warrant.
Rather than focusing on individual measures in this legislation, such as the strict liability offences, record keeping obligations and new monitoring powers, it is important that the measures in this legislation be viewed as a whole. This proposed legislation provides for a new framework for cargo management—one which allows for the maximum use of technology, more efficient deployment of Customs resources and more rapid cargo clearance times. This will clearly benefit business in Australia and those people who are involved in the import and export of goods in and out of Australia.
The legislation will also benefit government. Australia is not alone in moving towards the maximum use of available technology to manage the movement of goods across its borders. Other customs administrations have moved or are moving in similar directions. It is therefore important that we keep abreast of international best practice. This proposed legislation and the systems re-engineering that it supports will sustain Australia at the cutting edge of customs administration internationally.
I will now turn to the opposition's criticism as to there being no consultation by Customs in relation to these measures. This criticism is not warranted at all. Customs has embarked on wide consultation with industry throughout the development of this legislation. Customs will continue this process of consultation with industry associations and individual companies throughout the implementation phase. The government is well aware that industry will need time to adjust to this new cargo reporting process which the bill underpins. That is why the bill provides a moratorium period of six months in which cargo reporters can move to the preferred means of electronic reporting. It is also why the bill contains a two-year proclamation period for its commencement instead of the usual six months. This is something that is quite unique in allowing industry to come to terms with these new provisions. Customs has discussed, and will continue to discuss, business and systems changes with industry to achieve the best possible outcome for cargo management re-engineering and to make the transition as smooth as possible. Therefore, the government rejects outright that part of the second reading amendment which deals with a lack of consultation. 
I note that Labor goes on in its second reading amendment to deal with the question of periodic reporting. Firstly, the periodic reporting that we are talking about in this part of the bill is related to the accredited clients program and to accredited clients only. The whole point of the accredited clients program is to reduce the regulatory burden on business with a history of high compliance—and it does. This is evidenced by the fact that many businesses that currently do not qualify for this program have lobbied very strongly for the government to facilitate their early inclusion into that program. The periodic reporting that we are talking about applies only to those businesses that are benefiting substantially from the reduction in the regulatory burden under the accredited clients program. The effective reduction in the regulatory burden achieved through the accredited clients program initiative—an initiative of this government, I might add— completely contradicts the substance of Labor's proposed second reading amendment on this issue.
Those exporters and importers who have participated in the trial of the accredited clients program have raised with the government the issue of period declarations. They have put to us that they would prefer an alignment in reporting requirements under the Customs Act with reporting obligations under other relevant Commonwealth legislation. To this end, Senator Murray has raised this issue with us, and we have explained to him in detail—as we have explained to the opposition—why that proposal could not be implemented at this time. In brief, the advice to the government, which we have passed on to the opposition and the Democrats, is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has indicated that any delay in reporting dates would have significant ramifications for the integrity and timely availability of key economic indicators. In this regard, I point to the balance of payments, which everyone relies on. We could not afford to have any delay in those key economic indicators, and that is an essential aspect of this. Incidentally, the ABS has also advised the government that small and medium sized businesses—in contrast to big businesses pushing for a change on this—prefer to spread out their paperwork. That is the feedback we have had from small to medium enterprises.
Having said all of this, the government is sympathetic to the concerns expressed on this by those who have participated in the trial of the accredited clients program. The government is committed to keeping the regulatory burden on business to a minimum. It is in this context—and after detailed discussions the government has had with the Democrats on this issue—that I have agreed to pursue the establishment of a working group on this matter, involving industry and relevant government agencies, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The working group will explore the alignment of reporting obligations under the Customs Act with reporting obligations under other relevant Commonwealth legislation. I understand that, during the committee stage, Senator Murray will move an amendment to the relevant part of the bill which deals with this. That amendment will enable the government to capture, through regulations, any outcome of the working group discussions. The government has indicated that it will support such an amendment. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Murray for the constructive contribution from the Democrats in relation to this very important bill.
The government is totally opposed to the second half of Labor's second reading amendment, which refers to an inquiry into Customs IT and communications arrangements and which would entail a reference to another Senate committee. As I have said, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has looked at this proposed legislation in detail, as has the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. There has been thorough scrutiny of this proposed legislation, and the government does not believe that this legislation should be delayed any further. Even during Senate estimates there was extensive questioning in relation to this very important bill.
Industry wants this legislation to go ahead and it wants it to go ahead now. But we have indicated that there have been suggestions in relation to the working group that I mentioned and the aspect of a two-year delay before proclamation will allow the transitional phase to take place smoothly. The reforms in this proposed legislation will increase choice in that businesses will be able to choose how they will communicate with Customs. They will no longer be limited to the current exclusive arrangement in place through Tradegate. With respect to the opposition's criticism that the new arrangements will result in increased costs, the government rejects this is as well. The whole purpose of this exercise is to reduce costs for industry, particularly the costs associated with communicating with Customs. With respect to Customs IT arrangements, I do not believe that the opposition's concerns, as I understand them, would justify delaying this bill further.
Senator Murray in his speech during the second reading debate referred to the problem of goods destined for export being diverted into the domestic market. Senator Murray, I believe, said at that stage that the government needed to take this issue more seriously. Through the chair, I assure Senator Murray that the government does take this issue very seriously and in fact Customs is currently pursuing a number of investigations in this area. The legislation, as acknowledged by Senator Murray, is in fact also part of the government's commitment to address this issue as effectively as possible.
As I mentioned earlier, these bills have been the subject of extensive scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We have in fact adopted some of the recommendations made by those committees. I once again thank those committees for their thorough examination of these bills.
I will simply foreshadow amendments that the government will be moving. The first will be the requirement of a monitoring officer, before exercising monitoring powers, to give an occupier of premises written notice setting out the occupier's rights and obligations, and the second will be to require the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to make and have regard to guidelines for the administration of the infringement notice scheme for strict liability offences. These guidelines will be a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and therefore subject to the scrutiny of parliament. As I understand it, these were concerns expressed respectively by those Senate committees, who did a very good job in examining this legislation.
I also understand that Senator Murray has a number of amendments to move on behalf of the Australian Democrats, and the government, I believe—subject to what Senator Murray will say—is disposed to accept those. There have been persuasive arguments put in relation to several aspects of those and we look forward to the debate in the committee stage on those amendments.
This is one of the greatest reforms to Customs since Federation and it will be of great benefit to business, to the government and most importantly to the Australian community at large. I commend these bills to the Senate.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order and before we put the amendment—I think a point of order is the only way I can raise this—given the fact that the Democrats are in no position to support this amendment today and have indicated that they will be considering it tomorrow, I think the best course of action for me to take is to withdraw this amendment now and give notice that we will move it as a separate substantive motion in the Senate next week. This will allow some time for the Australian Democrats to either come behind this or expand it.
 (Senator Watson)—Do you seek leave to withdraw it?
—I seek leave to withdraw it at this stage.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2001-06-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Australian government established the Australia-India Council in 1992 to broaden the relationship between Australia and India by encouraging and supporting contacts and increasing levels of knowledge and understanding between the peoples of both countries. India has 1,000 million people. It is important to us as a market. It is also important to us geographically. It is a very important trade market and Australia's trade relationship with India is rapidly developing maturity. 
With the coalition victory in March 1996, the development of commercial ties with India has been given new expression and impetus. Strong ministerial support for and involvement in a major integrated country promotion, New Horizons, provided a particularly noteworthy example of this and the leader of my party at that time, the then Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, was instrumental in that. At the time, there was also some considerable work done in the development of further air links between Australia and India.
The trade figures also reinforce the expanding development of the relationship. Two-way trade between the two countries in 1999-2000 was $2.3 billion, a figure double that of the bilateral trade in 1992-93, the year that the Australia-India Council was established. Development of trade ties to their current levels would have been impossible without the instigation of a program of fundamental economic reform in India itself from the early 1990s. This reform sustained over the course of a decade has significantly redefined the operations of the Indian economy. 
Now, for the first time since India's independence, India has become exposed to competition from without and has taken important initial steps towards becoming an important player in the global economic community. Although there is still some way to go and the reform agenda remains politically difficult, the Australian government is encouraged by India's efforts to date to strengthen and liberalise its economy. One particular trade commodity that we have been able to develop is wool. We have been able to develop our wool market in India because of a reduction in the greasy wool tariff that has been applied traditionally to wool imports into India.
Considerable media attention was given to the Australian government's response to Indian nuclear testing in May 1998 and the possible adverse impact this might have on the trading relationship. The government has responded to the tests by suspending ministerial and senior official visits both to and from Australia and suspending defence ties and non-humanitarian aid. Australian measures did not extend to the imposition of sanctions on trade and investment with India and there was no clear evidence that the measures adopted by the Australian government adversely impacted upon the commercial relationship that is ongoing and developing.
The trade relationship and the market development strategy that needs to be put into place takes into account the market diversity borne out by the region, and particularly the importance of the roles that the Indian states themselves play within India. With its economic reform program opening Indian markets to trade and investment and with Australia's trade push intensifying our understanding of India's regional characteristics and cultural sensitivities, the style of governance of various states is becoming increasingly important and sophisticated. 
I commend to the Senate this annual report of the Australia-India Council because it is interesting reading. It is a broadly based council including a number of interesting Australian members with a connection to India. The Senate needs no reminding of the importance that India has and will continue to have in terms of its regional significance, its international significance, the fact that it has over one billion people and the fact that it is increasingly playing a role on the international stage which will have considerable importance not only to South Asia but also to South-East Asia, North Asia and beyond.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australia-India Council Annual Report 1999-2000</title>,Documents,22,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I too wish to speak to this annual report of the Australia-India Council. Having heard my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald, can I endorse many of the things that he has said. His presentation just now is a very good exposition of the distinguishing features of India and Australia and the nature of the Indian market. The emphasis he has placed on trade is welcome. Can I say for the Australian Labor Party and speaking as the shadow trade minister, we would see India as a major market, a market that has not been properly developed in the past between Australia and India. It will feature significantly in our policy pronouncements on trade when we announce them prior to the coming election. 
This is for us a major market, and we intend to work very strongly in building not short-term but long-term links with India that bind our two countries together and strengthen the characteristics we currently enjoy: India is a country that speaks English; India is a country that has a rule of law that is based on a system of law we understand and can operate commercially within; India is the world's largest democracy; India is a country with the world's largest middle class; India is a country that is given to resolving internal disputes by proper and peaceful means; and India is a country with which Australia has strong cultural ties, albeit mostly they are expressed in cricket competitions. We would like to see Australia's knowledge of India become broader and be more automatically across a whole range of things rather than just simply cricket. But, without cricket, the understanding between our two countries would be less.
The Australia-India Council that produced this report was established in 1992. It was established under an Australian Labor Party government, and we would certainly continue the council on and wish to develop its operations. In the year under report it has spent in total $814,943—about $600,000 of which has been spent on programs which have all helped to build the relationship. Having said all of that and indicated the objectives that we would have as a party in government in developing our relationship with India, there are still things on our bilateral agenda that need attention. One of the most important export industries for Australia is education exports. It ranks as the seventh most important export and the second largest services export for our nation. It earned some $3.5 billion worth of export revenue last year. Unfortunately, if one looks at where demand is for access to Australian education services, one can see around this region that India is a country where there is high demand for access but where the taking up of places in Australian universities actually fell over the last few years. 
One can only lament the obstacles that I as a member of parliament faced when I tried to negotiate the entry of a perfectly respectable and appropriately qualified person into Australia as a business migrant—the obstacles I faced with getting that person recognised as such from the immigration authorities were daunting and acted as a deterrent, I think, for migration at that level. When transposed to the educational area they are a major barrier, a non-cost barrier, to our being able to enjoy stronger relationships on education with India and being able to take a greater number of Indian students. It is something that needs to be addressed, because the education market is a competitive one. If our immigration barriers, as they do, impose constraints on the ability to tap that market then it will be to the disadvantage of India, to the disadvantage of Australia and to the disadvantage of the relationship.
I believe there is an informal quota in the department of immigration about Indian students' entry to Australia. I believe that the most recent decision to impose tests on Indian students as a prequalification for coming—tests that they would not have to pass in Australia—is also a barrier which imposes discrimination. They are barriers that ought to be swept aside not only because of education exports but also to strengthen and improve the relationship and to enable Australian and Indian relations to properly mature and flourish. This is an excellent report, and I commend it to the Senate. I commend the committee and all the members of it, and I look forward to working with them in the future.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2001-06-20,"—I rise tonight to speak on an issue of great importance for international and domestic law—the International Criminal Court. The ICC is designed to replace existing ad hoc international tribunals such as those operating in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia with a permanent court with worldwide jurisdiction to hear charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The 1998 international treaty that set up the court has so far been ratified by 29 countries. However, 31 more countries are needed for the court to begin operating. Australia is currently one of the countries considering the ratification of the treaty. I want to speak briefly tonight on this issue both as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and as a lawyer with a longstanding interest in human rights and international law.
Let me begin by saying that I support and endorse in principle the concept of an international court that would bring to justice the perpetrators of serious crimes such as genocide. The Nuremberg and Tokyo trials, as well as the more recent efforts to prosecute war criminals in the Balkans and in Rwanda, were all steps in the right direction. All of us who lived through the 20th century cannot remain unmoved by the pleas for justice by millions of victims of tyrants and dictators. However, a lot still remains to be done to overcome the widespread perception that international justice can be very selective and sporadic. As I speak tonight, not one person responsible for crimes against humanity in the former Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and their many communist satellites has yet been held accountable for murdering, starving or working to death in excess of a hundred million people. If justice delayed is justice denied, selective justice can be just as corrosive of people's respect for the international human rights system. My major concern about the International Criminal Court is that, like so many instances in the past, all its best intentions and designs will lose out to politics; that, in practice, it will more likely become a thorn in the side of democracies rather than dictatorships.
It is said by the proponents of the court that we need not worry about its impact on our domestic legal system. The Law Council of Australia, for instance, argues:
... under the Statute the Court must defer to Australia's own criminal law and proceedings. It is only when a country is unwilling or unable to prosecute an international crime that the ICC may have jurisdiction.
But this is precisely the problem. When one considers how broad and vague the definitions of `genocide' and `crimes against humanity' are under the treaty, one can easily foresee a situation where Australian courts will refuse to try actions that the court itself and the international human rights community consider to amount to breaches of international law. To argue that various non-governmental bodies and pressure groups will not try to use the machinery of the court to advance their own political agendas is to ignore the 50 years of history of such attempts.
It is similarly concerning to consider that, should Australian citizens ever be tried by the International Criminal Court, some members sitting in judgment might be appointed by governments which are anything but paragons of international virtue. This troubling celebration of judicial diversity, or the belief that all states are equal and that their political and judicial systems are of equal value, underlines and animates the push not just for the International Criminal Court but also for most other international treaties. In fact, despite the recent successful march of democracy and the rule of law and human rights around the world, many governments continue to have only a scant regard for the broadly accepted norms of political behaviour. Unfortunately, history shows that those least fit to sit in judgment are so often the first ones to point the accusing finger.
The International Criminal Court can only assume jurisdiction when a nation is unwilling or unable to prosecute an international crime—in other words, the court is only able to assume jurisdiction when a nation's justice system is judged to be unjust or inadequate. Imagine the response of the People's Republic of China to such a claim. Imagine China allowing others to judge her officials and her citizens. Imagine China accepting the international verdict. Under some circumstances it is possible that liberal democracies such as the United Kingdom or the United States might be successfully pressured into submitting its citizens to the court's jurisdiction, but China—never. In fact, this is the great failing of the ideas that animate the court and the international human rights system generally. It is exactly the more open, democratic and accountable governments that become the easiest targets for the self-styled human rights advocates. When the human rights establishment refuses to see the log in the other state's eye and it sees only a splinter in their own, everyone loses out—the victims whose oppressors remain unpunished, and the system itself, which loses popular legitimacy.
While this is not the intention of the court's creators—I accept that—various dictatorships, joined by Western left-wing ideologues and non-government organisations will almost certainly try to use the court to pursue the United States government for its alleged crimes against humanity. There is no guessing that America's allies—such as Israel or, indeed, Australia—might also become its targets.
Only a few weeks ago, the United States was voted off the United Nations Human Rights Commission, losing its membership for the first time since 1947. At the same time, Sudan and Libya were elected to regional subgroups on the commission. Other members include such paragons of international virtue and staunch defenders of human rights as China, Algeria, Syria, Vietnam, Iran and Cuba. This is the sort of action that does nothing to dispel concerns about the future operation of the International Criminal Court. Not surprisingly, the Bush administration is now unlikely to participate in the work of the court.
It gives me no pleasure to speak here tonight about what I and many others see as problems connected with the International Criminal Court. It gives me no pleasure, because I deeply sympathise with all those around the world who work tirelessly to bring justice to millions of victims of oppressive governments. I share the enthusiasm of those who want to make the world a better and safer place to live. Good intentions are not enough, and noble ideas do not always translate into good outcomes. For the sake of victims of oppression and genocide, it is important that we continue to strive for justice. But for all of us it is equally important that we get it right. Maybe the International Criminal Court is the only way forward for the victims of genocide and war crimes. I accept that. But for some, the fashionable celebration of judicial diversity will come at the price of justice. It seems such a pity that, in the long march towards a meaningful international human rights system, the International Criminal Court might not do enough to substitute politics for justice.
While I am at it, the failure of the Left between 1949 and 1976, to say nothing about the 60 million people whom Mao Zedong killed, is the greatest indictment of that side of politics that is ever possible. For them to even mention at all anything about human rights is pathetic, loathsome and, ultimately, hypocritical. They said nothing between 1949 and 1976 about the tens of millions of people who were killed in the People's Republic of China. Why didn't they? Ask them! They said nothing because it was not trendy—it was not fashionable. It was somehow a celebration of what?—political diversity. In the view of the Labor Party, communism was fine; it was just different—it was still legitimate. That is what they thought. They were wrong, and that is why they got the 20th century wrong.
