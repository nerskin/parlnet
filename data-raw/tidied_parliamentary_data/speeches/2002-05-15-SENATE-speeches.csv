"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-05-15,"—The opposition has read the outline of the circumstances surrounding the House of Representatives returning to this chamber the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002. What happened in respect of this legislation deserves an explanation from the opposition. The last period of the Senate sitting was quite compressed. Obviously, from our perspective, the government has not allowed sufficient sitting days and it has not provided sufficient time for the legislative program to be dealt with in an orderly, effective and efficient manner. It is a matter for the government.
There was a need for a number of bills to go through the Senate during the last sitting period and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill was one of those. The Senate was cooperative, Labor was cooperative, in recognising the number of bills that had to be passed during our sitting period. Labor looked at how it could ensure that there was proper scrutiny of legislation so that those bills would pass during the last sitting period as we were then going to go off to a seven-week break. That seven-week break—which was unusual from our perspective—meant we would not be back until now to look at that legislation.
Effectively, what happened was that the list of bills that was to be scrutinised was prepared, time was allotted and the parties involved progressed through the legislation. We sat late, we had extended sittings and Labor cooperated. I think the point needs to be made that Labor cooperated quite fulsomely with the debate to ensure that the bills were effectively scrutinised and that these issues were dealt with in an appropriate and proper manner—although we did make the point then that it was necessary to ensure that the government allowed sufficient time.
We have said consistently that the government's organising of the sitting pattern has been somewhat lacking. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill is one of these instances that you would not want to happen. It appears that, in the rush to ensure that the legislative program was completed, the baby bonus was one of those that was just on the outer edge of the table and slipped off. Unfortunately, the government should have provided time for legislation that did need to pass during the last parliament; however, it did not.
Labor thought at the time, quite rightly, that with proper scrutiny we could look at the Democrat amendment quite seriously. Upon better reflection, when it came back, we were not going to delay the passage of the bill; we were then not going to support the amendment. We expected all that to happen during the last sitting period. However, it did not. For a range of reasons, the program did not allow that to occur. Given that situation, Labor is not going to now reopen the debate. There was an agreement to ensure this legislation passed last time. There was clearly cooperation from all sides, including the Democrats and the Greens, to ensure that the legislative program was completed in an appropriate and effective manner. But this one did not quite make it through, not because of anyone's particular fault or anxiety; it was one of those things that just simply happened.
It is worth taking the opportunity during this committee stage to reiterate Labor's position in respect of the baby bonus so it leaves people in no doubt about what our position is. It is time to say again, as was mentioned during the second reading debate and put forcibly by Labor, that it is a regressive piece of legislation. It pays five times as much to the highest income category as to the lowest. It is capped at $2,500 for the highest income earner and $500 for the minimum income earner. So it clearly favours high-income earners; it does not favour low-income earners. It is not well directed, it is not well-targeted, and in our view it does not provide the best solution. It is a solution, but clearly not the best. 
This legislation is proposed to provide a tax offset for mothers following the birth of their first child. The offset will allow mothers to claim back the tax paid on their income in the year prior to the birth of the first child. Surprisingly, the payment is calculated on the woman's loss of income and, as I have said, the greater the loss of income the greater the benefit that would result. This bill is clearly complex. It is quite difficult, considering the convoluted piece of legislative drafting that has been undertaken, to ensure this effect comes to pass. However, we do believe that it will be difficult for parents to understand. We expect and call on the government to ensure that they do make sure that they simplify the recipient and the benefit stage and that they do ensure that they provide clear guidelines and clear advice. The government do have the ability to ensure that those mothers who are in need of this payment can access it, can access it easily and complete the relevant paper warfare in an understanding and sympathetic way and that they do not get miserable about it.
Perhaps one of the issues is the injustice that this legislation might sometimes provide. It is compounded because, with the lack of clarity, it appears—and I am sure Senator Campbell can confirm this—to be limited to the first child only. If you are trying to address the birth rate, if you are trying to assist mothers over a longer period, then because it is directed to the first child only it does not provide for and encourage second and third children. It does not provide a continuation of the benefit. It does not provide assistance to those in need straightaway. What it does is pay you at the end in a lump sum. Right after the birth of the first child— perhaps it is better called the `child event' because there may be an adoption or other circumstance; not that I can think of too many, other than adoption and birth—the payment is calculated but paid a lot further down the track. So, although people actually need the money, it is not provided—it is a lump sum payment which is paid possibly as far as 12 months away from the birth or the child event. The legislation is directed at how the costs of the new child event can be met. They cannot at that point; it is some time down the track.
It also has, in my view, the potential to cause unintended consequences. It is limited, as I have said, to the first child and people may take the legislative bill at its face value and delay their decision to have children to a later time. The money will persuade them to delay having children earlier on in their married life.
As I have said, from Labor's perspective the legislation is regressive. We made these comments during the second reading stage. We do believe it is ineffective in meeting some of its stated objectives, and it is contradictory. The potential beneficiaries may be those in the higher income bracket rather than the targeted lower income bracket, as Labor would expect. The offset being principally available to higher income earners is, in our view, not the most appropriate way to proceed. 
As I have said, we did last time provide much of the debate. What I have done is try to summarise the debate because it has been disjointed. All of these points were made during the second reading stage of the bill and during the last committee stage of the bill. I think it is just necessary to ensure that Labor is not acquiescing to what is happening now. We gave an in-principle agreement last time to deal with the legislative program. We dealt with the legislative program last time. Through what can only be described as a miscommunication, this bill was not finalised during the last sitting period. It has now come back on to be dealt with. It will be dealt with. Under the agreement we had last time, we said we would allow passage. We also indicated that we would make the point about the legislative program and we would make the point about the bill itself and then allow the matter to proceed.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-05-15,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002 should be with us today for us to insist that this amendment be passed, and I will commence by saying that the Australian Democrats will insist that this amendment be passed. Let us start by recapping what the amendment says: 
(1)	The Minister must cause a review of the operation of this Schedule to be undertaken jointly by the Departments of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Treasury.
(2)	The review is to conduct an assessment of the operation of the first child tax offset (baby bonus) with particular reference to the:
(a)	benefits derived from the payments; and
(b)	analysis of the benefits by income, gender, household structure and other relevant indicators.
(3)	A report of the review conducted in accordance with this item must be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament before the expiration of the 2005 financial year.
That amendment says that we recognise that this is a controversial scheme. We have just heard from the duty opposition spokesperson their criticisms of it. Their criticisms of the bill are valid. They might not be as strong or as comprehensive as we might want them to be and as we have stated in the debate, but their criticisms are valid. This is good policy in the sense that it attends to family support for births, but it is bad policy in the way in which it is constructed—singularly bad policy. It is skewed and distorted to benefit the wealthy mothers in our society, not the poor mothers in our society, and it cannot be put any clearer than that. The opposition in their remarks on this bill remind me of their remarks during the schools debate. Intense passion, great speeches and really vehement points were made about a policy which was designed to benefit rich schools, and then they just rolled over and voted for it.
It is quite extraordinary. I think this amendment is quite innocuous. It recognises, surely, that the expenditure of taxpayer moneys in an area which is accepted by the crossbenches as being both contentious and, even if you want to be kind, designed in a way which we do not agree with should be subject to review—that is, after three years and a cost-benefit analysis. Frankly, I am a bit offended by the language of the House of Representatives reasons for disagreeing to the Senate amendment because it says in the first paragraph:
This adds nothing to the policy intent behind the Baby Bonus, but instead adds to the complexity of its administration.
Of course it adds nothing to the policy intent. The purpose of it is to review the policy, not to affect or adjust the policy—although we would have liked to. Secondly, they say it `adds to the complexity of its administration'. Are you going to tell me that the departments and the government are not going to assess whether this has a proper cost-benefit virtue attached to it? Really the purpose of parliament is to ensure that moneys are properly spent and the purpose of government is to account to parliament. We in the Senate are not, thankfully, the house of the executive—and it is entirely proper that we should insist on it. What else offends me about this message? It says: 
The Labor Party's support for this amendment is contrary to an agreement with the Government that the proposed Democrat amendments would not be agreed to. 
I have heard an awful lot from the Labor Party over time about deals. Usually they put a phrase in front of it—dirty deals, I think, is their favourite way of stating it. I do not mind if you come to an agreement with the government over what approach you want to take, but the House should not be saying in a message to the Senate, `By the way, there is a deal, and you should subscribe to it.' It is offensive. If you want to tell me in this house that you have a deal with the government, I do not find that offensive; but the House in its proper constitutional framework should not be using that language. I think it is disgraceful. The reasons talk about a `communication breakdown in the opposition'. I do not think there was a breakdown; the opposition passed a perfectly reasonable amendment. The opposition is entitled now to make a decision as to whether it insists or not. If you decide not to, I think that is weak, ineffectual and inadequate, but it is your decision; you are entitled to make that decision.
From the perspective of the government, fancy rejecting an amendment which asks for a review of a policy which is going to spend $510 million. Fancy that! What is the matter with you! It does not affect the policy intent one bit, it does not affect your ability to deliver your promise to your constituency; it affects nothing else but an issue of accountability. That is what this amendment is about. All the other amendments you can argue over in terms of not fulfilling the government's needs, but this is about accountability. I say to the Labor Party: often you do a good job on accountability; in this case you are doing a terrible job. You should be up there shouting out, `Yes, we do want you to tell us how this money is to be spent and whether the benefits are genuinely accrued.' I will tell you why the government does not want this done: because any objective, independent analysis of this policy is bound to turn up the fact that it will benefit rich mums and will prejudice poor mums. It is good policy to look after families and look after people who are having children—that is a good policy and we support it 100 per cent—but your mechanism is poor. As you know, we advocate and prefer a maternity leave mechanism. But, even if you were to take this baby bonus route, to do it in a way which gives potentially five times the benefit to a rich mum as opposed to a poor mum seems to me very odd and very unfair. 
In summary, how do I feel about this? Firstly, I think that the House should take note that the language by which it addresses Senate amendments needs to pay attention to propriety. Secondly, I do not think that deals between any party need to be expressed in this manner. I do not have a problem with you having a deal or an agreement; that is not an issue providing that it is a public matter. I think that the Labor Party really need to distinguish between issues on which they are going to insist—issues which affect policy and the way in which the matter will be delivered—and issues of accountability. I would hope that in future you would be far stronger on the accountability area. You have done some wonderful things in accountability debates in this Senate since I have been here, but this is not one of your finest hours.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-05-15,"—I just cannot let that go unanswered. Perhaps my explanation may not have been of the greatest clarity; but, notwithstanding what is written there, there was a period where we needed to ensure that there was effective consideration of bills. To that extent, if you want to call that an agreement, there was an agreement that there was a need to finish the legislative program. There was not an agreement as to what was going to happen to this bill. There was a view that it should proceed, but we are not going to insist now on that amendment, and that is of our choosing. We do not think the amendment  will add to the legislation.
We have made our comments in relation to the bill, and we have made them quite clearly. We made them during the second reading debate the last time the Senate addressed this legislation. I then summarised those so that the Senate was in no doubt about our view in respect of the legislation. In the final analysis, Labor have decided not to insist on that amendment, and we have now expressed that view. We would have expressed that view during the last sitting; however, due to the miscommunication, the process was not completed. That is the point we would have got to at the last sitting. We have got to it now, albeit with a seven-week delay. We are not going to change that position because the opportunity might present itself to do so.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-05-15,"—Firstly, I rise to support the comments of Senator Murray in relation to the amendment that the Labor Party is no longer supporting. It is a good amendment, for all the reasons outlined in the previous debate and again put on the record today. In fact, in the last debate I heard members of the opposition commend the concept of a review. Now, for some reason—and I am not sure if it is to do with an agreement or a breakdown in communication or because the House of Representatives sends a message with such frank and inappropriate wording— the Labor Party is not going to pursue this amendment, yet the Labor Party and many other quite reputable and legitimate groups in our community, including organisations such as ACOSS, have identified that the baby bonus is an ill-targeted, ill-thought-out scheme. 
It is regressive, as Senator Ludwig has said. However, amendments moved by the Australian Democrats during the debate on the legislation would have made it more progressive, alleviated some of the worst aspects of the legislation and built on the commendable aspects to which Senator Murray referred. We did not receive support from the opposition for those amendments. However, we did get support for the notion of a review after three years. As Senator Murray said, a review after three years is not intended to add to or change the policy intent behind the baby bonus—and that is why I find the language in this message from the House in relation to the Senate amendment equally extraordinary—but it does give us the opportunity to examine how money is being spent and the complexities of the scheme.
In relation to money being spent, as people have identified even in recent days— even last night the Australian Labor Party was talking about the baby bonus and the amount of money being spent on that scheme—it is the single biggest financial outlay as a consequence of election promises made by the government at the last federal election. Around its third year of operation, as Senator Murray has said, the scheme will cost $510 million. Over the next four, five or six years it will be an extraordinarily expensive scheme, so wouldn't we want to get it right?
As Senator Murray said, we believe very strongly in a paid maternity leave scheme, and to that end the Australian Democrats are disappointed by the failure of the government to move in that direction. Despite the fact that 75 per cent of Australians believe it is time, despite the fact that they have at least five options to pursue through the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's report—Pru Goward's excellent work in the last couple of months—and despite community urging and even business support, the government did not decide to pursue paid maternity leave in last night's budget.
The Australian Democrats will table a private member's bill on this issue, and I will be giving notice of that today. I hope that the Australian Labor Party, who have made some positive signs about paid maternity leave, will consider that legislation on its merits. We are the only political party to put forward a fully costed scheme, and for that reason we again hope that the government will see the light and act on this issue. The government have chosen an ill-targeted scheme that is going to cost a lot of taxpayers' dollars and one that is regressive. There is no question that, if you are a woman on the basic minimum wage, you will receive at least five times less money than of a woman on a high income—a woman, say, on $50,000, who will be eligible for around $12,500 if she takes five years off. The Democrats find that extraordinarily regressive.
As I said, we tried to amend that during the last debate, but we did not receive support. All those people from the Labor Party who are telling us today that this is a regressive scheme did not take the opportunity to fix it up. In fact, they supported the legislation. So, quite frankly, I find it extraordinary to hear a lot of criticisms about the legislative timetable. While we share some of those criticisms, we could have postponed this debate if the opposition had decided that that was appropriate. Instead, we have legislation that has been passed and a good amendment that was agreed to now about to fail. So there will be no review of this scheme, the single biggest spending measure in the last round of election promises. The scheme does not assist those women in our community who are poor but, after last night's efforts, I am not surprised that it is the poorer in our community who are being picked on.
The Democrats express our disappointment that an amendment that would have added value to this debate, that would have ensured that there was some accountability for the administration of the scheme and the administration of taxpayers' dollars, is not going ahead. I will also add, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, our criticism of the House of Representatives' reasons for disagreeing to the Senate amendment. I think the terminology in this message, certainly the expression that relates to a communication breakdown, or the broken promise from the Labor Party, is something that Senator Ludwig quite rightly should take offence to and perhaps take up with the government. There is no other reason in this House of Representatives message that actually provides any rationale for the defeat of this particular amendment. Once again I call on the Labor Party to reconsider their position.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-05-15,"—As everyone knows, over the 26 years that I have been here, I have been fighting for a fair go for families, and I support any measure that advances this goal, including the current matter of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Baby Bonus) Bill 2002 that is before us. I warned of a situation where, unless we supported families, this country would see a rapid decline in the fertility rate, and that has happened. Everyone now acknowledges the real problem that Australia faces of an ageing population. I believe that the parliament and the government have the responsibility to act justly when it comes to families, to recognise that families are the fundamental group unit of society and that a functioning family does not need the assistance of the state. You might say, `Oh, the baby bonus is assistance from the state.' In my view, it is just for those families to expect such assistance.
I am proud to say that 80 per cent of the children in my family are now taxpayers. They are paying your salary and mine— whether they feel happy about that, I do not know. Yes, we should act justly, and the government has acted. The question as to whether it is equitable is one that we should consider. There are two notable features of the arrangements that have been made by the government—that is, payments will be made regardless of the combined income of the family, and higher amounts will be paid to higher income earners. It is the latter part that is of concern to me. An analysis of the measure reveals that approximately one-third of the female work force earns $20,000 per year or less and so will be eligible only for the minimum payment of $500 per year, whilst approximately 50 per cent of the female work force earns $26,000 or less, at which rate of earnings they would be eligible for a maximum of $800 per year. It is also revealed that only approximately five per cent of the female work force would be eligible for the maximum rate of $2,500 a year.
I am not going to reargue the case; I know you, Madam Chair Knowles, will rule me out of order if I do. We are dealing with a message from the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives has returned to the Senate a bill for an act to amend the laws relating to taxation related purposes and has acquainted the Senate that the House has disagreed to the amendment made by the Senate. It is entitled to do so, but then it sets out its reasons in the annexed schedule and I feel that those reasons are inadequate. It may be that the minister will explain that they are not necessary. But we are dealing with an amendment that I supported, which said:
(1)	The Minister must cause a review of the operation of this Schedule to be undertaken jointly by the Departments of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Treasury.
(2)	The review is to conduct an assessment of the operation of the first child tax offset (baby bonus) with particular reference to the:
(a)	benefits derived from the payments; and
(b)	analysis of the benefits by income, gender, household structure and other relevant indicators.
(3)	A report of the review conducted in accordance with this item must be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament before the expiration of the 2005 financial year.
The significant point about this amendment is that it was not a sunset clause; it was merely asking what would, I believe, normally be done anyhow. All of this fuss and bother might be resolved when the minister gets up to speak. He might say, `There was no real reason for that amendment; of course we will undertake such an examination in the course of time.' That naturally would take place within the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, and I am sure that it will take place in the Treasury; there is no doubt about that. The question is: will we know the outcome? The minister might say, `The estimates committees will consider it and you will no doubt ask that question'— and you can be assured the questions will be asked. We may be arguing for nothing, really, here. I would like an assurance from the minister that a review along these lines will be undertaken, that no doubt the normal course of events will take place and that we are entitled to ask at subsequent estimates for information thereon. In any case, I can see that the government does not want this measure held up. I certainly would be satisfied if the minister indicated that there was going to be that sort of examination or review done within the department and that we could ask questions of departmental officers in the estimates committee.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-05-15,"—I rise to speak briefly to the House of Representatives message. Much has been said in this chamber this morning about the disparity between the benefits those on lower incomes would receive and the higher benefits those who are on higher incomes would receive on an annual basis if they stayed out of the work force for five years. The issue that has not been raised is the fact that only approximately five per cent of women may be eligible for the $2,500 per annum— Senator Harradine did touch on that. There is also the aspect that mothers on lower incomes will be more inclined to stay with their families because they can access the additional $500 minimum per annum. There will be a natural incentive for the mothers who are on higher incomes to get back into the work force. My reason for that analogy is that, for the person on the average wage of approximately $27,000, receiving between $500 and $800 may be an incentive to choose to stay with their family, but for the person who is on between, say, for argument's sake, $60,000 and $100,000, the incentive is definitely to get back into the work force. 
I believe that the government has actually struck a balance across the spectrum that will end up supporting more mothers on lower incomes than on higher incomes to stay at home. I look forward to comment from the minister relating to the government's intention with regard to the assessment of the scheme.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2002-05-15,"—I see that I am being called on to make a statement, and that is why I rushed down to the chamber— so that I could have the opportunity to do that. 
—When all else fails!
—I do not know why you are not on the front bench, Senator; I simply do not know why.
—We don't know why you are.
—The first point I make is that this was an election commitment, and this is something we are very proud to deliver. It was very popular with the public, and we have a clear mandate to do this. I know that you, Senator West, above all, are very anxious for the government to keep its promises. This is a clear commitment which we gave to the public, and we are delivering on that commitment. Of course, all matters that are before governments are reviewed as appropriate. I have no doubt that the usual processes, which you explained so well in your remarks, Senator, would be carried out by Treasury. These are internal matters to government. If senators are not happy with information that is forthcoming, ministers, as you again explained so well, are subject to cross-examination at estimates. You are particularly good at that, Senator, and I am sure that, if you feel that these matters are not proceeding as you wish, you will have the chance to raise these questions at estimates. 
I think I have been able to give you the assurances that you were seeking, Senator. I hope you feel that is the case. This is a great measure. It is a measure that did capture the attention of the public during the election campaign. It is a measure we have a mandate for, but of course we recognise that senators have always got the right to ask questions. I think I am one who has always given particular emphasis to comprehensive and detailed answers in this chamber and at Senate estimates, but if I fail to satisfy you and you do not receive comprehensive and detailed answers in this chamber, I am sure I will be subject to cross-examination by Senator Harris and you at Senate estimates.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (BABY BONUS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech

"Senator VANSTONE,",LP,2002-05-15,"— I want to speak briefly about the recent passing of the Queen Mother. I think it is appropriate that I do so since it is well known that I have very strong republican views—I think I was probably born a republican—and I hope not to pass on from this globe until I have seen Australia become a republic. I want to make it very clear that I am one republican—and I think there are many, many republicans, probably the majority—who hold that view quite unrelated to any personal views about the current monarchy or previous holders of that high office. Our constitutional arrangements are ours to deal with. The constitutional situation we find ourselves in is not a function of what the royal family have done in the past. It has nothing to do with the fact, as Mr Latham pointed out, that the Queen Mother may have never poured her own cup of tea or drawn her own curtains in the morning. This is irrelevant drivel. That has nothing to do with our constitutional arrangements. That is not why I want a republic. I have great respect for the monarchical system that we are under, for the people who hold that office and for the way in which they have conducted themselves in that office. 
I feel very strongly that the republican cause will never be built by attacking the monarchy; it will be built only by strengthening Australia's resolve to stand alone and be a republic. You cannot build your own strength by diminishing others. I think there is nothing to be gained for the republican cause by attacking the monarchy. So my views in relation to the republic are not about diminishing the monarchy but about building a stronger Australia. I have read a lot of things about the Queen Mother over the years. Maybe she did not draw her own curtains—who cares? Who here would not mind if someone drew their curtains of a morning? I am not going to hold that against someone. It is pretty clear that the king and his wife did not plan and did not expect to hold the position of king and queen and hold it in very difficult times. They stayed in the country when it would have been perfectly acceptable for the wife and children of the monarch, at least, to be taken to some other country. They stayed and did a pretty good job of convincing the British people that their leadership had not left them and that their monarch would stand with them during this very difficult time. That is, in one sense, the job of a head of state: to make it clear to the people that the monarch stands with them. I have read some of the debate in the United Kingdom about whether they spent more time at Windsor or at Buckingham Palace—who cares? The job was to convince the British people that their monarch was standing with them, and that job was much achieved. So it was a lifetime of contribution, of a sense of duty and of responsibility. I never met the Queen Mother, but I understand that she liked a gin and tonic and so do I, so perhaps we would have got on quite well—you never know.
Let me summarise three points. I think that she did do a great job. I am sorry that we do not have somewhere a statue of her. I think republicans should endorse that because you cannot build a better future by hiding your past. You will never achieve it. Those who want a republic should listen to these words: you will not achieve it by rubbishing your past. If you really want to achieve a republic, do not rubbish your past but endorse it and build on it, move on from it. You can do that by recognising figures that were there in your past. I do not think much, incidentally, of the statue of the Queen—I mean no disrespect to the South Australian sculptor who did it. It is often referred to as the `Vegemite Queen', for good reason: it looks like it was made out of Vegemite. I hope that if we have one of the Queen Mother we have a better one than that and we put it in a prominent place. Do not try—because we want to change our constitutional arrangements—to rubbish people who have had nothing to do with keeping our constitutional arrangements as they are. So I think she did a good job. I would like to see a recognition of her role—perhaps a statue would be the appropriate way to do it—and I would like to see the republican movement recognise that you do not move on successfully by rubbishing your past. I would like them to recognise that our constitutional arrangements are nobody's fault but our own; you cannot blame the monarchy that we are not a republic. So getting stuck into the Queen Mother, Prince Charles or Her Majesty the Queen is a futile and wasted effort, and it is effort that could go into building a better Australia and building a republic.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-05-15,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does the minister recall telling the Financial Review just a month ago, on 10 April:
The bottom line, what business tells us, is `whatever you do, keep the Budget in surplus' ... We will meet that in full ... surplus budgeting is an appropriate stance.
With the budget in the red to the tune of $1.2 billion, do you feel like a dill, Minister?
—Senator Conroy, your question should be addressed to the chair, not across the chamber to the minister.
—Madam President, on a point of order: surely that sort of terminology is not allowed in questions. Specific standing orders in relation to questions state that that sort of terminology cannot be used. I would invite you to rule the question out of order or at least require Senator Conroy to get his question in line with standing orders.
—It is an inappropriate way of addressing. There is no question about that. It reflects more on the questioner than on the person being questioned, I would suggest. The first part of the question is legitimate, and I would invite the minister to comment on that.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-05-15,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. On what basis did the minister provide that categorical assurance only one month ago—which was after September 11—when the budget would essentially have been formulated, that the government would keep the budget in surplus? Wasn't the Minister for Finance and Administration involved in the budget preparation process?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-05-15,"—Thank you, Madam President. Those of us in the coalition are always amazed at the gall of the Labor Party asking questions that reflect on the surplus or otherwise, given that it was the Labor Party that, in an extraordinary period of just five years in the Hawke-Keating years, racked up deficits of some $70 billion, leaving this country with a government debt of $96 billion which we have spent the last six years paying off, to the great credit of this government and to the great benefit of Australian taxpayers. 
The public debt interest bill on the debt that Labor left us was some $8 billion and is now down to around $4 billion, still a substantial amount of money that we have to pay out on behalf of taxpayers on interest on their debt. But we are paying it off. We have paid off $61 billion of that debt. I remind Senator Conroy that over the last four years we have had surpluses of $24 billion and over the next four years we will have surpluses of $16 billion. We feel no embarrassment whatsoever in bringing down a budget that forecasts a surplus of $2.1 billion, entirely consistent with the remarks I made to the Financial Review prior to the budget.
The fact is that the expected outcome for 2001-02—that is, to the end of June this year—is a small deficit of $1.2 billion. We are not at all ashamed about that. I think Australians and the opposition should reflect on the fact that the year 2001-02 was one of the most extraordinary years in world history. No-one could have predicted the events of September 11 and the horrendous impact that had on the world financial system and on the requirement of all Western countries to massively upgrade their domestic security.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left will cease shouting, including Senator Conroy.
—The fact is that the government, like other Western governments, just about all of which are in deficit at the moment, had to respond to the cataclysmic events of September 11 by significantly upgrading their own domestic security— which we have done through various policy measures—by launching an all-out war against terrorism. We are proud to be part of that. We also had $400 million less revenue than was anticipated. As I said, we have no shame in the small deficit of $1.2 billion, given the extent to which we have been able to pay off the extraordinary Labor debt that was left to us and given the forecast for continuing surpluses under our government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Deficit</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-05-15,"—My remarks to the Financial Review or to any other part of the media related to the budget the government was preparing—that is, the budget for 2002-03. We gave a clear undertaking that that budget would be in surplus, and we have delivered a $2.1 billion surplus which Labor were completely incapable of delivering during its years in office. What they delivered was $96 billion of debt. How dare they criticise us for the management of the economy that we have produced.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2002-05-15,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. While the Labor Party is very critical of these measures to help the disabled, I ask the minister whether anyone has actually come out and supported the initiatives that Senator Vanstone has put in place to help those with disabilities?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Disability Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2002-05-15,"—I thank Senator Knowles for the question. It is a great opportunity to put paid to the myth being spread by some colleagues opposite that this government would cut disability spending to fund the war on terrorism. We are not cutting disability spending; we are in fact increasing it. In a difficult budget we are increasing expenditure on those with disabilities. We are rebalancing that increased expenditure in favour of those who have higher support needs. I want to start by apologising to the disabled in the community. The apology is that it has taken any government in Australia so long to finally focus on the abilities of these people rather than focusing on their disabilities. It is like the worker in the Public Service who recently said to her boss, `Don't judge me by the wheelchair that you see; judge me on my brain and what I can contribute to this organisation.' For that woman—before you scoff over there—there was a long haul from a tragic car accident, through to TAFE, university, a master's degree and finally her current position.
There is increased money in this budget to the states and territories for specialist disability services—$743 million through the next Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. The new agreement will be $2.7 billion—a record contribution from the Commonwealth. This must be matched by an increase from the states and territories who have benefited, of course, from increased GST funding and the record stamp duties that they are still collecting in Victoria and New South Wales. The states and territories will need to increase their accountability to disabled people for where the money goes— no more `big cheque spend it where you want', now they will have to account for it. The money also depends on the DSP reforms being passed by this parliament. I cannot urge senators enough to understand that disabled people want to be judged on their ability not on their disability. 
The McClure report told us to realign the 30-hour work capacity threshold with current working patterns. That is what we are doing. There has been a fivefold increase in part-time work, compared with full-time work, in the past 20 years. If you can work for 15 hours or more at award rates, you should not be on a disability benefit. There is no longer an easy way out for governments. They will now have to provide the help that people need to be active and valued members of the community. You cannot go the easy route any longer and pay people to stay at home, rather than invest in and help them be as active as they can. 
I hesitate to refer to Labor's apparent support. I urge honourable senators opposite who I know are interested in this issue to encourage their colleagues to recognise that many with a disability are quite sensitive. They do not think Mr Swan is smart or funny when he refers not to welfare reform but to welfare deform. Coming on top of Mr Latham's jibe—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—He said it—at a former Liberal Party minister and president as being deformed in every sense, it was not a class contribution from Mr Swan. Mr Latham is ill-advised when he says `blind Freddy can see' before he comments on disability support benefit reform. The Labor shadow minister, Mr Swan, has nonetheless recognised the need for change—and I am sure that Senator Knowles will want to know about those who support the need for change. The Labor shadow minister, Mr Swan, in the Labor Party's submission to the McClure reference group, said that solutions must be found to the growth in DSP to ensure that people with disabilities have the fullest opportunity available to reach their potential and to make their contribution. That is what we are doing. We are putting more money into those with the highest support needs to help them get out and be active.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget: Disability Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2002-05-15,"—I thank Senator Knowles for the question. Senator Knowles may be interested that Mr Latham, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, said that something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the disability support pension. He went on to argue that the disability support pension needed mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity to work. We are not going that far— we are looking at only those who have a genuine capacity to work for 15 hours or more. Mr Latham said in parliament, `Again Mr McClure has got it right' Mr McClure said that we should treat mildly disabled Australians seriously. He also stated:
So don't emphasise disability; emphasise the capacity that mildly disabled people have to work.
There is a famous quote that the disabled have their handicap revealed and their genius concealed, while able-bodied people have their genius revealed and their disability concealed. Ultimately, we must judge people by their values and their contribution. Do not leave anybody out.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-05-15,"—Madam President, yesterday Senator Bartlett asked me a question in relation to the detention of juveniles in immigration detention centres. I undertook to get back to him with some further detail and I have that here. I seek leave to table it and to incorporate it in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Madam President yesterday Senator Bartlett asked me a question yesterday regarding the government's response to the South Australian Department of Human Services report on children in detention.
After consulting with the Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs I wish to advise the following:
The Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has received the initial confidential report from the South Australian Department of Human Services. 
Both the DIMIA and human services officials have had detailed consultations on the contents of the report and at this time DIMIA has sought clarification from human services on some aspects of the information contained within the report.
DIMIA has acknowledged some of the practical issues raised within the report and is moving to address some of those issues at this time. However, until South Australian human services clarifies the information provided in the report, it remains unclear how long it will be before consultations can be concluded.
While there are ongoing consultations about the report between the two departments, the report deals with individual family cases and is therefore subject to privacy considerations. Consequently, DIMIA has no intention of releasing another agency's report on individuals and families whose privacy is protected by law.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: Detention Centres</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-05-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today relating to the 2002-03 Budget.
I wanted to speak in particular on Senator Minchin's appalling efforts to try and continue the fraud that is this budget that he has delivered for next year, the deceptions that this government is perpetrating, deceptions intended to mislead the public about the true state of the budget. Before the election—to be precise, on 17 October; and just in case anyone is confused October comes after September 11, so you cannot use the excuse that the world changed on September 11 and that caught us out—Mr Costello told all Australians:
We are giving a guarantee that we will keep the Budget in surplus, yes we are.
It would seem that Mr Costello's guarantees are not worth that much. Last night he announced a deficit, not that you would have known if you tuned in on the telly or listened on the radio. He spoke for 30 minutes, and he did not mention the dreaded d-word once. There was no mention of the fact that he had plunged us into deficit. Once again, it is one thing to tell the Australian public before the election and it is a different thing after the election.
What were the reasons for the deficit? If you were listening to the Prime Minister on AM this morning, he said it was the result of slightly weaker revenues. However, as the Prime Minister knows, this is not true. The budget shows quite explicitly that revenue was stronger than expected. The effect of revenue on the budget outcome was in fact $2.5 billion more than expected, not as they are trying to pretend on the other side. They actually had an increase, not the decrease they are trying to pretend. So who is to blame for the deficit? Again, according to Mr Howard this morning on AM, it was the bureaucrats—Treasury officials. They were assessments prepared by the two departments of Treasury and Finance, and both of them predicted that this year's budget would end with a slight surplus.
Of course, the other explanation that the government has seized upon to explain away the deficit we were not meant to have is the uncertain world environment. Given the emphasis the Treasurer placed on these uncertainties, why has he cut the contingency reserve to just $18 million? He has cut it from $920 million to $18 million. The contingency reserve provides funds for a rainy day to meet unexpected outlays—just the sort of outlays that might arise in the current uncertain environment in which Mr Costello has reminded us we all live. Why then has Mr Costello only left $18 million in its rainy-day fund, compared to almost $1 billion this time last year?
The answer is simple. Having broken his promise to deliver a surplus this year, he has raided the rainy-day fund so he can guarantee a surplus next year. We know what Mr Costello's guarantees are worth. But there are other fiddles; I do not want you to think this is the only fiddle he is up to this year because he has got form on budget fiddles, as we talked about in previous debates. The budget for 2002-03 would be in deficit on the proper basis of measurement defined not by the Labor Party but by the Treasurer and the Department of Finance and Administration and approved by this parliament: the accruals basis. $150 million was sliced off Defence spending through a delay in capital projects promised under the Defence white paper. That is right: if we buy this equipment, we go into deficit; so, quick, we will put it off till next year. Shame on you, Senator Hill. So much for looking after Australia's defences. There is a $200 million `re-profiling'—that is a quote from the budget papers—of the roads budget. That is another deferral of an existing promise. There is a $40 million deferral of the working credits proposal in the welfare reform package. Australian families are paying the price for this government's spending binge last year to buy them the election result. The government were spending like drunken sailors. Now the time to pay the bill has come—and who is paying for it? Australian families. They are already paying the price in higher interest rates because of the government's extraordinary incompetence in delivering a budget deficit in a year when the economy grew by four per cent at the end of a decade of growth. From 1 August they will pay the price in higher costs for medicines—and this is on top of price increases for other necessities such as telephone charges, postal charges and private health insurance.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2002-05-15,"—Talk about the pot calling the kettle black: Senator Conroy from the Labor Party—a party which, when in government, racked up deficit after deficit and exploded the Australian government's debt to almost $100 billion—coming in here and lecturing the government about the minor deficit that is estimated for the 2001-02 budget. As we well know, that deficit was caused by the unexpected events associated with the acts of terrorism of September 11 and the follow-up need for the government to commit more expenditure on defence. The first priority of any government is to ensure the security of its citizens—to ensure that our defences are adequate, to ensure that our borders are protected and to ensure that our domestic security is adequate. That is the reason why the budget for the current financial year is estimated at this stage to finish up in a small deficit.
It is quite significant that the Labor Party want to live in the past. They want to talk about the budget outcome for this year when the feature of last night's presentation was, of course, the budget for the forthcoming financial year and all of the initiatives that the government has taken in that budget as well as the strong economic growth that is going to be maintained as a result of this government's sound economic management. Again, that is a record that the Labor Party simply do not want to talk about because it contrasts so dramatically with the record of their government in the years from 1983 to 1996. So it is no wonder that the opposition want to nitpick, to try to find some fault in the government's budget processes either over the current year or next year. The only thing that they have found is a minor deficit which is, as I said, a result of the unexpected events of September 11 last year. When we look at the key issue—and, as I said, the key issue is the budget for the forthcoming year—we find a very strong fiscal outlook with an underlying cash surplus of $2.1 billion, which will lay the foundations for even stronger surpluses in the years beyond 2000-03.
I talked earlier about the massive debt that the Labor Party racked up when they were in government because of deficit after deficit, year after year. In the six years now that this government has been in office and with the seventh budget having been delivered, we will have paid back some $61 billion of that debt that Labor racked up. They increased our debt, let me remind the Senate, by some $80 billion: it was around $20 billion when they came to office in 1983 and it exploded to $100 billion over their time in office. We will have paid off $61 billion of that by the end of the next financial year. That is a remarkable achievement by any judgment, and those are the sorts of issues that ought to be focused on rather than this minor matter, this nitpicking, that we have seen exhibited by the opposition today.
The central feature of the government's financial management has been its maintenance of a strong economy even over the last 12 months in the face of the international recession that resulted from that terrorist act of September 11. In the current financial year that we are about to complete, the Australian economy outperformed the economy of every other developed country. Its rate of growth was about 10 times the OECD average—again, a remarkable achievement. That growth will remain strong over the next 12 months as a result of the effective budgeting and strong economic management of the government. There will be economic growth of around 3¾ per cent over the next 12 months. Inflation will remain in the target band at 2¾ per cent and, as a consequence of that strong growth and low inflation, unemployment will continue to fall to about six per cent by the middle of next year. Business investment will remain strong, and that is a very important factor in ensuring employment growth. So all of those key economic fundamentals are being kept on track by the sound management of this government. But the most important thing, as I said, for this government to do—indeed, for any government to do—is to ensure the security of its citizens and we are doing that with the increases in Defence spending, an increase of some half a billion dollars over and above what was planned in the white paper.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-05-15,"—We are taking note of a number of responses—so-called responses—from Senator Minchin, representing the Treasurer, with respect to the budget that was delivered last night. I did think it was somewhat ironic that Senator Chapman complained about the Labor Party wanting to live in the past after he had gone back six or seven years to the alleged record of debt that the Labor Party left when it finished in office. We could go back to the election loss in 1983, when the then Treasurer—now the Prime Minister— Mr Howard, left some $26 billion of debt from one budget. That was kept hidden during that election campaign. If we look at the budget speech, the Treasurer announced last night:
Our budget for the year is in surplus—a surplus of $2.1 billion.
What year was he referring to? He was not referring to the current year: if we look at the current year's budget, it is actually in deficit. The Treasurer was very careful not to mention the particular year he was referring to. He did not want to give away or draw attention to the fact that the underlying cash balance was $1.2 billion in deficit. He just wanted to talk about the budget being in projected surplus—I emphasise `projected surplus'—for next year.
In my question to the Minister for Finance and Administration, I did remind Senator Minchin that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, said on 17 October during the election campaign:
We are giving a guarantee that we will keep the budget in surplus. Yes, we are.
That was the undertaking that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, gave back on 17 October last year. Yet here we are, almost at the end of the financial year, when it is apparent that the Treasury and the Treasurer now accept that we are going to end up with a deficit. The Treasurer must have known at that point, some five or six months ago, that we were going to have a deficit. Yet he did not announce it during the election campaign. I think the reason is fairly obvious. The Treasurer would not want to disclose that Australia was going to be running both an underlying cash deficit and a fiscal balance.
What is interesting about the deficit for this year is the claim made by Mr Howard, on AM this morning I think, that there has been a decline in revenues. If we look at the total tax receipts, we see they have been very strong indeed, and they are projected to be very strong over the next four or five years. So the answer does not lie in a fall-off in revenue leading to the deficit during the current financial year. The answer lies in the huge spend-up that the government had in the lead-up to the election. I do not in any way criticise the expenditures in respect of security. There was a whole range of other expenditures that the government committed to last year in order to effectively buy back popularity in the lead-up to the election. That was overwhelmingly the most substantial reason for the deficit that has resulted this financial year.
The issue of tax revenues that I referred to earlier is an interesting one. If we look at the estimates of Commonwealth receipts in Budget Paper No. 1, page 13-4, the projected taxation receipts for the Commonwealth in the year 2005-06—and that is as far as can reasonably be projected—will be $186.4 billion. That is 20.8 per cent of the economy. In the financial year 2001-02, it was $148.8 billion. So there is going to be a very substantial increase in the tax take. I remind the Senate that this does not include the tax take from the GST. We should include the tax take from the GST. If we do, we find that this government is the highest taxing government in Australian history, outside wartime.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2002-05-15,"—Unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party at a federal level has taken a very narrow view of last night's budget. That narrow view is not shared by the business or economic community; indeed, it is not shared by the rest of the world. After last night we did not see a dip in the Australian exchange rate; in fact, I think it further strengthened. We did not see a great sell-off in shares, because everybody around the world knows of the strength of the Australian economy. It is unfortunate that today in Australia we have had this very narrowly based barrage of criticism from the Australian Labor Party. All free democratic governments have a prime responsibility to protect their borders and their domestic populations, as well as a responsibility to protect their economies. But, following the events in Manhattan on 11 September, security risks around the world have changed forever—for the worse, unfortunately. 
The potential threat from that type of terrorist activity requires strong protective action, not only at a domestic level but also at an international level. Proudly, Australia has risen to its responsibilities, as have the United States and other countries such as Britain. We all know that protecting our borders and our citizens and increasing surveillance against terrorist type infiltration and activity come at a great cost, unfortunately. That great cost was reflected in the budget figures presented last night. So, between September and June, costs have been rising, and that is the reason for a temporary move into deficit. The strong predicted recovery from temporary short-term deficit to future surplus reflects the underlying strength of the Australian economy. Reactions from businesspeople at home, from international institutions and from others show their continuing confidence in the economic direction and sound fundamentals of Australia. A recent issue of the Economist magazine states:
Australians are not like the rest of us. Last year, when almost all the rich economies dipped into recession or slowed sharply, Australia continued to boom. What is more, while most big stock markets have fallen by one-third or so from their peaks in early 2000, share prices in Sydney touched a new high this year.
In a sense it was this very strength of the Australian economy that, as a result of certain changes in housing, allowed some flexibility, like an increase in home owners arrangements. It was this very strength that provided this flexibility and allowed us to move into a deficit without a major reaction in terms of what might happen to interest rates, what might happen to inflation and other countries' regard for Australia. 
This was a very sound budget. If we look at what has happened, we will notice that most government departments have had significant costs. That comes from Prime Minister and Cabinet down. Very roughly, it looks like Prime Minister and Cabinet are down $24 million; Transport and Regional Services are down significantly, over $50 million; Foreign Affairs and Trade are down about $250 million. It is the same with Environment and Heritage, Finance and Administration and Agricultural, Fisheries and Forestry. So it is not narrowly targeted, as they say; it is across the spectrum, and all areas have to provide their cost. From a superannuation and a savings perspective, the budget certainly contained some very good news.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-05-15,"—We are taking note of responses to various questions to Senator Minchin, Senator Vanstone and Senator Patterson in the areas of finance, health and family and community services. Within those broad parameters, I want to make a few remarks about last evening's budget, as to how that budget affects Australia's veterans community. Senator Watson just made some comments in passing on the significance, or otherwise, of what he referred to as the temporary move into deficit. He said that was a one-off circumstance, justified by Australia's choice to become involved in the war on terror, and also—and more certainly—justified by extra demands from within the defence community for increased staffing arrangements, capital outlays, and improvements to border protection measures and other generalised security concerns. 
There is some truth in the matters raised by Senator Watson, but in principle it raises the question of the debt and the gratitude that this nation owes to those persons who served in prior conflicts—World War II, Korea, the Malaysian confrontation, Vietnam and a range of other conflicts where Australia has chosen to send its troops offshore. It raises the question of what debt is owed to those men and women and it raises the question of honour, as to how the undertakings of governments of the day—both Labor and conservative governments—should be honoured and maintained by current governments. In that context, those in the veterans community quite rightly suggest that payments or benefits that they receive are not to be equated with general welfare payments made to members of the community who are in need, but are really an appreciation of past service and a gesture of gratitude by current generations for service and work carried out by that community.
Within those constraints, when we look at the budget delivered by the Treasurer last evening, we can say at the outset that there was nothing new, additional or separate for veterans in last evening's budget. Two items only featured in the Treasurer's speech and in the supporting documentation. Firstly, there was the extension of the gold card to veterans with qualifying service—that is, service overseas. Secondly, there was the indexation of the war widows income support supplement. Let us take the first matter identified in the budget papers—the extension of the gold card. The bill that addresses that passed through both houses of parliament in February and March of this year, without any opposition from the Labor Party. It went through in record short time. Since that time, the department has been taking the necessary steps to implement the decision. So the suggestion in the budget papers that there is something new, wonderful, different or excessive for veterans is completely untrue. It is simply a continuation of past practice—past practice so cemented in memory that it has been on the record books since February or March of this year.
Similarly, with the indexation of the war widows income support supplement, there is nothing new and nothing not already foreshadowed. It was part of last year's election commitment by the federal coalition, and it is simply giving effect to that in the budget papers. So the net of last evening's budget for veterans and the veterans community is that there is nothing new or additional or separate. The two announcements in the glossy papers that had to be manufactured in the minister's office for distribution are simply reannouncements of current programs and benefits already promised.
Not only is there nothing new but there is going to be an attack and a hurt inflicted on the veterans community because the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs applies to veterans. In each of those instances, thousands of veterans around Australia—many of whom are on TPI, EDA or disablement payments, along with their families—are going to have the gratitude that has been bestowed upon them by previous governments, the public and taxpayers generally, dishonoured in this budget, because every time they go—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-05-15,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats particularly to acknowledge the answers given to questions asked by Senator Lees and me today on two issues: firstly, Senator Lees's question to the Minister for Health and Ageing on the PBS cuts proposed in this budget; and, secondly, my question to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services, on the proposed cuts to the DSP.
The Australian Democrats have made it very clear that we oppose any attacks on the most vulnerable in our community, particularly those who are sick, poor, disabled and unemployed. That is the reason we have outlined for opposing the two measures to which I refer. In order to avoid an impasse or some kind of budget block, we have indicated to the government that we are prepared to look at other areas, particularly in relation to the health budget, to find money to finance the PBS, in particular, which is one of the fastest growing aspects of the health budget. 
In relation to the DSP, I asked the minister today whether she was aware of estimates that indicated that up to 180,000 people— possibly more—could be thrown off disability support over the next four years. The minister did not seem particularly concerned by this. She seems to think there are other opportunities—employment et cetera —for these Australians. Given there are 600,000 other Australians who are competing for jobs in the job market—jobs that do not seem to exist—what is going to happen to these people? The minister did acknowledge that only 73,000 places were being created in training and rehabilitation. They would undoubtedly be available to some of these people, but that still leaves more than 100,000 disadvantaged Australians who, presumably, will have nothing to do and nowhere to go. Goodness knows what benefits they will be relying on. The cuts to the disability support pension which we think will hit around 180,000 Australians will see them losing at least $52 a fortnight, not to mention other concessional benefits. We think this is a cruel and nasty— in fact, mean—element of this particular budget, and that is why we will not support it.
In relation to the PBS, again the government was surprised by the entirely predictable. As Senator Lees noted in her question to the minister, the government was given advice, particularly about a couple of key medications that saw the blow-out in that budget expenditure. We believe this government can find the revenue necessary to prevent cuts to the DSP and the PBS, including through its own health budget. Do Australians realise that the 30 per cent private health care rebate that this government introduced actually cost the taxpayer $10 billion over four years? If we actually means tested so that we targeted that rebate—say, to make it not available to those who are in the top tax bracket—we could, conservative estimates suggest, make about $1.9 billion over the next four years. That would fund the DSP and the PBS, and there would be more left over—and I acknowledge that that is a very conservative estimate.
The Australian Democrats will not be supporting those measures. We are disappointed by the response of both ministers today in relation to health and welfare issues, but once again I am not surprised by this government's lack of empathy or interest when it comes to poorer Australians. This budget disproportionately impacts on people in our community who are the most vulnerable—the sick, the poor, the unemployed, the elderly and, of course, the disabled. How dare the minister in her answers today suggest that this is not a savings measure? It says very clearly in the budget that this is a savings measure. This government is going to recoup around $400 million by its cruel, mean and nasty cuts to the disability support pension. But there are some members of parliament who are not going to stand for it. I certainly hope—and there are indications— that the Australian Labor Party will join with the Australian Democrats to stop such regressive changes.
The budget was unbalanced in its impact on poorer Australians, but it was also a budget in deficit. I do not think any Australians will believe the furphy that it is in deficit as a consequence of the costs of the war on terror. It is in deficit as a consequence of this government's pork-barrelling, particularly at the last election, with ill-targeted policies such as the baby bonus, the cuts to the fuel excise and many others. The Australian Democrats are disappointed by the lack of vision in last night's budget and it short-sightedness in key areas in the economy such as education and the environment.

That the Senate take note of the report. 
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The statement read as follows—
In accordance with Section 16 of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the Sixty-fifth Annual Report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works. This Report gives an overview of the work undertaken by the Committee during 2001. 
The reporting year was a very busy one for the Committee. Fourteen reports were tabled, one more than last year, even though the Committee ceased to exist on 8 October 2001, when the House of Representatives was dissolved for the general election. The Committee had also commenced preliminary work on the proposed Christmas Island common-use infrastructure items. However, this reference lapsed with the dissolution of the House. The value of the works inquired into by the Committee amounted to over half a billion dollars.
During the year the Committee hosted the Annual Conference of Australian Parliamentary Public Works Committees. The Conference brought together parliamentarians and key staff from public works committees throughout Australia. This annual event provides a unique opportunity for members of Australian legislatures and staff involved in public works to explore issues of mutual interest.
The Annual Report I am tabling today canvassed a number of issues of continuing Committee focus. These relate to:
·	energy conservation;
·	heritage and environmental issues; and
·	the Public Works Committee Act.
Heritage and environmental issues remain a specific interest. The Committee is keen to ensure that items of significant heritage value are preserved for future generations and expects agencies to consult with the Australian Heritage Commission before bringing their reference before the Committee. The same situation applies to environmental matters. Agencies are reminded that the current Environment Act leaves the onus on them to raise issues of environmental concern with Environment Australia.
In relation to energy management, the Committee is aware that the Commonwealth is committed to best practice to assure ecologically sustainable development and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Committee received evidence from the Australian Greenhouse Office on a number of projects that detailed the extent of compliance with the Commonwealth's energy policy. The Committee believes that energy conservation issues will become increasingly important and intends to pursue them in future inquiries.
The Committee confirmed the importance of Greenhouse issues by inviting Ms Cathy Zoi, Executive Director, New Energy to address the Conference of Public Works Committees. The focus of her speech was `Sustainability in buildings'. Ms Zoi made the point that through the parliamentary committee processes, committees are uniquely placed to assist in ensuring increased application of sustainability in buildings. 
In this regard, the Committee considered an extension of its role in oversighting energy conservation in relation to Commonwealth public works projects and general energy usage by the Commonwealth. Representatives of the Australian Greenhouse Office raised the possibility of the Committee conducting an annual review of energy use based on the annual report of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, Energy use in Commonwealth Operations. However, under the current Public Works Committee Act, the Committee is unable to review this report.
The Public Works Act as it stands is providing increasing challenges for the Committee in this current environment of highly devolved public works and property functions. The Committee has been conscious for some time for the need to review the Act, as it was more applicable in a time when the Commonwealth operated a large and highly centralised property and public works system with in-house delivery of works-programming, building-design and project management. 
I should stress the point that the Committee strongly believes in the importance of public scrutiny of works projects that involve large public expenditures and it is because of this strong view, it considers the current Act should be reviewed. This would ensure that the process of parliamentary scrutiny is not marginalised. The Public Works Committee Act 1969 was last reviewed and amended in 1989. 
Last year saw the departure from the Public Works Committee and the Parliament of Mr Colin Hollis, the former Member for Throsby. Mr Hollis was a long-serving member of the Committee having served continuously from February 1985 until October 2001. I echo the sentiments of past and current Public Works Committee members by paying tribute to the substantial contribution made by Mr Hollis to the work of the Committee, both as Chair and as an active member. Mr Hollis always worked in bipartisan manner with the aim of ensuring that the expenditure on public works was necessary and that the Commonwealth was obtaining value for money. We wish Mr Hollis well in his retirement and we shall miss his good humour and camaraderie.
I wish to take this opportunity to thank all of the members of the Committee for their support during a very busy year. They worked in a spirit of cooperation to ensure that the references that came before the Committee were reported upon before the House was dissolved. 
I would also like to record the Committee's appreciation for the support provided by the staff of the Secretariat during a very busy period.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-05-15,"—I am in continuation in relation to the motion before the chair. I was talking about three gaping holes in the middle of the government's logic in their approach to enrolment fraud. I had mentioned that the AEC did not have a method of checking whether a witness falls into one of the prescribed classes of witnesses and I was about to quote the AEC, whom I had asked to advise on this particular issue. Firstly, the AEC said to me, `The AEC has nothing against which it could check the witness occupation details. The AEC ceased collecting electors' occupation details for Commonwealth purposes some time ago, and even that information was frequently out of date.' That is the first gaping hole.
Secondly, they said, `The AEC has no way of checking whether that witness actually sighted the ID.' And, to get the trifecta up, that `the AEC has no way of checking whether the ID was genuine.' The government has known for at least two years that its bureaucratic enrolment system would have no effect on enrolment fraud. The AEC's concerns about how ineffective the regulations would be were well summed up in a recent submission to the JSCEM committee, where it noted that these reforms would not have stopped Karen Ehrmann and Andy Kehoe. Nevertheless, the government wants to spend about $5 million of taxpayers' money, per year, for a complex bureaucratic system that even the AEC says will not improve the security or the accuracy of the roll. Cynically, the government is asking taxpayers to fund a system that will do nothing to stop electoral fraud but will entrench a much more serious rorting of the rolls by stopping young people and the disadvantaged from enrolling. 
It is important to remember that the government waited until the eleventh hour before the last federal election to table the regulations and then threatened massive and complex change to electoral enrolment. Not only did the government keep ordinary Australians in the dark about the new enrolment rules, but it also kept the AEC in the dark. The AEC, the organisation whose job it is to administer elections and inform all Australians about the electoral system, did not know when this massive change was to be brought in. 
The AEC was left in an invidious position of producing and issuing, under embargo, new enrolment forms to all Australia Post outlets. By tabling the regulations just before the election, but lacking the courage to proclaim the relevant amendments and so implement their new system, the government's claims that it is concerned about the integrity of the electoral roll have really been exposed. What an admission: they were too complex and the changes would have caused such chaos during the election that they were abandoned by the government itself. So, along with the AEC and most of the states, the opposition has made it very clear that constructive measures to improve the integrity of the roll will be supported. We will not, however, support changes to the system that do nothing about fraud while potentially disenfranchising very many people. All states and territories have commented on the regulations. 
—All Labor.
—All states and territories that have commented on the regulations have strongly objected to them, as they will impose extremely onerous requirements on first-time enrollees, while imposing much weaker requirements on those who are transferring enrolment.
In the interests of maintaining the joint enrolment arrangements, and recognising the requirements of the Commonwealth and state governments, the Victorian Attorney-General and the Victorian Electoral Commission have been very active in developing an approach which offers a means of establishing a stronger proof of identity for enrolment and which is not so onerous as to disenfranchise already under-represented groups on the electoral roll. 
A meeting of electoral commissioners and chief electoral officers was convened on Friday, 8 February 2002 in Adelaide to discuss possible alternative approaches to enrolment verification. The meeting considered the use of a range of information from databases, including Medicare, the ATO, passports and driver licence records. And driver licence records were considered to be a viable alternative for enrolment and transfer of enrolment purposes. Driver licences are held by some 90 per cent of the population and are already used to assist in the verification of identity for other government and commercial purposes.
If the driver licence approach were to be used, people applying for enrolment or transfer of enrolment would be required to include their driver licence number on the enrolment form. This would replace the need to have the form witnessed. If the person did not have a drivers licence, then he or she would have the form witnessed by an elector who did have a drivers licence and who would include the witness's drivers licence number on the form. Not only is the simplicity of this compelling; it would work, and we should do it. If the government proposes this sort of mechanism—simple, effective, certain to work—I can assure the government that those proposals would be strongly supported by the Labor Party.
The licence regulation authorities would be required by law to provide state and territory electoral authorities with driver licence numbers linked to name, address and date of birth information for the enrollee. This information would also be passed on to the AEC to assist with enrolment verification. Electoral authorities would then use the driver licence information to verify the identity of a person applying to enrol or a witness to an enrolment form as the case requires. Naturally, state, territory and the Commonwealth governments would need to pass complementary legislation to make the system work. In stark contrast to the regulations that the Senate is considering today, there was general agreement amongst electoral officials that the driver licence approach could be implemented.
Of course, further work on the implementation would need to be undertaken if the Commonwealth, states and territory governments were to agree to the driver licence approach. The meeting considered that the driver licence approach would provide real safeguards against potential enrolment fraud. The identity requirements would apply equally to those applying as first-time enrollees as well as to those transferring enrolment. The driver licence approach would also address the situation that was publicised in Queensland where there were a small number of cases of enrolment fraud amongst electors who had previously been correctly enrolled. If a person enrolled for an address at which they did not reside, or provided a fictitious address, then the address provided on the enrolment form would not match that on the driver licence database and inquiries would be made. The Commonwealth provisions, by contrast, would do nothing to address that sort of situation. 
Electoral commissioners and chief electoral officers are very keen to preserve joint enrolment arrangements. As such, if the driver licence approach has the support of state, territory and Commonwealth governments, electoral authorities believe that it has a number of very clear advantages. Primarily, the driver licence approach would not be onerous for people applying for enrolment or transfer of enrolment. People are already familiar with using driver licences as identification. You do it when you open a bank account, when you cash a cheque, when you apply for a passport, and so on. In addition, the enrolment form would be very simple and very clear compared to the enrolment form needed under the Commonwealth's proposed provisions. 
It is now obvious that the reason the government has ignored the alternatives is that the other models for improving the integrity of the roll did not have the political spin-off that the government wanted. That is, the government wanted to make it harder to enrol to vote for people in remote communities, harder for the homeless, harder for the disadvantaged, harder for the people with poor English, harder for the illiterate—harder for these more alienated people in our community.
What we in the opposition suspected all along has now become clear—the new enrolment witnessing rules brought in by these regulations are all about politics and have nothing whatsoever to do with the integrity of the electoral rolls or improving the electoral law in this country. The Commonwealth's enrolment provisions fail to address the potential for enrolment fraud, but they will ensure that it is more difficult for all eligible people—especially young people and others underrepresented on the electoral roll—to enrol. 
I have no doubt that the new enrolment form will confuse, and thus deter, many people from enrolling to vote. It will particularly affect people who are on the margins of our society, those whose intellectual capacity, whose language skills, whose eyesight or whose ability to find a witness or produce an ID is less than that of anyone who sits in this chamber. The homeless, and people living in remote areas of Australia will be the hardest hit. 
These new enrolment procedures have been on the drawing board for over two years. Over that time the government has consistently ignored sensible alternatives from the AEC and from state governments. By ignoring the legitimate concerns raised by the states, who are partners with the AEC in managing the roll, the government has risked the separation of the national and state electoral rolls. Such an outcome would be disastrous for the integrity of the electoral roll. It is for those reasons that I urge the Senate to support this motion to disallow the regulation. ",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-05-15,"—I rise to speak on the motion before us for the disallowance of the Electoral Referendum Amendment Regulation 2001 (No.1). The first matter I wish to deal with is the nature of the inquiries into the integrity of the electoral roll. The inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was a heated, contentious and fractious inquiry. Nevertheless, I felt that in the end, as often happens with inquiries and reports, the report had a lot to recommend it and a lot of balance. A key finding which emerged from the evidence presented to that inquiry, and which is heartening not only to all of us in this chamber but to all Australians concerned with the health of our democracy, is that while there are, were—and will continue to be, in my view—fraudulent enrolments and matters which would concern one about individual circumstances, general fraud, systemic fraud or anything which could put at risk the results of a by-election or a general election was quite patently not apparent. It is very important to understand that. 
The second inquiry of the Auditor-General into the integrity of the roll clearly found that the integrity of the roll was assured. That does not mean that it is perfect. I was heartened to see the very positive response of the AEC to all the recommendations for improvement. That is to their credit, and I am quite sure the government is very supportive of them doing what they must to follow up on those recommendations. However, having said that there is no risk to the results of either by-elections or general elections on the basis of the evidence before those two inquiries, we—and I mean `we' in the broadest sense of all parliamentary parties and other participants in the electoral process—would be foolish not to ensure the absolute minimal occurrence of fraud. That requires the systems employed by the AEC and by their brother and sister organisations in the states to be as tight as possible.  
The regulation that the government has put before the parliament, which is the subject of a disallowance motion, covers two broad grounds. One concerns the documents that need to be presented and the other concerns the persons who can attest to claims for enrolment—in other words, witness them. There are 14 original documents that can be produced to ensure that whoever turns up to be enrolled is who they say they are. I will go through them: an Australian birth certificate, an Australian Defence Force discharge document, an Australian marriage certificate, a certificate of citizenship, a current Australian driver's licence—of all those documents that is probably the one that people carry most, and Senator Faulkner said 90 per cent of people do—or a learner driver's licence, which is important to young people, a current Australian passport, a current Australian photographic student identification card, a current card issued by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, a current identity card showing the signature and photograph of the cardholder, a current pensioner concession card, a current proof-of-age card issued by a state or territory authority, again, a very important one for young people, a certificate of a decree nisi or a decree absolute made or granted by the Family Court of Australia, in other words, a divorce document, a document of appointment as an Australian justice of the peace, and a document, not mentioned in the preceding item in this schedule, that is accepted by the Electoral Commission as evidence of the identity of a person. That is an extremely wide list.
I will not drive the Senate mad by reading the next list, because there are 42 items on it, but the range of persons who can witness claims for enrolment is very wide indeed. A great variety of professions and officers can attest to it. So, on the face of it, this looks an extremely reasonable approach. Senator Faulkner has said that motives behind this are political, and the environment in which these have been generated are political, as is the failure to consider alternative means—if I am not verballing you, Senator Faulkner; it is my understanding of what you said.
—You are not verballing me, but I would not mind if you did. We are all verballed in here.
—I do not know if that is an insult or a compliment, so I will just glide by; I will take it as both. It seems to me that from my perspective I cannot judge that. I do not know what the motives of the government are and neither, I might say, do I know what the motives of the Labor Party or the state organisations are. What I do know is this: the Auditor-General's report, by memory because I do not have the report before me, said that nearly one million Australians are not on the roll. That is a great concern. This is a country—and I am a great supporter of its system—that requires the enrolment of all those entitled to vote and their compulsory attendance at the polls. My party have long supported that approach. Anything which would prevent or limit that substantial number not enrolling would be a worry. Senator Faulkner quite forcibly puts the argument that these regulations would. I cannot judge that on the face of what is before me, frankly. He also puts the argument quite forcibly that the drivers licence proposition he outlines would cover much of the ground. Again, I am not sure of that. 
So where am I left? I am left with a view that tightening the roll is advantageous in view of the findings of both the Auditor-General and the JSCEM. I am left with a view that minimising the opportunity for fraud is desirable. I am left with a view that very large numbers are not on the roll. I suspect that the way to get them on it is not really to do with enrolment procedures; it is more to do with marketing and advertising. But I am in the situation, as are my party, of having to decide whether or not to disallow this regulation. Frankly, I would like to see the process trialled, but the regulations do not allow for that. They are permanent regulations which would apply forever after.  
The major consideration which influences my views is my fear—and perhaps it is an unjustified fear—that the joint roll arrangements would be at some risk. The joint roll arrangements were commenced, I think, in the 1920s. I do not have the report before me, but one of the states first began that exercise of participating with the Commonwealth. I think the final state came into line in the 1990s. A joint roll is highly desirable. Personally, given my particular views on these matters, I think we would do well just to have one Australian electoral commission and no state commissions at all, just one that runs the whole show from top to bottom. That is not the case, but a joint roll is certainly highly desirable. The threat that, in the face of these regulations, joint roll arrangements would be put at risk weighs on me quite heavily. Because of that, I have put the proposition to my party room and they have taken the view that we will have no option but to agree with the opposition that these regulations have to be disallowed. You can hear from the way in which I am putting the argument that I am uncomfortable and that my party is uncomfortable, because we would like to assist in any form of arrangement, however minor, which may improve the integrity of the roll.
I would offer both the opposition and the government a suggestion that this should be trialled, that the government might consider bringing back regulations which have a sunset clause attached to them. I would have thought a minimum of 12 months operation of the scheme would be necessary. I would also suggest that the Senate—perhaps the JSCEM but certainly the Senate—be supplied with a report, which would need to be independent, as to whether it worked. The key considerations that my party would be interested in are whether more or fewer people were registered as enrollees than had been the normal or average practice and whether any groups were found to be excluded in any sense—such as those that Senator Faulkner outlined. There are many ways in which that report could evaluate whether such a trial in fact did improve the integrity of the roll, to what extent and what its benefits and shortcomings were. If that report—which would need to be independent, I must stress—was favourable, then obviously my party room, given that that is its view, I would expect would favourably consider the continuation of the regulations subject to our overweening fear of endangering the joint roll approach.
One thing I would suggest is that, if the states are developing alternative views which are of assistance, perhaps the new regulations could assist by incorporating any sensible or helpful suggestions from the states themselves. Listening to Senator Faulkner's points, it is possible that if the drivers licence was the primary method of identification then more stringent enrolment methods could apply to those who do not have a drivers licence. The difficulty with that is the argument that you are attacking the very group who might be poor, disadvantaged, young, disabled or whatever. `I don't know' is the answer.
—Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, does not have a drivers licence.
—I do hope that he does not sit on any votes; I assume he does. So I am left in a difficult situation. We have received lobbying approaches from groups that feel they would be disadvantaged. There are some politics attached to that. We are also very conscious of the need to be as supportive as we can of any government attempt to improve the integrity of our systems, whether they are of a major or of a minor matter. In conclusion, I think I should simply say that we will support the opposition's disallowance, primarily because of our fear that the joint roll arrangements and the integration of our systems may be threatened by this. I cannot fathom why, frankly. I do not know why such strong feelings are generated by it, despite having heard Senator Faulkner's argument, but that must weigh heavily with us. However, if a trial process could be found, we would certainly be willing to consider that quite favourably with a sunset clause attached to it. ",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-05-15,"—This evening we are discussing the electoral roll integrity regulations, and it is a sad reflection that in this debate we have seen the Labor Party at its worst, unreconstructed and unreformed position. All of Mr Crean's protestations about modernising the Labor Party fall flat in the face of Labor's attitude to these important regulations. Mr Crean's actions in opposing these regulations speak so much louder than his words. Labor's opposition is based very simply on protecting the rorters: the Karen Ehrmanns, the Jim Elders, the Mike Kaisers, the Andy Kehoes and the David Barbagallos. They are the ones that we know of. What about all the ones that we do not know about?
Senator Faulkner initially dismissed the government's proposed legislation and regulations as part of some government paranoia about the electoral roll and rorting. Might I remind the Senate that it was not the federal Liberal government's paranoia that led to Mr David Barbagallo being fined $1,000 for electoral roll rorting; it was not the federal Liberal government's paranoia that led to former Labor Deputy Premier Jim Elder resigning from office; it was not the federal Liberal government's paranoia that led to the resignation of Mike Kaiser, a Labor member of the Queensland parliament; and, indeed, it was not the federal government's paranoia that landed Karen Ehrmann in jail. The sad thing is that state Labor parties around this nation unfortunately have had a record of roll rorting and there is no doubt, therefore, that it has been the state Labor governments that have opposed these regulations. I take on board what my colleague Senator Murray says about the desirability of a joint roll, but the state Labor governments do not want a joint roll that might be less able to be tampered with, and that is why they are opposing these regulations.
Unfortunately, the Democrats have fallen for the view that the joint roll is more important than the integrity of the roll. Listening to Senator Murray's quite sensible contribution to this debate, I noticed that he weighed very heavily in his and the Democrats' mind the importance of the joint roll and also of integrity. Unfortunately, on balance, the Democrats—in my respectful view—have swung the wrong way. Let me remind the Australian Democrats that they heard the evidence at the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am sure they would have read what was in the Shepherdson inquiry report. Indeed, they have one of their own colleagues, Senator John Cherry, who in a previous political life—and we will never know the truth because Mr Barbagallo pleaded guilty to the charges, but I am willing to take Senator Cherry's view on this—was falsely and unbeknown to Senator Cherry enrolled on a Brisbane electoral roll by some Labor operative.
I submit to the Australian Democrats that, if some form of identification had been required of John Cherry prior to his name being put onto the electoral roll, his name could not have been falsely put onto the roll—and I believe the John Cherry view of the world and do not want to criticise that and the circumstances at all. The Australian Democrats in this place have had personal experience of one of their number being falsely enrolled. I submit to the Australian Democrats that, if it had been compulsory to provide a drivers licence for John Cherry or, indeed, any one of the documents on the list that Senator Murray read into the Hansard, his name would not have appeared falsely on the electoral roll.
It is a great disappointment that the Australian Democrats, despite that experience within their own ranks, have not seen fit to put the principle of roll integrity higher than the joint roll. Take the tip: the state Labor governments around will talk roll integrity— as Mr Beattie does—until the cows come home but they will not actually deal with the issues. As far as I am concerned, while the joint roll arrangement is very important, we as a government regard the integrity of the roll as more important. The integrity of the roll is more important than a joint arrangement with the states, because otherwise—if you have a joint electoral roll—the Commonwealth electoral roll will always have to be submitted to the lowest common denominator of all the states. 
My vision is that the Commonwealth set the standard which the states ought to aspire to and abide by. If they want to play the game of blackmail, costing the taxpayers literally millions of dollars by breaking the joint roll, then so be it, but let them explain to the electors of their various states why they are not willing to insist on what is very basic identification. Senator Murray has identified how very basic that identification is. Indeed, Senator Faulkner destroyed his own arguments when he said, `Really all we need for a witness ought to be a drivers licence,' while not saying what documents ought to be provided for people when joining up. In the list, document No. 5, a current Australian drivers licence, is mentioned.
In relation to the electoral roll, the importance of this from a government point of view is that democracy is potentially a very fragile way of doing government and business. I reckon it is the best way that man has devised, and I am fully supportive of the democratic process, but if people start doubting the integrity of the democratic process because rolls are rorted or ballots are rorted et cetera then people start questioning the whole basis of the fragile democracy we enjoy. So we as a government make no apology for putting integrity first. Sure, the Australian National Audit Office gave a pretty good bill of health to the Australian electoral roll, and that has been mentioned in this debate. Depending on the figures, there is 96 per cent accuracy or 99 per cent accuracy on the roll. Let us take the 99 per cent accuracy figure: there are 12.6 million Australians on the electoral roll; if there is a one per cent inaccuracy, that means 126,000 Australians are inappropriately enrolled. If you take the 96 per cent figure, which I think is the more accurate figure, then you are talking about half a million Australians being inappropriately enrolled. If you then translate that into the number of House of Representatives seats, taking the 99 per cent figure, you are dealing with 840 voters per electorate being inappropriately enrolled; taking the 96 per cent figure, you are dealing with about 3,000 voters per electorate being inappropriately enrolled.
—But are you saying that is fraud?
—No, `inappropriately enrolled' is the description that I have deliberately used because I am sure a lot of those would be honest mistakes et cetera. I do not say that we have got that many people enrolled fraudulently, and I want to make that clear, but when you start dealing with some of our colleagues in the other place winning their seats by margins of 10 or 20 or 40 votes—under 100 votes—and you know that there were either 3,000 or 800 inappropriately enrolled people in their electorate on election day, those discrepancies can have an outcome which can change the result. I take Senator Murray's point that the chances are that most of those are not fraudulent, but we do not necessarily know the extent of the fraud. We know it exists; it has been exposed and Labor person after Labor person, in Queensland at least, has borne the consequences of that fraud.
From a holistic government point of view, we are also concerned that there be integrity in the electoral roll because there have now been situations found where social security fraud has occurred. I would like to recognise in the gallery a great former Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, who did a fantastic job for this nation. It is great to see her in the gallery this evening. Social security fraud was committed by a person in Victoria who started off his various persona by falsely enrolling on the electoral roll. That was not done for electoral fraud purposes but for social security fraud purposes. Surely we in this place ought to say that if we can somehow limit that it ought to be limited. That is also part of our approach on this issue. The honourable member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett, had, I think, Curio Cat—
—Curacao Fischer Catt.
—Thank you very much, Senator Ferris. I trust Hansard caught that, because I am not going to try to repeat it. An elector had a cat enrolled in the electorate of Macquarie. Surely, we want to have some integrity and seriousness associated with the electoral roll. I would suggest that the cat may have had some difficulty in providing a drivers licence, a birth certificate or a citizenship certificate for the purposes of enrolment. That is what this government is about. But Senator Faulkner and his mates are of the view, `That is okay, because it allows us to run our preselection ballots for the Australian Labor Party.' 
Senator Faulkner suggested that there were three gaping holes in the government's approach. The first one was that the AEC was not able to check on a prescribed list of employment—which is the list that Senator Murray said he would not read through— which is a list of 42 categories of potential witnesses. There is something Senator Faulkner did not do, and this reflects on the integrity of the debate in this matter. The form that he referred to has a provision for a declaration by the witness: `I am aware that there is a penalty for making a false declaration. See page 3.' Page 3 tells you that there is a possibility of 12 months imprisonment. Basically, the logic of Senator Faulkner's argument is that people will still break the law, so why do this? That is a bit like saying, `We have murder on the criminal statute books; murder is still committed, so why not scrap it because it does not stop murders.'
—Then why did you not do it before the election?
—I would suggest that that acts as a disincentive within the community and, as a result, witnessing provisions act as a disincentive for people to rort the electoral roll. Senator Faulkner knows it. I have hit a sore point, and that is why he has to start interjecting. The second question is, `Where is the proof that the witness sighted the documentation?' The form says: `Identity documents sighted; yes or no', and the witness has to tick the box, sign off and, if he or she signs this incorrectly, they are liable to criminal prosecution with 12 months imprisonment. But Senator Faulkner says that that is not good enough. I have to agree: there would be no laws in this country that would stop the Labor rorters. They would always do something to get around the law. They would be imaginative and always somehow get around it. I say to Senator Faulkner and his party that, hopefully, these new regulations will act as a disincentive and, as a result, the number of Labor rorters will be minimised. 
The third assertion made by Senator Faulkner was that false identification could be provided. Yes, it could; but that of course completely and utterly debunks Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party's assertion about drivers licences being sufficient, because we all know that drivers licences can be forged. Seeing that these can be forged, why on earth do we, as a community, bother with drivers licences? They can be forged! So can passports! So why do we bother with passports? These are fatuous arguments. Senator Faulkner and the Australian Labor Party know they are fatuous arguments. They are grabbing at anything to avoid electoral reform to have roll integrity in this country.
Indeed, we were given the most patronising of descriptions of people who might be homeless, illiterate or living in remote areas. Those who are on social welfare need to provide more documentation to get welfare than they would to get onto the electoral roll. If they are in receipt of welfare, they must have the appropriate documentation, otherwise they would not be on welfare. The suggestion was that those who are migrants would not be able to enrol. To enrol as a migrant you first have to become an Australian citizen. The documentation required to become an Australian citizen is a lot more rigorous that what we are requiring for the electoral roll and, what is more, the citizenship certificate will be sufficient evidence. That is another argument completely debunked.
Then we had the argument—just thought up, no doubt—that those with poor eyesight would battle with the form. Well, excuse me! If that is genuinely the concern, I would invite Senator Faulkner to look at the existing form and the size of the print, and the form that he condemned, which is the new form, and see how much bigger and plainer it is, and how much easier it is to read. Once again, the argument on eyesight has been exposed as hollow and fatuous. Any excuse will do so that the Labor Party does not have to face up to the reality of electoral roll reform and deal with their rorters. The Australian Labor Party has clutched at every possible argument; each one of them has been debunked. 
Senator Faulkner will, unfortunately, be able to disclose a victory later on this evening, courtesy of the Democrats voting with the Labor Party. Whilst I accept where the Democrats are coming from, I repeat again that it is a matter of great regret that the Democrats see the joint roll arrangement as being more important than the integrity of the electoral roll. The Labor Party have shown absolute and utter opposition to trying to clean up the electoral roll. Indeed, we were told very early on in the piece that this was just a bit of federal Liberal government paranoia. That is what we were told. Even now, at this very late stage, the Labor Party are saying that they have their own—sort of—reform proposal. They know the public pressure. They know what the public believe and think on this issue. They now recognise that they have to come up with some sort of reform package. It reminds me a bit of their tax reform package, where they accepted we needed tax reform, but were unable to come up with it. Similarly, with this, they are finally willing to acknowledge that there is a need for electoral reform but, once again, when it comes to the crunch, they are unable to deliver on this important issue.
This really reflects on the leadership of Mr Crean and the Australian Labor Party, that they are willing to block electoral reform and roll integrity. They know that they have been the party exposed as having rorter after rorter within their ranks. We, as a federal government, are trying to clean up the electoral roll, and all we get from the Labor Party are fatuous arguments and pathetic reasons, none of which stand up to scrutiny. At the end of the day, the Australian Labor Party stand condemned for protecting their rorters. Mr Crean has not reformed the Labor Party. He has not modernised it. The Labor Party are still very much in the culture of rorting with their preselections and rorting the electoral rolls, and the Australian Labor Party stand condemned for it.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-05-15,"—I rise to provide a contribution to this motion to disallow the electoral roll integrity regulations. In doing so, I have some sense of deja vu in that I remember standing on my feet some years ago talking about the Electoral Act and what it meant for indigenous Australians. At that time, I spoke about the changes that the government was proposing in assisting people when they went to vote at the polls. But this time the tables are turned. If this government has its way, there will be a significant number of indigenous Australians who will not even make it into the polling booth to allow their vote to occur. Because of the barriers that these regulations will put in place, those indigenous people may not even get on to the roll in the first place.
The amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act were actually passed in May 1999, some two years ago, and we know that those amendments have yet to be proclaimed. We have heard significant arguments this evening about the fact that these regulations would limit the people who could witness a claim for enrolment and, of course, dramatically change the enrolment process. Before I get on to the substantive argument that I want to present, let me go to one or two things that the Special Minister of State said. The minister talked about—and named, in fact—some people who, he alleged, were rorting the system. I assume by that he means rorting the ability for them to be genuine voters in this country. But he did fail to mention that a number of people from his side of politics such as Jackie Kelly MP and her staff or Alex Somlyay—
 (Senator Hogg)—Senator Crossin, I think you need to withdraw that.
—I withdraw that. But there were a number of people that the minister could have named, if he so chose and if he wanted to provide some balance in this argument. Of the people that he named, I think only one was sent to jail. If we want to provide some balance in the argument, there are rorters and there are rorters. The integrity of this debate goes to the barriers that these regulations will put in place that will prevent people from even getting on the enrolment list—in fact, from ever being on the enrolment form. The minister talks about these regulations being able to be less tampered with and about integrity versus the joint roll system. While all those arguments may be well and good, if we actually step back and take a really close look at what happens with indigenous Australians, we will find that those arguments go to a very inappropriate enrolment system being put in place by this federal government.  
I think this government fails to genuinely understand the situation in which indigenous Australians in rural and extremely remote conditions in Northern Australia—in particular in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland—find themselves. If I use the Northern Territory as an example—and perhaps some of these stories might impress upon the Democrats why it is important that they have taken the stance that they have; I congratulate them in joining us in this disallowance motion—there are some 220 Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory with populations of 50 to 1,800 people. There are not too many people in this parliament who have bothered to travel to those remote communities—although it is pleasing to say that more and more members and senators are attempting to do so. It is a pity, though, that a few more from the government did not make the effort to go there. Of course, that does not actually take into account those people who may live on out-stations.
The ABS 1996 census data does not break down the figures into the indigenous population who are aged 18 and over—and it is in five-year chunks—so we have to look at those aged 15 and over. For example, in the Northern Territory in 1996 the indigenous population aged 15 and over was 32,107. So we could assume that now, some five years on—out of a total voting population in the Territory of 132,000—there are at least 32,000 indigenous Territorians who are eligible to vote. As of the ABS statistics in 1996, the percentage of indigenous people in the Territory was around 24.22 per cent.
The proposed regulations do nothing to ensure that that number of indigenous people in the Northern Territory are on the roll—it does nothing to maximise their participation in being on the roll. We do not have 32,000 Territorians of indigenous background on the roll at the moment. As it now stands, it is extremely difficult to get these people to enrol—to understand the importance of it and to fill out the simple form that we have now—without putting any more barriers in their way. Senator Ferris said a minute ago that this minister was on the joint native title committee. If that is the case, I would expect that this minister, more than anyone, would understand the extreme barriers that these sorts of regulations will place on indigenous Territorians. We know that these are people who, by and large, are not able to read and write. We know that these people do not have English as a first or second language but sometimes as a third or fourth language. We know that these people very rarely have any sort of proof of identity on them. In fact, even Centrelink has recognised the cultural differences of these people and asks only that traditional owners in these communities recognise or provide evidence that they are genuine indigenous people and, therefore, are entitled to a benefit under Centrelink.
Let us look at what a person would have to do—what sort of evidence they would have to provide—to get on the roll. Firstly, they would be asked for an original proof of identity, and that in itself would provide major difficulties and barriers in remote communities. They would be asked to provide an Australian birth certificate, and we know that very few indigenous Territorians would have one in their back pocket or in a drawer in a dwelling in which they might live. I will miss out some of the Defence Force requirements because they would not apply here. There would be very few indigenous Australians who would possess an Australian marriage certificate, particularly those in remote communities. They probably do not go through the formal non-indigenous process of getting married, as we do.
There would be a very significant problem in asking for a current Australian drivers licence. The motor vehicle registry people in the Northern Territory tell me that only 26 per cent of current enrolled voters in remote communities have a drivers licence—that is, most people in remote communities in the Northern Territory do not drive so they do not have a current drivers licence. One-quarter of those people currently enrolled possess a drivers licence, so you would not be able to pick up those people. They certainly would not have a passport. They certainly would not have a current photographic student identification card. They do not have a concession card issued by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. They would not have a current identity card showing their signature and photograph issued by their employer. We all know that that would not be the case in a remote community. 
—How do you know that? That is patronising.
—What employer in a remote community, Senator Ferrris, would provide photo ID for their employees? Are we talking about local community councils? Are we talking about workers in a health clinic or Aboriginal assistant teachers in a school? None of those places provides photographic ID. You have come up with a list that is right off the planet in terms of the way in which indigenous Australians would relate to it. It is beyond any sort of fairness and equity. With regard to a current proof of age card issued by state or territory Australia, are we talking about a seniors card? It would be really worth my while if I were living in Port Keats to have a Territory seniors card; there would be an awful lot of concessions I would be able to get out there!
—You are patronising and letting down indigenous people and you should be ashamed.
—I doubt it.
 (Senator Hogg)—Order! Senator Ferris, if you want to join the debate, there will be plenty of opportunities upon the conclusion of Senator Crossin's speech. Enter the debate then.
—There would be no need to have a current proof of age card in a remote community either. In fact, indigenous Australians would not even bother to have one in those communities. As to a degree absolute granted by the Family Court of Australia, indigenous Australians do not recognise such a body. And, if they did, there would be very few of them who would have that sort of paperwork on them, or a document of appointment as an Australian justice of the peace—and you would find very few of those.
I say to the minister that this is not about patronising. Whatever regulation you want to put in place, your bottom line should be to encourage people to get on the electoral roll. You should be making it easier for people to be eligible to vote in order to maximise the vote of every person in this country. There is nothing wrong with the current enrolment form in the way in which people in remote Australia are able to access it and fill it in. If they need to provide any of the 13 documents that you have here, you will find fewer and fewer indigenous Australians eligible to vote—in fact, the number of indigenous Australians on the roll, particularly in remote Australia, would decline.
Senator Faulkner is right: that would suit your political purpose, wouldn't it? That would be absolutely correct. You want as little a number as possible of people who are eligible to vote to get on the roll. We know that, by and large, indigenous Territorians in remote Australia do not support your policies or your government's outlook, so that is correct. This would be one way of ensuring that they are not on those rolls and that they will never get a chance to vote for the party of their choice.
Let us go to those who might want to witness these enrolment forms. The call to have a drivers licence on behalf of the witness is probably about the most uniform and consistent suggestion that you could have. Again, out of your list of 42 people, there are only about eight who would apply in the Northern Territory. Out of that, you are talking once again of teachers and nurses; you are talking about people who are probably government workers—
—ATSIC regional commissioners? 
—Order! I have been very tolerant to those on my right. You have had the opportunity to have your say. I understand that Senator Ferris is going to speak in a few moments, so she may respond to the comments made by Senator Crossin then.
—There are 220 remote communities in the Northern Territory alone, not including outstations, but there are not 220 ATSIC commissioners in the Northern Territory. That is just an absolute furphy. There would not be enough of them around to witness these signatures. Again, the responsibility will fall back on those people employed by state and territory governments in those areas—the old reliable town clerks, the teachers and the nurses who would be called on every day and night to provide evidence to witness these enrolment forms. In a community of a couple of thousand people, they would want some time of their own. Basically, your regulations will not result in the integrity of the electoral roll; they will disenfranchise those people in our community who least understand how to fill out forms, who are not literate, who are not able to fill out those forms without assistance, who have English as a third or a fourth language and who find such a process extremely difficult. I have a letter here from Clare Martin of the Northern Territory government who states:
More than 25% of the Territory's population is indigenous many of whom do not speak English as a first or second language.
We know that. She continues:
The vast majority reside in remote locations where the communication with the bureaucracy is difficult.
That is correct. This has not been assisted by the cuts, in remote Australia, to the Australian Electoral Commission, which now no longer provides education programs on how to vote and no longer undertakes systematic trips out to those communities to ensure that the rolls are up to date. They seem to do it a few months before each federal election is due to kick around. Clare Martin goes on to say:
The primary effect of the Regulations which are now before the Senate will be to disenfranchise indigenous electors in the Northern Territory.
Not only that, they will, most likely, have the same effect in Queensland and Western Australia as well. She goes on to say:
If the Federal Government is serious about the integrity and quality of the roll it would, inter alia, ensure that adequately resourced electoral education and enrolment teams were operating throughout remote Australia.
She is right; that is exactly what should happen. The AEC should be resourced again to be able to provide that sort of enrolment.
There is one other important point that I want to make: there has never been, in the Northern Territory or in remote places, substantiated allegations of systematic enrolment irregularities or fraud in the electoral rolls. There is no evidence to suggest that that is the case when it comes to rural and remote Australia. There is no evidence to suggest that that is the case when it comes to indigenous Australians, particularly people in the Northern Territory. These regulations will, in fact, have the effect of disenfranchising those people who are least able to cope with a more complex form. They will be required to produce some sort of original form of identification, which is extremely difficult for those people who live in remote communities.
This will make the process of electoral enrolment extremely bureaucratic and there will be no benefit at all. There is no proof that this measure will ensure that the electoral roll has some degree of integrity. All this will ensure is that there are less indigenous people in remote and rural communities who are able to get on to the electoral roll. There is nothing wrong with the way the current system operates. Senator Faulkner has put forward a view that perhaps—
—Senator Ferris, you will not be able to find me examples of this for indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. These regulations will affect those people who are least empowered to be able to complete those sorts of forms. These regulations will ensure that, at the end of the day, there are fewer indigenous Australians on the electoral roll. They will ensure that fewer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country will be able to exercise their democratic right to vote when it comes election day because they will not even have a chance to get on the roll. It will be much harder than it is now. There is nothing wrong with the current process. The suggestion by Senator Faulkner that perhaps a witness should be able to provide identification is something that should be considered. There is nothing wrong with the current system for getting on the electoral roll. Your proposal simply puts extreme barriers in place and will make it very difficult for these people.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2002-05-15,"—I must say that I found the contribution just made by Senator Crossin regrettable and quite unfortunate. Senator Crossin and I served together on the Parliamentary Joint Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee. The minister in the chamber tonight, Senator Abetz, was a very distinguished member of the native title committee. As members of that committee, we have visited a large number of remote communities all around this country. To suggest that these people are in some way unable to make a contribution without some assistance is to denigrate unnecessarily a very large collection and community of people in this country. It made me wonder, when Senator Crossin opened her speech by referring to `some form of déjà vu', whether she had even read the enrolment form for people who want to join the electoral roll. It is very clear, if she looks at the section asking `Am I eligible to enrol?' that, if you are able to satisfy those classifications, you then move down to the special enrolment provisions. The very first special enrolment provision is for people who are unable to sign their own name due to incapacity; people who have no fixed address— that is, they are nomadic, for either cultural or other reasons—or a group of other people who may be at risk for various other reasons. If those people are in that set of circumstances, there is a free-call number printed here which will connect them to the Electoral Commission, and they will be able to obtain assistance.
—Now you are assuming that they have a telephone out there.
—Acting Deputy President, I ask you to allow me to make my contribution in the way that you drew to my attention earlier.
 (Senator Hogg)—I am showing the same tolerance that I showed during the other speech.
—Fine. I shall raise my voice when it is necessary to make my point, as Senator Crossin did.
—I will protect you.
—I think that is a very unfortunate way to conduct the debate, but never mind. If you need to call a 2326 number, there is no doubt that it is possible to make those calls. There are communications systems available for people to make those calls.
But what I want to draw to the Senate's attention tonight is within the regulations. I want to make it clear that there has been a misleading contribution made in relation to witnesses who are able to assist in this process. I would like to read into Hansard a couple of sections here about the verification of identity. This is for people who are unable to satisfy the criteria that Senator Crossin so patronisingly read into Hansard just a few moments ago—that is, people who are unable to identify themselves to the satisfaction of a person who is going to make the witness signature. Section 98 of regulation 13 applies to a person making a claim for enrolment who is unable to verify his or her identity in accordance with regulation 12. There is an opportunity there for those people to verify their identity by providing the Electoral Commission with at least one document mentioned in schedule 5. Very importantly, they can also show to a person mentioned in schedule 4 a document mentioned in schedule 5, and obtain the person's written statement, on the claim for enrolment, that the person is satisfied about the identity of the person making the claim. Far from that person needing to be an overworked government employee, such as a nurse or a schoolteacher, there are a range of people who can assist in this process. I think it is very unfortunate that Senator Crossin did not read some of these people into the Hansard. Let me do so now. The most important and significant one in relation to the comments that Senator Crossin made is No. 20: `the leader of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community', not an office holder but a person who is recognised as a leader of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community. If there are more than 200 communities, I have no doubt there would be a relevant number of leaders who are able to assist in the process. 
But wait, there is more. No. 26 can be not just a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community council; it can also be a member of a regional council. So there we have it. No. 20 refers to the leader of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community; a member of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community council or regional council; or a police aide, a registered or enrolled nurse; or a number of other people who are listed here. In fact, there are 42 of them. A number of them could satisfy the requirements that were pointed out earlier on by Senator Crossin.
I think it is also somewhat unfortunate to suggest that there are no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working in positions where they would have photograph identification. I have seen photo ID on secure mining sites in remote areas of the Northern Territory and Queensland, and up in the Torres Strait, and I have no doubt that there are many that I have not seen. I think it is quite unfortunate to suggest that Aboriginal people do not qualify for jobs that need photo ID. I think that is patronising, very regrettable and very unfortunate.
—When do they have photo ID?
—Senator Crossin, you might desist from your comments and let Senator Ferris finish.
—Let us get to the heart of the matter here. This, to me, is quite an unfortunate and regrettable debate. Senator Faulkner, yesterday, in part of the contribution that he made in relation to this debate, described the regulations as expensive, disenfranchising and bureaucratic. He said they were misguided and not needed. Nowhere did he say they would clean up the roll. He said the ALP was moving to disallow these regulations for one principal reason: that is, that they would not improve the integrity of the roll—in fact, they would have the opposite effect. He did not build that case. I thought he might have done so today, but he did not. He invoked the name of the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, to talk about how the roll was a roll of high integrity. I agree. Mr Barrett said that, overall, the electoral roll was one of high integrity.
Mr Barrett also said that there was a point at which there were data inaccuracies. They could be 96 per cent; they could be 99 per cent. Nobody has exactly identified that. If there was a data inaccuracy, for example, of just one per cent, if we go to the 99 per cent figure, and we do not take the four per cent figure, we find that that would represent 126 electors or, put another way, 840 voters in every federal seat in Australia. If we were to take the 96 per cent figure, we would find that that figure would come out at almost half a million people.
But, for the sake of this, let us stick with the one per cent figure. If we were to take the one per cent figure, we would find that, in 840 voters in every federal seat, there are in fact five federal seats that are currently held by a margin of less than 0.5 per cent. So, even if this roll of high integrity were to contain a data inaccuracy of just one per cent—not four per cent—there is every reason to take every step to clean up this roll and to clean up these rorts. I admit that an electoral roll containing as many voters as we have in Australia is always going to contain some inaccuracies, but surely it is absolutely crucial to limit the extent of these inaccuracies as much as possible. After all, even a one per cent inaccuracy in such a large number of enrolments could be absolutely ruinous for voter integrity and for the public perception of the integrity of our electoral roll.
We on this side of the chamber, as members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, will never forget the evidence of Karen Ehrmann. She was escorted from prison to give evidence in Brisbane— surrounded by her old mates, but alone with a prison officer—about the scamming and the rorting that she carried out with the patronage and wink-wink, nudge-nudge of some pretty senior figures in the Queensland division of the Labor Party. As a woman and a mother, I felt very sad for Karen Ehrmann. She sat there and gave her evidence as best she could to enable us to clean up the roll, to make recommendations which would make this roll as honest and as transparent as it could possibly be, so never again would Karen Ehrmann's children or anybody else's children have to visit their mother in a prison because she had carried out the dirty work that had been set for her by senior members of the Queensland Labor Party. 
Senator Crossin, I was stunned and amazed when I heard you say, `Only one rorter went to prison.' The person who went to prison was a wife, a mother, a woman who had done the dirty work for members of your party. I do not think it makes too much difference whether it is one or 21; the fact is that there was widespread rorting. Premier Beattie admitted it. I admit that he tried to take some steps to clean it up, but if you read carefully what Karen Ehrmann said, there is no doubt—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Ferris, did you wish me to read it carefully?
—I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President, I was suggesting that my colleague Senator Crossin may need to refresh her memory because to suggest that simply one rorter went to prison does not justify doing nothing to ensure that the roll and the integrity of the roll is such that it can never happen again, that no rorters go to prison ever again. Let's not beat around the bush here: Karen Ehrmann was a patsy for the Labor Party and they deserted her. Karen Ehrmann said—I cannot recall exactly what she said, but what she said is quite strongly burned on my brain—something like, `Senator Faulkner, you sit there in your smart suit and I sit here in my prison clothes.' I thought that drew a very interesting comparison. Senator Faulkner was there that day and he heard that evidence. I find it extraordinary that he is still saying that the roll as it stands is a roll of integrity. 
It was a disgraceful and cynical time in terms of the Queensland Labor Party. We should never forget that, although only one woman went to jail for this dirty business, there were in fact quite a few boys who stood behind the curtain and did exactly the same thing and for one reason or another were able to avoid being accompanied by a prison officer when they moved around. So I am quite puzzled that the Labor Party, in moving this disallowance motion today, should be ignoring the recommendation of Justice Shepherdson QC that identification procedures for identifying people when they apply to enrol should be improved. I would have thought that those comments of Justice Shepherdson would have been significant enough for them to have been accepted. 
The recommendation by Justice Shepherdson, let us not forget, was generated by the electoral rorting that he uncovered in Queensland of Labor's own people. Senator Faulkner and I sat together at that hearing and heard the evidence of Karen Ehrmann, who said how simple it was to do what she did. She thought she was acting quite honestly. She had no idea that she was being used in the way that she was. Justice Shepherdson found that false enrolments were made to assist candidates in preselections under the plebiscite system that operated there. 
As was mentioned earlier by the minister in his contribution, we should not forget how easy it was for a cat to be enrolled: Curacao Fischer Catt. We actually believed that Curacao Catt may have indeed voted. The fact is that on the Macquarie electoral roll, Curacao Catt was a voter. Who knows how many other voters were cats, dogs, budgies and goldfish! We have no way of knowing because anybody could come along and give that name and sign off and they could vote. The discovery of Curacao Catt was quite coincidental. There was no purging that discovered Curacao Catt, and there has been no purging done to discover how many others there are. Whether they fall into the one per cent category of data misinformation or the four per cent, there is no doubt that there is a capacity to affect the outcome of elections in marginal seats on the current system which operates for the electoral roll. 
What have we been trying to do? I listened very carefully to Senator Murray's contribution, because he is also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I cannot recall whether he attended the hearings in Queensland. I suppose he would have, because I know how seriously Senator Murray takes the question of electoral integrity. Senator Murray and I were certainly members of the electoral matters committee during the contributions that were made by rorters and people who discussed rorting and the ease with which rorting could be carried out. I was somewhat disappointed to hear Senator Murray say that we on the committee were going to revisit this matter after a trial period, and I was tempted to ask him just how much more evidence was needed of the fact that data mismanagement and data misinformation can continue. I wondered whether his suggestion of a trial process was perhaps optimism over reality, and I wondered how many more hearings we were going to have to have of people indicating—
—You misunderstand. The regulations would apply for 12 months.
—I heard you say that, Senator Murray, and I thought that we would have to revisit this matter—even though back in 1996 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters observed:
It is unacceptable that the most fundamental transaction between a citizen and the government—the act of choosing the government at a democratic election—is subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account ... or registering for social security benefits ...
I think we can now add to that trying to borrow a video from a video store, because I was required to present photo ID to get a card to be able to borrow a video from my local video store. I am not suggesting for a moment that that video store should not be able to insist on photo ID, because they are running a business and they clearly have discovered the need for security, but so have we. So have we, Senator Murray, and so have we, Senator Faulkner and Senator Crossin. That is why we moved to tighten up the procedures by which people can enrol to vote. We have seen in Zimbabwe in the last few months—and my colleagues Senator Ferguson and Senator Murray know—the abuse of a democratic process and the importance of that fundamental proof of the right to vote and the act of voting.
There is nothing more important in this country than being able to say with integrity and impunity that our electoral roll is the most honest and that our people who enrol to vote in our democratic process are not cats, dogs, budgies or goldfish but people who have proved who they are and who have had an application for enrolment witnessed by a person of integrity in one community position or another. We should be proud to be able to say that to Australia and to the world. What we are doing today in disallowing this set of amendments is taking a backward step. We are perpetuating a system where cats and dogs can still be enrolled on our electoral roll if somebody is prepared to fill in the form and somebody—perhaps the same person— is prepared to sign that that is a person of integrity. This set of amendments was intended to fix that, and it is a very sad day for Australia that we are walking away from it with a defeated vote in the Senate tonight.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-05-15,"—I would also like to speak reasonably briefly to this disallowance motion. The Senate—for the benefit of those trying to follow this debate—is debating a motion to disallow some regulations put forward by the government that would introduce stronger identity requirements for applications to go on the electoral roll. My colleague Senator Murray has outlined quite cogently the Democrats response to that motion, but I thought I would add to that and partly respond to some of the other comments that have been made in this debate. I am also speaking as another member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and I attended most if not all of the hearings that occurred into this general issue. 
The electoral matters committee, considering it was dealing with such a potentially politically contentious issue as electoral law, was operated in quite a cooperative matter under the chair of Mr Gary Nairn, the member for Eden-Monaro. It was a bit unfortunate when he either chose to stand down or it was suggested that he might like to stand down from the chair and Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt, took over. It was easily the most fractious inquiry I have ever been involved in, and I think that was unfortunate because the continual brawling, the toing-and-froing and the spats—public and private—amongst the committee tended to obscure the importance of the issue we were looking into. I think we have had a bit of that—to a far lesser extent—in the debate today. Obviously, being in politics, people in this place occasionally see the need to make political points, but we need to try to clear away some of that backwards and forwards rhetoric and look at the substance of what we are dealing with. In terms of the debate that has been put forward, I think both sides are very much overstating their arguments.
We have seen from the Auditor-General's report that we have an electoral roll that is of extremely high integrity—which does not mean that we cannot take measures to improve it even further. Clearly, it got a very good bill of health from the obviously independent and impartial Auditor-General. Despite what Senator Ferris just said, in the committee inquiry into the electoral roll, and indeed in the previous one into the overall operation of the 1998 election, I did not see any evidence at all of widespread fraud or of significant or even insignificant dishonest influence on an election. If you add that to the Auditor-General's findings, and indeed to the comments of the Australian Electoral Commission in terms of the great difficulty there would be to have any sort of seriously organised attempt to have a fraudulent impact on an electoral outcome in a House of Representatives seat, the risk is nowhere near as strong as the government is making out.
Indeed, the evidence does not exist, and the electoral matters committee did not uncover any significant evidence that there is a problem. In that sense, it is not desirable for the Liberal Party members to overstate the seriousness of this issue because that does almost automatically generate a perception amongst the community that there is some problem when the evidence does not back that up. It is not desirable for the community to have unjustified concerns about the integrity of our electoral system because it is important for people to have as strong a feeling of confidence about our electoral process as they can. That does not mean they should have rose-coloured glasses or be starry-eyed about it, but I think it is preferable not to have people unduly concerned about the integrity of our method of choosing government and parliamentarians if the evidence does not back that up.
If you compare Australia with virtually any other democracy in the world, the evidence is that Australia measures up extremely well. You only have to look at the farcical process that occurs in the United States of America to elect the leader of what is quite clearly the most powerful nation on earth. The process used to elect that leader is little short of a complete joke, and that was shown up quite starkly with the last election. The process from top to bottom—including qualifications for who is entitled to vote, right through to the voting system and the mechanisms for recording your vote—is extremely shabby, to put it as impartially as possible. If we look at that and compare it with our system here, we have got a lot to be proud of and I do not think we should unnecessarily run down the reputation of our electoral system. 
At the same time I think the Labor contributors to the debate very much overstate the impact that these changes would have. I am willing to consider the possibility that perhaps in some of the very remote indigenous communities it may be slightly more difficult, but I do not think that it would be a massive hurdle. It is an extremely broad range of options available to people. I think the argument that the government has put forward, that this would not disenfranchise many people, is probably correct. Of course, we do not know for sure; none of us ever know unless a change is made and we can see the impact and measure it. That is why the Democrats' suggestion that we have an isolated 12-month trial of this to see what the impact is, to see whether there is a significant decrease in the number of people who actually enrol, would be a desirable move. We could then look at it in a completely impartial way: the politics would be removed and it would be quite easy to run the statistics and assess that. It is a concern to the Democrats, and one that was reinforced by the Auditor-General's report, that huge numbers of people in Australia are not on the roll. I think they were suggesting it was 100,000 people. It might even have been more than that—was it a million? 
—I think it was more than that.
—Certainly a very significant number of people are not on the roll and therefore do not have a say in deciding who governs this country—certainly more than enough people, if they had all been on the roll and voted a certain way, to have changed the outcome of the last election. That is the biggest concern, certainly for the Democrats. We do need to be cautious about making changes that may increase the number of people who do not bother to enrol, or who do not qualify to enrol—who do not meet the hurdles to get on the roll. None of us know for sure whether that would be the impact, but it is something that we need to be cautious about.
It is of course always going to be the case that there is some inaccuracy on the electoral roll given the number of people in Australia who move residence so regularly. At any one time there is always going to be a significant number where there is a lag before they have changed their enrolment address. But that inaccuracy links to incorrect addresses rather than people being on the roll who should not be on the roll, such as the famous cat that Senator Ferris likes to refer to. I should say, as someone with a strong commitment to animal rights, that the concept of animals actually having a vote is one that does have some appeal, but it is not something that I am advocating in a legislative sense at the moment.
—Goldfish might vote for the Democrats!
—If the battery hens could vote we might have a different outcome. But it is clear that those inaccuracies that do exist are predominantly addresses that have not been updated, not people being on the roll who should not be there. That is all that these regulations we are dealing with address. They address people being eligible to enrol. They do not address updating of addresses or changes of address, or anything like that. That is the area where inaccuracy occurs, and the Auditor-General's report made some useful recommendations about that.
I should mention also that the government is right, and I think it is a good point to make, that it is easier to get on the electoral roll than it is to get a borrowing card from a video store. But at the same time I should point out that it is a lot more likely that the Electoral Commission will detect if you move address than your video store will. I can use my own example of my membership of Video 2000 in Brisbane which is for an address I have actually never lived at. They probably would not have much trouble tracking me down if I did not return a video, but, nonetheless, this continual reliance on the so-called video borrowing criterion does not hold up when you examine it. I was able to get my membership there at an address I have had some connections with but have not lived at, and the connections with that address are now long gone, probably some five or so years ago, so their ability to maintain accurate records is far less than the Australian Electoral Commission's.
Again, the government misrepresents the reality of the integrity of the electoral roll. The issue concerning the inaccuracies that do exist is almost completely to do with updating of addresses. The processes that the Electoral Commission have put in place in recent years go a fair way towards detecting those changes of address, certainly farther than any video store does. I hope that that is the case because they use a lot of government information to do that, and I also hope video stores do not get any access to it. The Electoral Commission are continuing to improve their methods for detecting people's change of address and that is where inaccuracies occur. Of course, inaccuracies do not mean rorts, they do not mean frauds; they simply mean people who have not got around to changing their address on the roll. 
It is important to emphasise that there is no evidence, and there was no evidence provided to the committee, that there had been any fraudulent activity in relation to any state or federal election. It is clear that inaccuracies on the roll are to do with inaccurate addresses; it is not to do with people putting themselves on the roll who are not entitled to be on the roll or putting themselves on twice. These regulation changes will not affect that at all.
Having said that, I do not believe that most of the concerns that Labor members have expressed are as real as they believe them to be. The various criteria for identification are very broad and it would not prove difficult for anybody, except possibly some homeless people and possibly some people in very remote areas. Of course those groups should not be ignored. They are groups who are underrepresented on the roll already, particularly homeless people. I am not dismissing the importance of that, but we do not know what the impact for sure would be. 
The Democrats are certainly concerned about more people not enrolling at all and we are equally concerned about the potential for the joint roll arrangements to disintegrate. It took a long period of time to get cooperation between federal and state levels of government in relation to the electoral roll, and that has really only operated effectively across all states over the last 10 years or so. It would be very much a retrograde step to have separate rolls again and very undesirable to have different criteria for eligibility to get on the different rolls.
It should be pointed out that there are minor distinctions between eligibility to vote in some state jurisdictions and at the federal level. The rolls already provide scope for that where a very small number of people, as I understand it, are entitled to vote at one level and not the other. Joint rolls can handle that, but the risk of disintegration of joint roll arrangements is a very serious one and that would, more than anything else, compromise the integrity of the electoral roll. That is something the Democrats are keen not to see happen.
In relation to other recommendations that government members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters put forward, it is worth mentioning one that was pushed strongly and one which the government may well still be trying to pursue through legislation. It is the proposal to close the electoral rolls on the day that the election is called. I cannot think of any other measure that would guarantee a more inaccurate electoral roll, because it would prevent people from actually being able to go and update their address. We all know that, human nature being what it is, it is not until an election is called that a lot of people get around to actually updating their correct addresses with the Electoral Commission. If that Liberal Party proposal was endorsed by the Senate, we would have certainty of inaccurate electoral rolls at election time locked in. It is hard to see that that particular proposal is driven purely by some desire to have as accurate a roll as possible, because it would clearly mean the opposite. One does have to wonder if there are other political motivations involved.
I acknowledge part of Senator Ferris's contribution in relation to some of the focus of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and the roll of indigenous communities in terms of the way they vote. At the hearings that I attended in Alice Springs and Darwin, which were not into the electoral roll issue but into the general operation of the conduct of the election, it was pretty clear that the CLP people were very focused, shall we say, on the indigenous communities and the size of their vote for the ALP. Indeed, there was one booth in Alice Springs where the Democrats outpolled the Country Liberal Party candidate, which was nice to see. It would be good to see that happen more often. It is not drawing too long a bow to suggest that CLP people would not be overly upset if it were a little bit more difficult for indigenous people to be on the roll. That is a valid point to make, but I would not overstate it.
As I said at the start, both the larger parties are overstating their argument and, of course, it is left to the Democrats to make the calm, rational, reasoned and logical contribution to the debate. In doing so, we have indicated that we will support this disallowance motion. On balance, we believe that the regulations put forward are not as draconian as has been suggested, but we also acknowledge the reality that the electoral roll is much more pure in its integrity than the Liberal Party members are suggesting. We do have serious concerns about the potential loss of joint roll arrangements and, to a lesser degree, the potential for an even larger number of Australians not enrolling when we need to do everything we can to encourage them to enrol. However, we maintain our offer to have this set of regulations operate for 12 months so that all of us can see at the end of 12 months whether or not the impacts have occurred in the way that various people have suggested. 
Of course, none of us know for sure until something is put in place what its real impact would be. My guess is that the impact will not be that significant either way. The other impact that we would be much more concerned about is the potential loss of the joint roll arrangements. For those reasons, the Democrats have come to a politically sound, balanced, rational and considered judgment that we will vote in favour of this disallowance motion. We hope that, under the new chairmanship of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters by Mr Georgiou, the committee will be able to once again operate in a more calm, reasoned and impartial fashion than it did over the last 12 months or so before the most recent election. These are important issues and when we can approach them in a measured way and a less heated way we are much more likely to get positive progress.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2002-05-15,"—I will be very brief this evening. I just want to make a point that perhaps has been overlooked or at least only partially commented upon. I think Senator Faulkner touched on it very briefly. The issue is not so much the integrity of the electoral roll; the issue really is the public perception of the integrity of the electoral roll. I want to say a couple of things about that. Free and fair elections are part of the cornerstone of this democracy, and when people vote it is in a sense the primary meeting of the citizen and the state. I do not think it is too much to ask for reasonable identification procedures to be entered into by the citizen to have that entitlement to vote. It has been said often, but I will say it again: it is not inappropriate that procedures be undertaken that are more extensive than would be required, for example, to rent a video. I think that is quite appropriate. I do not think, with great respect to Senator Faulkner and Senator Crossin, they have met that argument. This is an absolutely critical part of democracy. It is not asking too much.
Secondly, without any doubt, there is concern within Australia about the integrity of the electoral roll. Once again, I am talking about the public perception of the integrity of the electoral roll. We saw that in the Shepherdson inquiry and the Karen Ehrmann affair and so forth, and also last year in the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We had a wealth of submissions and enormous public concern about the integrity of the electoral roll. That has not been challenged this evening. There seems to be this idea that the issue is all about the audit report—that it said that the 96 per cent of the electoral roll is accurate, and that is enough. A close reading of the audit report shows it does not quite say that. In fact the Audit Office recommends that more be done to prevent and to detect fraud. We should not lose sight of that. That is absolutely critical to what the Audit Office said, and I do not think we should lose sight of that.
My point tonight has, sadly, not really been entertained by any of the speakers. The speakers talked about who can witness and whether the documents are appropriate. The fundamental issue here is whether the Australian public is convinced that the electoral roll provides the mechanism for free and fair elections. Our nation has a superb record internationally, but within the community there is enormous concern that the electoral roll is being rorted. Unless we make it harder to enrol, that perception will continue. I put it to the Senate that that argument has not been met tonight. There has been talk and then argument and counterargument about the best mechanism. That actually is not the point. The point is that there must be a mechanism developed to instil public confidence in the electoral roll—and that is not there. People I speak to are concerned that the electoral roll lacks integrity. Whether it does or does not is actually a secondary point. Sadly, that was hardly touched on in the debate by the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Crossin.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-05-15,"—I would like to say I was sorry I missed Senator Mason's speech, but I am not that sorry so I will not say it. There is an opportunity for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters now, at the beginning of the electoral cycle, to have a close, hard look at this question of electoral enrolment, this important question of witnessing provisions, and to come up with some reform that everyone can accept. There is unity of purpose on this issue. The Australian Electoral Commission and all the state and territory governments are united in relation to an alternative regime for electoral enrolment witnessing. There is a way forward, and it goes to the drivers licence regime that I mentioned in some detail as I moved the disallowance motion that is currently before the chair. There is a way forward. I think the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in this parliament has a responsibility to come up with a constructive and workable solution, come up with some answers, so this debate can be put to rest.
It is important for senators to remember it is not just the Labor opposition federally that does not support this unworkable and chaotic proposal that is being promoted by Senator Abetz on behalf of the government. We are lucky, in this country, to have an independent electoral commission that oversights electoral matters, electoral policy, electoral events. That is as it should be. It is a fundamental tenet of any democratic system that you have such a body responsible for the conduct of elections. The Australian Electoral Commission in this country do not support the regulations that Labor is proposing be disallowed today. They do not support these regulations. They do not think they are workable. They have recommended to government and to the committee of this parliament charged with the responsibility of dealing with electoral matters that these regulations should not be put in place. One would assume they would be very comfortable, therefore, with the proposal currently before this chamber that those regulations be disallowed.
The Electoral Commission have historically and consistently argued that the current regime is an effective one. But weaknesses have been pointed out and it is silly not to acknowledge them. There have been some weaknesses—not many; an extraordinary low number when you consider the number of electoral enrolments in this country—but I think there is an argument that can be mounted to improve the current system. If you can improve the current system, we have an obligation to do it. There is a way forward and it is the drivers licence regime that I spoke about earlier. Really, the committee has to get on with the job of making those recommendations, and then those will need to be put in place by Commonwealth, state and territory governments so we can keep the important objectives, so we can maintain the joint roll arrangements, because be under no illusions: if these regulations are not disallowed, we are going to go back to the old days of separate rolls. Does anyone really believe, given the corruption of the rolls at the state level—and I know that Senator Mason would agree with me about what occurred during the life of the former National Party and Country Party governments in Queensland, particularly under the stewardship of Mr Bjelke-Petersen—
—Disgraceful.
—I agree with you, Senator Brandis, he was disgraceful. You are right, and you have been on the record as saying that on other occasions as well. It was a disgraceful record that he had in relation to the manipulation of the electoral processes in Queensland, and it is proper that Senator Brandis and I draw attention to it in the Senate this evening. But do not go back to the bad old days of separate rolls. Ensure the integrity of the rolls, sure. Improve the situation, yes. Go to a regime, I think, that gets the balance right between improving the integrity of the rolls and ensuring that we do not disenfranchise people in our community and in our society who are marginalised. This may not be a high priority for all in this parliament, but it ought to be. You should not sling off at people who find it hard to fill in electoral enrolment forms. 
We have heard of the experiences of Senator Crossin, who knows the situation in the Northern Territory so well. There are issues in relation to the significant underenrolment in indigenous communities in this country. We need a system that maximises enrolment and we need a system that ensures the integrity of enrolment. I genuinely believe that is achievable, but it will not be done if these regulations that we are debating now are put in place. You have to ask yourself the fundamental political question, because neither the opposition nor the Australian Democrats, who I think gave some consideration to this, moved for the disallowance of these regulations before the last election. It is a very important point. This government, the current government that were re-elected on November 10, could have had these regulations in place if they had wanted to. But they did not proclaim the relevant amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act so that they could implement their new system. They did not do that.
Again, you have to question why the government did not do that. I know what the answer is. I think they made the right assessment. They made the right assessment both in policy terms and in political terms. They made the right assessment in policy terms because we know these particular regulations are inadequate and they made the right assessment in political terms because it would have caused an unholy mess, a catastrophe, during the conduct of the election campaign in the lead-up to the close of the rolls. It would have; you would have had absolute chaos. You would have had the alienation of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people at that time. To give this government some credit—every now and again you find a smart operator in the Liberal Party; there are not many in the Senate, I admit that, but there are one or two hanging around Robert Menzies House and the Prime Minister's office—someone got smart and said, `We are not going to proclaim those amendments. We are not going to have those regulations. We do not want meltdown during the election campaign in relation to enrolment. We do not want tens of thousands of people alienated, at that time, from the political process or the government of the day.' That was, I think, smart politics. Ask yourself why. What an admission: that they would not do it themselves when they could have before the last election. What sort of commitment does that show to the integrity of the electoral roll if you really believe that these regulations would improve the integrity of the electoral roll? What irresponsibility from the government if they really believe that those regulations would make a difference.
The government knows that the regulations are too complex, that they are unworkable and that it could not afford the sort of meltdown that would have occurred during the early part of an election campaign if they had been put in place. Nothing speaks louder or more strongly about how inadequate and unacceptable these regulations are than the actions of the government itself. I think it is important for us to reflect on that. I think the alternative regime that I have promoted in this debate is a very sound one.
The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is now under the chairmanship of Mr Georgiou, as opposed to Mr Pyne, and I think we would all accept that Mr Georgiou has to be an improvement. Mr Pyne gave a very undistinguished performance. He was subpoenaing witnesses to come before the committee and doing all the things the government now decries as totally unacceptable. He thought he would go out and make a name for himself and curry favour with the Prime Minister. He is one of the Black Hand group from the Liberal Party, and he thought, `If I sleaze up to the Prime Minister on this, I will be rewarded.' Of course he was not, and he never will be. You could not put someone like Mr Pyne into the ministry. You know that, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do not agree with you on a lot of things, but you and I have a unity ticket on that issue. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I do not have an opinion on that issue, Senator Faulkner.
—You are interrupting me, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Only to correct the record, Senator.
—Anyway, the situation is this: we have to put a better regime in place. We can improve the current regime in the way I have outlined. We do have to improve the integrity of the roll, if we can, although we should acknowledge the report of the Auditor-General that gave an overwhelming tick and an overwhelming bill of health to the electoral enrolment processes and procedures and to the status of the electoral roll in this country. We ought to acknowledge what the independent Australian Electoral Commission says about these regulations. I agree with the AEC and with all the state and territory governments: these regulations should be disallowed. I do believe we have to maintain the joint roll arrangements. I think the Senate has a responsibility to act and the committees of this parliament have a responsibility also to come up with some workable solutions, something that is beyond the ken of Senator Abetz.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-05-15,"—The Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, by a letter dated 15 May 2002, under the signature of the chair, Senator Cook, has raised a matter of privilege. The committee believes that there may have been interference with a witness before the committee. The committee indicates that it has conducted a preliminary investigation of the matter, as required by Senate privilege resolution 1, part 18, and has concluded that there is sufficient evidence that the witness may have been interfered with. Where a committee, after conducting a preliminary investigation, as required by resolution 1, part 18, comes to such a conclusion, this is regarded as sufficiently indicating that the matter meets the criteria which I am required to consider in making a determination under standing order 81: whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should be given precedence.

That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges:
Having regard to the matter submitted to the President by the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, whether there was any attempted or actual interference with a witness before the committee in respect of the witness' evidence, and whether any contempt of the Senate was committed in that regard.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,26,1,speech
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2002-05-15,"—I advise the Senate of the retirement from the parliamentary service last week of Mr Bernie Harris of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. Bernie Harris worked for the parliament for 38 years, with all but the last 2½ years being with Hansard. His final task for the parliament was to be the executive coordinator for the Centenary of Parliament and the Centenary of Federation, the highlight of which was the special sitting of the parliament in Melbourne last year. He played a pivotal role in the organisation of those events and represented the Speaker and I at many meetings in relation to them.
Bernie joined the DPRS in 1964 in the 25th Parliament. Fifteen parliaments and nine presidents later, Bernie has retired. To put that in a different perspective, he started working for Hansard when Sir Robert Menzies was Prime Minister, Mr Arthur Calwell was Leader of the Opposition and decimal currency was still two years away. Since then, there have been enormous changes in the parliament, including the move to this building. The resources available to senators and members have improved remarkably, and the services provided to senators and members by all areas of the parliament have also changed extraordinarily. On behalf of all senators, I thank Bernie Harris for his contribution to the Commonwealth parliament over such a long period and wish him well in his retirement. 
I also draw to the attention of honourable senators that, since we last sat, two senior Senate officers have also retired. I refer to Mr Peter Keele, the Senior Clerk of Committees, and Mr Terry Brown, the Director of the Table Office. Mr Keele joined the Department of the Senate in 1980 and Mr Brown in 1982. Peter was invaluable in providing advice and guidance to committee secretariats to assist them in resolving a wide range of administrative and procedural problems and generally in ensuring that the busy work of Senate committees was carried out efficiently and smoothly. Peter Keele has also made a major contribution in recent years as secretary of the Australian Branch of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
Terry had overall responsibility for the production of the Senate's major documents of record, including the Notice Paper, and some senators will recall his editorial involvement in making questions on notice and notices of motion more succinct and, in some instances, more grammatical. Both officers have served the Senate well and, on behalf of senators, I wish them well in their retirement.

With reference to the answer to question on notice no. 3641 (Senate Hansard, 20 August 2001, p. 26203): How much of the Commonwealth Government's plantation and industry package, under the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, is planned to be or has already been spent on replacing native forests by plantations.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Tasmania: Regional Forest Agreement</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,30,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-05-15,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: 
The honourable senator asked a similar question on 22 June 2001, the answer to that question was tabled on 20 August 2001. Tasmania has allocated $10 million of the Commonwealth funding package to eucalypt plantation development, which includes, among other activities, establishment of plantations on land previously under native forest. However, as previously stated, the Commonwealth Government does not have the detailed information requested. 
The Tasmanian RFA provides clear guidelines for plantation establishment on sites where native forest has been cleared for this purpose, including limits on the extent to which this can occur. These guidelines ensure the maintenance of native forests within specified criteria to preserve regional biodiversity. Also, the replacement of native forest with plantations occurs only in forest areas that now lie outside the conservation reserve system established under the RFA. In other words, this activity is making forests already available for timber harvesting more productive, and within strict limits.
To obtain the detailed information requested, I would recommend that the honourable senator make a request to the Tasmanian Deputy Premier and Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources, the Hon Paul Lennon MHA.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Tasmania: Regional Forest Agreement</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,30,1,answer
