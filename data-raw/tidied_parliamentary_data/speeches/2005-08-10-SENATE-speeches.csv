"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-10,"—I move:
That the committee does not further insist on the Senate amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.
The billwe are considering is the bill which gives effect to the re-elected coalition government’s substantial reductions in personal income tax as provided for in the last budget. These have had a tortuous course through this parliament, as we are all well aware. This is in fact the second time that the Senate will have an opportunity to vote in favour of these tax cuts. May I say that it is entirely appropriate that the very first piece of legislation to be dealt with by this new Senate—the new Senate elected at the last federal election—should be this bill to give effect to the government’s 2005-06 budget tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers.
It is regrettable that it has to come before this new Senate. This tax cut legislation should have been adopted by the previous Senate given that it was a tax cut proposal put by the government in its first budget after the federal election—a proposal which was an integral part of our budget and is entirely consistent with our reform of the economy. It is an entirely responsible range of tax cuts to return to Australian taxpayers moneys which they have earned and which will provide the necessary stimulation and incentive to Australians that we believe they deserve.
As I say, it has been a period of extraordinary humiliation for those opposite in the way in which this matter has been dealt with. I have referred before to what has become known around this place as ‘the cock-up in the lockup’, when the Labor Party made the fateful decision to oppose these tax cuts. That led to the defeat of this legislation in the previous Senate. It was fortunate indeed for millions of Australian taxpayers that the Labor Party did not seek to disallow the tax commissioner’s schedules which gave effect to these tax cuts. Therefore, all Australian taxpayers were able to benefit, in fact, from these tax cuts from 1 July. They have now had five weeks of enjoyment of those substantial tax cuts. That was only possible and the tax commissioner was only confident of putting into this place those schedules because of the expectation that the new Senate would indeed give effect to these tax cuts.
After a period of considerable confusion and humiliation on the other side, the amended bill has gone to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives has rightly and properly rejected those amendments. I now seek to have this Senate not insist on these amendments that were disagreed to by the House of Representatives. These are, as I said, a vital part of the government’s economic reform plan. They are an entirely responsible part of our 2005-06 budget. We have debated at length the whys and wherefores of our tax proposals, why they are so important for Australians and why we do not believe that the alternative put up by the Labor Party is the right and proper course for Australia. These tax cuts are now in place. They are being received by Australians. I have every confidence that these bills will be agreed to by this new Senate. Therefore, I urge this committee not to insist on the Senate amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I would like to make a few comments on behalf of the Labor Party on the message we have received from the House of Representatives. The one thing I would agree with Senator Minchin on is that it does appear that the bill is likely to be passed by the Senate given the new numbers.
—Are you going to divide?
—I just heard an interjection by Senator Boswell. I will get to the National Party—the doormats of the government—their attitude to tax cuts and what they supposedly stand for in a moment.
—Any publicity is good, as long as you spell our names right!
—Not on this issue, Senator Boswell. But we will get to the National Party in a moment—not in the same way that Senator Heffernan tries to get to you, though.

Senator Ferris interjecting—

—Another inane interjection from Senator Ferris! To come back to the tax cuts, again I disagree with Senator Minchin, who suggested that we feel humiliated. The Labor Party feel proud for standing up for low- and middle-income-earning Australians in the positive alternative that we presented to the Australian people, and I will get to some of the detail of that in a moment.
As I said, the tax cuts are now destined to pass the Senate, despite the fact that the economy and individual taxpayers would have benefited much more from Labor’s positive, constructive and fairer alternative, which we put to both the House of Representatives and the Senate and which found a majority in the Senate prior to 1 July. Senator Minchin referred to the budget and the prerogatives of government. He would be on much stronger ground if in fact the tax proposals in his argument had been presented before the election. If they had been an election commitment, he would be on stronger ground. They were not, however; and the tax proposals that were presented as a consequence of the budget had all the hallmarks of being cobbled together at the last minute. The Labor Party in the week following the budget put together and costed—and the costings have never been challenged—a fairer alternative for the Australian people in respect of low- and middle-income earners.
Labor also believe that the government, in its cobbling together of its unfair tax proposals, squandered an opportunity to deliver a fairer and more internationally competitive tax system. The Howard-Costello government would like to pretend that the tax cuts represent real reform, but they do not. When tax reform is done correctly, it can add to wealth creation in this country. It can encourage work, and it can also act as a vehicle for fairness and aspiration. On both counts, in terms of fairness and adding to the growth of Australian wealth, Labor came to the conclusion that the government’s cobbled together tax package did not represent a solid package or attempt even to deal with these two fundamental issues, and Labor argued—and the Senate did accept this—that our package was superior to that put forward by the government.
Senator Minchin referred to ‘the cock-up in the lockup’. For those listening who are not familiar with ‘the lockup’—I am sure they are familiar with cock-ups!—we do not lock up senators or members of the opposition, at least not yet. The government might try that one on us at some point in time. No doubt, they would like to lock up members of the National Party at the moment in another context, and they might even try that on Senator Joyce, but again we will deal with that if it happens. The budget lockup is a process where some shadow ministers, including the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and the shadow Treasurer, have the opportunity for the first time to examine hundreds of pages of budget detail and make a response on at least some of the major points presented in the budget. The Labor Party—that is, the 10 shadow ministers in the lockup—rightly took the view that the government’s tax package was fundamentally unfair, that the Labor Party would not support it and that we would present a positive and fairer alternative to the Australian people. As I said, I am proud, and the Labor Party are proud, to have stood and fought for what we believe is a fundamentally fairer approach.
The package that the government produced was about wealth redistribution, not wealth creation. As has been said, this was a Sheriff of Nottingham package: it massively redistributed tax cuts to the top and left the great mass of the work force out of the equation altogether. It squandered an opportunity to do something about participation. At certain times some of the government’s ministers lecture in the House of Representatives and the Senate about the three Ps, including participation. Labor’s package would have delivered a significant boost to the economy—the sort of boost that the Treasurer is constantly talking about in terms of participation. Also the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the OECD and the Business Council of Australia have said that our package was markedly superior in encouraging greater participation in the work force.
Labor acknowledge that marginal rates are too high across the board, especially for low- and middle-income earners. They were dudded by the government’s approach. The government are lining up, in respect of industrial relations reform, to remove unfair dismissal laws altogether and also to mount an attack on the take-home pay of, particularly, low- and middle-income Australians when it comes to issues like penalty rates. They are about lowering wages and conditions of low- and middle-income earners. They have them in their sights. Also, the approach on the tax package reflected that, because the great bulk of Australian workers received a tax cut of only up to $6 a week. Labor believe that this is unfair. I do not know where the National Party are on this. They are certainly not in Tasmania; they do not exist down there. You only have to look at the cost of filling up a tank of petrol to see that the $6 a week tax cut does not even match the cost of that.
What Labor has tried to do in its approach to tax is to encourage the movement from welfare to work, because there are still very high effective marginal tax rates—as high as 80c in the dollar for every additional dollar. There was no effort in the government’s package to deal with the effective marginal tax rates for low- and middle-income earners. We now have 9,000 pages in the tax act. Again, the government talks a lot about simplifying the tax system in its complexity, but we now have 9,000 pages in the tax act. So there is no real fundamental attempt at reform.
So what is the outcome? The outcome is that the burden on low- and middle-income earners in this country is rising; they are facing higher taxes than they faced in 1996. Even with the tax changes, the average tax rate for someone on average earnings will increase from 22.5 per cent to 22.7 per cent. The average tax rate for someone on half the average wage—that is, about $27,000—will increase from 12.9 per cent to 15.3 per cent. So what does it add up to? Someone on the average wage will pay just over $100 a year more in tax than if the average tax rate on their income in 1996 applied. Someone on half the average wage—that is, about $26,000 or $27,000—will pay almost $700 a year more in tax than if the average tax rate on their income in 1996 applied. Of course they have the GST as well.
These figures simply refute and blow away the claims made by Senator Minchin in this chamber and by the Treasurer that they have been great supporters of low- and middle-income earners—the working class in this country. They have not been a friend of the Australian worker when it comes to tax. We will get to the industrial relations changes in due course, but they are no friend of the Australian worker when it comes to industrial relations either. We are seeing a continual attack on the living standards of low- and middle-income earners.
I have mentioned the participation challenge. Labor proposed a genuine tax reform package that sought to tackle the participation challenge. There was no effort by the government to target reductions in marginal tax rates for those whose participation would respond the most. An analysis of Labor’s tax proposals carried out by the Melbourne Institute showed that they would have not only delivered more tax relief but also improved participation in the Australian work force. This has been a lengthy debate since the budget. It is obvious to the Labor Party that the message will ensure the carriage of the package.
I referred earlier to the National Party. We have heard a lot from some members of the National Party—not Senator Boswell; he has been the doormat of this government for years and years. We have certainly heard some words from Senator Joyce on Telstra, voluntary student unionism and some aspects of industrial relations. But where has the National Party been on tax? I find this quite interesting. I have mentioned the advantages in Labor’s alternative approach for low- and middle-income earners. It would have doubled the tax cut from $6 to $12 for low- and middle-income earners earning up to about $63,000. So where has the National Party been on a fairer tax deal for the people it represents—low- and middle-income earners in regional Australia? According to the data, a greater proportion of lower income earners are located in regional Australia. What has the National Party been doing? The package will be passed by the Senate because of the message. In tax packages over the years, the National Party supported a GST and continued—
—Absolutely.
—Thank you for the interjection, Senator Boswell. The National Party has rolled over and been the doormat of the Liberal Party in respect of the GST and all other aspects of tax. I do not think that the National Party understands anything about the tax system; it blindly followed the Liberals as they outlined over the years tax packages, including this one, which are clearly not to the benefit of low- and middle-income earners in regional Australia, whom the National Party claims to represent. Nowhere is that better illustrated than by this approach.
I come from regional Australia—the north-west coast of Tasmania. In a previous speech I said that some 97 per cent of the taxpayers on the north-west coast of Tasmania earn less than $63,000 a year. It is one of the areas of Australia with a very significant proportion of low- and middle-income earners. Most National Party electorates similarly have a very high proportion of low- and middle-income earners, yet the National Party does nothing to advance the position of rural and regional Australia when it comes to a fairer tax approach. We have heard a lot from some National Party senators on some issues but we never hear from them on tax, which is very fundamental, obviously, to the living standards of Australians.
This unfair tax package—that is, unfair compared to Labor’s approach—will pass. Labor would have doubled the tax cut for low- and middle-income earners from $6 to $12. We are proud to have stood up and fought for what we believe in as a Labor Party. We were not going to roll over on Senator Minchin’s specious argument that this was in the budget. We believe in standing up and fighting for what we believe in. We have done so, and we have done so proudly. We now obviously accept the reality of the numbers in the Senate. We make no apologies for standing up and fighting for low- and middle-income-earning Australians, and we will continue to fight very vigorously on a number of fronts and on a number of issues until the next election.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—The Australian Democrats have taken a view of tax cuts from the perspective of our plan for structural income tax reform. Our plan for structural income tax reform has had five parts: to raise the tax-free threshold, to index the rates, to broaden the base, to raise the top rate and to reform the tax and welfare intersects. At the heart of our criticism of the government’s approach has been a sense that their income tax cuts package has not been part of an announced, argued, well-prepared, well thought through, long-term structural tax reform plan. That is a criticism which I hope the government will take on board and address.
In some respects the government have moved towards the Democrat position. For instance, if you refer to our position that the tax-free threshold should be raised to $20,000 in phases, the government already allow for that for, on our estimates, about three million Australians. About three million Australians, being senior Australians subject to the tax offset, now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968 for singles and up to $36,494 for couples. So it is certainly the view of the government that a high income tax threshold is desirable, but unfortunately they have only made it desirable for a portion of Australians, nearly all of whom are not working—and, of course, it is working Australians trying to get themselves up and going in the world who need a great deal of support.
That has been our approach to an income-tax-free threshold. We have argued that it should be lifted from where it is at $6,000 to $10,000 in the first instance and thereafter in phases up to $20,000. That will have great effects for the economy. It will deliver significant disposable income increases to low-income Australians, enabling them to find low wages acceptable, because their living standards can increase. It will take vast numbers, the majority of whom are women, out of the tax system because they are casuals and part-time paid workers. It will have all sorts of attractive income, economic and social consequences.
The second element of our structural reform plan is indexation. The government introduced the $6,000 tax-free threshold from the year 2000. If it had been indexed from that year, it would be around $7,050 or $7,060—on the way up to $7,100—today. That costs around $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion a year. We think that would be a very good way of maintaining equity. The greatest effect, once again, will be for low-income Australians.
The third part of our plan is to broaden the base. We think welfare for the wealthy needs to be got rid of in the same very intelligent way that the Ralph review and subsequently the government recommended that the base should be broadened to allow the corporate tax rate to drop. The consequence was actually an increase in corporate tax revenue. We always knew that the revenue-neutral argument of the government erred decidedly on the conservative side. The Democrats supported that proposition because we knew it delivered greater equity in the corporate world but also delivered greater revenue, which was our interest, given an underspend in many areas of necessary government services. Broadening the base enables you to get rid of inequities, inadequacies and inequalities, then it provides you with the money to address other areas of necessary income tax reform.
The fourth area of our plan is to raise the top rate. We have recommended that ultimately the top rate could be $120,000. We have no problem with that. But bear in mind our suggestion or recommendation, our view of priority, is that first you raise the tax-free threshold, first you index the rates, because that is what helps low-income people the most.
The fifth part of our structural reform package is to reform the tax-welfare intersects. The government should be given credit for reducing the taper rate both in 2000 and in the latest budget, but we know from the McClure report and other reports and considerations that much more needs to be done. It is a fact that the highest effective tax rates apply to low-income people.
We have had the strong view, given the size of the surplus, the nature of the economy and the opportunities and challenges faced by government, that the government missed a golden opportunity to address low-income earners first. Our alternative with the money on offer was in fact to use that money to raise the tax-free threshold. The Senate rejected that, so we then had to consider Labor’s proposition, which although second-best in our view to our own proposition nevertheless did try to do much more for low-income people than the government did—although we should always recognise that the tax cuts we proposed would have given more to low-income people than Labor had proposed.
In fact, our tax package was better than the government’s for people on incomes below $60,000 and better than Labor’s for people on incomes below $65,000. So we ended up supporting Labor’s approach, because we think it is important that the Senate takes a view as to where structural income tax reform should go. The fact is that the tax cuts are now in place. It is fair to report that the government were quite right in assessing public opinion. There has been no strong public reaction or antagonism from those communities that did not get the same tax cuts that have gone to other communities. High-income tax earners, of course, are very happy, but there certainly has been no outrage from low-income tax earners at the government tax package in the sense of letters, emails and all that sort of thing that politicians normally get.
So it seems there is broad community acceptance of the government’s tax package, and we must accept that. But we must also, as it is our job to represent our constituency and Labor’s job to represent their constituency, argue for those policies which we believe are right. Despite the fact of a general acceptance of the tax cuts package within the community at large and its bedding down, we remain concerned not that the government have done it but that they have done it in the wrong order—that is, they have first of all addressed high-income earners when they should have first of all addressed low-income earners. I do not intend to speak at length on this matter. I want to conclude by recommending that the government do not rest on their laurels with respect to the income tax reform they have carried out to date in the years 2000, 2004 and 2005—with more to come in 2006—but that they in fact put together a serious, substantively argued case for permanent structural income tax reform which will provide certainty into the future.
As we know, every year income tax thresholds and income tax rates are affected by bracket creep, and the real income of Australians is effectively eroded. I think it is important that the government address that issue and deal with the five parts that we recommend. To restate them and conclude: we want to see the tax-free threshold raised, and raised significantly; we want to see rates indexed; we want to see the base broadened; the top rate can stay as it is probably pretty well where it should be for the present; and we want to see tax and welfare reformed and addressed. I guess, since Senator Sherry did address the National Party in this debate, it is recognised by the media and the community that the National Party have more sway in the new Senate environment. You have greater numbers but you are also getting much more media coverage and attention. I do hope, in the interests of their own regional, rural and remote constituency—many of whom are low-paid workers—that the National Party will argue strongly for further structural income tax reform.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-08-10,"—It is always a pleasure to follow Senator Murray. His speeches are coherent and they lead somewhere, in contrast to those of Senator Sherry, who is normally pretty predictable. As he starts off he always has a bit of a bash at the National Party and then he fades into insignificance. I would like to congratulate Senator Minchin. The first piece of legislation addressed by this parliament deals with the $21.7 billion tax cuts for all Australians—and if that does not signal that the game is on then nothing does. I do not know how you can sit there, Senator Sherry, and defend your position. I know that you are a shadow spokesman, and I suppose it falls on you to do that, but your defence of your position is pretty puerile.
This $21.7 billion is a very, very significant tax cut to most Australians. It is one that the government supports and one that the National Party support wholeheartedly. We have this bill, if it goes through—and it will go through, because we have the support of the coalition, so it will obviously go through. I do not even know if you would be prepared to call a division, but it would be interesting if you did call a division on this. The bill deals with the tax cuts in the May budget for Australian workers—for some more than others, but all Australian workers get a benefit. The cuts ensure that the top tax rate only applies to three per cent of Australians.
I want to address some of the issues that both Senator Murray and Senator Sherry alluded to. The Labor Party have been losing votes in rural and regional Australia over the last 20 or 30 years—in fact, they do not even put up a reasonable fight now; they get some union hack to go and stand out there and put their name up in a rural electorate. They usually get around eight, nine or 10 per cent of the votes, which they then redirect to an Independent to try and knock out the coalition member or senator. But I say to them and the Senate that there are many skilled workers out in rural and regional Australia who are going to get great benefits out of these tax cuts and these people have traditionally been Labor Party voters. You can understand, when these people who are skilled workers are denied tax benefits—or an attempt is made to deny them such benefits—that they turn their votes away from the Labor Party. The Labor Party never seem to understand this.
The old class warfare has moved on. Let me give you some instances, Senator Sherry, if you are listening. A skilled, unionised abattoir worker—let us say a beef boner, and a pretty good one—on the floor would earn around 70,000 bucks a year. Let me tell you that he would be worse off, if your bill got up, by $76 a month or $3.50 a day. Let us go to a truck driver making $75,000 a year. He would lose $22.30 a week if your tax cuts came in. A wharfie or a senior police officer earning $80,000 would lose a lot of money also. Let us take coalminers on an average of $93,000 a year. That is where you start in the coalmining industry—you can go up higher and higher, but that is the starting salary. The tax cut there that you would deny the coalminers is $180 a week.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I know that this is Senator Boswell’s first foray in a tax debate for a long time, but he is just wrong. What he said is not correct.
 (Senator Kirk)—Senator Sherry, there is no point of order.
—Senator Sherry, I know you do not agree with this, but I am giving you a little bit of political advice, whether or not you want to hear it. When you voted against this bill you denied some of your ex-supporters huge tax cuts—abattoir workers and all those sorts of people. You have to move on, Senator Sherry. A lot of your constituency earn serious sums of money, ranging from $93,000 a year—that is a starting wage in a mine—to $70,000 a year for an abattoir worker, and then there are the truck drivers, policemen and all those sorts of people. By voting against our tax cuts, you are going to deny those people huge tax benefits. Then you wonder why your vote disappears in rural and regional Australia. I am telling you why: you are neglecting the people who originally supported you: the abattoir worker, the miner. Most of those people are now voting for the National Party and you would not wonder when you are trying to take $170 a month from them. Of course they will vote for us. They have realised that you have not moved on with the times.
I welcome the opportunity to speak today on behalf of the National Party. I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the abattoir workers, the miners, the people in rural and regional Australia who earn very good money because they have very good skills. We recognise that fact and we have implemented tax cuts that you would deny them by voting against our legislation. So do not come in here and belt up the National Party for having no views on tax, because we do have very serious views on tax. We believe those people who are in the productive sector in rural Australia are entitled to tax cuts as much as anyone else in Australia, and you want to deny them that. I am sorry, but the National Party will not agree to that. We will support tax cuts for all Australians, including the abattoir workers, the rural Australians, the miners, the policemen, the waterside workers—all the people who used to vote for you who have now come over to us.
It is not by smoke and mirrors that the National Party have increased their Senate numbers by 50 per cent. It did not just happen. We did not just walk in here and take a couple of positions on this side of the house. We got those positions, representing rural and regional Australia, because you neglected those miners, those abattoir workers, those rural and regional Australians that you have just walked away from. As long as you keep walking away from them, the National Party will keep increasing their numbers. Do not do it. I have given you the warning that, if you keep belting up your ex-constituents, the National Party will keep increasing their Senate vote and their rural representation.
Question agreed to.
Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-08-10,"—We had a lengthy debate on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005 before 1 July, when there was a change in the Senate numbers. Like the message we have just considered regarding the income tax package of the government, given the new numbers in the Senate this bill is now destined to pass the Senate. The issue of the so-called surcharge tax for higher income earners on superannuation contributions has been a matter of great debate since it was introduced in 1996.
I have made many contributions on this topic, so I do not want to speak at great length. However, I do want to reiterate a couple of fundamental points regarding the abolition of the tax surcharge on superannuation contributions of high-income earners. Firstly, we are talking about a tax. The Liberal government introduced this tax in 1996, claiming it was a surcharge and dodging the word ‘tax’. It did so because it broke a fundamental promise that there would be no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. It broke that promise in 1996 and it called this a surcharge when in fact it was a tax. It applied to high-income earners. At that point the Labor Party opposed the surcharge tax, because the government broke its promise. Senator Minchin is looking a bit puzzled but, if he looks at the government’s election platform of 1996, he will see that the promise of no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes was central to its 1996 election commitments.
What was the government’s justification? It argued in support of this new tax for higher income earners because of fairness and equity. It was not about balancing the budget, as it now claims; it was about fairness and equity. In fact there are on the record numerous quotes from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, claiming that it was introduced because of fairness and equity. It was introduced in order to reduce the effective marginal tax saving for higher income earners in respect of superannuation contributions. That is on the record on numerous occasions. At one point in time Mr Costello even boasted about the fact that he was applying it to politicians as well—members of defined benefit funds. He boasted about that. He boasted continually about the need to increase the tax rates for higher income earners in respect of superannuation to reduce the relative advantage they had in terms of contributions to superannuation. That is why it was introduced.
There was significant discussion at the time about the administrative complexity of the collection of this tax, and Labor did point out that the costs of collecting this tax were significant. It is certainly the most costly tax to collect. In fact, I discovered something startling. I think Senator Murray might have been at Senate estimates during this last year when I questioned the Australian Taxation Office. The tax office admitted that over the past eight years there was more than, I think, $700 million to $800 million of this tax that they could not collect. They were not able to collect it, and that goes back to the administrative difficulties. In introducing this tax, the government did not think enough about the administrative complexity of collecting the tax—and I think that is a legitimate criticism of this tax.
However, the Labor Party live with reality. The fact is that the GST was introduced. We are not seeking now to scrap the GST. This tax has now been in operation since 1996. The beneficiaries of this are people on a surchargeable tax income of greater than $99,700 a year. Despite some of the nonsense I see in the media from some people, about five per cent of the taxpayers of this country—higher income earners—benefit from this tax. That five per cent figure was confirmed at Senate estimates by Treasury.
The tax is not being repealed, and I do want to emphasise this because there does seem to be some confusion amongst people who are paying this tax at the present time. It is being abolished, not repealed. That means that for people in a defined benefit fund—and there are many people in defined benefit funds—the debt that they have accrued will continue on and will continue to gather interest. There is some belief amongst people who have accrued a debt that the debt is being wiped as well. That is not correct, and I want to put that on the record, because a number of people have rubbed their hands in joy about the fact that their debt is being wiped out. It is not. However, the debt will not grow any larger—other than from the interest component.
So the tax is being abolished but the existing debt is not being repealed. Individuals will have to pay that, probably when they retire. The accrued debt will come off their retirement income, or, if they wish, they can choose to pay the accrued debt off. Those are the two options for people in defined benefit funds—and higher income earners have a greater propensity to be in defined benefit funds. I am not sure of the exact number of people. It might be interesting for Senator Minchin to let us know—if he knows—how many people actually have an accrued debt because they are in DB funds. I have never seen a figure, but it would be a reasonably substantial number. That is of course why in the budget papers for the forward estimates, despite the fact that the tax is being abolished, there is still about $300 million a year being collected. It is because people are paying off their accrued debt as they reach retirement or, alternatively, are paying it off through the defined benefit fund before they reach retirement. I just wanted to make it clear, because there does seem to be some misunderstanding on that matter among people who have accrued surcharge debts.
Again, Labor argued that this was an unfair tax cut because it was an exclusive tax cut only for high-income earners. They benefited from the income tax cuts and then they got a very significant tax cut via their super. Labor argued that this was an unfair approach and we would not support it. The government have made a great deal about the co-contribution. In the context of the initial reduction and now the abolition of the surcharge they said, ‘We are doing this for high-income earners—those earning more than $99,700 a year—and we have introduced a co-contribution for low- to middle-income earners.’ The co-contribution is that if you put up to $1,000 into super voluntarily you get a matching government contribution of up to $1,500, if your income is up to $28,000. It then phases out until your income reaches $58,000.
The government say that this is a balanced approach. Labor say that that is not right, it is not a balanced approach, because under this proposal to abolish the surcharge all high-income earners on a surchargeable tax income of greater than $99,700 a year get a benefit—all of them, and they do not have to do anything; they do not have to make extra contributions to super. So the tax abolition is not conditional on higher income earners putting extra money into super. By way of contrast, the co-contribution is. You only get the co-contribution if you put extra money into super. In order to gain a benefit from the government via the co-contribution, low- and middle-income earners have to do something. They have to put extra money into super—it is conditional, whereas it is not conditional for higher income earners. They all get the tax cut and they do not have to do anything.
The second point that I make about the lack of balance is that many low-income earners do not have a spare $1,000. Some do, and I accept that, and good on them if they put it into super. However, on the government’s own figures, only about one in 10 low-income earners have a spare $1,000 or so to put into super, because lower income earners have a lower propensity to save, for one very obvious reason: in the majority of cases, they simply do not have the money. Some do, but the majority do not. So that is not a balanced approach. I reject that government argument.
The third point I want to make is about what is happening to middle Australia. What is the government doing as far as superannuation and incentives for middle Australia? For those earning roughly $55,000 up to approximately $100,000, they are not doing very much or, indeed, anything. I think there are approximately 2½ million wage and salary earners in this group. We have a very significant group of middle Australians for whom this government has done nothing in respect to superannuation. The surcharge and the co-contribution for people in the middle to higher end of the 50s is not a great deal of money as it is phased out. You get to $58,000 in income and there is no co-contribution. From then on up to a surchargeable income of $99,000—approximately $100,000—for that vast group of middle Australians, this government has done nothing in terms of direct incentives for superannuation. It is not a balanced approach.
The Labor Party accepts that the bill will now pass in the Senate. We recognise the reality of the numbers in the new Senate. As I have outlined, the Labor Party will not support the abolition of the surcharge. We believe that better use of the monies could have been made, particularly for lower and middle income earners. Where is the tax cut on superannuation for other Australians earning less than $100,000 a year? There is not one. So it is an exclusive tax cut from that point of view. However, this bill will pass in the Senate. Again, the Labor Party has fought for what it believes in. We do not agree with the principle.
I know that Senator Minchin has outlined that the basic position since 1 July is that the numbers have changed in the Senate and that the Labor party should just accept everything the government puts up. I see Senator Murray smiling because I know he made this point in previous debates as well. The government of the day has a very arrogant approach. We have seen the creeping arrogance coming into a number of arguments and behaviours in this place. We saw it yesterday. The government is arrogantly saying, ‘The Labor Party should not oppose anything in the Senate. They should not put up anything positive. We, the Liberal Party, are the government and you do as we say. That is it. We have the numbers and we are going to use them.’
The government may have the numbers in the Senate but the Labor Party are going to continue to fight for what we believe in. We are going to continue to put up positive policies for improving the economic and social conditions of Australian workers and their families. We are going to continue to do that. We are going to continue to fight in this Senate to make the arguments and policy points. We are not just going to roll over and accept the arrogance of this government saying that we should just accept what they put forward in the Senate as a matter of right because it is in the budget and that we should therefore pass anything they deem to put up. As I have said, I think this is an arrogant approach from the government and we have seen this across a number of fronts. They are out of touch in a number of areas that are of fundamental concern to Australian workers and their families. We will debate those other issues over the course of the next 2½ years. The Labor Party will continue to fight in this place for what it believes in.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005 proposed changes which could be summarised as follows: the discontinuance of surcharges on superannuation contributions that occur on or after 1 July 2005 applying incrementally to taxpayers with a taxable income in excess of $99,710—in other words nearly $100,000—with the full rate to apply to taxable incomes in excess of $121,075. They are charged incrementally up to 12½ per cent for the 2004-05 financial year and 10 per cent for the 2005-06 financial year and later fiscal years. In other words, this is a tax cut for the wealthy.
The discontinuance of surcharges also applies to lump sum superannuation payments, principally eligible termination payments that resulted in reported incomes in excess of the thresholds outlined above, and the maintenance and indexation of previously assessed surcharges owing for superannuation contributions made between the 1996-97 financial year and the 2004-05 financial year that are still outstanding.
According to the government the intention behind repealing the surcharge is to encourage further retirement saving for the 600,000 to one million Australians to whom the surcharge is estimated to apply. The real intention is to respond to strong and prolonged opposition to the surcharge that has existed ever since its introduction, to gratify a large sector of the coalition constituency and because, as Senator Minchin recently admitted, its real original purpose was as a tax to help reduce the budget deficit inherited from Labor. They now think of it as an unnecessary fiscal revenue raising measure since the government budget is in surplus. In other words, despite us never being told of that view, it was always regarded by the coalition as a temporary tax or surcharge.
The cost to revenue is very considerable. It is estimated it will be in excess of $2½ billion over the next four years. So for any little charitable association out there, local road that needs to be built or any other bit of expenditure that is denied to the community, just remember that the better off have got your money and that is why you are not getting it.
There are several issues that should be noted. The original intention of the surcharge, according to the Howard government, was to address the inequitable concessional taxation treatment that applied to high-income earners who, through greater disposable income, were able to take advantage of higher superannuation contributions. The removal of this levy implies a reversal of that policy and favours a widening of the gap between those who can save for retirement and those who cannot. It was originally sold as an equity measure. With the exception of recipients of lump sum super payments, the surcharge currently applies only to the highest bracket of income earners. Its removal is yet another concession to wealthy Australians at the expense of revenue that could be put to use in a range of areas, such as education or low-income earners’ tax cuts.
Relieving the future welfare burden of underfunded retirees, for instance, whose saving gap the surcharge was originally intended to redress, is not a priority. And there is the question in this debate as to what will be done with the money instead—that is, what is the better purpose that money could have been put to? This is not a base-broadening measure; this is a costly measure, and there is no compensatory removal of welfare for the wealthy. In that sense, it disregards a good tax principle—that is, that in addressing an income tax issue in one area you should seek to equalise the revenue effects wherever you can by compensating removals of inequities or unjustified tax concessions. The claim that removing the surcharge will simplify the superannuation system is not well founded, since the vast majority of the reporting measures will need to be maintained for the government’s super co-contribution policy.
Key beneficiaries of this bill, it should be noted, are people such as me, due to their higher employer contribution rate, which is amongst the highest in the country. The superannuation industry has welcomed the bill, as it does stand to gain management control of the funds freed up by the proposal whilst also benefiting from a reduced administrative and reporting workload. In that respect, the government’s belief that some of these restored funds will flow into savings is confirmed by the superannuation industry’s attitude. Press commentary on the matter has been largely positive, although it has noted that the bill is against progressive taxation measures. Once again, the government is fortunate in that the public seem blissfully unconcerned, but the higher income beneficiaries of this largess are of course delighted—that is, until they have to pay for the accumulated debt which is sitting there.
The Democrats’ policy is that we believe superannuation savings should be encouraged by taxation incentives that are fair and progressive and avoid excessive tax minimisation by high-income earners while properly reflecting the deferral of the benefits of superannuation and government co-contributions targeted at low-income earners. We oppose the bill, not because it delivers more savings consequences—to the extent that it does—but because we believe that the revenue impost on higher income earners was justified and the revenue could have been better used for other purposes within the government’s requirements, and I could name any number of them. I will leave my remarks at that. I am sure Senator Watson will enjoy exhibiting some part of his justifiable reputation in these matters. He is, with Senator Sherry, one of the experts in this chamber.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-08-10,"—I hail the abolition of this surcharge. It is certainly long overdue and has certainly been one of the most inequitable taxes that has been put on the statute books. With respect, Senator Murray, to say that the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005 is just for high-income earners is not really correct. We have the situation where police officers injured in the course of duty suddenly find their accumulated amount comes within this legislation. It might not come completely within it; it might be within the transition stage—but, during that transition stage, the marginal tax rates on the way up can be as high as 62 per cent. Is it fair, when superannuation is supposed to be concessionally taxed, that people such as police officers and others injured in the course of duty suddenly find themselves with an incremental marginal tax rate as high as 62 per cent, when the top tax rate on personal incomes is below 50 per cent?
I would also like to point out the terrible inequity in the situation where a person’s entitlement is not a lump sum but a pension. Should such a person happen to die within a short time of their retirement—or even beforehand—there would be no lump sum entitlement through which to pay the surcharge. Such a person, dying within a short time of their retirement, could have accumulated a terribly high surcharge debt—maybe $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 or $80,000. A retiree on a pension payment may have no ability to pay that sort of money. They would have to borrow from neighbours, banks or family just to meet that surcharge debt—and they would have received absolutely no benefit, because they are on an income stream. At a time when we are trying to encourage people to move to an income stream, a pension or an annuity, where is the fairness in putting an obligation like that on people who are locked into an income stream or a pension and have no ability to finance that debt? One of the good tenets of taxation is that you pay tax on where you get a taxation benefit. Where is the taxation benefit in those circumstances?
We have another situation: suppose a person is a member of a corporate defined benefits scheme and that scheme happens to be pretty good. When returns are good, sometimes they can be 22 per cent. I have known some to be as high as 30 per cent. But what happens with the surcharge debt? As far as parliamentarians and Commonwealth public servants are concerned, we legislated to provide a cap of 15 per cent. But for those people out in the real world, in a good company scheme, what is the rate of interest that they have to pay? It is 22 per cent, 25 per cent, 30 per cent or, if it is a less well performing fund, maybe 17 per cent. There is a minimum of 15 per cent. Where is the equity?
So I say to you: this is a tax that has to come off the statute books. It is not a uniformly good tax that is applicable to all; it is very selective and it hits some people, because of particular circumstances, very aggressively. I commend the Treasurer on his initiative in getting rid of this tax. Last Sunday in Sydney I attended a meeting of the Society of Superannuants where they farewelled this tax—hopefully—with dignity.
The other big problem is that it is not a universal tax. Not everybody who is a high-income earner pays it. We find that new judges pay it but old judges do not. We find that magistrates, who are performing almost the same duties as judges, pay it. I remind you that we also had a High Court decision saying that a number of aspects of this tax could not be upheld. So increasingly we are finding that, as the litigation comes before the highest courts in the land, holes are being found in this tax. A tax must be universal. It must be applicable to everybody. You cannot have some people outside the system and some inside the system, on the basis that they get an equivalent return.
I am very pleased to see this unfortunate tax go. I remind senators that it came in to plug that $10 billion black hole that was inherited from the Labor government. It was intended to be a short-term tax but, because of the combined opposition parties in this place, has taken too long to take it away. I think this is the first opportunity that we have had to get rid of it. The sooner it is off the statute books the better. Unfortunately, it is going to linger because, although it is going to be abolished from this year, 2005-06, the repercussions of it will go on for several years. Already we have found, from the Australian National Audit Office’s assessment, that the tax office is having difficulty in handling the more difficult cases. So it is a bad tax. The quicker we can get it off the books and the sooner we can get rid of the notion that it is a universal, fair tax, the better.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-08-10,"—I thank Senator Watson for his very informed and wise contribution to this debate on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005. I also thank Senators Murray and Sherry. I do think it is fitting that both the first and second bills dealt with by this new Senate reduce the tax burden on all Australians. I think this therefore should be seen as Australians getting their appropriate dividend from their investment in a coalition majority in this place, because the facts are that neither the income tax cuts nor the abolition of this 15 per cent surcharge would have happened but for the result of the last Senate election. This Senate, in its old composition, voted down the government’s proposals to reduce income tax and abolish this surcharge. So neither of these things would be happening but for the phenomenon of the coalition being given a Senate majority by the people of Australia—a quite extraordinary circumstance.
From a wider perspective, the fact that we are able to proceed with both these pieces of legislation to reduce the tax burden on Australians should be seen as a dividend from nine years of very hard work on our part to restore the strong fiscal circumstances of this nation. It has taken us nine long, hard years of debt reduction, cost control and economic growth to ensure that Australia is in a position to be able to afford these substantial tax reductions. They would not have been possible without all the hard work that has occurred over the last nine years to make this economy much more productive and to introduce much more fiscal discipline into the way this $200 billion federal government budget is managed.
I repeat emphatically what Senator Watson has said: in the 1996 election campaign we did not want to introduce any new taxes, but the facts are that we inherited a budget situation where the previous government had accumulated some $70 billion in federal government debt. That brought about a situation where we faced $96 billion of debt, $8 billion a year in interest payments and an ongoing $10 billion deficit each year. We had no alternative but to cut government programs and introduce other imposts like this surcharge in order to deal with that very difficult fiscal situation. This surcharge was introduced on the basis of equity in relation to sharing the burden of dealing with the fiscal shambles that we inherited in 1996. It was always seen within the government as being a temporary measure to restore the fiscal integrity of the federal government’s finances.
We wanted to be in a position to remove this surcharge when that was a fiscally responsible thing to do. We quite deliberately packaged this as an equity measure, as described by Senator Sherry, but in the context of an equitable sharing of the burden of restoring the fiscal integrity of the Commonwealth’s finances and getting the budget back into surplus. That job has been done and we have now run surpluses in, I think, eight of our 10 budgets. We now are in a position to completely abolish this surcharge. I am humbled that the Australian people have given us a majority in the Senate which is enabling us to do it. I remind this chamber and people listening elsewhere that this would not have been possible but for the fact that we have won a majority, which is quite an extraordinary phenomenon. This Senate, in its old form, voted down this bill.
I would also draw attention to the Labor Party’s extraordinarily chequered behaviour in relation to this matter. The Labor Party opposed the introduction of this surcharge. They not only left us with a fiscal shambles but also opposed every attempt on our part to fix the problem. They sought to deny us the capacity to repair the budget by denying us the income from this surcharge and then, on every occasion when we have sought to reduce the surcharge, they have opposed us—contrary to their original opposition to the surcharge itself. Now that we come to this chamber to abolish the surcharge—having done its job and being no longer necessary—they again seek to oppose it. The Labor Party have fallen into a culture of opposition, where they believe they must oppose everything that the government put up and, apparently, they cannot consider anything on its merits.
This has been an administratively difficult surcharge. There are all the problems that Senator Watson has alluded to. It is timely, proper and appropriate that we abolish it. It is something that I have personally sought to achieve for many a long day and I flagged that publicly at the very beginning of this year, in January. I am delighted that the budget is in such a strong position that we are able to finally remove this surcharge. I commend the bill to this chamber.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—by leave—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I speak to this as chair of this references committee but, as members of the committee would know, that is a role I took on just at the end of June. The totality of the work beyond drafting the final report was done by the previous committee, of which I was not a member, and of course by the previous chair, my fellow Queensland Democrats senator John Cherry who, sadly, is no longer in this chamber. So in many ways I am simply presenting the result of the work of other people beyond the final pulling together of the report. I pay tribute to particularly the work of the former chair of the committee, Senator Cherry, and also the work of the committee secretariat in pulling it together in that slightly unusual and less than ideal context.
This report is, nonetheless, a very important one for the Senate and the public, with the current crucial debate about the future of telecommunications in Australia, only part of which revolves around the future ownership of Telstra. This report focuses on the performances of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. Its release will contribute to the current national debate on Telstra’s provision of services to the bush, the encouragement of investment in telecommunications infrastructure and the appropriate level of regulation of competition in the telecommunications arena.
The benefits of effective telecommunications services to the Australian economy and to the community are very substantial. As well as being a vital social service to which all Australians are entitled, internationally competitive telecommunications services are essential to local businesses, from the very largest to the very smallest. To put it bluntly, affordable, accessible and modern telecommunications are very much in the national interest. The committee heard many concerns that the sale of Telstra would undermine those benefits, including criticism that in proceeding with the sale the government was failing to take sufficient account of the importance of regulation and competition in protecting a vital service and was putting potential revenue ahead of the need to safeguard future services to consumers.
It is important to emphasise that those concerns are broader than simply a view about whether Telstra should or should not be in public hands. In the context of that debate, it is a view that the very important issue of whether the regulatory and competition regime that surrounds Telstra, regardless of whether it is in public or private hands, is not getting the attention it deserves and it is in part being deliberately ignored by some of the imperatives driving the government’s desire to maximise the amount of money it gets from selling Telstra.
The concerns in this report are very real. It is not just the Democrats and the ALP pushing their agenda; it is a report that reflects the concerns of industry, small business and, importantly, millions of individual Australians. Some people in rural areas drove hundreds of kilometres to tell the committee of their concerns, particularly their frustration with poor services and high costs. So this report is an effort to constructively contribute to this important debate. In a context where this government have a growing record of ignoring Senate committee reports and community concerns, I would urge them on this occasion to pay attention to what has been provided by the community.
The committee received 52 submissions and held eight hearings across Australia, taking evidence in Sydney, Melbourne, Dubbo, Townsville, Perth and Canberra. Several major themes emerged during the inquiry: weaknesses in the anticompetitive provisions and the access regime under the Trade Practices Act, a high level of concern about current and future services to regional and rural Australia and the need for stronger consumer protection measures. The clear message was that the current regulatory regime did not and does not protect consumers sufficiently, does not support competition adequately and does not stimulate infrastructure investment in this country, particularly outside the high-traffic, high-profit areas. This report makes 35 important recommendations for reform, and they are valid whether or not Telstra stays in public hands.
The committee heard considerable evidence indicating that Telstra’s horizontal and vertical integration has stifled competition. The committee believe that effective transparency of Telstra’s activities will only be achieved if Telstra’s wholesale and retail activities are structurally separated. The government has never properly considered this option and has consistently dismissed it out of hand, so we have recommended that the Productivity Commission be asked to undertake a full examination of the structural separation of Telstra. In light of the government’s position, the committee also see merit in the ACCC’s recommendation on an effective model of operational separation, which clearly is not working adequately at the moment. In order to regulate the telecommunications sector effectively we have called for the ACCC’s powers to be enhanced. The example of the 2004 broadband competition notice illustrates that the ACCC does not have sufficient powers or resources to deter anticompetitive behaviour. We have recommended that funding provided to the ACCC for telecommunications issues be substantially increased, and that they be given divestiture powers so that they can do the job they need to do more effectively.
Infrastructure competition in this country has been severely hampered by Telstra’s ownership of two of the three HFC networks and by its part ownership of Foxtel. As have previous inquiries, we have called for Telstra to divest its shareholding in Foxtel and for measures to be taken in relation to its ownership of the HFC network. The committee heard repeated claims of regulatory gaming by Telstra to hinder its competitors in gaining access to declared infrastructure. The government has known of these concerns but has not taken the necessary steps to address them. The committee have made a range of recommendations to address weaknesses in part XIC of the Trade Practices Act and to ensure compliance with national competition principles.
Central recommendations are that the government consider expanding the class of core services and that the ACCC include prohibitions on behaviour that has the purpose or effect of impeding or unreasonably delaying access in any model terms and conditions for core services, particularly the unconditioned local loop service. We have also recommended various legislative amendments with regard to the model terms and conditions set by the ACCC, the ACCC’s powers to set prices, and amendments to the undertaking scheme to prevent its misuse and promote certainty.
Australia’s performance on broadband access, compared with other OECD countries, has declined in recent years. In addition to promoting greater competition, the committee call for greater support for infrastructure investment, particularly in low traffic areas, to promote broadband access. We have made several recommendations to improve the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, including that the government carry out a cost analysis of HiBIS to ascertain how equitable universal broadband access can be provided. We need to consider simplifying the application requirements for this scheme and streamlining the processing of applications for registration. Also, HiBIS needs to be broadened so that a higher subsidy is provided for a broadband service that creates suitable infrastructure for multiple users—such as cable or wireless technology—which allows for future use by other consumers.
The report acknowledges that infrastructure investment in regional Australia is severely limited by the prohibitive cost of backhaul. Another key recommendation is that the ACCC examine the availability of access to and the cost of backhaul services for carriers in regional Australia. The committee also recommended that funding be provided to local government to develop business models that focus on delivering affordable local broadband services to regional and remote areas. It is my view that broadband access, particularly in regional and rural areas, is absolutely critical to ensuring equal opportunities for economic and social development in those parts of the country. More opportunity for economic and social development in regional and more remote areas would, I believe, be beneficial for people that live in the cities as well.
The committee also repeat some recommendations from previous reports, particularly broadening the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. We have also recommended legislative amendments to enforce development of codes within set time frames, as well as annual reporting by industry on compliance with codes.
I wish to thank those that made submissions to the inquiry and the many people who gave evidence at the public hearings. That is another example of how important the independent Senate committee process is, operating as a genuine chamber of review, and providing real opportunities to the general public to provide their expertise and experiences and express their views and concerns.
I repeat my thanks to the former chair, Senator Cherry, and the secretariat staff: Louise Gell, Jacqueline Dewar, Jonathan Chowns, Rick Williams, Robyn Clough, Jacquie Hawkins and Dianne Warhurst, for their hard work in pulling together an enormous amount of material in a short time. I also thank former senators, Tsebin Chen and John Tierney, both of whom participated in this inquiry, as well as the other members of the committee, who put in their time and interest. I urge all senators and those members of the general public interested in this crucial policy issue to give consideration to the issues raised in the report. It is important that they be addressed. Regardless of whether or not we have public or private or ownership of Telstra, proper regulation and proper competition is important to the future of this crucial infrastructure area.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,4,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-08-10,"—As deputy chair of this committee, taking the place of Senator Tierney who retired earlier this year, I want to acknowledge the work that he put in, and also acknowledge the work of Senator Cherry as the former chair of the committee.
Not surprisingly, government senators have produced a report dissenting from the majority report on this inquiry. We feel that many of the recommendations are already in place. We all agree that high-quality, affordable telecommunications services are critical to the ongoing prosperity of this country. That is why there is a focus on liberalising the Australian telecommunications market and encouraging the development of competition. We need to ensure that new market entrants can get access to and use of key services owned and operated by the incumbent provider. That should be provided through an access regime contained in part XIIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and, as well, through telecommunications specific competition rules in part XIIB of that same act.
It is very important to understand that there are now over 100 telecommunications carriers in this country. There are several hundred internet service providers. There are four companies which operate mobile phone networks and there are broadband networks in both regional cities and capital cities. The real question that should be asked is: are all consumers receiving benefits as a result of the existing regulatory framework? The Australian Communications Authority found, in its Telecommunications performance report 2003-04, that the output of the telecommunications industry was 96 per cent greater even then, in 2003-04, than if the telecommunications reforms of 1997 had not happened.
Government senators are satisfied that the current regulatory framework has worked reasonably well. The real questions we need to ask are: what will the future look like, what technologies are going to succeed in the future and what business models and structures will emerge? It is those questions that we need to ask rather than shackling the present telecommunications regime to a regulatory framework which may well be outmoded in two, three or five years. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, has initiated a review. I am very confident on behalf of government senators that this will deliver a flexible, responsive and robust framework.
There are several recommendations that government senators have supported in principle—for instance, recommendation 4 of the committee, which is ‘that one of the full-time commissioners of the ACCC be given specific responsibility for telecommunications, and this person also be a member of the Australian Communications and Media Authority’. The ACCC already has a commissioner who has carriage of telecommunications issues. In relation to this person also being a member of the Australian Communications and Media Authority, we note that there are provisions for this to occur and it has happened in the past. But it would be prudent, surely, to consider this matter only after the senior Australian Communications and Media Authority positions, including that of chair of that authority, have been finalised. That is what we would like to see happen.
Recommendation 30—‘that the Australian Communications and Media Authority give immediate and urgent consideration to adopting the recommendations in the ACA research report Consumer driven communications: strategies for better representation so that the rights of consumers are better protected’ than they are currently under the ACA ‘as previously recommended by the committee’—is another recommendation that has already been addressed. Consumer driven communications: strategies for better representation was submitted to the ACMA late in December 2004. The ACMA is considering those recommendations which relate to its functions and powers and has developed a work plan for addressing those recommendations. The government, of course, is also considering the recommendations, as are other bodies such as the Australian Communications Industry Forum and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. They are also considering the report recommendations that relate to their functions and powers. So these recommendations are already being addressed.
With regard to the committee’s recommendation 34—‘that all carriage service providers make available a basic residential package to households who want only a clear, cost based package of local access services’—we already have in place a number of measures which aim to assist low-income individuals in regard to access to adequate telecommunications services. However, government senators consider that it would be beneficial if other carriage service providers were to put in place similar measures to those Telstra has developed for people on low incomes, particularly in light of the ongoing move away from a monopoly in telecommunications service provision.
Certainly, as I said, we support in principle some of these recommendations. But we also need to recognise that much of this work is ongoing and many of the recommendations in this report have already been addressed in the many exhaustive inquiries into our telecommunications regime that have been carried out. What we need to do, as I said, is make sure that the clients are receiving the benefits as a result of the existing regulatory framework. In spite of the many negative comments that were made about the telecommunications regime, government senators are reasonably satisfied that consumers under the present regime are receiving benefits. There are always improvements to be made and modifications to the existing regime that can be carried out. But, by and large, we consider that the present regime has served consumers well.
The big question, of course, will be the structural separation of Telstra. The government has made it clear that it does not endorse this due to the cost and complexity of such an exercise. But we reject the recommendation to ask the Productivity Commission to undertake a full examination of that. By and large, we do not agree with the majority recommendations. We have issued a minority report, which I believe sums up the feelings of government senators very well. We can only perhaps be sorry in a way that this inquiry went over so much ground that had been trawled over by previous inquiries. There is not a lot of merit, I fancy, in going over and over these questions when the government is actively considering what it will do with the telecommunications regime.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-08-10,"—At the outset I would like to acknowledge two former senators for the enormous amount of work they put in on this committee: Senator Cherry, the former chair of the committee, and Senator Tchen. They travelled all around the country—they have probably been to more parts of the country than you have recently, Senator McGauran, as a National Party senator—and put in the hard yards. I want to acknowledge their commitment to the issue of the telecommunications regulatory regime.
—I will forward that on to them.
—Thank you. The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and Arts References Committee report into the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime is the product of five months of hard work from the committee, staff and senators involved. Over the past five months the committee heard extensive evidence from witnesses during a number of hearings in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Townsville and Dubbo. Completing the report by yesterday’s reporting date was an enormous effort for all involved, and I would like to express my personal thanks to the committee staff for their hard work and dedication in this regard. I would also like to express my thanks to the witnesses, who gave up their time and often put substantial effort into giving evidence to the inquiry. Many witnesses travelled vast distances to have their say at the hearings, and their stories gave vivid colour to the kinds of issues that the committee was inquiring into.
This inquiry was an open process and allowed people with something to say to express their views on issues like the upcoming privatisation of Telstra and the adequacy of Australia’s current telecommunications regulatory regime. Unlike the minister’s stage-managed listening tours of rural and regional Australia, this committee has actually gone out and heard the real story on Australian telecommunications services. In this regard, there is one area of the report that I especially want to speak to today, and that is the current standard of telecommunications services in rural and regional areas.
From the evidence heard by this committee, it is clear that telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia are far from adequate. After nine long years of the Howard government promising to bring rural and regional telecommunications services up to scratch, services in the bush are still so bad that regional businesses are being forced to flee the bush for the cities. The committee also heard many stories of the shockingly low levels of service provided to Australians in rural and regional Australia. Mr Michael Davis and his wife drove 500 kilometres to Dubbo to outline their concerns to the committee—that is, they drove 500 kilometres in both directions just to appear before the committee. They said:
The government promised a 19.2 kilobit service on a dial-up. We still cannot get 19.2 on a dial-up. We can only get 10 or 11 ... We have lost voice quality.
Similarly, the Mayor of the Narromine Shire Council told the committee:
Every three months we send our stuff to our accountant. It takes me over half an hour to email my little bit of info to the accountant ... I punch it in and go and make a cup of tea and have a sandwich and come back 20 minutes later and it is still whirring away, sending the email. That is the level of service we have.
—Did you ask him the question: how many pages?
—You are welcome to meet the Mayor of the Narromine Shire Council and have a discussion with him about it. I will give you his phone number and you can have a chat with him.
—It’s a fair technical question.
—Unlike you—
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order! Senator Conroy, please direct your remarks through the chair.
—Just to respond to Senator McGauran, without being drawn into an across-the-chamber debate—and I accept your admonishment, Mr Acting Deputy President—I will repeat what the Mayor of the Narromine Shire Council said:
It takes me over half an hour to email my little bit of info to the accountant.
The report catalogues damning evidence of the impact of Australia’s dilapidated telecommunications network on rural and regional communities. Disturbingly, the committee heard evidence that some businesses in rural and regional areas were being forced to consider relocating to metropolitan areas due to poor telecommunications service levels in rural and regional areas. Mr Joe Knagge from KNet Technologies, an IT company with offices in Dubbo and Orange, stated:
I can see that, in five to 10 years, if I do not have access to the very latest technology, then I will no longer be able to compete in the marketplace I play in, which includes the Sydney market, and I will need to move my business to Sydney. I just do not want to do that. I have always lived in regional Australia. I love regional Australia and so do all of our staff. I do not want to be faced with a move to the city, and that is why I am here today.
Jeffery Caldbeck, from the Dubbo City Development Corporation, described one example where relocation had occurred:
It was a home based business that really needed fairly substantial bandwidth to operate. Because of the inability for ADSL services to be provided, this family—both husband and wife worked in the business—relocated to Wollongong.
Mr Robert Barnett, the Mayor of Narromine Shire Council in western New South Wales, described the difficulty of running a rural business without access to broadband:
I am a wheat farmer—
Senator McGauran, you should pay attention to this—
and I am a cattle producer.
—Where was he from?
—He is from the Narromine Shire Council. He said:
In the wheat industry now, every day when wheat is delivered we download those loads and we try to market it. I cannot do that at home. I do a day’s work and come home at night, then I go into town—
that is 30 kilometres away, just for your information—
to my daughter’s place to access the information, because I can do there in 10 minutes what I cannot do in an hour at home.
After a hard day’s work he drives 30 kilometres into town so he can use a decent level of broadband service. He said:
The National Livestock Identification System is coming online in the cattle industry as of 1 July. We will be required to record through the internet the movements of these cattle but we do not have the infrastructure to do it, so we are really getting in a bind.
Similarly, in Western Australia, Mr Gary Chappell from the Peel Development Commission told the committee about the reliance by dairy farmers on broadband:
When I was at Waroona, a farmer gave me an example. He has little electronic readers and the cows have things on their ears.
You would be familiar with that, Senator McGauran. I understand the National Party have one on you to keep track of you in the building.
—They have one on Barnaby!
—Yes, one on Barnaby as well. Mr Chappell went on to say:
He downloads information off the internet to upgrade his software to do all those sorts of things and to enter statistical information but he is on dial-up so he sits there and if it does not go through the scanner, I suppose, he is missing one somewhere and he will go hunting for it.
The committee heard the same story up and down the country, from Dubbo to Perth to Townsville: services are not up to scratch and they are hurting rural businesses and holding back rural towns.
It was also clear from the evidence heard by the committee that none of these problems will be solved by the privatisation of Telstra or the creation of a rural slush fund to finance National Party photo opportunities. In fact, many witnesses before the inquiry expressed serious concerns about the privatisation of Telstra. Prominent telecommunications industry analyst Paul Budde noted:
It has become very clear that the government’s position on T3 is certainly not geared towards the best interests of the country.
Mr Charles Britton from the Australian Consumers Association noted:
Unleashing a private monopoly into an uncertain regulatory environment seems to us a dubious public service.
Mr Paul Askern from Townsville City Council stated:
Once Telstra is completely privatised it has the potential to become the ‘gorilla’ in the marketplace. This could have a range of adverse implications for consumers, residential and commercial.
In the face of the evidence revealed in this report the fact that the government’s only priority in telecommunications remains forcing through the sale of Telstra shows just how out of touch this government is.
In the context of the present debate over the privatisation of Telstra, the evidence in the report being tabled today is a timely reminder for those who will be voting on the sale about the issues that really matter. Those people who purport to represent the interests of Australians in rural and regional areas should take note of the evidence in this report when considering the sale of Telstra. They should ask themselves: if services are so bad in rural and regional Australia that people are being forced off the land and into the cities, how bad will they get once Telstra is privatised?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,4,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I too would like to comment on this report upon its tabling in the Senate today. Like Senator Conroy, I believe that it sends a very clear message to government senators and other senators about the dire consequences that will follow if Telstra is to be fully privatised. As we have heard, the evidence from one end of the country to the other describes the pitiful state of telecommunications services. The inquiry looked at the regulatory environment that the minister has been so inclined to mention in recent times in the context of this debate, saying that the regulatory environment will be there regardless of who owns Telstra. As a result of this inquiry we now know that the regulatory environment in telecommunications is not serving the people of rural and regional Australia very well at all, despite all the government’s rhetoric. And we know, as a result of the evidence collected in the inquiry, that if the government proceeds with privatisation the position will become worse.
That exposes as completely false the minister’s rhetoric that the regulations will be put in place regardless of who owns Telstra. The evidence says otherwise. The evidence says that we are in a bad state now, even with the residual public ownership, as far as services in the bush go—and more work needs to be done there—but it will become far worse if such a dominant, arrogant carrier such as Telstra is unleashed in a fully privatised manner. We need to look no further than the new CEO’s recent claim that Telstra will stay in the bush. Was there any question of it not servicing rural and regional Australia? That should stir the suspicions of National Party senators and of all those who live in rural and regional areas of Australia. Was there ever a question about Telstra servicing those areas? I would have thought not, but that question is now on the table. In many respects we all represent rural Australia. I have many constituents in the ACT—people tend to think of Canberra as a bit of a city state—on the outer metropolitan fringe and in rural areas who are directly impacted upon by Telstra’s failings in this area.
I would like to turn to our detailed investigations of that regulatory environment, particularly relating to anticompetitive behaviour and access to the existing regime. Both of those areas are crucial for the successful operation and delivery of services, again particularly in rural and regional Australia. The conclusion of the committee, based on the evidence, states:
The weaknesses of the current regulatory regime lie in the ability of Telstra to mask where the delineation between its wholesale and retail prices occur; the ACCC’s limited capacity to prove anti-competitive conduct—
and the reluctance of many witnesses to provide the ACCC with evidence for prosecution—
and ultimately the fact that the ACCC’s power to impose only financial penalties is not an adequate deterrent to anti-competitive behaviour. Consequently Part XIB of the TPA does not appear to provide the regulator, the industry or the wider community with confidence in the anti-competitive regime.
That conclusion speaks for itself. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—by leave—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the performance of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I speak to this as chair of this references committee but, as members of the committee would know, that is a role I took on just at the end of June. The totality of the work beyond drafting the final report was done by the previous committee, of which I was not a member, and of course by the previous chair, my fellow Queensland Democrats senator John Cherry who, sadly, is no longer in this chamber. So in many ways I am simply presenting the result of the work of other people beyond the final pulling together of the report. I pay tribute to particularly the work of the former chair of the committee, Senator Cherry, and also the work of the committee secretariat in pulling it together in that slightly unusual and less than ideal context.
This report is, nonetheless, a very important one for the Senate and the public, with the current crucial debate about the future of telecommunications in Australia, only part of which revolves around the future ownership of Telstra. This report focuses on the performances of the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. Its release will contribute to the current national debate on Telstra’s provision of services to the bush, the encouragement of investment in telecommunications infrastructure and the appropriate level of regulation of competition in the telecommunications arena.
The benefits of effective telecommunications services to the Australian economy and to the community are very substantial. As well as being a vital social service to which all Australians are entitled, internationally competitive telecommunications services are essential to local businesses, from the very largest to the very smallest. To put it bluntly, affordable, accessible and modern telecommunications are very much in the national interest. The committee heard many concerns that the sale of Telstra would undermine those benefits, including criticism that in proceeding with the sale the government was failing to take sufficient account of the importance of regulation and competition in protecting a vital service and was putting potential revenue ahead of the need to safeguard future services to consumers.
It is important to emphasise that those concerns are broader than simply a view about whether Telstra should or should not be in public hands. In the context of that debate, it is a view that the very important issue of whether the regulatory and competition regime that surrounds Telstra, regardless of whether it is in public or private hands, is not getting the attention it deserves and it is in part being deliberately ignored by some of the imperatives driving the government’s desire to maximise the amount of money it gets from selling Telstra.
The concerns in this report are very real. It is not just the Democrats and the ALP pushing their agenda; it is a report that reflects the concerns of industry, small business and, importantly, millions of individual Australians. Some people in rural areas drove hundreds of kilometres to tell the committee of their concerns, particularly their frustration with poor services and high costs. So this report is an effort to constructively contribute to this important debate. In a context where this government have a growing record of ignoring Senate committee reports and community concerns, I would urge them on this occasion to pay attention to what has been provided by the community.
The committee received 52 submissions and held eight hearings across Australia, taking evidence in Sydney, Melbourne, Dubbo, Townsville, Perth and Canberra. Several major themes emerged during the inquiry: weaknesses in the anticompetitive provisions and the access regime under the Trade Practices Act, a high level of concern about current and future services to regional and rural Australia and the need for stronger consumer protection measures. The clear message was that the current regulatory regime did not and does not protect consumers sufficiently, does not support competition adequately and does not stimulate infrastructure investment in this country, particularly outside the high-traffic, high-profit areas. This report makes 35 important recommendations for reform, and they are valid whether or not Telstra stays in public hands.
The committee heard considerable evidence indicating that Telstra’s horizontal and vertical integration has stifled competition. The committee believe that effective transparency of Telstra’s activities will only be achieved if Telstra’s wholesale and retail activities are structurally separated. The government has never properly considered this option and has consistently dismissed it out of hand, so we have recommended that the Productivity Commission be asked to undertake a full examination of the structural separation of Telstra. In light of the government’s position, the committee also see merit in the ACCC’s recommendation on an effective model of operational separation, which clearly is not working adequately at the moment. In order to regulate the telecommunications sector effectively we have called for the ACCC’s powers to be enhanced. The example of the 2004 broadband competition notice illustrates that the ACCC does not have sufficient powers or resources to deter anticompetitive behaviour. We have recommended that funding provided to the ACCC for telecommunications issues be substantially increased, and that they be given divestiture powers so that they can do the job they need to do more effectively.
Infrastructure competition in this country has been severely hampered by Telstra’s ownership of two of the three HFC networks and by its part ownership of Foxtel. As have previous inquiries, we have called for Telstra to divest its shareholding in Foxtel and for measures to be taken in relation to its ownership of the HFC network. The committee heard repeated claims of regulatory gaming by Telstra to hinder its competitors in gaining access to declared infrastructure. The government has known of these concerns but has not taken the necessary steps to address them. The committee have made a range of recommendations to address weaknesses in part XIC of the Trade Practices Act and to ensure compliance with national competition principles.
Central recommendations are that the government consider expanding the class of core services and that the ACCC include prohibitions on behaviour that has the purpose or effect of impeding or unreasonably delaying access in any model terms and conditions for core services, particularly the unconditioned local loop service. We have also recommended various legislative amendments with regard to the model terms and conditions set by the ACCC, the ACCC’s powers to set prices, and amendments to the undertaking scheme to prevent its misuse and promote certainty.
Australia’s performance on broadband access, compared with other OECD countries, has declined in recent years. In addition to promoting greater competition, the committee call for greater support for infrastructure investment, particularly in low traffic areas, to promote broadband access. We have made several recommendations to improve the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, including that the government carry out a cost analysis of HiBIS to ascertain how equitable universal broadband access can be provided. We need to consider simplifying the application requirements for this scheme and streamlining the processing of applications for registration. Also, HiBIS needs to be broadened so that a higher subsidy is provided for a broadband service that creates suitable infrastructure for multiple users—such as cable or wireless technology—which allows for future use by other consumers.
The report acknowledges that infrastructure investment in regional Australia is severely limited by the prohibitive cost of backhaul. Another key recommendation is that the ACCC examine the availability of access to and the cost of backhaul services for carriers in regional Australia. The committee also recommended that funding be provided to local government to develop business models that focus on delivering affordable local broadband services to regional and remote areas. It is my view that broadband access, particularly in regional and rural areas, is absolutely critical to ensuring equal opportunities for economic and social development in those parts of the country. More opportunity for economic and social development in regional and more remote areas would, I believe, be beneficial for people that live in the cities as well.
The committee also repeat some recommendations from previous reports, particularly broadening the role of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. We have also recommended legislative amendments to enforce development of codes within set time frames, as well as annual reporting by industry on compliance with codes.
I wish to thank those that made submissions to the inquiry and the many people who gave evidence at the public hearings. That is another example of how important the independent Senate committee process is, operating as a genuine chamber of review, and providing real opportunities to the general public to provide their expertise and experiences and express their views and concerns.
I repeat my thanks to the former chair, Senator Cherry, and the secretariat staff: Louise Gell, Jacqueline Dewar, Jonathan Chowns, Rick Williams, Robyn Clough, Jacquie Hawkins and Dianne Warhurst, for their hard work in pulling together an enormous amount of material in a short time. I also thank former senators, Tsebin Chen and John Tierney, both of whom participated in this inquiry, as well as the other members of the committee, who put in their time and interest. I urge all senators and those members of the general public interested in this crucial policy issue to give consideration to the issues raised in the report. It is important that they be addressed. Regardless of whether or not we have public or private or ownership of Telstra, proper regulation and proper competition is important to the future of this crucial infrastructure area.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,4,2,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-08-10,"—As deputy chair of this committee, taking the place of Senator Tierney who retired earlier this year, I want to acknowledge the work that he put in, and also acknowledge the work of Senator Cherry as the former chair of the committee.
Not surprisingly, government senators have produced a report dissenting from the majority report on this inquiry. We feel that many of the recommendations are already in place. We all agree that high-quality, affordable telecommunications services are critical to the ongoing prosperity of this country. That is why there is a focus on liberalising the Australian telecommunications market and encouraging the development of competition. We need to ensure that new market entrants can get access to and use of key services owned and operated by the incumbent provider. That should be provided through an access regime contained in part XIIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and, as well, through telecommunications specific competition rules in part XIIB of that same act.
It is very important to understand that there are now over 100 telecommunications carriers in this country. There are several hundred internet service providers. There are four companies which operate mobile phone networks and there are broadband networks in both regional cities and capital cities. The real question that should be asked is: are all consumers receiving benefits as a result of the existing regulatory framework? The Australian Communications Authority found, in its Telecommunications performance report 2003-04, that the output of the telecommunications industry was 96 per cent greater even then, in 2003-04, than if the telecommunications reforms of 1997 had not happened.
Government senators are satisfied that the current regulatory framework has worked reasonably well. The real questions we need to ask are: what will the future look like, what technologies are going to succeed in the future and what business models and structures will emerge? It is those questions that we need to ask rather than shackling the present telecommunications regime to a regulatory framework which may well be outmoded in two, three or five years. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, has initiated a review. I am very confident on behalf of government senators that this will deliver a flexible, responsive and robust framework.
There are several recommendations that government senators have supported in principle—for instance, recommendation 4 of the committee, which is ‘that one of the full-time commissioners of the ACCC be given specific responsibility for telecommunications, and this person also be a member of the Australian Communications and Media Authority’. The ACCC already has a commissioner who has carriage of telecommunications issues. In relation to this person also being a member of the Australian Communications and Media Authority, we note that there are provisions for this to occur and it has happened in the past. But it would be prudent, surely, to consider this matter only after the senior Australian Communications and Media Authority positions, including that of chair of that authority, have been finalised. That is what we would like to see happen.
Recommendation 30—‘that the Australian Communications and Media Authority give immediate and urgent consideration to adopting the recommendations in the ACA research report Consumer driven communications: strategies for better representation so that the rights of consumers are better protected’ than they are currently under the ACA ‘as previously recommended by the committee’—is another recommendation that has already been addressed. Consumer driven communications: strategies for better representation was submitted to the ACMA late in December 2004. The ACMA is considering those recommendations which relate to its functions and powers and has developed a work plan for addressing those recommendations. The government, of course, is also considering the recommendations, as are other bodies such as the Australian Communications Industry Forum and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. They are also considering the report recommendations that relate to their functions and powers. So these recommendations are already being addressed.
With regard to the committee’s recommendation 34—‘that all carriage service providers make available a basic residential package to households who want only a clear, cost based package of local access services’—we already have in place a number of measures which aim to assist low-income individuals in regard to access to adequate telecommunications services. However, government senators consider that it would be beneficial if other carriage service providers were to put in place similar measures to those Telstra has developed for people on low incomes, particularly in light of the ongoing move away from a monopoly in telecommunications service provision.
Certainly, as I said, we support in principle some of these recommendations. But we also need to recognise that much of this work is ongoing and many of the recommendations in this report have already been addressed in the many exhaustive inquiries into our telecommunications regime that have been carried out. What we need to do, as I said, is make sure that the clients are receiving the benefits as a result of the existing regulatory framework. In spite of the many negative comments that were made about the telecommunications regime, government senators are reasonably satisfied that consumers under the present regime are receiving benefits. There are always improvements to be made and modifications to the existing regime that can be carried out. But, by and large, we consider that the present regime has served consumers well.
The big question, of course, will be the structural separation of Telstra. The government has made it clear that it does not endorse this due to the cost and complexity of such an exercise. But we reject the recommendation to ask the Productivity Commission to undertake a full examination of that. By and large, we do not agree with the majority recommendations. We have issued a minority report, which I believe sums up the feelings of government senators very well. We can only perhaps be sorry in a way that this inquiry went over so much ground that had been trawled over by previous inquiries. There is not a lot of merit, I fancy, in going over and over these questions when the government is actively considering what it will do with the telecommunications regime.

Once Telstra is completely privatised it has the potential to become the ‘gorilla’ in the marketplace. This could have a range of adverse implications for consumers, residential and commercial.
In the face of the evidence revealed in this report the fact that the government’s only priority in telecommunications remains forcing through the sale of Telstra shows just how out of touch this government is.
In the context of the present debate over the privatisation of Telstra, the evidence in the report being tabled today is a timely reminder for those who will be voting on the sale about the issues that really matter. Those people who purport to represent the interests of Australians in rural and regional areas should take note of the evidence in this report when considering the sale of Telstra. They should ask themselves: if services are so bad in rural and regional Australia that people are being forced off the land and into the cities, how bad will they get once Telstra is privatised?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,4,2,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I too would like to comment on this report upon its tabling in the Senate today. Like Senator Conroy, I believe that it sends a very clear message to government senators and other senators about the dire consequences that will follow if Telstra is to be fully privatised. As we have heard, the evidence from one end of the country to the other describes the pitiful state of telecommunications services. The inquiry looked at the regulatory environment that the minister has been so inclined to mention in recent times in the context of this debate, saying that the regulatory environment will be there regardless of who owns Telstra. As a result of this inquiry we now know that the regulatory environment in telecommunications is not serving the people of rural and regional Australia very well at all, despite all the government’s rhetoric. And we know, as a result of the evidence collected in the inquiry, that if the government proceeds with privatisation the position will become worse.
That exposes as completely false the minister’s rhetoric that the regulations will be put in place regardless of who owns Telstra. The evidence says otherwise. The evidence says that we are in a bad state now, even with the residual public ownership, as far as services in the bush go—and more work needs to be done there—but it will become far worse if such a dominant, arrogant carrier such as Telstra is unleashed in a fully privatised manner. We need to look no further than the new CEO’s recent claim that Telstra will stay in the bush. Was there any question of it not servicing rural and regional Australia? That should stir the suspicions of National Party senators and of all those who live in rural and regional areas of Australia. Was there ever a question about Telstra servicing those areas? I would have thought not, but that question is now on the table. In many respects we all represent rural Australia. I have many constituents in the ACT—people tend to think of Canberra as a bit of a city state—on the outer metropolitan fringe and in rural areas who are directly impacted upon by Telstra’s failings in this area.
I would like to turn to our detailed investigations of that regulatory environment, particularly relating to anticompetitive behaviour and access to the existing regime. Both of those areas are crucial for the successful operation and delivery of services, again particularly in rural and regional Australia. The conclusion of the committee, based on the evidence, states:
The weaknesses of the current regulatory regime lie in the ability of Telstra to mask where the delineation between its wholesale and retail prices occur; the ACCC’s limited capacity to prove anti-competitive conduct—
and the reluctance of many witnesses to provide the ACCC with evidence for prosecution—
and ultimately the fact that the ACCC’s power to impose only financial penalties is not an adequate deterrent to anti-competitive behaviour. Consequently Part XIB of the TPA does not appear to provide the regulator, the industry or the wider community with confidence in the anti-competitive regime.
That conclusion speaks for itself. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-08-10,"—I move:
That the committee does not insist on the Senate amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-08-10,"—Labor are disappointed that the government has decided to use its numbers to overturn important amendments to the Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005 that were made in this chamber only a few weeks ago. Labor will now reluctantly be supporting this bill, as amended, because we see it as vital that the detainees be housed in a shore based facility, rather than on their boats in Darwin Harbour.
It has taken the government too long to get to this point. In additional estimates hearings in February the minister told the committee that the facility would be up and running by August. Then in budget estimates he said that it was his goal to get it operational by the end of the year. Frankly, any responsibility for delays lies fairly and squarely at the feet of the government and the minister, and certainly not at the feet of the public accounts committee, the Labor Party or anyone else that the minister has tried to blame for his failure to get this project completed in a timely fashion.
The rationale behind Labor’s amendments to this bill was canvassed at some length at earlier stages of debate on this bill. It became clear during the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee’s inquiry into this bill that senators from both sides of this chamber have real concerns with aspects of this piece of legislation. Those concerns were reflected in the committee report and were reinforced, I might say, by the additional comments made by Labor members of that committee.
I am particularly disappointed that the government has decided to reject Labor’s amendment relating to who may be appointed to undertake fisheries detention tasks. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, Labor has serious concerns about the provision in the bill that permits the minister to engage private contractors to perform fisheries detention tasks and those that further permit the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to authorise private contractors to perform critical screening, searching, identification and detention functions. The amendments proposed by Labor dealt with those concerns by removing the provisions that allow for the engagement of private contractors.
Recent revelations about the performance of private contractors in running migration detention facilities and especially in exercising power over detained people have added weight to Labor’s view that only federal, state or territory public employees should be engaged in this task. For example, the case of the five immigration detainees who were denied adequate food, fluids, rest, exercise and even toilet facilities during a very long drive in a van while being transferred from Maribyrnong to Baxter detention centre raised real questions about the appropriateness of giving detention powers to private contractors.
In the committee inquiry into this legislation we heard that there was no certainty as to who the contractor might be and therefore no certainty as to the ethics required of or observed by those contractors in the future, were there to be a change from what was thought might be the outcome of the tender process for such a contract. We have not resiled at all from our concerns about the role of private contractors in this important activity, bearing in mind that Australia has obligations to deal properly with and observe the rights of all persons, be they citizens or not, in being detained and in being transported.
In saying that, let me say that we do welcome the decision of the government to adopt Labor’s amendments relating to the training of officers. Labor senators on the committee shared government senators’ concerns about the failure of the bill to provide for minimum staff training. The effect of Labor’s amendment is to ensure that officers carrying out functions under this legislation are adequately trained for the task by undertaking a training program set out in a disallowable instrument. I am assuming that the government will provide some real hurdles in such a training program so that there is a real training outcome rather than some mickey mouse outcome. I give the government and the department credit for what I believe will be an intent to construct such outcomes, but we wait and see. Because it is a disallowable instrument, the parliament will be able to ensure that the training program provides officers with the skills and knowledge that they need. Labor will be watching that closely and will be drawing to the attention of the parliament and the public any perceived deficiencies in such a scheme.
There is a decision by the government to adopt the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats and supported by Labor to ensure that the detainees are informed of their right to have access to legal advice and assistance. It was regrettable that we had to move such an amendment. I welcome the decision of the government to concur with the views of Labor and the Democrats on this issue. It is a fundamental issue of basic human and legal rights. We were disappointed that this matter was not properly provided for in the original legislation. We are pleased that the government has seen fit to recognise the validity of the concerns which were raised. This is one of the matters which leads us to the view, along with the view that we prefer that detainees be kept in an onshore facility rather than detained on their boats in Darwin Harbour, that this legislation should now be supported by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—As the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation and the shadow minister would know, the Democrats did not support the Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005 in the first place, for reasons I went into at great length when we debated it back in June, so I will not repeat those arguments now. The simple fact is that, whilst the principle of harmonising the legal and administrative regimes surrounding detention of illegal fishers with the regime surrounding migration detainees has some sense, the concept of harmonising this with a migration regime that has clearly been shown to be dysfunctional is one that we think is unwise. We think that until the migration detention regime is dramatically improved we should not be harmonising it with anything. However, our view is a minority one.
The question before the chamber today is whether or not the Senate should insist on the amendments to this bill. The government has not accepted the amendments that were made by the Senate—the Labor Party amendments regarding the contracting out of detention arrangements for people in fisheries detention. As I said at the time, there are two competing principles there. We do not support and have never supported contracting out of the detention arrangements. More and more has come to light in recent times about major problems with the private operators who manage our immigration detention regimes. Indeed, a couple of very serious proven or accepted allegations have come to light since we last debated this bill concerning major mistreatment of detainees by GSL, the company that operates the mainland detention centres in Australia. So the principle of contracting out to companies like that is clearly not a good one, and that is why the Democrats have never supported it. But of course this bill does not go to that; this bill goes to fisheries detention.
The competing principle is the administrative effectiveness of having the same group of people being able to manage both areas when there is such an overlap. I can see the competing arguments there. The government is saying that if we have private operators managing immigration detention centres it does not make any logical sense to not have them also being able to manage fisheries detention. Our view is that the principle is flawed, regardless. We welcome the position of the Labor Party of not supporting contracting out and welcome the opportunity to continue to push for that arrangement to be removed from immigration detention.
I should say, in making the point, that this is not to suggest that there were not problems with the management of immigration detention when it was done by public officers. But the fact is that, when those problems occur, they are much more able to be identified and investigated because the processes are much more transparent than current arrangements. It is far more difficult to establish the veracity of allegations if there are failures by private contractors running immigration detention centres than it is if there are failures by public officials. It is a transparency issue as much as it is a suggestion that the public sector will always do it better than the private sector. Those are wider issues. The simple question is whether or not these amendments should be insisted on. The Democrats supported them at the time, of course, and the competing principles are still the same now as they were then. Given the circumstances, we do not see any reason to modify our view.
I do note—and indeed welcome—the government’s decision to accept the Senate amendment that I moved in relation to the legal advice available to fisheries detainees. This is something that the government opposed in this chamber at the time. Senator Ian Macdonald opposed it. I urged him at the time to listen to reason and not just instinctively oppose whatever we put forward. Clearly, after the fact, the government have thought about it, exercised some reason and accepted the amendment—even when, with the numbers the way they are now, they are not obliged to do so. I acknowledge and thank them for that. The minister in the other place, Minister McGauran, said:
The original bill had ... ensured that all detainees had the right to request access to reasonable facilities for obtaining legal advice.
The Democrats’ concern is that it should not be a matter of people being able to request access; they should be given the information about their legal rights, rather than our just sitting back and waiting to see whether or not they actually know to ask for it. I am pleased that the government has acknowledged that principle, although the rationale given by the minister in the other place was that in practice the Australian Fisheries Management Authority already informs all fisheries detainees in their own language of this right upon their arrival in Australia. Therefore, the government accepts the Democrat amendment, as it is evident that the existing practice will satisfy the legislative requirement. I am pleased about that—I am pleased that it is the existing practice and I am pleased that it is still in the law so that the existing practice cannot change.
What I am still displeased about is not anything the current minister can do anything about, and that is that this is not the situation for immigration detainees. The same principle should apply. Immigration detainees—people who arrive here and are put into immigration detention or, indeed, people who are in their community and then are taken into immigration detention—should be, as a matter of course, informed of their legal rights. They should not be in a situation where they have to ask for information to be made available to them. That change was specifically made by this government with the support of the Labor Party back in about 1998, with the specific aim of making it more difficult for immigration detainees to get access to legal advice about their rights.
I make the point that, seven years on, the record shows that that has not had the effect the government desired. I will make this point a bit more in the debate on another bill that will be before the Senate shortly. The effect has basically been that people’s claims were not properly put in place in the first place and, in many cases, it has simply meant that people have been in detention for a lot longer, at a much larger public cost and with much more suffering for them. There have been appeals right through to the courts for people who have then established that due process was not followed. They have gone back and finally put in a proper claim, which they could have done in the first place, with decent legal advice, to get the same eventual outcome.
So it is actually counterproductive—whatever your rationale is—to deny people information regarding their legal rights. We should not be steering people away from their legal rights or see them as a negative. They are genuinely there to protect not just the people who have a legal right but the community and to ensure that the process works effectively. When people do not have legal rights and when the legal rights situation is unable to be addressed by the law in a positive way, it helps to let them know that at the start—that they will not be able to stay, that they will not be able to do this or that and that certain other things will happen, and that that is how the law operates. They should be told all that at the start—the bad and the good. It helps everybody, not least the taxpayer and the people who deal with immigration detention.
I welcome the government’s acceptance of that amendment. I hope that it is a sign—even though it is handled by a different portfolio—that this practice, in principle, might be reapplied to the Migration Act where it is so sorely needed. With those words, I nonetheless note the government’s acceptance of the Democrat amendment that was passed by the Senate. In some ways it is a minor amendment, but it is an important one. I also welcome, as was stated, that it is an existing practice of the Fisheries Management Authority. Overall, it is a good thing that there will be clear opportunities for fisheries detainees to be housed on land rather than in boats. That matter has certainly been of concern to not just many people in Australia—and of course the people who are detained—but also the Indonesian government. It was raised fleetingly with me when I was in Indonesia a couple of months ago, so I am pleased that, via a circuitous process and for different motivations and reasons, we will get to that circumstance. That is a small step forward. It does not address some of the systemic problems with migration, but it will at least bring about an improvement in the physical conditions for fisheries detainees.",SENATE,<title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-08-10,"—I thank the two previous speakers for their contribution, and I am pleased that it seems this bill will at last be passed and come into law. It is part of the Howard government’s determination to properly protect our borders, be it against people smugglers, for quarantine purposes or against illegal fishing in Australian waters. The Howard government have a very strong record in combating illegal fishing and we have made very significant inroads into illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean, as I think all senators will accept. We are grappling with a real problem in the north of Australia, which has been made more difficult by the fact that previous legislation dealing with illegal fishing in the Torres Strait did not align with the immigration acts and did not allow for the seamless transition between fisheries and immigration detention that is needed to properly protect our fisheries.
Our government are determined to do everything that we can to enhance arrangements and give powers to our officers and officials to do their duties in the best possible way, and that is what the Border Protection Legislation Amendment (Deterrence of Illegal Foreign Fishing) Bill 2005 is all about. I was rather disappointed that the Democrats and the Labor Party joined together in, I think, May or June to prevent the bill being passed then, even though they knew at the time that the government would have a majority in August and, regardless, it would then be approved. The delaying tactic has disrupted the process of our officials in trying to perfect that seamless transition between Fisheries and Immigration and also in trying to bring together those consistencies between the Torres Strait Fisheries Act and the Fisheries Management Act and, where appropriate, the relevant migration acts.
Last time the government accepted the amendment regarding training, and we did that very happily. It was pointed out by the Senate committee. The practice already occurred but, in the spirit of goodwill and given the fact that we will always listen to sensible amendments, we agreed to do that. We had the same view about the requirement to give advice but, as those senators who partook in the debate might recall, we debated for some time the amendment regarding training and had agreed to it quite happily. We then went on to debate the issue of not allowing independent contractors to be fisheries officers or immigration officers.
At one stage I recall saying that I had almost convinced Senator Bartlett that he should have agreed but, as it turned out, it became clear that the major amendment which the government could not accept would be insisted upon by the Labor Party and the Democrats. So at that point it became pointless to deal with other amendments, knowing full well, as I did, that the matter would come back to the Senate after the winter recess. As I said, notwithstanding the fact that we were always happy to accept the amendment regarding the requirement of advising that legal advice was available, we did not deal with it at the time because it was quite clear it would come back.
Again, we happily accept that amendment of the Democrats, even though, as Senator Bartlett has quite rightly raised, we do not need to at the moment. The government have a majority in the Senate, but I think this is a demonstration of the fact that the government will always use the majority we have been fortunate and privileged to have been given by the Australian people in a sensible and wise way.
This amendment deals with a task that my officers already undertake, but the Democrats and the Labor Party required it to be in the legislation. We are happy enough to do that because, as I said, it is something that occurs as a matter of course. We will always accept sensible amendments from opposition parties. I think it clearly demonstrates that the government will use its majority in the Senate in a very sound and moderate way and in a way that enhances the running of the parliament and, hopefully, will lead to a better government for the people of Australia. I thank senators for their contribution and urge that the bill now proceed with the two principal amendments that have been recommended so that we can get on with our business of properly protecting and defending Australian fisheries everywhere but, particularly in this instance, in the north of Australia.",SENATE,<title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I only rise on this matter to take issue with the minister’s assertion that the delay in the passage of this legislation prevented officers from doing any preparatory work on this matter. If one looks at the Hansard, one will see that the minister admonished Labor and the Democrats for pursuing an amendment on the basis that we should have and would have known that the amendment would come back here in August because the government did not agree with it and it would be overturned. If that is something we should have known, then clearly the minister and his department knew that the government intended to bring the matter back in August and, with the government’s numbers in the Senate, would have been able to enforce its view. Therefore, I see it as a particularly difficult point for the minister to make, to suggest that somehow, because we then insisted on the amendment, it prevented officers from doing the preparatory work which might be needed on contractual material to allow these facilities, which are not yet ready for occupation, to be ready at the end of the year. I have never assumed that the capacity of the minister’s department is so lacking that it could not have done the preparatory work in any case, and I am almost sure that they have done a fair bit of it. I could go through the process of asking the minister what work has been done. Perhaps I will in a written form. I will think about that. However, I do think that it is somewhat gilding the lily to suggest that this process has been an impediment to the department doing its work.
I will refrain from entering into the debate about what the government acceding to a very sensible amendment means in this process. I think the reality was pointed out by Senator Bartlett. Although the officers may now have a practice of advising detainees of their rights, that is not a right until it is contained in legislation, and, given that there is the propensity under this legislation for work to be contracted out and for others to do it, we much prefer that that obligation continues, whoever is doing the work. So we think that it is very important that the right be enshrined in legislation. I do not propose to hold this legislation up by further debating the matter, but we did say that we were concerned about the appropriateness of the current detention regime. It has taken some time to get to this point. We are two and a bit months down the track from when the matter was last debated. It will clearly be passed today.",SENATE,<title>BORDER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DETERRENCE OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN FISHING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,5,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2005-08-10,"—I thank Senator O’Brien for that. His understanding of the facts and of what might happen are different to mine, but it is not a point to debate now. I am pleased that we will be able to move on with the legislative backing we need to do what needs to be done to properly protect Australia’s borders and fisheries.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I rise to speak on the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. This legislative package before the Senate today represents the dismantling of Australia’s national vocational education and training system—a system established by Labor over a decade ago. Labor’s national training system was built on a shared belief in cooperative federalism, where meeting Australia’s skills needs came before petty politicking. However, under this government those principles have been swept aside by an out-of-touch executive government which is intent on imposing its extreme agenda on all those who come before it.
After nine long years of the Howard government, Commonwealth-state relations have been reduced to political grandstanding and cheap point scoring. Unconcerned by policy outcomes, this government’s motivation seems to be about increasing their control and power but without responsibility and accountability. This attitude is nowhere better typified than in the areas of education and training. The new vocational education and training arrangements outlined in the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill redefine the Commonwealth-state relationship. The bill contains unprecedented legislative prescription over how state and territory governments must organise their vocational education and training system. Unlike the previous ANTA agreements, which were agreements in the true sense of the word—where people, institutions and different levels of government actually agreed—the new skilling Australia’s work force funding arrangements force compliance with little consultation, but when issues of maintaining quality or consistency arise with our vocational education and training system the Howard government points the finger and offers no solutions.
The statutory conditions detailed in division 2 of the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill are breathtaking in the breadth of their scope and in the level of minute operational detail they seek to enforce. The funding appropriated by section 40 of this bill to skill Australia until the end of 2008 is manifestly inadequate. There is no significant new general growth funding. Increases on current levels are mostly redirected and reallocated funds, save for a small number of targeted places under the so-called Welfare To Work program announced in the last budget. As I have said previously, both in this place and publicly, the number of places that this government has chosen to allocate to those persons who will now be required to look for work under their welfare changes is manifestly inadequate.
The Howard government should be concerned about the bigger picture of using increased investment to boost skill levels to drive further productivity gains, not whether TAFE institutions are encouraging or discouraging union membership amongst employees. As in so many other areas of policy, we see a government distracted from the task of national leadership and ensuring that we lock in the drivers of future productivity growth in this country, leaving Australia unprepared because of its obsession with its narrow and extreme ideological crusade.
Sadly, the Howard government’s new Senate majority will not be used to ensure we have a strong economy creating wealth and security; instead they are obsessed with ideological pursuits and settling old scores. They are ideological agendas that bear no relation to the policy outcomes they purport to pursue. They are extreme agendas that are disconnected from what should be the government’s number one goal—training Australians and solving the nation’s skills crisis.
In the latest survey of monetary policy the Reserve Bank once again highlighted the risk posed by our worsening skills crisis. This is a crisis that has developed under this government; in fact we say it has been created by this government. Yet this government still refuses to acknowledge its magnitude. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education is unable to admit the severity of Australia’s skills crisis. During debate on this bill in the House he maintained that there is limited evidence of economy wide skills shortages, yet we have had everyone from the Reserve Bank to the OECD shouting warnings.
New figures show that the Howard government has simply dropped the ball when it comes to training Australians. During 2004 major indicators of skills development were in decline. Figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show the number of people who undertook vocational education and training in 2004 was 1.6 million, down from 1.72 million people in 2003. This is a drop of 122,000 people. This is at a time when we are experiencing demonstrable skills shortages. The NCVER figures show the number of students fell by 7.1 per cent in 2004 compared to 2003, while the total number of hours of teaching delivery also fell by 2.6 per cent. This is the first decline in both of these measures of training activity in more than a decade. Over the same period other figures from the NCVER show a 4 per cent drop in the number of Australians in apprenticeships and traineeships.
These are damning statistics and they highlight this government’s failure. While our national skills base drops this government has decided to discard our national training system. This is a breathtaking triumph of ideology over good public policy. Instead of national leadership at a time of skills crisis—when we need to lock in the future productivity growth of this country, increase our human capital, invest in our people and train Australians—we have an extreme agenda focused on things such as AWAs.
The bills before the Senate dismantle the cooperative tripartite national system established by Labor in 1992 under the auspices of the Australian National Training Authority. The Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 abolishes ANTA and repeals the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act. The opposition senators’ report from the recent Senate inquiry into these bills emphasises the contrast between the creative policy processes which preceded ANTA and led to its creation, and the complete absence of any policy debate associated with the government’s decision to abolish ANTA and virtually stop real growth funding for the TAFE sector. The government’s modus operandi is to abolish first and hope for solutions later. ANTA’s demise was affected not by consideration, evaluation or review, but by one line on page four of a prime ministerial press release announcing the fourth Howard ministry. With one prime ministerial decree more than a decade’s worth of cooperative federalism and a tripartite national training system have disappeared into the memory hole.
Before this repeal legislation had even come before the Senate, the functions of ANTA had already been transferred to DEST, staff moved across and ANTA’s website shut down. All this action has been on the basis of a prime ministerial press release, pre-empting the Senate’s consideration of this repeal legislation. It appears that in this new order, in this new Howard government era of Senate control, the Prime Minister can now shut down a statutory authority without first securing the concurrence of parliament by means of passage of the legislation he ostensibly requires to do so. What an outstanding example of the arrogance and contempt with which the Howard government treats this parliament, and in particular this chamber.
Labor believe that our national training system should be supported by a strong, independent, tripartite body able to provide broadly based advice to the entire sector. Training our current and future work force should be a partnership between all involved: government, industry and workers. Given the government is not willing to honour these principles in the new system it proposes, Labor will oppose the bill to repeal ANTA and its associated national arrangements.
The Howard government’s record on funding of vocational education and training is shameful. After coming to office in 1996 it made savage cuts to the VET system and our current skills crisis is a direct result of its cutbacks. In 1996 and 1997, the Howard and Costello budgets reduced VET grants, abolished real growth funding and reduced training expenditure by $240 million. In the 1997-98 budget the government abolished a stand alone national skill shortage strategy. With the benefit of the hindsight of history, how short-sighted a decision was that? In 1998 the ‘growth through efficiencies’ policy effectively froze Commonwealth VET funding resulting in a loss of growth funding estimated at around $377 million over the period from 1998 to 2000. The current government’s VET funding offer to the states and territories for the next four years, appropriated by this bill, contains no significant new money.
Labor cannot support the so-called Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill when it does not even provide enough funding to meet Australia’s skill needs. This was summed up by the ACTU in its submission to the Senate in the inquiry. It said that the level of funding ‘demonstrates a disregard for the need to address skills shortages by providing for additional training places within TAFEs and the demand of business for more skilled workers.’ Yet again, this bill does not address the growing unmet demand for TAFE places. It does not provide the additional places in the traditional trades required to meet industry’s skills needs. It does not do enough, and Labor do not support it. We call on the government to properly fund vocational education and training in this nation and we call on the government to train more Australians.
Section 12 of the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill contains one provision in particular that Labor cannot support. Paragraph (1)(b) forces TAFE colleges to offer Australian workplace agreements. Labor believes that the government’s ideological industrial relations crusade has no place in legislation about funding vocational education and training. It is extraordinary that this government, who say they are about freedom of association and that they are going to introduce legislation in this parliament to protect the rights of students to not have to participate in the student services fee, are now saying to the TAFE sector, the vocational education sector, in this country, ‘We’re going to withhold money from you unless you make people go onto Australian workplace agreements.’ Where is the freedom of choice in that?

Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—You were the one, Senator Macdonald, who stood up for freedom of choice and what you are doing here is holding a gun to their head. You are saying—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I remind you to address your remarks through the chair, Senator Wong.
—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, the government are saying, ‘We will only pay the money if you do the right thing by us; if you implement our radical industrial relations agenda.’ It is an appalling thing to be imposing on our TAFE system. As the Australian Education Union noted in their submission to the recent Senate inquiry:
The Bill seeks to inhibit the right of education workers and state and territory governments to reach industrial agreements which best suit the culture and situation of each state or territory system. Similarly, where industrial bargaining has been devolved within a state TAFE system to an institutional level, the legislation would inhibit the right of those institutions to negotiate terms and conditions which best suit the needs and interests of their particular circumstances.
I thought that was exactly what the government’s industrial relations agenda was supposed to be about—actually giving freedom to employers and employees to negotiate conditions at the workplace. But apparently that is not the case in TAFEs. In the case of TAFEs, the government say, ‘We will withhold money unless you put people on AWAs.’ I will be moving an amendment to delete this requirement. Should this amendment be unsuccessful and not have the support of the chamber, Labor will oppose this legislation.
Instead of attempting to recast the VET system in its own image, the government should launch an immediate investigation into its sham New Apprenticeships scheme. The results of a recent survey into outcomes from the New Apprenticeships scheme were denied to this chamber following a return to order request. The government was willing to show the Senate the survey questions asked but not the answers received. It took a freedom of information request by the opposition and repeated media inquiries for the government to sit up and take notice and finally reveal the survey’s damming conclusions. The survey revealed that 25 per cent of people who completed a New Apprenticeship did not receive any training at TAFE or a similar institution, or from an external trainer who came into the workplace. The research also reveals that 15 per cent of people who have completed a New Apprenticeship are still looking for work. It also found that 20 per cent of people who do not complete the New Apprenticeship say it is because they are not happy with their training. These results are unacceptable.
Instead of dismantling the national training system, the government needs to admit that its policy decisions with respect to the New Apprenticeships scheme have undermined quality training in this country. When it should be addressing Australia’s skills crisis, the Howard government is being distracted by its own ideological obsessions. There is a real danger that the industrial relations agenda the government is blindly pursuing could have a significant detrimental impact on ensuring we train enough young Australians. Undermining collective bargaining will place our most vulnerable workers most at risk. Young apprentices are in an unenviable bargaining position. Most are inexperienced and unsure of their rights, let alone aware of industry and community standards. Many are in small businesses without significant collective workplace support, especially from more experienced non-managerial older workers who can act as mentors.
If this government succeeds in cutting apprentices’ conditions, apprenticeships will become less appealing to young people. The Howard government’s extreme and divisive industrial relations changes threaten apprentices’ penalty rates, tool allowances, overtime and basic standards and conditions. Under the proposed changes, if apprentices work in a business with fewer than 100 people, they will have no protection against unfair dismissal and they will have no job security. We could actually see fewer young people doing an apprenticeship if their working conditions are stripped away by this government’s ideological crusade. We are already seeing individual contracts drive down wages and conditions for apprentices.
How are we to attract younger Australians into training by offering a first-year apprentice rate of as little as $6.90 per hour? This is a rate currently offered in an AWA to a first-year hospitality apprentice in Perth. Worse than being an appalling low hourly figure, it is an all-up rate. It is a rate that is supposed to include a component for sick pay, public holiday pay, weekend and late penalty pay and split-shift allowance. So that is $6.90 an hour, with no penalty rates, working 40 hours a week. It is hardly an incentive to train, particularly at a time when we are experiencing a skills shortage. It is little wonder low wages consistently emerge as a significant deterrent to young people taking on an apprenticeship. Low wages are also a considerable factor contributing to the high dropout rate. We should be paying our young apprentices more, not less.
Furthermore, this week we have seen reports that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry want to make apprentices easier to sack. In a secret report commissioned by the Department of Education, Science and Training, detailed in the Financial Review, the ACCI wrote that businesses should not be forced to retain an apprentice once they have finished their qualification. Undermining job security, another by-product of the government’s proposed IR changes and central to this secret ACCI report, would have the effect of reducing the number of apprentices and exacerbating our already deep skills shortages.
Instead of funding more TAFE places with these bills, the Howard government is seeking more control over the minute operational detail of TAFE management. Instead of encouraging more young people into apprenticeships, the Howard government is driving down apprentices’ wages and threatening their job security. The Howard government’s failure underscores the need for urgent action to address our worsening skills crisis to ensure the nation’s future economic prosperity.
Labor believes that the government must reach a new accord with the states and territories on vocational education and training policy. We need a new national framework involving representatives of employers and employees, designed to meet the skills needs of the Australian economy and to ensure that Australians in training have high-quality transferable skills. Most importantly, fundamentally and basically, Labor demands that the Howard government increase the funding available through the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 to meet Australia’s serious skills shortages.
There are around two million Australians looking for work or wanting more work. This includes 600,000 part-time workers who would like more work than they have. If you look at the ABS statistics on the labour underutilisation rate you will see that, when asked, a significant number of respondents identified a lack of appropriate skills as a factor in their inability to find work or find more work. Yet, at this time, what do we see? We see a government obsessed with an ideological crusade in the area of industrial relations and demanding that AWAs be the norm within our TAFE sector. The two million Australians looking for work or wanting more work should be upskilled and reskilled to meet the needs of our economy. Instead of relying on an imported skills quick fix, Labor believes in training Australians first and training more Australians now.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,7,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-08-10,"—The Greens do not support the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 because we support TAFE. We support the excellent public vocational education and training sector. We support the great work that TAFE colleges and TAFE staff do, and we want to see that work recognised and appropriately resourced. This legislation does not support TAFE. In fact, it does quite the opposite. This legislation is a cruel attack on TAFE. It is an attack on the concept of a universal public vocational education and training provider. It is an attack on the states’ right and ability to manage the public vocational education and training system. Finally, it is an attack on the working conditions of tens of thousands of workers in TAFE colleges across the country.
If the Commonwealth government were generally motivated to ensure that Australians could access the best vocational education and training then the first thing that they would do would be to ensure the viability of the public TAFE system. The public expects this, because TAFE colleges are widely recognised as cornerstones of our community. A huge proportion of Australians have benefited from education at a TAFE college. There are currently 1.7 million Australians enrolled in TAFE and millions more who are ex-TAFE students. These people well understand and appreciate the accessibility and affordability, comprehensiveness and quality of the system.
When I worked as a youth worker I saw young people getting their second chance at education. They had not finished their schooling, and they were thrilled to be accepted into the local TAFE at Granville to have the opportunity to compete their schooling there. Within my own family there are people who have needed to retrain as a result of workplace injuries, and they have been able to turn to TAFE to get that retraining opportunity for themselves. I have also seen people, again within my own family, who have retired from previous employment and have been able to enrol in TAFE courses that have provided real opportunities for them in their retirement.
Those of us with a more intimate knowledge of the TAFE system from a public policy point of view share this understanding of the importance of TAFE and add to this an understanding of TAFE’s enviable reputation when compared to vocational education and training systems overseas. In 2004 the TAFE sector received an over 80 per cent satisfaction rating from employers and an over 85 per cent satisfaction rating from students in a survey that was conducted by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. In completion and employment rates, the TAFE sector continues to come up with the goods, with over 75 per cent of students finding work on graduation and a further 11 per cent going on to further training. Twenty per cent of those graduates are in their first full-time job after training in TAFE and 13 per cent are in work after having previously been unemployed.
The public might also expect the federal government to be championing a major investment in the TAFE system, given its well-publicised views on the skills shortage that Australia faces. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education said in his speech on the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005:
... Australian businesses estimate that the most significant challenge to ongoing economic growth is the need for more skilled workers to meet demand.
He went on to say:
... there are indications that some parts of the labour market are moving towards full capacity.
Given that TAFE trains the overwhelming majority of vocational education and training graduates, including a significant proportion of apprentices, you would forgive Joanne Public for assuming that the Commonwealth would be preparing to back TAFEs to rise to the challenge of the skills shortage. But of course they would be wrong, very wrong.
The millions who understand the benefit of TAFE will be appalled to find that what the federal government are in fact doing is deliberately undermining the viability of the TAFE system. They are undermining it by threatening to withdraw a third of its funding, attacking the conditions of its staff and legislating to encourage further decreases in public funding into the future. This bill is quite breathtaking in its unabashed arrogance. This is supposed to be a bill about education, but when you look through the provisions of the legislation it is pretty hard to find many references to education. Instead, we see what is sadly becoming familiar to legislators in this place—that is, a list of threats and inducements tied to a wholly unrelated field of government policy: industrial relations.
This bill is a ransom note issued to the states listing a set of demands. The dynamic at play is one of: submit to our demands or the funding gets it! It seems the government is prepared to decimate the TAFE college system by withholding $4.4 billion in funding if the states and the colleges do not agree to implement the government’s simplistic and ideological industrial relations agenda.
The first major demand on this ransom note is about user choice. This is something that is not new to the Commonwealth dealings with the TAFE sector, and it is continued in this legislation. The coalition government is demanding maximum choice for employers and new apprentices. I have spoken in the chamber before about the flawed nature of the user choice and the user pays slogan, which the government passes off as public policy, but here I just want to note what the committee report on this bill said:
When the references committee looked at the VET system in 2000, it became clear that apprentices and trainees were not able to exercise their market power to any extent. They had insufficient information to make an informed choice. Employer choice, rather than a trainee’s choice, most often prevailed.
The second demand in this ransom note is about attacking organised labour in TAFEs. The bill says that in order for TAFEs to get the money that they need to survive, staff must be offered Australian workplace agreements, staff must have underperformance managed and performance pay must be introduced. This demand is of course part of the broader government agenda on industrial relations that is about reducing the capacity of working people to organise collectively for their own benefit and the benefit of society, to instead further empower employers to exploit staff to the greatest extent possible. The government’s industrial relations changes make exploitation of workers and their families in this country easier.
This government believes that somehow Australians will be better off if employers can undermine working conditions, getting more work for less pay and play staff off against each other in a desperate race to the bottom. The most charitable view that we can take about all this is that the government genuinely believes that this dog-eat-dog free-for-all will magically make society freer, wealthier and happier when individual workers get richer as a result of one-on-one bargaining with employers. The less charitable view that we can take is that the government supports this ridiculous view because it suits the interests of employers, owners and investors who want to maximise profits, irrespective of the effect that this has on the quality of life of their employees. Just because TAFE colleges are not profit-making businesses does not mean that the government does not want to fit them into its simplistic economic plan. This bill seeks to make TAFEs fit into the government’s plan.
The next major demand on this ransom note is that TAFEs must be allowed to retain and increase revenue from industry and sponsorship, and states must provide capacity for TAFE institutions to develop entrepreneurial and commercially oriented business plans. The government clearly wants to see TAFE colleges focusing more on businesses rather than upholding their key role as places of public learning.
What is perhaps most shocking about that last clause is what has been removed from the latest form of the legislation. In an earlier version of the bill we are debating today, after the words ‘commercially oriented business plans’, the legislation had said ‘that will enable government funding to be reduced’. I will repeat that: in the original version of this bill the government was candid enough to include the requirement that commercial activities be fostered in TAFEs in order to ‘enable government funding to be reduced’. These words were removed because they were a drafting error, according to the government. It seems to me that the error was more one of honesty that one of fact. If anyone were in any doubt as to the intentions of this government for our fabulous public TAFE colleges then this drafting error should make it clear: they want TAFEs privatised, the staff deunionised, the courses dumbed down and the government price tag slashed.
The Greens are not surprised by the content of this bill. We have become familiar with the approach of this government and this minister which has cynically undermined the foundations of our public education system since 1996. The first pattern, for those who have not noticed it, is this: slash funding, deny growth funds, blame the states for lower funding and poor management and, after a few years of this, when the pressure on the system starts to bite and the resistance is low, force through a plan of deregulation, privatisation and antiunion measures—all this in exchange for access to desperately needed funds. This has been the approach of this government to public schooling and public universities and now to the TAFE sector. This strategy drives a bus through the cooperative federal relations which in the vocational education and training sector have been so successful in delivering quality education and training outcomes for both students and employers. Remember the 80 per cent satisfaction rating from employers and the 85 per cent satisfaction rating from students.
The complementary bill that we are dealing with today abolishes the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, which, as the committee report into this bill notes, a Senate references committee, with a coalition majority, that reviewed the establishment of ANTA 10 years ago represented it in their report as a good working example of cooperative federalism. But this minister is not interested in cooperative federalism and instead continues to use the Commonwealth’s funding powers to centralise control of education and force non-education related ideology onto the sector.
The Greens utterly reject this approach. We recognise the massive benefits that accrue to societies that have well-funded and accessible universal public education systems that encourage high-quality teaching and research. The Greens feel the urgent need to retain and reward the thousands of devoted and gifted staff that make our TAFE systems tick and to turn around the demoralising effects of the 10 years of underfunding and undermining that the Commonwealth and to a lesser extent the states have subjected TAFEs to. That is why the Greens oppose this bill and I now move the following second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
         “but the Senate:
              (a)    Condemns the Government for introducing legislation that would undermine the quality of public provision of vocational education and training by:
                    (i)    failing to recognise and reward the good will of Australia’s TAFE teachers and support staff and their commitment to the best interests of their students and the community;
                   (ii)    attempting to introduce a climate of fear and greed into TAFE colleges, based on both punitive industrial relations arrangements and the entirely impractical requirement for performance-based pay;
                  (iii)    compromising the ability of TAFE teachers to work collaboratively by attempting to set them in competition with each other;
                  (iv)    using TAFE as a beachhead in their assault on Australia’s union movement;
                   (v)    using TAFE as a pawn in their attempt to centralise decision making in Canberra and undermine the balance of power between the states and the commonwealth;
                  (vi)    substituting financial blackmail of the states for proper negotiation with all interested parties and consensus building;
                 (vii)    playing out an agenda of revenge against the Australian Education Union and the NSW Teachers Federation for their well-founded criticisms of the Howard government’s failure to adequately fund public provision of vocational education and training; and
                (viii)    further progressing their vision of a privatised vocational education and training sector, despite the massive failure of existing funding of private providers to effectively contribute to quality outcomes.
              (b)    calls on the Government to withdraw this Bill because it is fundamentally flawed and will fail to address Australia’s growing skills shortage, and instead to:
                    (i)    develop arrangements for negotiation between the States, the Commonwealth and TAFE teachers and their union on funding of vocational education and training and on the coordination of policy setting in this sector;
                   (ii)    recognise the current and potential future role that TAFE colleges and TAFE teachers and support staff play in wealth creation and in building Australia’s cultural, social and democratic institutions;
                  (iii)    recognise that the Commonwealth government should play a key role in the funding of public provision of vocational education and training by restoring its per student funding of TAFE to 1996 levels in real terms and providing funding increases to match the growth in demand for vocational education and training over that period and for the next planning period; and
                  (iv)    end the funding of private providers that compete with TAFE.”
The Greens policy for the re-funding of TAFE, as outlined in this second reading amendment, is bold and achievable. This vision includes a $1.2 billion increase in funding to TAFE over the next triennium. This is the kind of commitment that we should be seeing from the Commonwealth in skilling Australia’s work force. This is the kind of commitment that would allow us to call this bill, as the government have, ‘one of the most significant boosts to vocational and technical education ever undertaken by any Australian government.’ Unfortunately, this label that the government seek to give to this bill is entirely wrong.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,7,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-08-10,"—I rise to speak on the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the associated Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. These bills embody the government’s commitment to the national training sector. The government is taking steps to ensure the continuation of a healthy and vibrant skills sector, with flexibility for teachers, apprentices and employers.
These bills will, as we have heard, abolish the Australian National Training Authority and transfer $4.4 billion to state governments to fund vocational education programs administered by DEST. Including the $577 million already allocated to the states in 2005, the total appropriation from July 2005 to December 2008 will be $4.9 billion. Of this funding, $175 million is over and above the previous ANTA agreement. Each state will match this additional commitment. In total, federal funding will represent an average real increase of 3.2 per cent from 2004. The abolition of ANTA will also save the government over $3 million annually from 2006-07 by eliminating management and support service duplications and rationalising administrative costs.
The bills also establish a federal framework for skills education that ties funding to benchmarked training outcomes, which is as it should be. Requirements for funding will include: workplace reforms in the TAFE sector to provide greater incentives for staff and to reward staff, removing impediments inherent to state awards to accelerate and encourage apprentices who show initiative and commitment, and increasing the choice of employers to employ the apprentice most suitable to their needs.
These bills enshrine flexibility throughout the training sector. This is a significant change in approach from that of past Labor governments. The Opposition has taken to rewriting history in its defence of the training package it introduced in 1992. Mr Beazley, when he was minister for employment, education and training, introduced the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. The current shadow minister for education and training waxes lyrical about the success of that act, which established ANTA. The government agrees that, to an extent, she is justified. ANTA was a landmark policy in bringing the training sector under a national umbrella. However, senators opposite need to recall the context in which ANTA was established in 1992. Unemployment was at 10 per cent. Today it is at five per cent.
—One million people!
—We well remember that front page headline saying, ‘One million people unemployed,’ as Senator Campbell reminds us. We no longer have job shortages across the board. Apprentices, job seekers, employers and industry today need flexibility to maintain the current vigour of the work force. The challenge today is so different to 13 years ago, thank goodness.
There is an increased demand now for skilled workers in Australia. We need to shift our focus to addressing the new challenges that are posed by a strong and growing economy. We know what the approach of those senators opposite is to addressing the skills shortage—it is to get into government and kill the economy. If you kill the economy, unemployment goes up. There will certainly be no skills shortage in that case. That is about their only policy for addressing the skills shortage. We need to look at different ways to deliver education and training.
With these bills the government is responding to the current economic environment—the strong environment brought about by nine years of reform, strong management and good policy. The opposition, as we have heard, would happily leave the old legislation in place if their amendments are not agreed to. For what reason? They like the status quo. They insist that the world does not change and that what was in place and had some merit 10 years ago is appropriate for today. It is not. Times change. Legislation and policy settings need to change to address the current environment.
The opposition wants to use the argument that ANTA was good policy in 1992. So does Senator Nettle. It does not bode well for a particularly creative policy approach from those opposite, who are clinging to the past again. Unlike the opposition, the government are not scared of reform. We are not scared of looking at new policy and better ways of doing things. To that end, the government are also seeking to allow TAFE institutions the flexibility of offering teaching staff Australian workplace agreements or similar performance pay contracts. TAFEs will be able to attract and keep the best teachers for their apprentices and offer appropriate rewards for their work. Sadly, senators opposite continue to scaremonger on AWAs. It is important for the Senate to note that there will be absolutely no compulsion for TAFE teachers to agree to AWAs or any other sort of agreement. They can choose to work under a collective agreement. It is entirely misleading to say that we are not offering choice.
Senator Wong likened this legislation to the proposed voluntary student unionism legislation or drew a parallel with it, saying that, on one hand, we are arguing for choice and, on the other hand, we are seeking to limit choice through this legislation. This legislation does not seek to limit choice. This legislation seeks to guarantee choice. The staff at these institutions will have the opportunity to choose an Australian workplace agreement if they want to. All this legislation does is ensure that a choice is offered. Choice is what employees are entitled to have, and they will have it. TAFE directors too will be able to take advantage of this greater freedom in hiring staff. They will be able to take advantage of greater autonomy over the operation of the institutions for which they have responsibility. They will have the power to attract and retain quality teachers and manage underperformance with their employees as well.
Another hollow argument put forward by the shadow minister is that the states have in some way been railroaded into accepting a national outlook on skills training. She has claimed in the other place that the state and territory governments have not been consulted about the reforms in these bills. I know my government colleagues in that place have already brought her error to her attention, so now I will bring it to the attention of senators here. Eleven days before these bills were tabled in the House of Representatives, a Council of Australian Governments meeting agreed that a whole-of-government approach to the training sector was required. It established a joint Commonwealth-state working group. I would have thought that that was a relatively thorough form of consultation.
Further, COAG agreed that a more flexible, responsive and genuinely national apprenticeship, vocational education and training system is vital to meeting current and future skills needs. We have to remember that COAG is not some creature of the Commonwealth. COAG has eight state and territory Labor governments, and they are no patsies for this government. That meeting even specifically examined the Commonwealth-state funding agreement for these bills. This was only two weeks before the shadow minister declared that the government had not consulted the states on this issue.
There are distinct benefits to a wholly national training sector. The Labor states agree. Skills recognition as a result of these changes will more easily traverse state borders. Apprentices will have a broader range of jobs suitable to them and employers will have a larger pool from which to select the right apprentices for the jobs. Conditional funding will hold training providers to a national benchmark appropriate for the national job market, which is as it should be.
Unlike Labor, we believe in choice. We want to maximise choice. We do not think everyone should go to university. It is not appropriate for everyone. Some people’s skills are better suited to university and some people’s skills are better suited to training or an apprenticeship. We want to facilitate and support that choice. It is one of the reasons that the Commonwealth is also introducing 26 Australian technical colleges. We want to affirm an apprenticeship and a trade as being as valuable, good and productive as a university degree. A good trade is as good as a good university degree and people should be proud of the choices that they make. We should seek to support the choices they make. These bills will ensure the reforms necessary to maintaining a vibrant skills sector. The bills will make a significant contribution to making sure that we have a skilled work force and that we are in a strong position to meet the skills needs of Australian industry. I commend the bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,7,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-08-10,"—After that interesting contribution, perhaps we will get back on track. As Senator Fifield has said, we are debating the Skilling Australia’s Workforce Bill 2005 and the Skilling Australia’s Workforce (Repeal and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005. These bills are, in my view, amongst the first bills that will allow all of our fellow Australians to understand the consequences of a government majority in this place. These bills will enable the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training to effectively override the states’ control of vocational education. What we are seeing today is the total overthrow of one of the founding principles of the Liberal Party. The party founded by Robert Menzies with a strong commitment to states’ rights has now become the party that is using its legislative power to overturn the foundations of our Federation. What arrogance!
These bills give effect to the federal government turning its back on one of the cooperative arrangements negotiated between it and the states and territories. That negotiated agreement, which saw the creation of the Australian National Training Authority, was put in place to ensure that the vocational education sector—the TAFE system, in effect—was adequately funded and would meet Australia’s future work force requirements. It came about because the states would not agree to the Commonwealth assuming control of the TAFE sector back in 1991. That is back when there were Liberal state governments. Apparently the Liberal Party was concerned then about the rights of the states and did not want central control.
The original objectives of the system were to create a unified national vocational education and training system, with joint Commonwealth and state responsibility for funding, closer interaction between industry and providers, and the development of an effective training market. The critical factors in the original ANTA agreement related to its role and the funding arrangements. What we now see is little more than a grab for power. It is a grab for power that does not mean the Commonwealth will be involved in the day-to-day management of vocational education, but it allows the minister to withhold funding if he or she does not agree with the training plans submitted by the sector. All the control but none of the responsibility will be delivered to the Commonwealth through the minister holding the purse strings. It is not a very satisfactory model for the delivery of needed vocational education.
It is clear that the Howard government are taking this step as a means of pretending that they are addressing our skills crisis. What a load of rubbish! When confronted with the problem—one that they have allowed to develop over the last nine long years—the government’s only response is to blame the states and the unions and attempt to divert the public from the issue. The simple facts, however, are these: the government on coming to power reduced the funding to the vocational education system. That is undeniable. They did this by removing the growth funding that was built into the agreement. They combined this with reductions in expenditure through efficiency dividends and by requiring the states to do the same.
This all resulted in the fall of funding overall. Growth funding was reintroduced in the ANTA agreement in 2001-03. However, the Commonwealth then offered such a small increase that the states would not agree to the new ANTA agreement in 2004. The Commonwealth have allowed the ANTA agreement to lapse and, although funding is guaranteed for this year, we now see revealed their intent all along. This reveals the original decision to be none other than a bad case of cutting off their nose to spite their face. If the states would not agree to their unreasonable offer, then the Commonwealth would rewrite the rule book, as we are obviously going to see often in this place.
It shows to the Australian people the complete arrogance of this government. Australia has now become a country where it is the Liberals’ way of doing things or the highway. The abolition of ANTA was announced by the Prime Minister by press release last October, as part of the new ministerial arrangements following the election. This is what passes for consultation by the Howard government: no discussion with the states, no policy announcement during the election campaign; just a press release after the event. Did they take this policy to the Australian people for their endorsement during the election campaign? Of course they did not. After the election and whilst announcing the new ministerial arrangements, the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority and that its responsibilities would be absorbed within the Department of Education, Science and Training.
Now with the government in control of the Senate, the legislation is here before us to give Australia what effectively amounts to executive government by press release. We may well ask what justification those opposite have put forward to mask their grab for power. The one constant refrain from those opposite is that the current system based on the states restricts the free flow of labour from one state to another. They claim that a hairdresser in New South Wales cannot work in Victoria. They claim that this comes about because state differences are based on union vested interests. Somehow they would have us believe that unions in each state have controlled the state governments’ regulation of trades for their own interests. What nonsense!
It is a nonsense on several levels. Firstly, the government would have you believe that the conservative parties have never been in power in any of the states. As I said, they were there when ANTA was first established. The government would pretend to the Australian people that many of the regulations they now rail against are the product of not state governments’ vested interests but rather unions having convinced conservative parties to legislate in their favour. It is a nonsense of the first order. Secondly, those opposite pretend that this regulation of the labour market is restricted to the traditional trades. Every time they speak about this problem they use the examples of hairdressers, carpenters and electricians. Do they ever speak about other occupations or trades? No, they do not; there is not one word about any other occupation.
Let us just take one example to illustrate this point. A lawyer—an occupation those opposite, particularly those on the front bench, would be most familiar with—who attended university in New South Wales is not able to go and practise law in any other state without becoming accredited in that state. That should sound familiar to most on the opposite front bench. Where is the legislation dealing with all occupations? Labour market regulation is apparently an issue only for tradespeople but not for professionals, although many of the constraints are similar.
The other argument cited by those opposite is that the current system needs to be reformed to deliver three key principles. They are: firstly, industry and business needs should drive training; secondly, better training outcomes would be achieved through more flexible and accelerated pathways; and, finally, the processes should be simplified and streamlined. Whilst acknowledging the success of ANTA, the Commonwealth then uses the above principles to argue that the skills shortages are the failings of the system. They again pretend that business and industry needs are not at the forefront of planning for vocational education.
As someone who has been associated with the employment and training sector for many years, I know this is the sort of conservative claptrap that has no basis in reality and shows no experience of how the labour market really works. No vocational training in this country is conducted without there being some input from business or industry—everyone in the sector knows that. No training provider—TAFE or otherwise—would offer a vocational training course that does not have employment as its outcome. In fact, from what I have observed at first-hand over the years, training providers are not in the game for very long if they do not develop close relationships with industry—a self-evident fact. The government’s next principle is that better outcomes would be achieved if there were more flexible and accelerated pathways. Let us decode that.

 (Senator Hutchins)—Order! It being 12.45 pm, I call on matters of public interest.",SENATE,<title>SKILLING AUSTRALIA’S WORKFORCE BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,7,1,speech
"Senator BOSWELL,",NATS,2005-08-10,"—I am very glad that Senator Ian Campbell is in the chamber today, because what I am going to speak about is relevant to his portfolio. I stand here today waiting with bated breath to see what action will be taken to move Australia into the era of fuel self-sufficiency and greenhouse gas abatement. Renewable fuels are the way of this nation’s and the world’s future. Almost every other country with the potential to develop biofuels has taken policy steps to introduce these fuels into their transport sector. Australia is lagging years behind.
I have outlined to this chamber before the health and the environmental benefits of using E10. I have spoken of the job opportunities that will come with developing this industry in regional Australia—said to be more than 6,000 jobs in Queensland alone—and of the vital importance of improving our fuel self-sufficiency and reducing fossil fuel imports. Since that occasion, a number of new developments have taken place. New science confirming the environmental benefits of Australian produced ethanol has been released and biofuels have been recognised as a way to address the environmental issues affecting the world.
In an address to the nation in May, United States President George Bush singled out biofuels development as a strategic direction for America to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. Mr Bush said:
This strategy will encourage more efficient technologies, make the most of our existing resources ... develop promising new sources of energy such as hydrogen, ethanol and biodiesel ... and strengthen the long-term economic security of our nation.
Just two weeks ago the Senate and the House of Representatives in America agreed on a bill ordering the US oil industry to nearly double the amount of corn-distilled ethanol it uses as an additive in petrol. It is now awaiting the President’s signature. One of the bill’s authors, Republican Pete Domenici of New Mexico, said:
For once, Congress and the United States are going to do something important that we will benefit from, not tomorrow, but for the next five or 10 years. This bill will create jobs, job security and clean energy, who could ask for anything more?
The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, has called on the government to provide a real future for the biofuels industry. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said:
Renewable fuels are the way of the future and ethanol is leading the international charge as an alternative to fossil fuels. Export markets and demand are growing as mandates are introduced around the world to require oil companies to include ethanol in fuel for vehicles.
Former Premier of New South Wales Bob Carr said:
Alternative fuels will be increasingly important as we move away from reliance on fossil fuels and establish a more diverse and secure energy supply. Ethanol-blended fuel will be used for the first time in the NSW government’s vehicle fleet under future fuel contracts.
A new player, the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, has detailed the AMA’s support for the mandatory use of ethanol in petrol in the interests of protecting and improving human health:
“In our opinion, there is incontrovertible evidence that the addition of ethanol to petrol and biodiesel to diesel will reduce the deaths and ill-health associated with the emissions produced by burning those fuels,” Dr Haikerwal said.
“The AMA believes that among other actions the introduction of mandatory biofuel blends would reduce the negative health impacts of emissions.”
In its submission to the biofuels task force in June the Australian Conservation Foundation—you will be interested in this, Senator Ian Campbell—said:
A thriving biofuels industry can deliver long term environmental, social and economic benefits for Australia if implemented in the right way.
There is a strong case for the implementation of a mandatory renewable fuels target (MRFT) to ensure the development of a commercially viable biofuels industry based on market flexibility and responsiveness to technical innovation.
The Council of Australian Governments communique of 3 June 2005 agreed to set up a senior officials group to examine the scope for national cooperation on climate change policy, including encouraging renewable energy including ethanol. BP Australasia President Gerry Hueston has suggested using wedges in a multipronged approach to greenhouse gas abatement, one of which is ‘increasing biofuel production 50-fold’. Mr Hueston went on to say that they have sold 13 million litres of E10 in Queensland ‘and we have not received a single technical complaint from consumers’. The Strategic Fuels Development Manager of Biofuels at Shell states:
Biofuels are real! Both ethanol and bio-diesel are penetrating the fuel market as they integrate smoothly into the fuel infrastructure.
Shell’s web site proclaims:
Bio-fuels are realistic contenders as a major low-carbon fuel source for the future.
All those people believe in the benefits of a strong ethanol industry, and so do I.
Over recent weeks there has been some criticism of The Nationals’ push for the right policy setting to encourage the ethanol industry. I believe that that commentary was unfounded and I would like to challenge some statements in the media. Widely quoted in the media was Mr Peter Harris of CommSec, who was formerly employed by Shell Australia. Some published statements claim:
An ethanol mandate would cost taxpayers $600 million in excise forgone and if the price of oil falls below $US42 a barrel, an ethanol mandate would increase petrol prices.
A Caltex spokesman said:
It is a marketing decision not to sell ethanol blend more cheaply at Caltex sites.
There is no country in the world where ethanol blends are sold at higher prices. Mr Harris’s figure of $600 million is achieved by multiplying the total amount of unleaded fuel in Australia by the full level of excise paid on petrol. By the time Australia is capable of producing that volume of ethanol—most probably around 2020—ethanol will be paying excise equivalent to its energy rating. Mr Harris says:
The best way to reduce Australia’s growing reliance on imported oil is to provide incentives to look for more oil and extract more expensive oil ...
Current oil reserves are not expected to meet increasing demand over the next 20 years. OPEC has recently announced that the price of oil could reach $80 a barrel in the next two years. The declining ratio of production to consumption in Australia has resulted in oil imports jumping from $400 million in 2000-01 to $5 billion this year, and it will get worse. Mr Harris also says:
Oil companies are buying ethanol at around 72c/l but of course the ethanol producers are still enjoying the protection of a holiday from the normal fuel excise of 38c/l ...
Ethanol and other alternative fuels like LPG and LNG are rebated according to their energy ratings. An excise rebate is no holiday; it is a recognition of the quality of low emissions. Even the conservationists would reject this claim made by Mr Harris:
Ethanol is not only uneconomic, it is bad for the environment.
                  …         …           …
The land required to produce 1.8 billion litres ... would no longer be available for carbon dioxide consuming trees ...
No new agricultural land is required to provide feedstock for a strong and vital ethanol industry. The 1.8 billion-litre estimate assumes that all petrol sold in Australia contains 10 per cent ethanol, which represents unrealistic consumption of ethanol in the short term. The most recent Australian research by CSIRO on the proposed Primary Energy ethanol plant at Gunnedah examined the full life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of ethanol. The results indicated that when compared to the production of premium unleaded petrol there will be greenhouse gas reductions within the range of eight per cent to 12.5 per cent. The total CO equivalent reduction from the 120 million-litre bioenergy plant will be 303,720 tonnes per year—that is the equivalent of removing 70,000 cars from the nation’s roads each and every year—from the ethanol produced at this plant alone. No attack on ethanol would be complete without a reference to Australia’ s largest producer of ethanol. Mr Harris says:
The only real beneficiary would be that chastened donor to the conservative parties, Dick Honan and his Manildra Group.
There are currently between six and eight new ethanol projects waiting for some indication from government of the appropriate policy setting to provide confidence to financiers. Any initiative to further support the development of this industry would be designed to benefit new entrants to ethanol production as well as existing suppliers. Mr Harris also says:
The indelible mark of a truly silly idea—such as the Nationals push to inflict a 10% ethanol blend on innocent motorists across the country—is that its unintended consequences quickly become apparent.
Ethanol is not a National Party idea and it is certainly not a silly idea. Implementing policy decisions to assist the development of a strong and vital ethanol industry is widely supported across all political parties, the AMA, the services stations association and the Conservation Foundation, as the quotes prove. Every piece of evidence points to the fact that Australia needs and must embrace an ethanol industry. It is time the policy environment was amended to ensure that this industry happens. I eagerly await the Prime Minister’s response to the biofuels task force.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Biofuels</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,8,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-08-10,"—My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. Is the minister aware of a deteriorating security situation in the southern Iraqi city of Samawah, where, as the London Times states, rioters were ‘seen moving around the streets with rocket-propelled grenade launchers’? Has the government assessed the extent to which civil disturbances in the city of Samawah may spread throughout the Al Muthanna province? Are the Australian troops responsible for securing this area exposed to greater risk as a result of the emerging civil unrest? Can the minister indicate what assessment has been made of the adequacy of resources that have been provided to our troops in the event that they are required to simultaneously confront both civil disturbances and possible attacks from insurgents?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-08-10,"—Mr President, I have a supplementary question arising out of the minister’s response. As he correctly identifies, the purpose of the Australian troops in this particular province is to assist the Japanese who are there. In light of that purpose and in light of the minister’s earlier response, can the minister indicate what action the government is taking in response to the concern raised by task group commander Lieutenant Colonel Roger Noble that Australian troops ‘can’t sanitise’ themselves completely from the civil unrest in Samawah?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-08-10,"—As the honourable senator says, there have been civil disturbances in Samawah. They seem to have arisen from a number of different causes—one being a shortage of basic services, particularly electricity. There have also been disputes about the police services. Unfortunately, as is sometimes the case in that part of the world, the civil differences very quickly deteriorated into violence. It would seem to have been complicated somewhat by some militia forces of Muqtada al-Sadr becoming involved. This has brought a response from the Iraqi army as well as the Iraqi police services. In relation to the Australian role: of course the Australians are not there to involve themselves in civil disturbances; the Australians are there to provide an element of security for the Japanese humanitarian mission and also to provide further training for the Iraqi security forces. Australians are not involved in providing a response to these civil differences. They are, of course, observing what is occurring and reporting appropriately.
As to whether they need further resources as applies to the civil disturbances, I have not seen any suggestion that they need further resources and I would not expect that they would, because they are not involved in providing a response to such disturbances. It is a worrying development—I would not hide that fact—but overall the province of Al Muthanna remains one of the most stable within Iraq and one in which there have been few instances of insurgency actions and even fewer instances of jihadist activity.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-08-10,"—We rely on the professionalism of the ADF in such circumstances, and they are very professional and very capable. As I said to the honourable senator, it is not the Australians’ role to become involved in civil differences within the province. I suppose there is always the possibility that a particular Japanese humanitarian operation could receive attention from some elements of civil disobedience, but I have not seen any suggestion that that is happening and the Japanese are, in any event, very cautious in such circumstances. I would be very surprised if they allowed themselves to be put in a position where that might occur.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-10,"—My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Can the minister confirm whether the government is intending to provide grants for regional and rural universities to compensate them for the loss of student services under its extreme voluntary student unionism proposal? Is it the case that the government is considering these taxpayer funded grants for regional and rural universities in order to gain National Party support for its ideological attack on student organisations? With Liberal Party members and senators also concerned that metropolitan campuses will lose services under VSU, will the government extend these grants to metropolitan campuses or does it intend to create two classes of students? How will the government decide which universities need grants and which students need services? Can the minister provide a rock solid guarantee that the government will not just pork-barrel universities in National Party seats?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,question
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-10,"—Minister, don’t the calls—including from within the coalition party room—to provide grants to bail out universities suffering the effects of the issues show that the changes are nothing more than an ideological attack on student organisations and student services? Won’t these plans force university services to close down and also discourage international students from choosing Australian universities? And won’t plans for cash handouts for regional universities simply mean that some university students will get a better deal than others, depending on where they live?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-10,"—The government does not accept for one minute that voluntary student unionism will in any way see a reduction in services. The example of Western Australia showed that. There was no diminution in services and it did not bring the end of the world, as everybody predicted. In fact, I saw that at first-hand on visits to the campus of the University of Western Australia. What we are all about is empowering students to give them some freedom of choice. Universities, which are supposed to be havens for free thinking and searching wisdom, should also be proponents of freedom of association. One would think that freedom of association would be a principle held dear by universities around this country.
Of course, what we see from the ALP is that old socialist policy, the collectivist attitude against the freedom of the individual, where they will impose compulsion on an individual so that that person has to pay fees before they can engage in studies. That is an outrageous situation to have in a free country such as Australia—to say, ‘You cannot engage in studies. You cannot engage in pursuing excellence to enhance your talents. You cannot do that unless you pay a compulsory fee first.’ That is what they are on about. They are all for taking, by compulsion, $170 million a year off students, who can least afford it. What is more, how would they explain it to someone who engages in long-distance studies and never attends the campus? ‘You have to pay this compulsory fee because there are services provided on campus.’ Quite frankly, this is not only a farce but also a matter of principle which flies in the face of freedom of thought in this country and freedom of association.
We saw in Western Australia, where you had voluntary student unionism, no diminution in services. What you will see is people voting with their feet. If a service or a sporting body is so good, students will pay money to that organisation to join it. That will be the test. If they can offer a true service or facility, students will pay on a voluntary basis to join it. What could be better than that? What we are about is providing freedom of choice. We do not believe that students should be forced to pay fees which are somewhere in the region of $100 through to $500 when they are not that well-positioned to afford it. More importantly, there is the principle that you demand a compulsory fee from an Australian student or any student before they can engage in studies—a fee which has no relevance to the tuition they are getting.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,answer
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-08-10,"—If freedom of association is an ideology then that is one that I proudly subscribe to. This is about a principle which is wrong. It is wrong in principle not to allow freedom of association, especially on the tertiary campuses in this country, Australia, which is a free democratic country. We are saying, ‘No, you will pay a compulsory union fee before you can commence your studies’—a fee which in no way is related to the tuition of a student. It is an outrageous situation and we will not stand for it. If it is an ideology, I make no apology for it because that is what we stand for.

Further to that answer to Senator Forshaw, I have now been advised that upgrading an exchange as a result of a demand register of fewer than 75 people is not the least bit unusual. The business case in each town is of course different. Thanks to HiBIS, most exchanges can be upgraded with fewer than 75 people expressing an interest. For example, the town of Haddon in Victoria upgraded with a register of 35 interested people; the town of Hampstead in South Australia upgraded with a register of 48 people; Southbrook in Queensland had just 30 people; and Stanley in Victoria had 57 people.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) and the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to questions without notice asked today.
I do not want to spend a lot of time on the unedifying brawl that is the coalition government at the moment, dominated by calls for expulsion, bullying and standover tactics. I understand that yesterday Senator Heffernan—he is better known as ‘Senator Heffalump’ in some quarters—was muscling-up in the party room. It is an unedifying mess; it is a government in disarray. I do not want to concentrate on that; today’s media did that very well. What I want to concentrate on today are the answers given by two ministers, Senators Coonan and Ellison. Today we got a clear view of the dominance of ideology over the government.
Senator Ellison could not constrain himself: he threw away the brief. Normally he sticks to his brief very rigidly but today he threw away his brief because he was on his old ground. I remember the University of Western Australia in the old days—back to the old VSU arguments by student politicians. It is the most important thing in the old ideological agenda. They have been nailed by The Nationals. The Nationals do not care about that stuff; they are interested in serving people in the bush. I give them credit for that. They are about ensuring a very good deal, by some unusual tactics no doubt. But you can see the ideology oozing out of the government. They have finally got their hands on the levers of power—they have the numbers in the Senate—so they want to go on about VSU.
I was down at the shops the other day when a couple of people stopped me and wanted to talk about politics. Not one of them mentioned to me their concern about student unionism. They were worried about feeding their kids, getting a job and how family leave entitlements would affect them. They never raised with me their great concern about how student guilds are funded in Australia. That is not the issue that is worrying most Australians but it is worrying your party room because it is driven by ideology. It is driven by the opportunity to use its Senate majority to get back to the old ideological agenda. All the old student politicians here made it into parliament but they never won a debate or an election at university because, as they said, they were beaten by the Maoists and the Trots. Those guys could not even beat the Maoists and the Trots in a ballot at university. But this is their chance. They have their hands on the levers of power and they are going to fix the old wrongs. Senator Mason said it is about settling old student battles—‘we are going to win now’—so they are muscling-up to each other and they are pushing and shoving and fighting because it is all about ideology. The Howard government finally got the levers in the Senate and it can run with really important issues such as voluntary student unionism.
I think that Australians want to hear the Howard government talking about families, family leave, work and family balance, opportunities for kids, the skills crisis and the infrastructure crisis. But, no, what are you guys going on about? What are the Liberal and National parties talking about? They are having an internal debate about voluntary student unionism. How pathetic. The other agenda, of course, is industrial relations. They say, ‘We have record growth and record employment but we really have to fix the IR system.’ It has nothing to do with fixing anything; there is no economic case. It is about ideology: John Howard’s 20-year battle to leave his mark on the industrial relations system. The government is now driven by ideology. Senator Barnaby Joyce, whom I have not yet formally met but I must go over and say hello—I hate to give him all this publicity—is quoted in today’s paper.

Senator Hill interjecting—

—Yes; he does not need my help. Senator Joyce is quoted in today’s paper as talking about wanting to change the ‘absolutism’ of the current government. I knew what that word meant but I looked it up in the dictionary because I wanted to be sure. The definition in the Oxford Dictionary talks about the principle of absolute government and ruling arbitrarily. It uses the word ‘despotic’. One of the government’s own senators has captured what this government is now about: the principle of absolute government—ruling arbitrarily, running an ideological agenda driven by cabinet ministers who are desperate to win some battles, including ones they lost at university. How pathetic it is that they think that those are the concerns of ordinary Australians. You have let the power go to your head before you have even started— (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-08-10,"—I am delighted to follow Senator Chris Evans in this debate because I am a former student politician who did win elections. In 1982 I was elected as President of the Australian National University Students Association with a 65 per cent majority—compared to 35 per cent—on a platform of voluntary student unionism. Let me advise Senator Chris Evans that it is not this side of the chamber that has lost touch with the majority of Australians on this argument. It is you people who have lost touch with the majority of Australians on this question. The majority of Australian society has moved on with respect to compulsion within Australian life. You do not find many compulsory unions of any description in Australian life these days, Senator Chris Evans. You might not have been out in the work force very much in recent years but that is the fact.
The concept of having to belong to a particular organisation in order to sustain your living tends to be the exception rather than the rule in the Australian workplace. If it is the case in the work force that that compulsion has disappeared, isn’t the argument against compulsory student unionism within universities, within places of learning where students acquire the qualifications they need to enter the workplace, even stronger? Of course it is. Compulsory student unionism in this country must end because it is an affront to the concept of choice, it is an affront to the concept of freedom of association and it has contributed very significantly to the decline in the quality of student services.
Senators opposite seem to think that it is quite all right to argue for compulsion without it existing elsewhere in the community, but they forget that what that produces is a situation where student organisations do not have to appeal to the loyalty of their membership to be able to produce high-quality services. They get the fees that run those organisations whether the organisations are efficient, well run and providing high-quality services or not. The sad fact is that very often those organisations are not. Very often those organisations are inefficient, they waste large amounts of student money, they provide poor services and students walk away from them if they can.
That is the evidence on campuses across this country. You yourselves know that that is the case, because you know that the moment voluntary student unionism is enacted in this country thousands upon thousands of students will walk away from unions. Do not forget that this government is not outlawing the idea of belonging to a student union. It is not saying it is against the law to form or belong to student unions. People are perfectly free to associate in that way on university campuses under the legislation this government is sponsoring. But you in the Australian Labor Party know as well as I do that when students are no longer required to belong to one of those unions in order to obtain a degree at an Australian university in the vast majority of cases in the present circumstances they will walk away from those unions. Why will they do that? Because they recognise that they provide extremely poor value for money.
In my opinion, that is the most serious crime student unions have committed: they have failed to satisfy the needs of their members. They have lost sight of the need to service their members. I believe, moreover, that this reform will generate an understanding on the part of many student unions that they have to lift their game if they are to have any chance whatsoever of being able to attract students back to them in the future.
Compulsory unionism is an anachronism. It plays no role in contemporary Australian society, it ought not to be a feature of workplaces in this country and it certainly should not be a feature in our society of the environment where students obtain their qualifications to enter the work force in the first place. Senators opposite know that fact. They know that members are going to desert those unions in droves when they have the opportunity. That is the best possible reason why they should be given the freedom to decide for themselves whether they wish to belong to those unions or not.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,13,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-08-10,"—It is wonderful that Senator Humphries has come here today and confessed exactly why he is so supportive of the issue: it is because he did not win this agenda in 1982 so he has to come into the Senate in 2005 and win it now, now that the government have got their hands on the levers of power. It is really interesting, isn’t it? This is from 1982 to 2005—I was still at school in 1982 and there might be a few people listening who were; it is hardly what you would call a cutting edge agenda. It is hardly what you would call a current agenda to face some of the crises such as the skills crisis that has developed under this government or to deal with issues that are important to families in Australia such as ensuring their take-home pay, penalty rates and overtime are preserved and that work and family issues can actually be dealt with.
From Senator Humphries and also today in question time from Senator Ellison we heard the same ideological agenda, the same obsession with old battles that they could not win at university. The problem is, for them, that people are not convinced by their argument. Not only are their constituencies not convinced that this is a good idea—and of course I do not talk about some Liberal Party backbenchers; I talk about constituencies that actually elect you—but your coalition party, the National Party, are not convinced either.
I congratulate the National Party on this, because unlike some of the people opposite who are simply obsessed with this old agenda, The Nationals have understood: ‘This might actually be a problem for student services in this country, particularly in some of the areas we represent.’ What has been played out in the papers is an unedifying debacle and an unedifying example of the way this government is divided over the fact that a number of Liberal Party frontbenchers and backbenchers are putting an old, obsessed, ideological agenda on the issue of voluntary student unionism and a number of National Party senators and MPs are saying, ‘Well, actually, this might be a problem.’
What we have seen, for example, are three state conferences of the National Party passing resolutions saying they would only support the ban on student unionism if there were a different mechanism with comparable levels of funding to existing fees—in other words, subsidising—so that the student services which are currently paid for by student union fees can actually continue on campuses. We have also seen Hendy Cowan—who would be known to Senator Boswell, who is in the chamber—former leader of the WA National Party and Deputy Premier between 1993 and 2001, who happens also to be the Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, writing to Senator Eggleston urging him ‘to consider the need for a “compulsory amenities and services fee” as the bill is debated by the Senate’. He also wrote that the removal of collectively funded services would ‘hit students hard, particularly those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds’. We have seen similar comments by state National Party members such as Peter Hall, leader of The Nationals in Victoria’s Legislative Council. The Nationals MP Fiona Nash also indicated publicly:
Our job is to make sure that regional universities aren’t disadvantaged by these changes ...
They are very important contributions. What they reflect is the growing realisation amongst the National Party and hopefully some of the Liberal Party of the effect of these changes, that what they will actually do is undercut student services. But have the government—the government that Senator Ian Macdonald said today are a government that consults—been listening to this, perhaps tempering some of their old obsessions with the reality of what is coming into their offices, the feedback from their coalition party members and also from their constituencies? What have we had from them? Senator Fifield is reported as heaping scorn on the idea of special grants for regional universities. According to the Melbourne Age:
Senator Fifield said the compromise plan to separate a compulsory services fee from political activity was “a con and sham”.
This is what the National Party is suggesting to ameliorate some of the problems with the Liberals’ obsessive agenda and ideological crusade against the word ‘union’ in student unions. This is what he says it is: a con and a sham.
In the very short time remaining for me to speak, I will finish with a point about what this really means. Flinders University in my home state of South Australia has subsidised child care. It is subsidised by the student union, by student services, in order to ensure that parents who attend university can attend classes. It is a fantastic measure. It is a measure that will be under threat if you take the subsidy out of this. If you start to say that student unions are to be made voluntary, people will not have the opportunity to have these services. What you are actually talking about in your agenda against the word ‘union’ in this debate is removing services such as the subsidised child care that people at Flinders University in South Australia— (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-08-10,"—One of the principles that separate senators on this side of the chamber—be they Liberal or be they Nationals—and senators on the other side of the chamber is the principle of freedom of association.
—Don’t hide behind freedom of association!
—Senator Lundy mocks that, but one of the great divides between the two sides of Australian politics is the principle of freedom of association. Voluntary student unionism is a natural extension of that principle. If we can trust students and if students have the capacity to choose their university, if we can trust students and students have the capacity to choose their degree and if we can trust students and students have the capacity to choose their subjects, then why do we suppose that their critical faculties all of a sudden leave them when it comes to deciding whether or not to join a student union or association and whether or not to pay a compulsory amenities fee? If we can trust students to decide which institution to go to and what to study, why can we not trust them to decide whether to join a student union or association and whether to pay a fee?
It was disappointing, as the committee that I was on, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee—and I certainly will not pre-empt their findings before they are tabled—moved around Australia, to hear vice-chancellors express that they did not trust students. We heard Professor Ian Young, Vice-Chancellor of Swinburne University, say:
This is a rather condescending comment, I am afraid, but when you have a group of 18- to 22-year-olds the reality is that their focus is very short term. They are interested in the here and now.
I think that is a very condescending comment, and I think the attitude to students of senators opposite is very condescending: that students lack the capacity to make the decision for themselves. The answer that is sometimes put up is the legislation in Western Australia and Victoria, which allows students to opt out of unions. Sounds like a good idea—the only problem is that if you opt out of the union you still have to pay the same fee as though you joined the union. When Senator Wong was referring to me earlier and talking about ‘a con and a sham’, that is what I was referring to: the legislation in Victoria and Western Australia. That legislation in those two states is a con and a sham. No, you do not have to join the union, but you still have to pay the same fee, as if you did, and that money still goes to the union. That is a con and a sham. That is not freedom of association; that is just a technical out. It is not a real out; it is not a real choice.
It is extremely interesting that the National Union of Students, the Gallop government and even Ms Macklin in the other place support this concept of a limited amenities and services fee. It is pretty clear why that is. You only have to look at the National Union of Students’ electoral return for the last federal election to see why. It is because you cannot quarantine money. It does not matter what is on paper, the money is fungible. The money ends up being used for a purpose other than that for which it was intended. The National Union of Students spent $250,000 of the money compulsorily acquired from Australian university students in a partisan political campaign to put the coalition last. That is why the National Union of Students, the Gallop government and the senators opposite want to maintain the status quo or, at the very least, have a limited amenities fee. They know where that money will end up. That money will end up in partisan campaigns, being used against the wishes of students. Students are not consulted. Students do not have a say as to whether that money is used on political campaigns but, sure enough, that is where that money ends up.
On the issue of rural campuses: despite repeated questioning at the hearings, the transcripts—which are available—show that witnesses were unable to substantiate the claim that regional universities would be affected in any way materially different to metropolitan universities.
—That is not true!
—That is rubbish!
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: I think the senator is technically misleading the Senate. We cannot discuss the report in detail as it has not yet been tabled, but I take great exception to him reflecting on the evidence that we received in that committee inquiry in the way that he has, because I believe it to be untrue.
—Senator Lundy, I hear what you say but I do not believe that is a point of order.
—There were assertions but there was no hard evidence to substantiate that claim. Senators opposite were asking in question time if a fund will be used to compensate differently in regional areas and metropolitan areas. The simple answer is: there is no fund, so I am not quite sure what they are talking about. On the tax analogy that is often put forward: I do not accept that universities and student unions are some fourth tier of government—(Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I am very pleased I have this opportunity to respond to Senator Fifield and other comments, because I have never heard a more outrageous set of claims than I have just heard. There are a couple of issues at stake here. The Howard government is relying on two central arguments to support its voluntary student unionism legislation: (1) freedom of association and (2) that you cannot quarantine the funds from political campaigns. We can deal with this second argument by virtue of the fact that Labor have now put forward an amendment that says we believe a compromise—and the way forward—is to provide for a compulsory fee for specific activities relating to student services. That should resolve, once and for all, any argument the government tries to present that there will be funds directed towards political campaigning. There is no base for that argument because there is now a political solution. The coalition senators know that; the National Party senators know that; the Democrats senators know that; the Independents know that; the Greens know that; and of course Labor know it because we are putting it forward.
The other argument regarding freedom of association is pure ideology, and we clearly heard more today than perhaps at any other time from Senator Kemp and Senator Ellison that it is all about ideology. That is the motivation here. This freedom of association is really about what they felt when they were at university when they did not win those elections and they spent their whole campaign focusing on the idea of getting rid of voluntary student unionism, because they could never get control—so much so, I understand, that Liberal student activists were directly consulted in the drafting of this legislation. It is a matter of public record that no less than a Victorian convener of the Liberal Students Association, their president and perhaps a few others were called to Canberra to help the Howard government draft this piece of ideological claptrap. They were called here because that is still part of the Young Liberal mindset and it is what motivates student activists on campus.
What a glorious day it is for all these excitable chaps on the other side of the chamber who lived through this campaign in the seventies and eighties and who like nothing more than to come and get their just desserts on the floor of this place now that they have managed to win a majority in the Senate. How indulgent and how divisive of their own side, when everyone else behind these ideologues who are championing this campaign is sitting back and saying: ‘Actually, it will wreck university sport in my area and it will undermine the local gym that the community uses, and we won’t be able to have child care at the regional university anymore. My son or daughter might not be able to go to that university now, because I’m not confident as a parent that it will be safe and that there will be sufficient social services to sustain a quality existence.’ That is the practical reality of what is going on here, and this is what those coalition senators who are supporting VSU do not understand. There is a practical problem with the legislation—that is, it will seriously undermine the quality of life on campus for not only students but broader communities, particularly in regional areas and also in outer metropolitan areas of Australia and indeed on city campuses.
The way that university life is integrated with society more generally and the benefits for participants and students of those universities are inextricable from what student services fees are spent on. If you take away the revenue stream from a compulsory student service fee, a whole raft of things fall over that go to social cohesion, the whole social environment and the structure of universities and their very important and very practical facilities.
I am the shadow minister for sport, so of course I am going to put an emphasis on this issue, but you cannot take away the very business case that underpins the practical experience of facilities and services on a university campus on the basis of the pathetic, indulgent and ideological argument purported by a few Liberal ex-university students at the behest of a recent incarnation campaign by virtue of the fact that the coalition have a majority in the Senate. How indulgent and how disgraceful! It is not surprising that they are split asunder on this issue. Half the coalition senators know that this legislation will practically destroy services— (Time expired)

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-08-10,"—First of all, I thank my colleague Senator Bartlett for giving up his time in this debate. I was not expecting that we would be speaking on this issue. As some honourable colleagues have mentioned, some outrageous claims have been made in this place today that cannot go without rebuttal. Today is a national day of action on so-called voluntary student unionism. I say ‘so-called’ because there is nothing about voluntarism or freedom of association inherent in these proposals or even in the legislation that has been put forward by the government. This is about emasculating student services, amenities, representations and advocacy—all the things that are vital parts of campus life and that are provided to students today by virtue of the payment of a universal services or amenities fee.
As has been pointed out by Senator Lundy and others, this matter is about an ideological obsession. It may be about settling old scores—I do not know. I do not particularly care whether it is about some politicians or former student politicians, and I acknowledge that I am a former student representative. It is not about the baggage that some of us may or may not carry; it is about suppressing dissent. I think the real ideological agenda here is: ‘We don’t like the idea that some people may vehemently disagree with the policies of this government, so let’s get rid of their funding’—as in the case of NGOs and other representative peak bodies that have been defunded under this government. They say: ‘Let’s take away the universal services fee from universities that students pay themselves. Let’s remove the prop of some students, particularly disadvantaged students and poorer students’—not to mention students from areas such as regional, remote or rural campuses—‘let’s take away the vital services that give them a university experience.’ I say ‘university experience’ because I am sick and tired of this chamber passing legislation that has as its very subtext an anti-intellectualism.
These days we view university degrees as a commodity. Students come in and out on conveyor belts. They are not given time to participate in other aspects—the lifeblood—that are a university experience. We are told: ‘No, we don’t want them involved in student radio or newspapers. They’re bad. Student representation—we don’t need it. Political organisations—they’re just wrong.’ What about advocacy and representation, things that students would not necessarily be able to afford themselves?
The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee heard evidence—and I will not reflect on the committee’s deliberations—but we know that students cannot afford to bring a lawyer to a hearing when they face some kind of difficulty or if they are being challenged with respect to their studies or their marks. What about child care? People keep saying, ‘We can get private companies to come onto campuses and provide other services that might assist students in their studies.’ Subsidised child care and catering are often things that cannot be run at a profit—not necessarily at a profit and not necessarily at cost. That is where student organisations, student unions, guilds or associations provide vital services, particularly for those traditionally disadvantaged students. But when did we stop thinking about universities as a holistic experience? What is so wrong with thinking about an academic aspect of university life as well as about broadening your horizons from a social, political, religious or artistic perspective? That is what the great institutions of not just this nation but the world are founded on.
That is why you will find the Oxbridge models. You will not find Cambridge and Oxford implementing this kind of change. I recall asking people about this. I think we are the only country in the world doing this. Once again, Australia is coming up with a wonderful first—a unique position. Australia is going to be one of the first places in the democratic world to singlehandedly destroy the tradition of university life. I think that is shameful, and I am glad to see that there are some backbenchers, and some National Party members in particular, who are concerned about this, not just because of the loss of sporting services—as important and integral as they are, not only to universities but to the entire community—and not just because of the job losses but because of what it means to the very definition of university life.
If the minister is happy to preside over that, good luck to him, but some of us will go to the barricades opposing it. I believe Senator Ellison said in question time today: ‘We are going to remove student funds. They can raise their own funds in order to fight governments.’ You watch—they will, and they will be a force to be reckoned with, as opposed to the kind of peaceful and civic demonstrations and protests we see from students now. Wait and see what happens in the future. But it is not about that; it is about vital services. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,13,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2005-08-10,"—I give notice that, on Tuesday, 16 August 2005, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The amendments relating to the importation of goods into Australia and the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia contained in the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 (the ITM Act) are proposed to be proclaimed to commence on 19 July 2005. This is the last possible day on which these amendments can commence. These amendments will, in part, require electronic reports (eg import entries, cargo reports etc) to be sent to Customs using the new Integrated Cargo System (the ICS).
Under section 5 of the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004, the Chief Executive Officer of Customs (the CEO) must specify an import cut-over time before 19 July 2005. Section 5 also provides that the latest possible time that the CEO can specify as import cut-over time is 28 August 2005. Ships and aircraft and related cargo that arrive in Australia for the first time on or after the import cut-over time are subject to the amendments in the ITM Act, including the requirement to use the ICS to report electronically to Customs.
In order to allow communicators (eg importers, cargo reporters, etc) the greatest amount of time to prepare the necessary systems, it is expected that the CEO will specify 28 August 2005 to be the import cut-over time.
However, at this stage it is a strongly held view by the importing community and their agents that they will not have the systems in place in time to communicate using the ICS in relation to ships and aircraft (or goods on board them) arriving on or after 28 August 2005. This situation would result in severe disruption at all major ports and airports that deal with import cargo as well as having a major impact on Australian business and manufacturing dependent on imports.
In line with the media release on 24 May 2005, the Minister for Justice and Customs announced the government’s intention to consult with industry during June 2005, and if more time were needed, to introduce a bill during the Spring Sittings to extend the transition period. This bill gives the CEO the power to specify another later import cut-over time in order to allow communicators additional time to prepare and test their electronic systems.

Reasons for Urgency

The proposed amendments must be made before 28 August 2005—that is, during the first two weeks of Spring Sittings. If the amendments are not made before 28 August 2005, communicators will be required to communicate with the ICS but will not have the systems in place to do so. This will mean that the clearance of imported goods will be delayed and in some circumstances the importers, cargo reporters etc will commit offences under the Customs Act 1901.

Worse still is the Government’s request to the UN Security Council to extend the presence of the occupation forces, made without consultation with the people’s representative in the National Assembly who hold the right to make such fateful decisions.
In line with our historic responsibility, we reject the legitimation of the occupation and we repeat our demand for the departure of the occupation forces, especially since our national forces have been able to break the back of terrorism and to notably establish its presence in the Iraqi street and to recover the state’s dignity and the citizen’s trust in the security forces leading to the noble objectives in an Iraq whose sovereignty is not embellished; and

That the Senate take note of the document.
The Auditor-General’s Report No. 1 of 2005-06 into the management of detention centre contracts was received by the Senate about a month ago. Normally, the Auditor-General’s reports would strike people as worthy perhaps, but not necessarily the most riveting of documents. It is written in audit speak, as it should be. The fact is that this report is an extraordinarily damning indication of the hopeless management, just on the financial and accountability side, of our detention centres. We might think there could not be much more that could damn the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The fact is that this particular audit report from the Auditor-General is an absolutely appalling indictment of the financial arrangements, accountability mechanisms, oversights and general mechanisms put in place in relation to the management of our detention centres.
Our detention centres are contracted out by the federal immigration department to GSL, and there are various further subcontractual arrangements with caterers, health professionals and other people. The simple fact is that even those people in the community who support mandatory detention and long-term indefinite detention of detainees should be outraged because they are getting such a raw deal—as is every single other taxpayer in the country—from the arrangements that have been in place. As this report clearly shows, those arrangements have not in any way delivered anything remotely meeting value for money. In my view, as someone who does not support mandatory detention, we do not need to be spending anywhere near this amount of money anyway. The fact is that the way it has been set up, as the report makes clear, does not enable, and has not enabled for a long period of time, the immigration department to know whether or not the contractors are actually meeting the requirements under their contracts. That does not just mean poor value for money; it also means that there are no proper mechanisms in place to ensure that they are doing the job they are supposed to be doing. That means all of the repeated assurances we have had from minister after minister, year after year, that things are done in a certain way and everything is fine because of the requirements that are in place, cannot be believed. I am not sure that they could be believed anyway, but they clearly cannot be believed because the minister and the department were not in a position to know whether those things were being done in accordance with the requirements they had in place.
As this report made clear, there is no way that the department could have ever clearly ascertained whether the various benchmarks were being met. Partly because of the vague and imprecise way in which they were written, it was very difficult to ascertain how to measure it anyway and, because of the reporting mechanisms and other things that were in place and the lack of independent oversight, there was no way to guarantee the adequacy of the reports and the performance that was occurring. I do not think that that was any particular accident. I do not actually think it was a bit of sloppy bookkeeping. I think it made life a lot easier for the department, the minister and the government to not be able to find out these things. If it cost a bit of extra money in sloppy bookkeeping and not being able to ensure good value for money, that was a price worth paying to enable them to basically have the problem out of sight and out of mind.
Sometimes you wonder how we could possibly have ended up with situations such as those involving Cornelia Rau, Vivian Solon and the hundreds of other cases that have now been referred to the Ombudsman—and the many other cases beyond that—that clearly showed bizarre decision making and failures in duty of care at the most basic level. Some of the reasons go back to the way the contracts were structured and the contracting-out arrangements put in place by the government many years ago. That is why I say Auditor-General reports are important, even though they might seem somewhat dry from time to time. It is not just a matter of value for money; it is a matter of transparency and of knowing that the job that is supposedly being done is actually being done and is being done properly and well.
That is why we have ended up with the further expense of people going to the bizarre lengths of having to take out court action to get detention centre operators to provide health care for people. People who had mental illnesses had to get court action to access proper mental health treatment. How inefficient can you get? How appalling in terms of the human cost, of course. As the court found, there was a basic failure of duty of care. As the court judgment also found, just in that particular arrangement with the subcontracting out of the health areas, there were hopeless lines of authority and accountability. In effect, at the end of it all, nobody had responsibility for some of these issues. That is why people do not just fall through the cracks; they go plummeting through great chasms and holes.
I believe it is almost certainly deliberately set out that way. The fact is that that is the consequence. It is the reason the whole issue of contracting out in the first place is a serious problem. We had this debate to some extent earlier on today with the detention of illegal fishers. This involves the same issue whereby detention arrangements are contracted out to private operators. That is one of the reasons the Democrats have a key problem with this, and we have consistently held that view over many years. It is bad policy. It is bad practice, purely in a management sense, in some of those areas such as custodial activities to be contracting out. It is bad for transparency. It is bad value for money and that has flow-on consequences in terms of human cost and the impact on duty of care.
The other point that has to be made about this audit report is that it was not the first time those problems have been identified. Whilst the fact that the department has said, ‘Yes, we accept the recommendations,’ should be welcomed, it should not be sufficient to satisfy people, because the same sorts of problems have been identified before by previous audit reports. The department has said, ‘Yes, we accept that,’ and then nothing has happened. That has to be followed up, in the same way that so many other issues that have come to light and have shown the absolute debacle of immigration management in a whole range of areas have to be followed up. This is just a symptom; it is not the whole problem.
As we have seen from answers supplied after the Senate estimates process, which have come through just in the last couple of days, the cost to the taxpayer to put guards in the psychiatric hospital at Glenside in Adelaide was about 10 times more than the cost of simply providing health care for those people. The absurd obsession with custody, detention and viewing people with a security approach rather than with a duty of care and health approach has meant that tenfold the amount of resources are being spent on paying private guards in secure mental health facilities purely to guard individual immigration detainees who are in those places. We see that $1 million is being spent in less than a year simply to pay guards to be at these places that are already secure facilities, anyway. I have visited detainees in hospitals who were too ill to get out of bed but were still required to be in the line of sight of two guards for 24 hours a day. That is the level of absurdity and inefficiencies that we have got to. Some of it goes right back to the issues that are identified in this audit report. They are just another aspect of the absolute scandal that is the whole migration area and its administration in this country. It is another reminder of why we have to have comprehensive reform, beyond just a bit of shuffling of some of the people in various positions.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 1 of 2005-06</title>,AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS,31,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-10,"—by leave—Over nine long years the Howard government has demonstrated that it has no idea what it is doing when it comes to immigration. For almost as long as this government has been in power, since November 1997, the provision of detention services at Australia’s immigration detention centres has been outsourced to private organisations. Between 1997 and February 2004, detention services at mainland immigration centres were provided by Australasian Correctional Services. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs signed a contract with Group 4 Falck in August 2003. Group 4 Falck changed its name to Global Solutions Ltd or, as it is more commonly referred to, GSL.
The four-year contract contains an option for the Commonwealth to extend it for a further three years but, after the recent unmasking of the serious mismanagement and the problems within the department of immigration, we have to question whether this is still an appropriate course or, instead, is another example of how the Howard government is incompetent in managing the detention centre regime. So far in 2005, we have seen the result of a total systemic failure within the department that has been going on for nine years. In February, two Baxter detainees took their case to the Federal Court, alleging negligence. During the same month Minister Vanstone announced that an inquiry would be held into the wrongful detention of Australian permanent resident Cornelia Rau, and we have now had the Palmer report. Minister Vanstone also announced during that month that an inquiry would be held into the Vivian Solon matter, which the Ombudsman is now conducting.
Those cases occurred after the management of detention centres was transferred to a private company, GSL. Whether or not GSL is to blame, I think the government is. The recent ANAO report into the management of detention centre contracts found that this government is so out of touch that it believes that $6 million was well spent in transferring the management of these centres to GSL. Furthermore, a number of failures and omissions and an unclear liability indemnity insurance regime within GSL’s contract means it is impossible for the Commonwealth to know with any certainty exactly what is covered by GSL’s insurance. That means it is unclear where liability between the Commonwealth and GSL falls. It allows the Commonwealth to take the blame, the liability and the risk rather than ensuring that the contract manages that. That is another failure in that this government cannot even manage its insurance contract. That is what the ANAO report found.
It also found that, when the contract was signed, DIMIA failed to have in its possession a list of Commonwealth assets and equipment at the detention centres so that what was Commonwealth property and what was the contractor’s property could be determined. The incompetence and failure continued when it came to the monitoring of the contract itself. While in theory DIMIA should have been able to identify poor quality service delivery, the ANAO found that at a number of points within the monitoring and reporting process DIMIA officials exercised considerable discretion as to the extent of what was reported. They could decide what they should or should not report. There was discretion at that point.
The report also found that the lack of clarity in performance standards outlined in the contract made it difficult to assess the performance of GSL. The ANAO reported that DIMIA could not well assess, according to its standards, the performance of GSL. Driving home the extreme Liberal ideology about what an appropriate way to manage immigration detention centres is, the ANAO found that DIMIA’s internal monitoring and reporting arrangements did not define or measure lawful, appropriate, humane or efficient detention. One of the key objectives of contract administration is to demonstrate value for money, but the report found no evidence that DIMIA’s internal reporting arrangements monitored the extent to which expenditure was contributing to the achievement of value for money.
In its report the ANAO has found what I am sure the Australian public have long suspected of this government: that this government has little idea about what is really going on within its own detention centres. What is of real concern is, as in the case of Cornelia Rau, the sheer incompetence and extreme Liberal ideology favoured by the minister which ensured that problems have multiplied and developed into much larger ones until we are faced with the situation we have seen over the last couple of months. The latest outrage orchestrated by GSL and the department saw a group of detainees who were transferred to the Baxter detention centre in the back of a van—a journey of 6½ hours without toilet breaks, food or water, so it seems. Instead of punishing GSL for this and for the errors made during the detention of Cornelia Rau, the minister, according to the Australian Financial Review of August 4, may deliver ‘a handsome financial windfall which comes at the expense of taxpayers’. How is that for out of touch? Why would you give them a windfall in their contract? The minister, it appears, rewards bad behaviour.
It is clear that, after nine years, the Howard government is still unprepared to deal with the most basic issues associated with immigration detention management. It is time for the Howard government and the minister to recognise that it is not good enough. Not only have they left Australia unprepared to deal with the issue of immigration detention in the future, but the situation has become dire. The time for action has passed. The minister should seek further help and assistance, because clearly she cannot do it on her own.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 1 of 2005-06</title>,AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS,31,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I too want to take note of this ANAO report on the detention centre contracts. It is an important report, and it is one that slipped below the radar for many people because we were not here. It was tabled on 7 July, just one day after the Palmer report. It was a sleight of hand that is perhaps indicative of a government that has been in power for nine years too long.
The report makes a very convincing case that DIMIA has no idea what is going on inside its detention centres and that it is simply hoping for the best from its contractor. As Senator Ludwig said earlier, the report bolsters Labor’s argument that the running of detention centres should remain in public hands and should not be contracted out, and this report tells us exactly why. It reveals incompetence, maladministration and arrogance; and, most importantly, it reveals what a shambles the contract was that was drawn up by DIMIA. The report states:
… the Contract does not adequately specify key responsibilities that are to be met, either by DIMIA or GSL. In particular, clear and consistent definitions are not provided for health standards that are central to detainee welfare. For example; Duty of Care, and the specific obligations for a subcontractor supplying psychological services …
The deficiencies in the supply of health and psychiatric services, and, more generally, the inadequacy of the contract between DIMIA and GSL, could not have been given a more tragically human and Australian face than the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez Solon. The Palmer report, which scratches the surface of these cases, went further, stating:
The current detention service contract with GSL is flawed and does not allow for the delivery of immigration detention policy outcomes that are expected by the government. It is onerous in its application, lacks focus in its performance audit and monitoring arrangements, and transfers risk to the service provider. The contract places little emphasis on service quality or the establishment of an equitable detention environment, which are vital to the success of governance. In essence, the contract describes a master-slave relationship.
After nine years of the Howard government, I am sure that a master-slave relationship would be the key descriptor of all relationships that exist with government ministers. I would go so far as to say that it is endemic throughout the executive. It is a relationship that breeds a culture of blame-shifting, denial, complacency and assumption.
Both the ANAO report and the Palmer report highlight the dangerous culture of assumption and denial that exists within the department—a culture that has overseen the detention and the deportation of mentally ill Australian citizens. It is a culture that did not begin with the department itself but has been passed down from the very top. It has been passed down from the Prime Minister’s cabinet table. We all know about the famous Howard cabinet table, with its remarkably comfortable sheepskin-covered chairs that cost the taxpayers $5,000 each. Perhaps they were sitting on those chairs when they decided that the best way to change the culture of DIMIA was to promote the head of the department. That is right: instead of deploring this type of behaviour, they rewarded it. What message does that send? They promoted a person who, under the direction of Minister Vanstone, nurtured a culture that, according to the ANAO report:
… assumes that detention services are being delivered satisfactorily at each immigration detention centre unless the reporting of an Incident (or repeated Incidents) highlights a problem.
This is the crux of the culture of assumption. Surely the last thing we should do with these centres, this department, or, more importantly, this government, is to assume anything. But that is exactly what has been festering in Minister Vanstone’s department. In the words of Mick Palmer, it is ‘a culture of denial and self-justification’—and, might I add, detestable arrogance.
What other word besides arrogance could you use to describe the unbelievable fact that part A of this ANAO report, dealing with the contract between DIMIA and Australasian Correctional Management, the providers previous to GSL, had not even been seen by DIMIA before the current contract with GSL was settled. That is right: part A of this report, which detailed—surprise, surprise!—many of the same problems outlined in part B, was received by the Senate on 18 June 2004, yet the contract with GSL was signed on 27 August 2003. It really is a joke. This government treats the inquiry process and, in turn, the Australian people with contempt. They sign a contract with a second provider before the report detailing the problems with the first provider has even been postmarked and, after the shocking details of Cornelia Rau are known, they order an inquiry, as damning as it may be, that only has the power to scratch the surface.
Now it is time to dig below the surface. It is time to drag the government off their comfy sheepskin chairs. Put simply, it is time for a royal commission—a royal commission with the power to compel witnesses and crack the culture of denial and secrecy that has gone unchecked within this government, a royal commission called for by the families of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez Solon and a royal commission that fully exposes this government and its ministers as the incompetent, complacent and in many ways dangerous group that they are.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 1 of 2005-06</title>,AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS,31,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2005-08-10,"—I, like my colleagues, also wish to comment on the ANAO audit that was conducted on the management of the detention centre contracts for DIMIA. As has been explained by my colleagues, this report presents yet another damning indictment of the government’s mismanagement of immigration detention centres. You would think that the number of reports beating a path to the minister’s door would tell her that something is seriously wrong with her department’s handling of immigration detention.
The report was to assess DIMIA’s management of contracting for detention centre services, especially focusing on lessons learned from the previous tender, transition and management of those centres. Like most aspects of this unfortunate minister’s portfolio, time and again those lessons have not been learned. Time and again this audit witnessed bungling, inadequate and unclear processes and requirements, a lack of oversight and, most importantly, significant leakage of public money in the management of the contract.
It is important to note that the conditions of detention centres and the mismanagement of cases like Cornelia Rau’s have been considered by other reports. Those reports found that a poisonous organisational culture, inadequate safeguards and poor procedures culminated in the circumstances which are before us now on the public record. This report has found that systematic shortcomings also extend to the management of detention contracts.
The report by the Australian National Audit Office is damning in its findings, which include that the contract does not adequately specify key responsibilities that are to be met, either by DIMIA or GSL—the detention services contractor—and that clear and consistent definitions relating to the health standards that detainees should be able to expect, such as duty of care, accessibility of psychological services and the like, are not provided. The Audit Office also found that oversight mechanisms, including monitoring of subcontractor arrangements for their compliance with intended outcomes, are lacking. We have a contract whose terms are ambiguous, and the promises made by the contractor, GSL, can be seen as illusionary. In key areas where the terms of the contract should be very clear, such as the standard of services at immigration detention centres, they are precisely the opposite.
In addition to the very human cost behind the government’s failed detention contracting, there are also associated financial costs. The report found that since 2000 over $16.9 million has been paid out or settled by the Commonwealth due to damage caused to detention facilities in disturbances and riots. The contract, however, has placed all the risk on the government, with little clarification of where the liabilities of the day-to-day operators, GSL, should lie. This is because the definition of an incident of disturbance is unclear, as differing descriptions are used throughout the report. This creates confusion in determining liability between the parties. Secondly, there is no mechanism to determine the amount that the service provider is liable for in respect of damages, and the Commonwealth is not protected from service provider’s insurance.
While this is bad enough, there is no satisfactory way of measuring the contractor’s performance in fulfilling its contract. Whilst the contract contains 148 standards and 243 measures of performance, these are meaningless, with over 300 undefined phrases such as ‘timely’, ‘appropriate’ and ‘relevant’. No doubt all these allow the contractor to shirk its responsibilities under the contract.
The report has noted that, despite DIMIA having been in the business of contracting detention since the late 1990s, the costs have been blowing out under the contracting arrangements. Despite detainee numbers falling, costs have been increasing. On current projections, with a contract worth $90 million each year, overheads are close to $30 million. When you add on the $20 million of additional litigation I referred to earlier, the financial losses alone present a compelling case to place detention back in public hands, but this still pales against the human misery associated with this government’s detention policy.
Mr President, if you have an opportunity to read this report from the ANAO, you will be amazed and surprised—or maybe you will not be—at the sheer arrogance with which this department seems to conduct its business. No private industry would conduct its business this way. This government seems to have had many indications that DIMIA is incapable of management and has an organisational problem yet still has not acted on them. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-08-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise to speak on this order of production of documents in relation to the Palmer inquiry. The record of this government in managing immigration is, in short, a complete shambles. It appears that many of the lessons out of the unfortunate detention arrangements are yet to be learnt. The Liberal government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming from its extremist position on immigration—in fact, it dragged its heels the whole way. The Liberal Party has become, in short, blinded by its own extremist ideology. It seems that, in the instance of the immigration detention regime signed up to by this government, the Australian community and its values have been left by the Liberal Party. They are not with the Australian people on this issue. They have departed. Herein lies the source of DIMIA’s problem: its culture. We have been told this by the Palmer inquiry. But it cannot only be the culture within the department itself. You have to look wider and say, ‘Where is the accountability in terms of the department?’ Does the accountability rest with the first secretary, the undersecretary, the officials or the clerks within the department? No, it does not only rest there; the responsibility for the culture rests at the top. The culture is set by the minister’s office and the minister leads the department. That is where the responsibility lies.
The accountability for a department lies with the minister in respect of how the department operates and works. The minister cannot absolve herself from guilt in relation to the culture of the organisation. Yet when you take the Palmer report, what does it say about the extremist culture of the Howard ministry? The answer is that it says absolutely nothing. In fact, if you look at appendix B of the report, it reveals a curious omission. This page contains a list of people whom Mr Palmer interviewed in the preparation of his report. There are some key names missing—names like Mr Ruddock and Senator Vanstone. They are not in the Palmer report. If you were to look at how the Palmer inquiry was going to conduct itself, you would say, ‘We want to get to the bottom of what happened. We want to find out what happened in relation to Ms Cornelia Rau. We want to find out how a department allowed this to happen.’ You would then say, ‘We need to start by looking at the incident. We need to investigate what happened there. We need to interview the relevant people.’ Mr Palmer seems to have done his job diligently in that respect. Although we do not know whether all of the people were interviewed, at least we know that a report was produced and departmental officials were interviewed. But you would also say, ‘We should look at what happened in relation to the minister’s office.’ There may or may not be anything there, but you would at least try and satisfy yourself and say, ‘We should interview the minister and the minister’s office to determine whether they had any involvement or not.’ You would at least try to rule it out, if not to find or apportion blame.
You might then say, ‘We do need to look at whether we apportion blame and whether we need to say the minister’s office or the minister herself is accountable as to how this incident came about.’ I would expect that you would then interview the minister’s office and the officials who may or may not have had any involvement. That does not seem to have been done, despite the fact that Mr Palmer discussed matters pertinent to the inquiry with Senator Vanstone on a regular basis, it seems, as was reported during estimates. No-one in Senator Vanstone’s office—that is, no-one including the minister—was interviewed in the production of his report. But we do know that Senator Vanstone was in consultation with Mr Palmer about the report itself.
We also know that Mr Ruddock was not interviewed. Nor, it appears, were any of his staff. Mr Ruddock, of course, was the minister who was responsible prior to Senator Vanstone. This oversight has left a blemish of mismanagement cover-up by this government. We do not know whether anything has been hidden from us—the opposition—or Mr Palmer about whether there was any involvement of Mr Ruddock or Senator Vanstone. I am not going to make the accusation that there was, but I would have expected that the Palmer inquiry, the Neil Comrie report—which is yet to be made—or the Ombudsman would look at these issues.
We were promised—at least I use the word ‘promised’—guardedly a full inquiry by this government but we have thus far only received half the story. The culture that allegedly pervades DIMIA does not stop within the department itself. The source, if we are to remove it root and branch, must also include the minister’s office. That is where we also have to look. If you do not have a complete inquiry, if you do not go and look at those other areas, there will always be the suggestion that there has been a cover-up. Mr Palmer took the job on but, in my view, he never stood a chance with one arm tied behind his back.
It is a matter of established fact that Ms Cornelia Rau wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs while in detention to appeal for her release. Were the circumstances of that contact investigated by Mr Palmer? Not as far as we know on reading the report. How can that be a full and thorough investigation of the case, when there has been no interview with the minister who was written to and who could ultimately have ordered Ms Rau’s release? It is a hole that should have been filled, but it is not too late. The minister can redress that. The minister can take up the issue with Mr Comrie and with the Ombudsman and say, ‘I am open to being interviewed. I am open to my staff being interviewed to work out the sorry mess that surrounds these matters.’
Let us look at the preliminary findings of the Alvarez case as well, and ask this question: would a full and adequate investigation leave one of the main protagonists in that affair out of the inquiry? That is exactly what happened. Senator Vanstone’s right-hand person, the chief of staff, Dr Nation, was the prism through which all of the contact between DIMIA and Ms Alvarez’s former husband, Mr Young, occurred. That means that every conversation with Mr Young, then DIMIA’s primary contact in relation to the case, occurred through the filter of the minister’s office. That is what the record tells us: that at the time it was realised that the person was an Australian citizen, was deported by DIMIA and was subsequently found, Mr Young’s contact was through Dr Nation.
What a surprise it was, then, to learn that Ms Alvarez’s former husband and Dr Nation of the minister’s office came to an agreement, it seems, to conceal from public knowledge for a vital short period that an Australian citizen, Ms Alvarez, had been deported. Yet this is exactly what we heard at Senate estimates. For the benefit of senators who were not at the committee late that night, let me quote directly from the Hansard. Senator Evans asked:
How did you know Mr Young wanted it kept quiet?
Mr Killesteyn replied:
That was a matter that was discussed between Dr Nation, the minister’s chief of staff, and Mr Young at the time.
Senator Chris Evans then asked:
But no-one at DIMIA had actually spoken to Mr Young.
Mr Killesteyn replied:
No. We had a view that this was a serious matter and that we should treat it as such. As a consequence, we think the matter was appropriately dealt with by personal contact between Dr Nation and Mr Young to show that we were treating it seriously and that we were in the process of searching for Ms Solon.
That seems odd to me, and I think it would seem odd to anyone in this chamber as well. It is inconceivable to me that this investigation could be considered adequate in terms of the report when one of the principals in the case has not been asked about his involvement in the matter. Yet the minister’s office still remains, as far as I can determine, unanswerable to Mr Palmer. We will find out whether or not the minister’s office is answerable to Mr Neil Comrie’s or the Ombudsman’s reports. The Australian public have a right to know what went on. The central issue is that there needs to be full and frank disclosure. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-08-10,"—It is always disappointing to me and I find it, in fact, somewhat unseemly when there is a real human tragedy which occurs as a result of somebody falling within the machinery of government and being treated badly that non-government political parties in this place leap upon it with alacrity and seeming glee and say to themselves, ‘Aha, here is a wonderful opportunity for us to score a political point against the government.’ Perhaps I am a little too sensitive, but I think that there does come a point at which respect for the people concerned should abjure being gleefully and recklessly political about human tragedy. So I am going to try to avoid being too political in this speech and merely record the facts.
The core fact of this case is that in the administrative processes of the department of immigration two very grave errors were made, which had terrible consequences for two particular people: Ms Rau and Ms Solon. When that came to light, the government appointed Mr Palmer, a respected former federal police commissioner, to get to the bottom of it.
Let us put this in context. In the last five years the department of immigration has processed, in one manner or another, some 80,000 unlawful entrants and other persons of interest. Without for a moment excusing what happened in these two cases, it does not strike me as beyond the ordinary ken of human affairs that, when one is dealing with a case load of that magnitude, occasional mistakes are made—two out of 80,000, in this case. They were serious mistakes with tragic consequences; nevertheless, they were mistakes made within a machinery of government which processes tens of thousands of people. That is the first point.
The second point is this: one judges whether or not there is culpability by the government and by the minister by considering the response of the government and the minister. What did the government do? As I said a moment ago, the government appointed Mr Palmer—who, as anyone who knows him either personally or by reputation knows, is a demanding, no-nonsense investigator—and asked him to get to the bottom of the matter. His appointment was announced shortly after these cases came to light. He conducted a searching investigation, he delivered a report to the government, and the Prime Minister and Senator Vanstone announced on 14 July that, in the broad, the recommendations of the report would be accepted. There is no suggestion of personal culpability by the minister. No such suggestion could be seriously made by any intelligent person. The report found that, among case officers, errors were made in respect of these two people. Mr Palmer identified those errors, and the government accepted what he said.
The government apologised to the two persons concerned, as it quite properly ought to have done. Mr Palmer also recommended that changes be made to the systems and processes within the department, and the government, in a frank and self-critical way, accepted those recommendations and has committed itself to those processes.
In these two cases, framed in the context of two human tragedies which really should be immune from cheap political point scoring, we have systemic problems identified. The problems having been identified, the government responded with alacrity. Anyone who has acquainted themselves with the facts would agree that the government’s response has been characterised by candour, transparency and responsiveness—but you would not think that from listening to the rhetoric that we have heard from Senator Ludwig. You would not hear that listening to the rhetoric of some on the other side of the chamber. And that is a shame.
In my former profession as a barrister, to be accused of engaging in rhetoric was a high professional insult because it suggested that the person concerned was more interested in the beauty of their own words, more interested in scoring a point, than in critically and clinically assessing facts. Rhetoric has an honoured place in politics but, when one is dealing with specific instances of conduct which tragically affect the lives of two Australians, it would be nice to hope that we might ascend above rhetoric and show a bit of integrity to the facts of the two cases. That is what Mr Palmer has done, and the government has taken his advice.
Let me give an example. We have heard a lot of high-blown rhetoric about children behind razor wire in the Baxter detention centre. Those who trouble to read the Palmer report, as opposed to reading the rhetorical talking points published by the Australian Labor Party, will have found that Mr Palmer had this to say:
Many of the stories about Baxter that circulate and have become folklore are just that.
…         …         …
Descriptions of hell and razor wire have been aired on television file footage. There is no razor wire at Baxter; the stories relate to Woomera, which was closed in April 2003.
Reference has been made to cells and bars. At Baxter there are rooms with doors and windows.
The Management Unit is represented as a punishment cell where no light enters and where people are incarcerated 24 hours a day. There are 10 single rooms, each with a door, a window, toilet and shower facilities, and a mattress. Detainees are permitted limited periods in outside courtyards.
…         …         …
It has been claimed that lights in ‘cells’ are left on all night to intimidate detainees. There is a light switch in every room.
Although they were critical about a number of aspects of Baxter life, the detainees interviewed by the Inquiry did not complain of poor or malicious treatment. They also said that they had never witnessed mistreatment of Anna and rejected many of the popular claims made about her behaviour …
That appears at pages 57 and 58 of the Palmer report.
Let me close where I began. When dealing with a case of a human tragedy, we have a particular responsibility to exercise a bit of discretion and sensitivity. As ethical legislators, we have an obligation to maintain fidelity to the facts. I would have thought that we have an obligation to this institution not to wrap the facts of a human tragedy in the easy, lazy guise of rhetoric in order to score a political point. Something badly wrong was done here, in two of the 80,000 cases that DIMIA handled in the period under review. It was identified, the procedures have been corrected, and the government has apologised in a frank and self-critical way.",SENATE,<title>PALMER REPORT</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,35,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—This is the first opportunity for the Senate to note the report. I think that aspects of what Senator Brandis said need to be responded to, even though he has left the chamber so he will not be hearing this. He talked about the Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon incidents as being real human tragedies. There is no doubt about that. But this is not about just one or two tragedies. The one or two cases detailed in this report are simply one or two amongst many tragedies. That reflects a situation that is not a tragedy but an abomination.
Senator Brandis talked about fidelity to the facts, and I agree with him on that. The problem is that many of the findings contained in the Palmer report are consistent with findings that have been made time and time again by Senate committees, by the government’s independent advisory group into detention centres, by parliamentary committees, by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, by the Ombudsman and by international organisations. All of those findings and facts were continually dismissed, belittled and waved aside with the sort of political rhetoric that Senator Brandis so rightly criticised as having no substance and simply being about scoring political points.
It is easy to score political points demonising vulnerable people and ignoring the situation the powerless are in. There is no group that is easier to score political points against than the powerless. The inevitable consequences of that are the human tragedies that Senator Brandis so rightly decried. Whilst I do not know who he specifically had in mind when he talked about people gleefully and recklessly exploiting this situation, I can assure him and the government that I am not gleeful at all about this. I am extremely angry and outraged that this has continued to occur for so long.
Let me remind the Senate also as we talk about this that one of the people who are the subject of this tragedy, Ms Solon, is still enduring that tragedy. She is still in Manila and not able to return to the country that she has been a citizen of for a long time. I saw in the Senate committee the other day an email that was tabled from her ex-husband. I am not sure if it has been published yet, so I will not read it word for word. It had finally got through to somebody who paid attention to it. He had tried a number of times over the years with phone calls and other things to clarify what might have happened. That email specifically mentioned Ms Solon’s children just wanting to know what had happened to their mother. That woman has still not been able to reunite with her children. I would urge the government to deal at least with that situation and do what is necessary to enable her to get back into Australia.
The suggestion was also made that basically this is a terrible situation—and we all agree with that—but things just went wrong with the administrative process. I assert very strongly that it was not just a matter of wonderful administrative processes that just had a glitch or two which caused terrible tragedies. It was an inevitable consequence of the law that this parliament and this Senate passed. I have to continually re-emphasise the point that those laws were continually passed by both major parties in this place. It is the policy underpinning those laws that makes these sorts of situations inevitable. I will look specifically at the categorical and unequivocal findings of this report. Main finding No. 4 was:
There is no automatic process of review sufficient to provide confidence to the Government, to the Secretary of DIMIA or to the public that the power to detain a person on reasonable suspicion of being an unlawful non-citizen ... is being exercised lawfully, justifiably and with integrity.
That goes to the heart of the key problem that is still in the law. The law gives public servants the power to lock somebody up on reasonable suspicion that does not have to be proved in front of any independent body. When you give people that sort of extreme power to take somebody’s freedom away and lock them up for an indefinite period of time purely on a suspicion that does not need to be backed up and proved with solid evidence before an independent body, it is almost inevitable that you will have inappropriate uses of it and people being jailed wrongly, if not unlawfully—depending on how trickily the law is written—but certainly not justifiably or with integrity.
Mr Palmer spoke about a serious cultural problem within DIMIA’s immigration compliance and detection areas. Let me emphasise that this problem is much wider than simply dealing with asylum seekers. The compliance mentality infects huge amounts of the migration department. But it has to be emphasised that you cannot change the culture simply by changing some personnel in the administration. The culture comes from the law and from the policy, and that is driven by the government.
There is no doubt that the chief lyric writer and lead singer for this culture club is the Prime Minister. The guiding anthem that directed the band of workers in the immigration department was the Prime Minister’s rhetoric of, ‘We shall decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come,’ and the continual underlying message of that repeated again and again is that it is the government that will decide. It is not due process. It is not an independent body. It is sure as hell not going to be the courts. It is not the law. It is the government: ‘We’ll decide, and that’s that.’ That fundamentally undermines the rule of law. As Mr Palmer himself said in the very first line—the first principle—of his report:
The protection of individual liberty is at the heart of Australian democracy.
This law, this policy that drives this culture strikes at the heart of Australian democracy.
We just heard a firebrand speech from Senator Ronaldson. I congratulate him on his first speech, where he specified the rule of law as being non-negotiable for him—very firm. Here is his chance to demonstrate it in the very next debate. When we will be dealing with another change to the law, he will have a chance to demonstrate whether or not he actually supports the rule of law and the fundamental principle at the heart of it—the right to individual liberty, the right not to be locked up indefinitely without due process. It is pretty hard to think of other more significant things than that when you are talking about the rule of law.
This report makes a finding that Ms Rau was locked up in the Brisbane Women’s Correctional Centre for six months as an immigration detainee. Mr Palmer says not just that she was not a prisoner—that she had not done anything wrong—but that she was put there for administrative convenience. We can lock somebody up in a jail for six months for administrative convenience—that is what the law allows, that is what the policy encourages. Mr Palmer said:
There are serious problems with the handling of immigration detention cases. They stem from deep-seated cultural and attitudinal problems within DIMIA and a failure of executive leadership in the immigration compliance and detention areas.
This failure of leadership has to go right to the top or the term ‘leadership’ means nothing. This is not just a tragedy; this is a damning indictment that is consistent with report after report. You cannot deal with it just by changing a few people lower down the cogs in the machine. You have to change the whole tune. You have to change the law. I and the Democrats will continue to push until those changes are made. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—I move:
That the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 6), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 171 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
We will not get through the debate on this today; I guess it will be finalised tomorrow. In many ways this continues on from the contribution I just made going to the heart of some of the issues addressed in the Palmer report on the inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau. That might seem like a bit of a leap when dealing with this regulation, which excises thousands of islands around the coast of Australia from the migration zone and has the effect of basically preventing any unauthorised noncitizen in those places from making a claim for a protection visa, or any other visa, under the Migration Act.
You might say: what has that got to do with Cornelia Rau, who was not an asylum seeker at all? She, of course, was an Australian resident detained inappropriately. The common link is the issue of the rule of law, which I was talking about, and the real problems that were identified in the Palmer report around the culture of the immigration department, which was driven, in my view, by the government’s policy and rhetoric—not least the Prime Minister’s rhetoric. The sorts of extreme human tragedies and disgraceful outcomes that have occurred are a direct consequence of the existing laws and the department’s inability to operate in a humane and justifiable way within those laws. Knowing what we know about the immigration department’s inability to act effectively, coherently, with integrity and fairness and a duty of care within the existing laws, not just from the Palmer report but from many other things that have come to light in recent months—and over a longer period of time—how much more dangerous is it to allow regulations through that give the government and Commonwealth officers, including the department of immigration, the ability to operate completely outside any legal framework at all? That is the key thing these regulations do. That is what the excise of islands from the migration zone means. That is why this is such a fundamentally important matter.
In some respects it could be suggested that this is not that crucial. There have been no boat arrivals of asylum seekers in recent times—which is a good thing—so it is not likely to affect many people. Most of the islands that are going to be excised are not where asylum seekers are likely to land. I think the islands to be excised go all the way down the Queensland coast to about the Tropic of Capricorn near Rockhampton, so all of those islands—the Barrier Reef islands et cetera—are completely irrelevant in terms of the migration zone and where people are likely to arrive. Similarly with most of the other islands involved—the mainland is much closer for most people who would be coming. In that respect, it is basically a symbolic action on the part of the government.
Part of it is to create the perception, an almost subconscious perception, of a barrier around the top of the country—that all of the islands around the top of the country that are not really part of the migration zone are like a protective barrier. The fact that the vast majority of them, 95 per cent of them, are not islands that any asylum seekers are ever going to go near is beside the point. It reinforces the notion that we need to be protected from these people, a notion that goes deep into the psyche of Australian history, of course. The White Australia policy was one of the things that drove Federation itself and the needs of the colonies to draw together into one nation.
But the facts are that we do not need a protective barrier, they do not provide a protective barrier and there is nothing particularly special about an island in any legal sense. That is why the principle is so important, because these regulations say that it is okay for parts of Australia. In this case it happens to be islands, but there is nothing legally or constitutionally special about islands. The same could apply to any part of Australia in a legal sense. In effect, this withdraws part of Australia from the refugee convention in all but name. It removes the refugee convention from the Migration Act or from having any legal application. We are still signed up to it in an international sense but it no longer has any legal application. No longer would any refugee in these parts of Australia have any legally enforceable right. It takes away a legally enforceable right for somebody to seek protection from persecution. That, I suggest, is an extremely serious action.
It is also about the principle that the Migration Act, with all its flaws—and God knows it has got a few—is clearly not applying at all in that area; the law does not apply in relation to migration issues in these parts of Australia. It is saying that laws do not have to apply. Commonwealth officers can operate outside the law in these chunks of Australia, around which we just happen to draw a line. In this case we draw a line around the islands. We could draw it through the middle of Australia. We could recreate the Brisbane Line. We could just make it the ACT or, as has been suggested, we could just put the carpet in front of the minister’s desk and say, ‘Until you get to there, you cannot claim asylum.’
As the only member of this Senate who has been to Nauru, where this policy, if you like, applies in practice, I know the human cost, and the financial cost—for people who simply want to take that approach to it—to Australia of this whole system. The Australian government says it still applies its obligations under the refugee convention and people who get to these islands and seek asylum will not just be flicked back; they will be assessed, according to this government’s policy, by Immigration officials under their interpretation of the refugee convention.
Firstly, there is nothing to stop any future government from ignoring that and flicking people back even if they do get to Australia. Secondly, there is no legally enforceable right to any appeal. We saw on Nauru that people were assessed by Immigration officers under their interpretation of the refugee convention. If they failed, they appealed to another DIMIA officer, and that was that. If there was enough political pressure from people in Australia or enough representation to the minister, then they were reassessed again by another DIMIA officer. In some cases, after further pressure and further concern and further information coming to light, they were reassessed again by another DIMIA officer.
I have seen the paperwork of some of these assessments—the paperwork of people whose claims have been assessed—and decisions that are just cut-and-paste jobs from previous decisions. They are appalling, sloppy, incompetent—to be polite—processes. Under any form of independent assessment—even the flawed ones in Australia—they would not have lasted a second. But the people who did those assessments knew that they would not be independently assessed so, inevitably, particularly with political pressure being applied, they did a sloppier job because they knew they were not being watched. They knew there was a chance—it is not what turned out to be the case—that those assessments would never be seen by anybody. The asylum seekers were meant to be failed and then pressured to go back straightaway.
It is clear evidence that when you do not have those independent checks and balances your decision-making quality declines massively. In issues like this where we are, by definition, dealing with life and death issues, that is completely unacceptable. Again, when we have the evidence before us with the Palmer report of how badly we handle things under a legal framework, how much more appalling is it to have regulations put in place that will actually allow government officers to operate outside the legal framework?

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-08-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document details livestock mortalities for sea exports for the reporting period for the first part of the year. This is a recent initiative, so in that sense I should congratulate the government for the transparency involved in providing these statistics directly to the parliament. It does show statistics and percentages that are below what has been the case in the past. In that sense, I think it is a positive situation, but it also shows the enormity of the numbers that are involved. The size of some of these shipments is really quite staggering, particularly with regard to sheep, where you have shipments of 90,000 or 100,000 animals at sea for over three weeks, or 25 days in some cases. So even when you have a one per cent mortality rate you are still talking about up to 1,000 animals dying on the voyage.
A lot of people say, ‘They’re going to die anyway when they get to the other end. What difference does it make?’ I think there are two key issues there. Firstly, nobody should underestimate how stressful transportation is for large animals, for livestock. We are not talking about flies here. We are talking about mammals—large mammals; sentient mammals—that are clearly capable of significant suffering. They are usually animals that have firstly had to spend a number of days on trucks. I have seen some of those trucks going into the port—for example, at Fremantle. They are not having fun, those animals, I can tell you. Then they get herded onto an enormous carrier and spend another three to four weeks at sea before they get offloaded at the other end.
Parliamentarians can no longer pretend that we do not know what happens to the animals at the other end, because people have taken the trouble to go there and film what happens and it has been screened on television in Australia. We know that those animals are subjected to breathtaking cruelty, which is literally almost impossible to watch—certainly if you have a squeamish stomach. The mechanisms that are used for slaughter are appalling in their cruelty.
It shows that the fraudulent excuse often used to justify this trade for many years—that we had to ship them live because they had to be slaughtered in a way appropriate for halal purposes—clearly does not apply in many cases, and there is documented evidence of that. I should also emphasise that we have halal certification in Australia and indeed there was a very significant increase in the amount of carcase meat and frozen meat that went to Saudi Arabia during the period when the live export trade was halted. So the fraudulent claim that there is no market for this slaughtered meat is wrong.
I recognise that the owners of the livestock get extra money up front for live trade and that is why they do it—that is the way economics works. But to say there is no market there for slaughtered meat is wrong; to say that they have to do it there in a halal way is wrong; to say that it does not take jobs in Australia is wrong. All of those things are incorrect. All of them have been used to justify this trade which, I should remind the Senate, a committee of this chamber found 20 years ago should be halted on welfare grounds. The committee found that if the trade was being assessed purely on animal welfare grounds, it should be halted.
I believe there are plenty of other alternative trades available, in terms of both economic and job opportunities. If they had the same amount of money and energy put into them, they would clearly have just as much economic value for Australia and would certainly mean dramatically reduced animal suffering. I would also remind the Senate of a significant court case before the courts in Western Australia alleging breaches of the Animal Cruelty Act over there, despite efforts of governments to turn a blind eye for many years.
While the decline in mortality revealed in these statistics is welcome, I do not think that they should be in any way used as a cloak to suggest that the cruelty and suffering are not still happening. I note for the Senate’s benefit that I today moved a disallowance motion on the instrument that reinitiated the live animal trade to Saudi Arabia. I do not expect that to succeed, but it is important to have that debate and for people to put on the record their views about that particular issue. I also remind the Senate that this is an issue that has had more expressions of public concern via signatures on petitions than any other issue in the last three or four years. It is an issue that concerns a lot of Australians. It is an issue that people have been turning a blind eye to for far too long. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,"<title>Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</title>",DOCUMENTS,44,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-08-10,"—I want to make some observations this evening on several matters regarding Australia’s regional relations in particular. Firstly, I note with pleasure that Australia will be attending the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur in December. That is a very important opportunity for Australia to participate in a key regional forum. In fact, the development of the focus in East Asia is one we have been watching very closely for some time. This is a very important part of that process.
I was also very pleased recently to see that the expertise of a certain prominent Australian formerly of another place continues to be harnessed even though he has left that place. On 29 June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced the establishment of the Australia-Thailand Institute, which is intended to further the bilateral relationship between Australia and Thailand and to expand the links between our two nations. The head of that new institute will be the eminently well qualified former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Tim Fischer AC.
I have personally always very much valued Mr Fischer’s advice and his knowledge and leadership in international affairs generally but most particularly in relation to our region—and, prominently, his experience and his interest in Thailand also. He was in fact pivotal in my own introduction to Thailand. I was encouraged to engage with colleagues and associates and form very important and ongoing relationships with that particular country. As Minister for Trade, he continued that very important groundwork. His leadership and his personal knowledge will bring a particular character to the institute and will enable us to develop that very important relationship.
He joins with a number of other prominent Australians on the institute. Its executive committee will also include Dr Vijoleta Braach-Maksvytis, Director of CSIRO Global Development; Mr Mike Courtnall, President Asian Building and Manufacturing Markets of BlueScope Steel; Mr Peter Hendy, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Mr Doug Hall, Director of the Queensland Art Gallery; Prue Holstein, Executive Director of the Asia Society; Professor Tony Milner, Dean of Asian Studies at the Australian National University; and Sidney Myer of the Myer Foundation. The membership of the executive committee is very varied, and I think that shows the depth and breadth of our relationship with Thailand, including culture, business, agriculture and technology. The very basis of our important relationships in Asia developed there. I am pleased to make those observations.
We will also of course be furthering our engagement on a trade basis through the FTA which commenced its operation in January. We have a number of endeavours in counter-terrorism and law enforcement with Thailand. It is a very important issue in this region at this time, as many commentators are saying at the moment. The work on the agreement on bilateral cooperation, which was signed by our respective governments last July, will also strengthen special opportunities in science and technology, public sector reform and the environment.
There is also another matter of ongoing interest to me. I would like to make some observations concerning the international effort, and Australia’s role at the forefront of that in our region, to address the challenge that HIV-AIDS presents regionally. Recently, in July, we sent a delegation to the seventh International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, known as the ICAAP. The sixth ICAAP was held in Melbourne a couple of years ago. It was a very successful and important initiative for Australia to host. It is a key meeting for stakeholders in our region to share information and to share experiences in fighting the epidemic.
One of the reasons that the ICAAP works so well is that it is not just about well-paid experts and internationally known faces and figures making their views public and having an opportunity to speak about the issue; it involves so many people from the Asia-Pacific region, where we face such a significant challenge. Australia sponsored over 50 participants from developing countries who otherwise would never have had the chance to attend. I think that is a very tangible aspect of our work in this area. Our special representative on HIV-AIDS, Annmaree O’Keeffe, who does an exceptional job in that role, was also able to chair a session of the congress—part of the recognition of leadership as a key component in the effective response to HIV-AIDS. That relates directly back to the role of the Asia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV and the work that they are doing.
I want to congratulate the organisers of the seventh ICAAP, held in Kobe in Japan last month. I particularly note the involvement of Marina Mahathir, who was a member of the congress’s International Advisory Committee. She is currently president of the Malaysian AIDS Council and chairman of the board of trustees of the Malaysian AIDS Foundation. The role she plays in this region cannot be underestimated. I recently had a useful opportunity to catch up with Marina Mahathir to discuss the work that she is doing in this area and, most particularly, the importance of addressing the challenge that we face in the Asia-Pacific.
There are already more than eight million people in this region living with HIV-AIDS, so we must have a broad, continuous, consistent commitment to implementing effective measures to halt the development of HIV. In fact, it is interesting to note that a lot of the media observations on the spread of HIV internationally still focus on Africa and the extraordinary and devastating effects of HIV there. But regionally I think it is very important for us as a parliament and as a nation to turn our minds to the devastating potential that exists in the Asia-Pacific and the role that Australia and other countries are playing in addressing that. As it grows in the Asia-Pacific, there are calls to declare the situation a global priority here, just as it is in Africa.
The impact on women is extraordinarily significant. Globally, young women now make up over 60 per cent of 15- to 24-year-olds living with HIV. So the imbalance of economic status, education and power between men and women in these areas is having a direct impact on the rate of female infection and their capacity to look after and protect themselves. In fact, Peter Piot, who is the executive director of UNAIDS, noted recently that the imbalance has had a very devastating effect in the Asia-Pacific. In this region, 30 per cent of young women are married before the age of 15 and 62 per cent are married before the age of 18, often to much older husbands. In many countries in our regions, it is husbands in those partnerships who represent the primary source of infection, not just for their wives but for other women. These are extraordinarily difficult issues to grapple with culturally, socially, politically, economically and in security terms.
The pursuit that we have taken in this region, through the Asia-Pacific Leadership Forum, through the work of our HIV-AIDS special representative and through the ongoing work of AusAID is a very important component to addressing some of these challenges. I want to note that we contributed a further $20 million this year to the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria as part of our ongoing $75 million commitment to that fund. I met slightly earlier in the year with Dr Richard Feachem, the executive director of the global fund. He emphasised to me at the time the importance of Australia’s ongoing leadership role and the importance of our continuing with that role.
I would also like to note in the Senate and to welcome the appointment of a very important Australian participant in the global fund. Recently Helen Evans was appointed to serve as the global fund secretariat’s first deputy executive director. Her role will be to oversee the performance and management of the fund’s secretariat, which reflects the rapid growth of the organisation, including its expanding portfolio of grants in over 128 countries. To date the global fund has committed in excess of $US3 billion to support aggressive interventions against HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria. The positives for us in having an Australian in such a key role are obvious. It is an important level of engagement, and it is a testament to the drive and professionalism of all Australian personnel who are working on these issues that they generally—and obviously Helen Evans specifically—are held in such high regard.
I want to note in the brief time remaining to me some aspects of the recently released final report on the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, known as RAMSI. That report by the eminent persons group which was appointed by the Solomon Islands forum, at the request of Prime Minister Sir Allan Kemakeza, came to public note in July. It highlights the progress made by RAMSI in two years—very important progress in relation to law and order, countercorruption measures and so on. It is also important to note in the Senate that there is still much work to be done and we welcome Australia’s participation. (Time expired)
