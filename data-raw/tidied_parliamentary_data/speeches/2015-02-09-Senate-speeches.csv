Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:02):  I am in continuation from last year but, given that that was some time ago, I will remind the chamber about where I was coming from at the time. I can see the smile on your face, Mr President, because you remember the occasion very well, I am sure.


As I was articulating in that short time last time, the Australian Greens are extremely concerned about the fast-tracking of intercountry adoption processes. We have seen the trauma that can be caused by flawed adoption practices to the child, the relinquishing family and the adoptive family. For some, there is an assumption that adoption automatically leads to a better outcome for the child. We obviously understand the very deep—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  Excuse me, Mr President. I am sorry. It is slightly distracting.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes. Could I ask senators to keep any noise down and maybe have meetings outside of the chamber.




Senator SIEWERT:
  As I was saying, there is an assumption that adoption automatically leads to a better outcome for the child that is being adopted, and obviously on many occasions that is true, but there are many that it is not true for.


We obviously understand the deep desire for people to become parents. For those of us who do have children, it really is impossible for us to imagine what it must be like to want to have children and to be unable to. However, having said that, we in this country know the consequences of some of the adoptive processes for all involved, including the relinquishing parents. I use the term very carefully when I talk about 'relinquishing', because we know from past experiences that parents in some cases were not relinquishing parents. Those children or those babies were taken from those parents.


We know, however, from past experiences that adoption processes can have bad outcomes for the child, obviously for the relinquishing parents but also for the adoptive parents. There is no guarantee that the practices we saw in this country not several decades ago are not in fact being carried out through overseas adoptions. We cannot pretend that we are not aware of the lifelong consequences of adoption for the child who becomes an adult, for the relinquishing parents and for the adoptive family.


We now have high-profile people promoting adoption. While I am sure they are coming from a desire to help children, we cannot allow this to override the need for proper consideration, protections and oversights. We need to ensure we are listening to the evidence based policy and appropriate expert stakeholders, not just on the goodwill of those high-profile people that are pursuing this cause. Sometimes I am deeply concerned adoption could take place at the expense of the child's interests. I will come to the overwhelming need to make sure that we are doing this in the child's interests.


Australia must be vigilant to ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect parents from being coerced into 'relinquishing' their children, to ensure that intercountry adoption is a last resort and there is appropriate post-adoption care, support and services for children and families. The Australian Greens are deeply concerned that the so-called one stop shop, where children may be seen as commodities and the goal is a swift acquisition of them, is not the way to go in adoption. This country has been there. We know the consequences of that swift approach to adoption.


The presumption that adoption is good, that Australian parents are all loving and that children will have a better life here is not a fair assumption to make. What evidence is this based on? I would argue that there is overwhelming evidence to show that, if we are not extremely careful with adoption, it can lead to very poor life outcomes for everybody involved. All legal rights to extended families, heritage, homeland are extinguished. We are deeply concerned that this may occur and that the children have no say in this matter. 


We need to be asking the government on what evidence the decision to facilitate easier and faster overseas adoptions is based. What evidence is relied on to show that this in fact will be in the best interests of the child and that they can guarantee, when they start allowing adoptions from non-Hague countries, that all the concerns that have been raised—and I will go into those in a minute—can be addressed?


I am deeply concerned that the government may be so quickly forgetting the history of child removals and the reports that we have seen in this country: the Bringing them Homereport, the forced adoption reports and the three reports on forgotten Australians and former child migrants. These are lessons that we can never, ever forget in this country. This country has watched the intergenerational harm caused by the displacement of children and by dispossession. We have the legacy of the stolen generations, the forgotten Australians and the travesty of forced adoptions. Those directly affected continue to pay a very heavy price, and I have spoken at length in this place about those costs. Unless we get this right, Australians will unfortunately continue to pay a heavy price socially and a heavy price in terms of the cost to health, because we know it has poor health and life outcomes. Justice will also, we believe, be threatened for these people. 


That takes me to this bill and why we are debating it in this place now. The Greens are concerned about a number of aspects of the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. Allowing intercountry adoption through bilateral agreements outside of the safeguards, transparency and procedures of the Hague convention on intercountry adoption is of concern to us. The bill does not focus on the best interests of the child, and we know where that leads. The bill could facilitate an environment where forced or coerced adoption practices could take place—again, this country knows very well what occurs then. There is the lack of a requirement for adequate post-adoption support services. These concerns were clearly shared and articulated by many submissions and witnesses during the committee inquiry into this bill. There are many risks associated with adoption through bilateral agreements with non-Hague-convention countries. The Hague convention of 1993 set out guidelines which considered the child's interests to be of paramount importance. Bilateral agreement to not necessarily meet the same standards. 


The stated reason for this bill is to cut waiting periods and allow for easier and more convenient adoptions. International Social Service Australia said in evidence to the committee that the benefits to adoptive parents 'are grossly outweighed by the risks associated with adopting children in non-Hague countries'. We know that countries that have a very limited child protection process do not have the capacity to monitor individual cases. In these countries, individuals or criminal organisations can exploit the loopholes in intercountry adoption. As International Social Service Australia's representative said to the committee:


Whilst Australia has signed the convention, it is difficult for Australia to monitor the systems in countries that are adopting children that have not signed the convention. For this reason, I think promoting bilateral agreements with non-Hague countries and finalising adoptions in overseas countries have lots of risks associated. So I do not support this bill.


The Australian Greens are deeply concerned that this bill puts convenience to adoptive parents above the best interests of not only the child but also the birth parents. The Australian Greens argue that the risks outweigh the convenience of speeding up adoption with countries that have not signed the Hague convention. The interests of the child are better protected by the safeguards and standards of the Hague convention, and we would prefer that Australia encourage non-Hague countries to become signatories to the convention rather than simply caving in and doing bilateral agreements with them.


I come to the best interests of the child. The Australian Greens believe that all legislation that affects children must be in the best interests of the child. Evidence to the committee from Dr Gillespie of UNICEF emphasised the need to keep the interests of the child at the centre of the intercountry adoption process. He said:


… we emphasise the best interests of the child test. We note that the CRC, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, talks about 'primary' interests of children whereas the Hague convention talks about consideration of children being 'paramount' in intercountry adoption. UNICEF would not support any dilution of those standards … 


In order to properly protect children and families, the first thing we need to do is work with countries to enhance and improve their child protection systems and supports for the parents of those children through that process. The best interests of the child must stay at the centre of our decision-making process. As UNICEF said:


In the very first instance, the Convention on the Rights of the Child says that a child should be with its own family. 


That is what we should be focusing on: making sure that every possibility is explored for the child to be able to stay with its family. I am not Pollyanna; I know that in many circumstances that is not possible—but that does really need to be at the centre of our thinking. Dr Gillespie went on:


In all circumstances, that is what we should be striving for. If that is not possible—and that is also about why we do development, to try to bolster systems to ensure that children and families can be supported—then that child should stay in its own culture and with family members or extended family members in that country. Again, our job is to help build systems with those foreign governments to make sure those child protection systems are strengthened before we get into this.


…   …   …


If all of that is exhausted—in a way, the convention says that intercountry adoption should be a last resort after those have been exhausted—then we look at how best we can minimise and protect.


Therefore, the Greens think we need to be ensuring that the best interests of the child should be at the centre of this legislation; unfortunately, we do not think this legislation goes far enough to ensure that. 


Now I want to look at forced and coerced adoption, something this country knows a lot about. I remind this chamber that in little over a month we will be acknowledging the second anniversary of the apology to those affected by forced adoption in our own country.


The past forced adoption processes in Australia have caused ongoing trauma. I do not think anybody in this place is unaware of that trauma, to all those involved. As Professor Nahum Mushin, the Chair of the Forced Adoptions Implementation Working Group, noted, the consultation for the submissions on this bill had a 're-traumatising effect' on affected people. In other words, this is an ongoing trauma for all involved.


We have a responsibility to ensure that we do not create situations for such practices to recur. The Australian Greens are very concerned that this bill could assist in making coerced and forced adoption practices more likely. As UNICEF said, it is important to remember that intercountry adoptions can take an extended time because of the complex nature of the process:


… it takes time and due diligence and also that children are genuinely available to be adopted. We do not want to see any more cases where parents adopt into the Australian context only to discover that the child should never have been considered genuinely available for adoption. That is a really complex thing for parents to have to live with. What does that mean then for your parenting, what is meant for your family, what does it mean for the child, what does it mean for the biological family?


Unfortunately, illegal and unethical adoptions are more likely in non-Hague countries. Without due process and systems around child protection, children and families are at risk of exploitation. International Social Service Australia said:


The more bilateral agreements we have with non-Hague countries, the more unethical and unlawful adoptions we are going to have.


As UNICEF said:


… it has been noted in other country contexts that sometimes there is not due process around free, prior and informed consent from parents and situations where parents are actually being pressured to surrender their children to adoption programs.


A deep concern is that by agreeing to non-Hague convention adoptions these practices will occur more.


I would like to talk briefly about post-adoption support, an issue that came up significantly during the inquiry as well. We are concerned that faster adoption processes provided by the bill may mean that important supports and services do not occur. One issue that is not included in the bill is post-adoption support, or adequate post-adoption support. As several of the witnesses stated, appropriate post-adoption support is very important. There is no provision in the bill to ensure that bilateral agreements will be required to have the same standards in post-adoption support and follow-up as the Hague convention. The Hague convention currently requires post-adoption assessments, which usually occur in the first 12 months after the adoption process. There is also follow-up with the relinquishing family from the country of origin.


It was pointed out to the inquiry that it is essential that there is contact and support for the relinquishing family, the child and the adoptive family. There are several issues with post-adoption support, including the need for long-term post-adoption support for both families and adoptees, and also the important support and assessment back in the country of origin in that first year. International Social Service Australia said that post-adoption support is very, very crucial. 'It is not just the formal reports that we are talking about; it is the informal support that the family needs and may require throughout that child's upbringing.' They continued:


Also, we are funded by the New South Wales government support service for adult adoptees to search for their birth parents overseas. It is important to understand how much of a profound impact that can have on adoptees in later life when they become an adult to find out that their adoption was unethical and unlawful.


I know from the work that I have done with forgotten Australians, former child migrants, those affected by forced adoptions and the stolen generation how important it is that services are available—in fact, lifelong services. We are currently putting in place support services, after all these years, for those who were affected by forced adoptions. That is critical and important evidence that shows the lifelong impacts that flawed adoption processes can have on people. Just adopting a child, unfortunately, does not necessarily have a 'happy ever after' conclusion. We are already having significant problems with this process in Australia, after all those decades of forced adoption processes. By loosening up the overseas adoption processes so much, we are in danger of repeating that, of putting another generation of people through that.


As I said, I deeply understand people's heartfelt desire to look after children who they think they can help by bringing from overseas. I am not saying for one minute that these processes are always flawed, but we know from the evidence that many have poor outcomes. We know the lifelong impact on so-called relinquishing parents or biological parents. Some people call them birth parents. We must guarantee that the adoption is not unethical, that every move has been made to ensure that there are other supports or other potential avenues to support that child in their culture and in their country of origin. We cannot speed it up at the cost of the child, of the parents and of the adoptive parents. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:20):  The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looked at the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 very closely. Indeed we had a number of witnesses give evidence to the committee. A lot of the issues that Senator Siewert has just spoken about were issues that the committee was also concerned about, but the committee deliberated, addressed those issues and asked questions. The committee was of the view that the bill should be passed and the committee made a couple of recommendations.


I take on Senator Siewert's theme, that children who come to Australia and are adopted by Australian citizens in many instances have a much better future ahead of them than they perhaps would where they were. That became clear from some of the evidence given to the committee.


The Senate referred the provisions of this bill to the committee in June 2014. The bill allows for acquisition of Australian citizenship by a person adopted outside Australia by an Australian citizen in accordance with bilateral arrangements between Australia and another country. In particular, the bill amends the Australian Citizenship Act to create entitlement to citizenship in accordance with bilateral arrangements—that is the same as the entitlement currently provided to persons adopted in accordance with the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Hague convention process as implemented into Australian law provides for the immediate grant of citizenship following completion of the adoption in a foreign country. The statutory regime set out in subdivision AA of division 2 of part 2 of the act allows for the immediate grant of Australian citizenship following completion of the adoption. This allows the adopted child to travel to Australia as an Australian citizen and, thereby, removes the need for the child to obtain a passport from the home country and an adoption visa under the migration regulations.


The bilateral arrangements to which the amendments will apply are identified in the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements-Intercountry Adoption) Regulations. The regulations currently apply to adoptions under bilateral arrangements with Ethiopia, Korea and Taiwan. These are the only three countries who are not signatories to the Hague convention that these arrangements will apply to. In all three cases, the bilateral arrangements are exactly the same as the provisions of the Hague convention. I heard what Senator Siewert said; I do not agree with her because these are issues that were raised by the committee with witnesses who understand the issues. It was made very clear that the provisions of the Hague convention would apply to these few bilateral agreements we have. One of those countries with which we have that bilateral agreement is in the throes of becoming accredited under the Hague convention in any case. Regarding another one of those three countries, where life is not perhaps as ordered as it used to be when these arrangements were first made, that country, as I recall the evidence given to the committee, no longer is dealt with under these bilateral arrangements because of the concerns that Senator Siewert mentioned. The Australian officials have thought that for the moment those bilateral arrangements with one of those countries would be suspended.


This bill will speed up a lengthy process and will allow Australian parents to be connected with their adopted children in a much simpler way. With no disrespect to Senator Siewert, I have to say that Senator Siewert takes the typical Greens line—the glass is always half-empty, never half-full. The number of people and the number of children who will be benefited by this amendment and reform is very significant, and that is something that we as Australians want to ensure does happen. Sure, we have to be very careful of those very few who fall through the cracks, but, by and large, this is a reform which will make the whole process much better.


The committee made three recommendations. Of these recommendations, in response to the concerns raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the committee urged the government to positively state its position regarding the primacy of the child's interests in the operation of the revised scheme for intercountry adoption. The committee recommended that, subject to other recommendations, the bill be passed. The second recommendation was:


The committee recommends that the child protection principles set out in the Hague Convention, particularly the overarching requirement that the best interests of the child be the paramount consideration in intercountry adoption processes, be explicitly articulated in Australia's bilateral arrangements and, where relevant, in the related legislation and regulations.


The department has indicated that that is how it will proceed. The third recommendation was:


While not directly relevant to the committee's terms of reference, the committee strongly urges Commonwealth, state and territory governments to ensure that adequate resourcing and priority is provided for follow up monitoring and support to ensure that it fully addresses Australia's obligations to adoptees throughout the adoption cycle, regardless of whether adoptions take place under the Hague Convention or under bilateral arrangements.


So, regardless of which it was, we are very concerned and Australia is concerned to ensure that adopted children are properly cared for in Australia.


On the human rights issue, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection provided the committee with evidence that it had reviewed the amendments against the provisions of seven key international treaties. As the children to whom these amendments are relevant are located outside Australia's territory or jurisdiction, Australia's obligations under seven core human rights treaties are not effectively engaged. However, once these children come within the Australian territory or jurisdiction, these rights and freedoms articulated under the seven core international human rights treaties will be enlivened. The department added that, in its opinion, the bill enhanced the wellbeing of adopted children by creating a more streamlined and cost-effective process which allowed these children to commence their lives in Australia more quickly.


The Attorney-General's Department advised that the bill would not change post-adoption support arrangements which were provided by state and territory governments in accordance with their respective laws. Whilst the laws and processes may vary in some respects between states and territories, support services were provided to adopted children and their families on an identical basis whether the adoption took place under the Hague convention or the bilateral arrangements.


During the inquiry, the committee also noted advice from the relevant department that the bill would not in any way compromise the interests of the child nor the standards and safeguards applied to intercountry adoption programs under bilateral arrangements, which will continue to mirror the principles of the Hague convention. Additionally, we were told that COAG has given in principle support for the utilisation of an existing agency to provide services for intercountry adoptions. An agreement was reached at the COAG meeting in October 2014. As far as I am aware the details of that program have not yet been finalised or announced. The streamlined citizenship process created by the bill will make overseas adoptions faster, easier and more cost-effective for adopting families and will enable adopted children to settle more quickly and easily into their new lives and access key support services more immediately upon arrival in Australia. 


The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee strongly endorses the passage of the bill through the parliament. I thank all those who gave evidence to the committee during its deliberations. I thank the deputy chair, Senator Collins, and other members of the committee for their attention to the evidence and the material given to the committee in researching and considering this bill. The bill is a reform and I urge the Senate to do as the Senate committee did—that is, agree with the adoption of this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (10:31):  I thank senators for their contribution to this second reading debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. The bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister emphasises his strong personal commitment and the commitment of the government to reform and improved intercountry adoption. Adoption should always be in the best interests of the child and we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. However, what we do want to do is remove the red tape, but not the safeguards, and reduce the delays that do not benefit anyone. 


I remind the chamber that the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 only amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 insofar as to facilitate the grant of Australian citizenship to children after they have been adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements. While bilateral arrangements may be between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, I remind the chamber that all such adoptions are compliant and consistent with the principles of the Hague convention. 


The Prime Minister noted when he introduced this bill that it is another step in delivering reform to intercountry adoption. The bill gives effect to one of the recommendations made in the Report of the interdepartmental committee on intercountry adoption released in April 2014, which recognised that where bilateral arrangement adoptions with nonconvention countries have standards and safeguards to protect children that are equivalent to those required under the Hague convention, the adoptions should be treated in the same way as Hague convention adoptions when assessing Australian citizenship. 


The purpose of this bill is to ensure that children adopted by Australian citizens in accordance with a bilateral arrangement will be able to apply for Australian citizenship in the same way as children adopted from Australia's intercountry adoption partners which have acceded to the Hague convention. Since 2007, children adopted by Australian citizens under Hague convention arrangements have been able to apply for Australian citizenship in their home country. Countries with which Australia establishes a bilateral arrangement must have the same standards and safeguards as those required with adoptions made between countries that have ratified the Hague convention. 


As the process for children adopted under bilateral arrangements, including automatic recognition under Australian law, is in substance identical to those processes under the Hague convention, it is reasonable and equitable for both the adoptees and their families that the children should be treated the same regarding access to Australian citizenship. This was recognised by the interdepartmental committee as an area suitable for immediate reform. The government has moved quickly to act on this recommendation. It will mean the child and the adopting family will be spared the process of applying for and meeting the cost of an Australian visa. It will mean that an application for Australian citizenship can be made immediately after the adoption is finalised, following an application for an Australian passport. The bill will not prevent the child from having access to dual citizenship. Whether a child can have dual citizenship will depend on the relevant laws in a child's country of birth, as is currently the case.


Where a non-convention country meets Hague convention standards of intercountry adoption, Australia may have a bilateral intercountry adoption program with them. South Korea and Taiwan are the only countries with which Australia has bilateral adoption programs. These arrangements with South Korea and Taiwan have existed since 1978 and 1984 respectively. South Korea is in the process of acceding to the Hague convention. No new bilateral arrangements are under consideration at this time. The countries with which new programs are being discussed are all parties to the Hague convention.


Passage of the bill does not sanction any changes to the adoption process. Parents who adopt from countries with which we have bilateral arrangements are assessed by states and territories through the same robust process as parents who adopt from countries that are parties to the Hague convention. This assessment process includes the requirement for prospective adoptive parents to provide an Australian national police check. The best interests of the child remain the paramount consideration in the adoption process, regardless of whether this occurs under the Hague convention or a bilateral arrangement. This bill makes no change to existing arrangements or safeguards to protect children from exploitation.


I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on this bill. The committee recommended that the bill be passed, subject to two issues: (1) that the child protection principles in the Hague convention, particularly that the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in the adoption process, be explicitly articulated in the bilateral arrangements and, where relevant, in related legislation; and (2) that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments ensure adequate resourcing is provided for follow-up monitoring and support to adoptees and their families.


In relation to the first issue, the government considers that such an amendment is not required, as the principles of the Hague convention, including the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, are adhered to in all of Australia's intercountry adoption programs. 


In relation to the second issue, state and territory adoption authorities currently facilitate post-adoption support for adoptees and their families. The new Intercountry Adoption Support Service announced by the government will also explore this issue, and I advise the Senate that on 25 January 2015 the Prime Minister announced the Intercountry Adoption Support Service will be established as soon as April 2015. The Prime Minister confirmed the new service will include a website and a dedicated 1800 helpline, with trained staff to assist families in working with state, territory and overseas authorities, and to provide referrals to other support services. The new service will aim to reduce the waiting time for Australian families while maintaining the necessary safeguards for children, consistent with Australia's obligations under the Hague convention on intercountry adoption.


I note that the Greens provided a dissenting report to the Senate committee inquiry and I would like to briefly address the four issues that they raised in their report. First, the Greens are concerned that bilateral arrangements are, as they view them, 'outside of the safeguards, transparency and procedures of the Hague convention'. I respond to this concern by emphasising that the overarching requirement from Australia's perspective is that an intercountry adoption partner country meets the standards and safeguards equivalent to those required under the Hague convention. Australia assesses a country's intercountry adoption legislation and infrastructure for compliance with the Hague convention and also assesses its practical compliance with the standards and principles of the Hague convention. Australia only has intercountry adoption programs with countries that meet the standards of the Hague convention in practice. This is not dependent on whether they are parties to the Hague convention. 


The key Hague convention standards and principles include: (1) the existence of safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child; (2) consideration of all options for permanent care for the child in the child's country of origin before considering intercountry adoption; and (3) measures to prevent the trafficking of children, including no facilitation payments. 


The Attorney-General's Department assesses and monitors Australia's intercountry adoption programs using a number of measures, including: ongoing review of child protection and adoption legislation, guidelines and infrastructure in the overseas country for compliance with standards of the Hague convention; monitoring the practical operation of the adoption program in overseas countries; regular dialogue with authorities in the overseas country, including central authorities, government departments, adoption agencies, embassies and visits to the country; monitoring reports from various non-government organisations on child protection issues in the overseas country; exchanging information about adoption processes with other countries; and maintaining relationships with other relevant stakeholders.


The second issue raised by the Greens is:


That the bill does not focus on the best interests of the child …


As I have previously noted, the guiding principle for all intercountry adoptions undertaken by Australia, including through bilateral arrangements with countries that are not parties to the Hague convention, is that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in the intercountry adoption process. The bill does not affect this fundamental principle.


The third criticism or issue raised by the Greens is:


That the bill could facilitate an environment for forced or coerced adoption practices to take place …


This is not the case. The bill makes no change to existing intercountry adoption arrangements or to the safeguards that are in place to ensure that an adoption is in the best interests of the child. All Australia's active intercountry adoption programs have been assessed as complying with the standards and principles of the Hague convention, regardless of whether the country is a party to the Hague convention. Furthermore, the government is committed to ensuring that all parties involved in intercountry adoptions are protected and takes seriously all allegations of unethical or illegal practice in intercountry adoption. If there were allegations of unethical or illegal adoption practices in one of Australia's intercountry adoption programs, the government would consider a number of options to address the issue. These include formally reviewing the relevant program against the Hague convention principles and standards; advising the appropriate authorities in the relevant countries of Australia's concerns; communicating Australia's concerns to other countries and international organs, as appropriate and consistent with our obligations under the Hague convention; suspending or closing the program with the country in question; and investigating whether, under the program, any offences have been committed under Commonwealth, state or territory laws. 


Together with state and territory central authorities, the Australian government has also developed a protocol for responding to allegations of trafficking children in intercountry adoptions. The protocol provides information to assist adoptees and adoptive families. It sets out measures that can be taken if allegations of unethical or illegal adoption practices are made, and the support and assistance available for adoptees and adoptive families.


The fourth criticism or issue raised by the Greens is that there is a lack of a requirement in the bill for post-adoption support services for adoptees and their families. I have previously addressed this issue and note that the state and territory adoption authorities currently provide these services and that the bill does not change this—and I confirm again that, on 25 January 2015, the Prime Minister announced that the Intercountry Adoption Support Service will be established as soon as April 2015.


Senator Siewert, in her contribution to the second reading debate, moved a second reading amendment. In relation to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens I advise the Senate that the government opposes the amendment, as it considers it to be unnecessary. This is because the overarching requirement from Australia's perspective is that an intercountry partner country meets in practice the standards and safeguards required under the Hague convention for intercountry adoption. This is the case whether the country is a signatory to the Hague convention or not. 


As I have said previously, all Australia's active intercountry adoption programs have been assessed as complying in practice with the standards and principles of the Hague convention, as new programs will not be established unless they are assessed as Hague convention compliant.


I would also like to respond to the conclusion of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights that the bill is likely to be incompatible with Australia's international human rights obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I note that the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law has issued an outline of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. This outline explains that the Hague convention gives effect to article 21 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child by adding substantive safeguards and procedures to the broad principles and norms laid down in that convention. As the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection at the time said, in his response to the committee:


Given that all of the country programmes which the Australian Government has established must meet the standards of the Hague Convention, the government is of the view that Australia's intercountry adoption programme as a whole is consistent with Article 21 of the CRC. 


As I have already explained, all of Australia's active intercountry adoption programs demonstrate practical compliance with the standards and principles of the Hague convention, and this includes holding the wellbeing and rights of the child as paramount.


The bill also acknowledges the hard work, dedication and perseverance of Australian citizens who embark on the challenging journey of intercountry adoption, and they have our admiration and respect. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question negatived. 


Original question agreed to.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:02):  I am in continuation from last year but, given that that was some time ago, I will remind the chamber about where I was coming from at the time. I can see the smile on your face, Mr President, because you remember the occasion very well, I am sure.


As I was articulating in that short time last time, the Australian Greens are extremely concerned about the fast-tracking of intercountry adoption processes. We have seen the trauma that can be caused by flawed adoption practices to the child, the relinquishing family and the adoptive family. For some, there is an assumption that adoption automatically leads to a better outcome for the child. We obviously understand the very deep—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator SIEWERT:
  Excuse me, Mr President. I am sorry. It is slightly distracting.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes. Could I ask senators to keep any noise down and maybe have meetings outside of the chamber.




Senator SIEWERT:
  As I was saying, there is an assumption that adoption automatically leads to a better outcome for the child that is being adopted, and obviously on many occasions that is true, but there are many that it is not true for.


We obviously understand the deep desire for people to become parents. For those of us who do have children, it really is impossible for us to imagine what it must be like to want to have children and to be unable to. However, having said that, we in this country know the consequences of some of the adoptive processes for all involved, including the relinquishing parents. I use the term very carefully when I talk about 'relinquishing', because we know from past experiences that parents in some cases were not relinquishing parents. Those children or those babies were taken from those parents.


We know, however, from past experiences that adoption processes can have bad outcomes for the child, obviously for the relinquishing parents but also for the adoptive parents. There is no guarantee that the practices we saw in this country not several decades ago are not in fact being carried out through overseas adoptions. We cannot pretend that we are not aware of the lifelong consequences of adoption for the child who becomes an adult, for the relinquishing parents and for the adoptive family.


We now have high-profile people promoting adoption. While I am sure they are coming from a desire to help children, we cannot allow this to override the need for proper consideration, protections and oversights. We need to ensure we are listening to the evidence based policy and appropriate expert stakeholders, not just on the goodwill of those high-profile people that are pursuing this cause. Sometimes I am deeply concerned adoption could take place at the expense of the child's interests. I will come to the overwhelming need to make sure that we are doing this in the child's interests.


Australia must be vigilant to ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect parents from being coerced into 'relinquishing' their children, to ensure that intercountry adoption is a last resort and there is appropriate post-adoption care, support and services for children and families. The Australian Greens are deeply concerned that the so-called one stop shop, where children may be seen as commodities and the goal is a swift acquisition of them, is not the way to go in adoption. This country has been there. We know the consequences of that swift approach to adoption.


The presumption that adoption is good, that Australian parents are all loving and that children will have a better life here is not a fair assumption to make. What evidence is this based on? I would argue that there is overwhelming evidence to show that, if we are not extremely careful with adoption, it can lead to very poor life outcomes for everybody involved. All legal rights to extended families, heritage, homeland are extinguished. We are deeply concerned that this may occur and that the children have no say in this matter. 


We need to be asking the government on what evidence the decision to facilitate easier and faster overseas adoptions is based. What evidence is relied on to show that this in fact will be in the best interests of the child and that they can guarantee, when they start allowing adoptions from non-Hague countries, that all the concerns that have been raised—and I will go into those in a minute—can be addressed?


I am deeply concerned that the government may be so quickly forgetting the history of child removals and the reports that we have seen in this country: the Bringing them Homereport, the forced adoption reports and the three reports on forgotten Australians and former child migrants. These are lessons that we can never, ever forget in this country. This country has watched the intergenerational harm caused by the displacement of children and by dispossession. We have the legacy of the stolen generations, the forgotten Australians and the travesty of forced adoptions. Those directly affected continue to pay a very heavy price, and I have spoken at length in this place about those costs. Unless we get this right, Australians will unfortunately continue to pay a heavy price socially and a heavy price in terms of the cost to health, because we know it has poor health and life outcomes. Justice will also, we believe, be threatened for these people. 


That takes me to this bill and why we are debating it in this place now. The Greens are concerned about a number of aspects of the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. Allowing intercountry adoption through bilateral agreements outside of the safeguards, transparency and procedures of the Hague convention on intercountry adoption is of concern to us. The bill does not focus on the best interests of the child, and we know where that leads. The bill could facilitate an environment where forced or coerced adoption practices could take place—again, this country knows very well what occurs then. There is the lack of a requirement for adequate post-adoption support services. These concerns were clearly shared and articulated by many submissions and witnesses during the committee inquiry into this bill. There are many risks associated with adoption through bilateral agreements with non-Hague-convention countries. The Hague convention of 1993 set out guidelines which considered the child's interests to be of paramount importance. Bilateral agreement to not necessarily meet the same standards. 


The stated reason for this bill is to cut waiting periods and allow for easier and more convenient adoptions. International Social Service Australia said in evidence to the committee that the benefits to adoptive parents 'are grossly outweighed by the risks associated with adopting children in non-Hague countries'. We know that countries that have a very limited child protection process do not have the capacity to monitor individual cases. In these countries, individuals or criminal organisations can exploit the loopholes in intercountry adoption. As International Social Service Australia's representative said to the committee:


Whilst Australia has signed the convention, it is difficult for Australia to monitor the systems in countries that are adopting children that have not signed the convention. For this reason, I think promoting bilateral agreements with non-Hague countries and finalising adoptions in overseas countries have lots of risks associated. So I do not support this bill.


The Australian Greens are deeply concerned that this bill puts convenience to adoptive parents above the best interests of not only the child but also the birth parents. The Australian Greens argue that the risks outweigh the convenience of speeding up adoption with countries that have not signed the Hague convention. The interests of the child are better protected by the safeguards and standards of the Hague convention, and we would prefer that Australia encourage non-Hague countries to become signatories to the convention rather than simply caving in and doing bilateral agreements with them.


I come to the best interests of the child. The Australian Greens believe that all legislation that affects children must be in the best interests of the child. Evidence to the committee from Dr Gillespie of UNICEF emphasised the need to keep the interests of the child at the centre of the intercountry adoption process. He said:


… we emphasise the best interests of the child test. We note that the CRC, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, talks about 'primary' interests of children whereas the Hague convention talks about consideration of children being 'paramount' in intercountry adoption. UNICEF would not support any dilution of those standards … 


In order to properly protect children and families, the first thing we need to do is work with countries to enhance and improve their child protection systems and supports for the parents of those children through that process. The best interests of the child must stay at the centre of our decision-making process. As UNICEF said:


In the very first instance, the Convention on the Rights of the Child says that a child should be with its own family. 


That is what we should be focusing on: making sure that every possibility is explored for the child to be able to stay with its family. I am not Pollyanna; I know that in many circumstances that is not possible—but that does really need to be at the centre of our thinking. Dr Gillespie went on:


In all circumstances, that is what we should be striving for. If that is not possible—and that is also about why we do development, to try to bolster systems to ensure that children and families can be supported—then that child should stay in its own culture and with family members or extended family members in that country. Again, our job is to help build systems with those foreign governments to make sure those child protection systems are strengthened before we get into this.


…   …   …


If all of that is exhausted—in a way, the convention says that intercountry adoption should be a last resort after those have been exhausted—then we look at how best we can minimise and protect.


Therefore, the Greens think we need to be ensuring that the best interests of the child should be at the centre of this legislation; unfortunately, we do not think this legislation goes far enough to ensure that. 


Now I want to look at forced and coerced adoption, something this country knows a lot about. I remind this chamber that in little over a month we will be acknowledging the second anniversary of the apology to those affected by forced adoption in our own country.


The past forced adoption processes in Australia have caused ongoing trauma. I do not think anybody in this place is unaware of that trauma, to all those involved. As Professor Nahum Mushin, the Chair of the Forced Adoptions Implementation Working Group, noted, the consultation for the submissions on this bill had a 're-traumatising effect' on affected people. In other words, this is an ongoing trauma for all involved.


We have a responsibility to ensure that we do not create situations for such practices to recur. The Australian Greens are very concerned that this bill could assist in making coerced and forced adoption practices more likely. As UNICEF said, it is important to remember that intercountry adoptions can take an extended time because of the complex nature of the process:


… it takes time and due diligence and also that children are genuinely available to be adopted. We do not want to see any more cases where parents adopt into the Australian context only to discover that the child should never have been considered genuinely available for adoption. That is a really complex thing for parents to have to live with. What does that mean then for your parenting, what is meant for your family, what does it mean for the child, what does it mean for the biological family?


Unfortunately, illegal and unethical adoptions are more likely in non-Hague countries. Without due process and systems around child protection, children and families are at risk of exploitation. International Social Service Australia said:


The more bilateral agreements we have with non-Hague countries, the more unethical and unlawful adoptions we are going to have.


As UNICEF said:


… it has been noted in other country contexts that sometimes there is not due process around free, prior and informed consent from parents and situations where parents are actually being pressured to surrender their children to adoption programs.


A deep concern is that by agreeing to non-Hague convention adoptions these practices will occur more.


I would like to talk briefly about post-adoption support, an issue that came up significantly during the inquiry as well. We are concerned that faster adoption processes provided by the bill may mean that important supports and services do not occur. One issue that is not included in the bill is post-adoption support, or adequate post-adoption support. As several of the witnesses stated, appropriate post-adoption support is very important. There is no provision in the bill to ensure that bilateral agreements will be required to have the same standards in post-adoption support and follow-up as the Hague convention. The Hague convention currently requires post-adoption assessments, which usually occur in the first 12 months after the adoption process. There is also follow-up with the relinquishing family from the country of origin.


It was pointed out to the inquiry that it is essential that there is contact and support for the relinquishing family, the child and the adoptive family. There are several issues with post-adoption support, including the need for long-term post-adoption support for both families and adoptees, and also the important support and assessment back in the country of origin in that first year. International Social Service Australia said that post-adoption support is very, very crucial. 'It is not just the formal reports that we are talking about; it is the informal support that the family needs and may require throughout that child's upbringing.' They continued:


Also, we are funded by the New South Wales government support service for adult adoptees to search for their birth parents overseas. It is important to understand how much of a profound impact that can have on adoptees in later life when they become an adult to find out that their adoption was unethical and unlawful.


I know from the work that I have done with forgotten Australians, former child migrants, those affected by forced adoptions and the stolen generation how important it is that services are available—in fact, lifelong services. We are currently putting in place support services, after all these years, for those who were affected by forced adoptions. That is critical and important evidence that shows the lifelong impacts that flawed adoption processes can have on people. Just adopting a child, unfortunately, does not necessarily have a 'happy ever after' conclusion. We are already having significant problems with this process in Australia, after all those decades of forced adoption processes. By loosening up the overseas adoption processes so much, we are in danger of repeating that, of putting another generation of people through that.


As I said, I deeply understand people's heartfelt desire to look after children who they think they can help by bringing from overseas. I am not saying for one minute that these processes are always flawed, but we know from the evidence that many have poor outcomes. We know the lifelong impact on so-called relinquishing parents or biological parents. Some people call them birth parents. We must guarantee that the adoption is not unethical, that every move has been made to ensure that there are other supports or other potential avenues to support that child in their culture and in their country of origin. We cannot speed it up at the cost of the child, of the parents and of the adoptive parents. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:20):  The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looked at the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 very closely. Indeed we had a number of witnesses give evidence to the committee. A lot of the issues that Senator Siewert has just spoken about were issues that the committee was also concerned about, but the committee deliberated, addressed those issues and asked questions. The committee was of the view that the bill should be passed and the committee made a couple of recommendations.


I take on Senator Siewert's theme, that children who come to Australia and are adopted by Australian citizens in many instances have a much better future ahead of them than they perhaps would where they were. That became clear from some of the evidence given to the committee.


The Senate referred the provisions of this bill to the committee in June 2014. The bill allows for acquisition of Australian citizenship by a person adopted outside Australia by an Australian citizen in accordance with bilateral arrangements between Australia and another country. In particular, the bill amends the Australian Citizenship Act to create entitlement to citizenship in accordance with bilateral arrangements—that is the same as the entitlement currently provided to persons adopted in accordance with the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Hague convention process as implemented into Australian law provides for the immediate grant of citizenship following completion of the adoption in a foreign country. The statutory regime set out in subdivision AA of division 2 of part 2 of the act allows for the immediate grant of Australian citizenship following completion of the adoption. This allows the adopted child to travel to Australia as an Australian citizen and, thereby, removes the need for the child to obtain a passport from the home country and an adoption visa under the migration regulations.


The bilateral arrangements to which the amendments will apply are identified in the Family Law (Bilateral Arrangements-Intercountry Adoption) Regulations. The regulations currently apply to adoptions under bilateral arrangements with Ethiopia, Korea and Taiwan. These are the only three countries who are not signatories to the Hague convention that these arrangements will apply to. In all three cases, the bilateral arrangements are exactly the same as the provisions of the Hague convention. I heard what Senator Siewert said; I do not agree with her because these are issues that were raised by the committee with witnesses who understand the issues. It was made very clear that the provisions of the Hague convention would apply to these few bilateral agreements we have. One of those countries with which we have that bilateral agreement is in the throes of becoming accredited under the Hague convention in any case. Regarding another one of those three countries, where life is not perhaps as ordered as it used to be when these arrangements were first made, that country, as I recall the evidence given to the committee, no longer is dealt with under these bilateral arrangements because of the concerns that Senator Siewert mentioned. The Australian officials have thought that for the moment those bilateral arrangements with one of those countries would be suspended.


This bill will speed up a lengthy process and will allow Australian parents to be connected with their adopted children in a much simpler way. With no disrespect to Senator Siewert, I have to say that Senator Siewert takes the typical Greens line—the glass is always half-empty, never half-full. The number of people and the number of children who will be benefited by this amendment and reform is very significant, and that is something that we as Australians want to ensure does happen. Sure, we have to be very careful of those very few who fall through the cracks, but, by and large, this is a reform which will make the whole process much better.


The committee made three recommendations. Of these recommendations, in response to the concerns raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the committee urged the government to positively state its position regarding the primacy of the child's interests in the operation of the revised scheme for intercountry adoption. The committee recommended that, subject to other recommendations, the bill be passed. The second recommendation was:


The committee recommends that the child protection principles set out in the Hague Convention, particularly the overarching requirement that the best interests of the child be the paramount consideration in intercountry adoption processes, be explicitly articulated in Australia's bilateral arrangements and, where relevant, in the related legislation and regulations.


The department has indicated that that is how it will proceed. The third recommendation was:


While not directly relevant to the committee's terms of reference, the committee strongly urges Commonwealth, state and territory governments to ensure that adequate resourcing and priority is provided for follow up monitoring and support to ensure that it fully addresses Australia's obligations to adoptees throughout the adoption cycle, regardless of whether adoptions take place under the Hague Convention or under bilateral arrangements.


So, regardless of which it was, we are very concerned and Australia is concerned to ensure that adopted children are properly cared for in Australia.


On the human rights issue, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection provided the committee with evidence that it had reviewed the amendments against the provisions of seven key international treaties. As the children to whom these amendments are relevant are located outside Australia's territory or jurisdiction, Australia's obligations under seven core human rights treaties are not effectively engaged. However, once these children come within the Australian territory or jurisdiction, these rights and freedoms articulated under the seven core international human rights treaties will be enlivened. The department added that, in its opinion, the bill enhanced the wellbeing of adopted children by creating a more streamlined and cost-effective process which allowed these children to commence their lives in Australia more quickly.


The Attorney-General's Department advised that the bill would not change post-adoption support arrangements which were provided by state and territory governments in accordance with their respective laws. Whilst the laws and processes may vary in some respects between states and territories, support services were provided to adopted children and their families on an identical basis whether the adoption took place under the Hague convention or the bilateral arrangements.


During the inquiry, the committee also noted advice from the relevant department that the bill would not in any way compromise the interests of the child nor the standards and safeguards applied to intercountry adoption programs under bilateral arrangements, which will continue to mirror the principles of the Hague convention. Additionally, we were told that COAG has given in principle support for the utilisation of an existing agency to provide services for intercountry adoptions. An agreement was reached at the COAG meeting in October 2014. As far as I am aware the details of that program have not yet been finalised or announced. The streamlined citizenship process created by the bill will make overseas adoptions faster, easier and more cost-effective for adopting families and will enable adopted children to settle more quickly and easily into their new lives and access key support services more immediately upon arrival in Australia. 


The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee strongly endorses the passage of the bill through the parliament. I thank all those who gave evidence to the committee during its deliberations. I thank the deputy chair, Senator Collins, and other members of the committee for their attention to the evidence and the material given to the committee in researching and considering this bill. The bill is a reform and I urge the Senate to do as the Senate committee did—that is, agree with the adoption of this bill.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (10:31):  I thank senators for their contribution to this second reading debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014. The bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister emphasises his strong personal commitment and the commitment of the government to reform and improved intercountry adoption. Adoption should always be in the best interests of the child and we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. However, what we do want to do is remove the red tape, but not the safeguards, and reduce the delays that do not benefit anyone. 


I remind the chamber that the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Intercountry Adoption) Bill 2014 only amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 insofar as to facilitate the grant of Australian citizenship to children after they have been adopted by Australian citizens under bilateral arrangements. While bilateral arrangements may be between Australia and countries that are not party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, I remind the chamber that all such adoptions are compliant and consistent with the principles of the Hague convention. 


The Prime Minister noted when he introduced this bill that it is another step in delivering reform to intercountry adoption. The bill gives effect to one of the recommendations made in the Report of the interdepartmental committee on intercountry adoption released in April 2014, which recognised that where bilateral arrangement adoptions with nonconvention countries have standards and safeguards to protect children that are equivalent to those required under the Hague convention, the adoptions should be treated in the same way as Hague convention adoptions when assessing Australian citizenship. 


The purpose of this bill is to ensure that children adopted by Australian citizens in accordance with a bilateral arrangement will be able to apply for Australian citizenship in the same way as children adopted from Australia's intercountry adoption partners which have acceded to the Hague convention. Since 2007, children adopted by Australian citizens under Hague convention arrangements have been able to apply for Australian citizenship in their home country. Countries with which Australia establishes a bilateral arrangement must have the same standards and safeguards as those required with adoptions made between countries that have ratified the Hague convention. 


As the process for children adopted under bilateral arrangements, including automatic recognition under Australian law, is in substance identical to those processes under the Hague convention, it is reasonable and equitable for both the adoptees and their families that the children should be treated the same regarding access to Australian citizenship. This was recognised by the interdepartmental committee as an area suitable for immediate reform. The government has moved quickly to act on this recommendation. It will mean the child and the adopting family will be spared the process of applying for and meeting the cost of an Australian visa. It will mean that an application for Australian citizenship can be made immediately after the adoption is finalised, following an application for an Australian passport. The bill will not prevent the child from having access to dual citizenship. Whether a child can have dual citizenship will depend on the relevant laws in a child's country of birth, as is currently the case.


Where a non-convention country meets Hague convention standards of intercountry adoption, Australia may have a bilateral intercountry adoption program with them. South Korea and Taiwan are the only countries with which Australia has bilateral adoption programs. These arrangements with South Korea and Taiwan have existed since 1978 and 1984 respectively. South Korea is in the process of acceding to the Hague convention. No new bilateral arrangements are under consideration at this time. The countries with which new programs are being discussed are all parties to the Hague convention.


Passage of the bill does not sanction any changes to the adoption process. Parents who adopt from countries with which we have bilateral arrangements are assessed by states and territories through the same robust process as parents who adopt from countries that are parties to the Hague convention. This assessment process includes the requirement for prospective adoptive parents to provide an Australian national police check. The best interests of the child remain the paramount consideration in the adoption process, regardless of whether this occurs under the Hague convention or a bilateral arrangement. This bill makes no change to existing arrangements or safeguards to protect children from exploitation.


I thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on this bill. The committee recommended that the bill be passed, subject to two issues: (1) that the child protection principles in the Hague convention, particularly that the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in the adoption process, be explicitly articulated in the bilateral arrangements and, where relevant, in related legislation; and (2) that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments ensure adequate resourcing is provided for follow-up monitoring and support to adoptees and their families.


In relation to the first issue, the government considers that such an amendment is not required, as the principles of the Hague convention, including the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, are adhered to in all of Australia's intercountry adoption programs. 


In relation to the second issue, state and territory adoption authorities currently facilitate post-adoption support for adoptees and their families. The new Intercountry Adoption Support Service announced by the government will also explore this issue, and I advise the Senate that on 25 January 2015 the Prime Minister announced the Intercountry Adoption Support Service will be established as soon as April 2015. The Prime Minister confirmed the new service will include a website and a dedicated 1800 helpline, with trained staff to assist families in working with state, territory and overseas authorities, and to provide referrals to other support services. The new service will aim to reduce the waiting time for Australian families while maintaining the necessary safeguards for children, consistent with Australia's obligations under the Hague convention on intercountry adoption.


I note that the Greens provided a dissenting report to the Senate committee inquiry and I would like to briefly address the four issues that they raised in their report. First, the Greens are concerned that bilateral arrangements are, as they view them, 'outside of the safeguards, transparency and procedures of the Hague convention'. I respond to this concern by emphasising that the overarching requirement from Australia's perspective is that an intercountry adoption partner country meets the standards and safeguards equivalent to those required under the Hague convention. Australia assesses a country's intercountry adoption legislation and infrastructure for compliance with the Hague convention and also assesses its practical compliance with the standards and principles of the Hague convention. Australia only has intercountry adoption programs with countries that meet the standards of the Hague convention in practice. This is not dependent on whether they are parties to the Hague convention. 


The key Hague convention standards and principles include: (1) the existence of safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child; (2) consideration of all options for permanent care for the child in the child's country of origin before considering intercountry adoption; and (3) measures to prevent the trafficking of children, including no facilitation payments. 


The Attorney-General's Department assesses and monitors Australia's intercountry adoption programs using a number of measures, including: ongoing review of child protection and adoption legislation, guidelines and infrastructure in the overseas country for compliance with standards of the Hague convention; monitoring the practical operation of the adoption program in overseas countries; regular dialogue with authorities in the overseas country, including central authorities, government departments, adoption agencies, embassies and visits to the country; monitoring reports from various non-government organisations on child protection issues in the overseas country; exchanging information about adoption processes with other countries; and maintaining relationships with other relevant stakeholders.


The second issue raised by the Greens is:


That the bill does not focus on the best interests of the child …


As I have previously noted, the guiding principle for all intercountry adoptions undertaken by Australia, including through bilateral arrangements with countries that are not parties to the Hague convention, is that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in the intercountry adoption process. The bill does not affect this fundamental principle.


The third criticism or issue raised by the Greens is:


That the bill could facilitate an environment for forced or coerced adoption practices to take place …


This is not the case. The bill makes no change to existing intercountry adoption arrangements or to the safeguards that are in place to ensure that an adoption is in the best interests of the child. All Australia's active intercountry adoption programs have been assessed as complying with the standards and principles of the Hague convention, regardless of whether the country is a party to the Hague convention. Furthermore, the government is committed to ensuring that all parties involved in intercountry adoptions are protected and takes seriously all allegations of unethical or illegal practice in intercountry adoption. If there were allegations of unethical or illegal adoption practices in one of Australia's intercountry adoption programs, the government would consider a number of options to address the issue. These include formally reviewing the relevant program against the Hague convention principles and standards; advising the appropriate authorities in the relevant countries of Australia's concerns; communicating Australia's concerns to other countries and international organs, as appropriate and consistent with our obligations under the Hague convention; suspending or closing the program with the country in question; and investigating whether, under the program, any offences have been committed under Commonwealth, state or territory laws. 


Together with state and territory central authorities, the Australian government has also developed a protocol for responding to allegations of trafficking children in intercountry adoptions. The protocol provides information to assist adoptees and adoptive families. It sets out measures that can be taken if allegations of unethical or illegal adoption practices are made, and the support and assistance available for adoptees and adoptive families.


The fourth criticism or issue raised by the Greens is that there is a lack of a requirement in the bill for post-adoption support services for adoptees and their families. I have previously addressed this issue and note that the state and territory adoption authorities currently provide these services and that the bill does not change this—and I confirm again that, on 25 January 2015, the Prime Minister announced that the Intercountry Adoption Support Service will be established as soon as April 2015.


Senator Siewert, in her contribution to the second reading debate, moved a second reading amendment. In relation to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens I advise the Senate that the government opposes the amendment, as it considers it to be unnecessary. This is because the overarching requirement from Australia's perspective is that an intercountry partner country meets in practice the standards and safeguards required under the Hague convention for intercountry adoption. This is the case whether the country is a signatory to the Hague convention or not. 


As I have said previously, all Australia's active intercountry adoption programs have been assessed as complying in practice with the standards and principles of the Hague convention, as new programs will not be established unless they are assessed as Hague convention compliant.


I would also like to respond to the conclusion of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights that the bill is likely to be incompatible with Australia's international human rights obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I note that the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law has issued an outline of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. This outline explains that the Hague convention gives effect to article 21 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child by adding substantive safeguards and procedures to the broad principles and norms laid down in that convention. As the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection at the time said, in his response to the committee:


Given that all of the country programmes which the Australian Government has established must meet the standards of the Hague Convention, the government is of the view that Australia's intercountry adoption programme as a whole is consistent with Article 21 of the CRC. 


As I have already explained, all of Australia's active intercountry adoption programs demonstrate practical compliance with the standards and principles of the Hague convention, and this includes holding the wellbeing and rights of the child as paramount.


The bill also acknowledges the hard work, dedication and perseverance of Australian citizens who embark on the challenging journey of intercountry adoption, and they have our admiration and respect. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question negatived.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:48):  Organised crime in this country is something all levels of government need to tackle. And one way to do this is to target the unexplained wealth of individuals, especially those who are not directly involved in an act of criminality, to obtain benefits. Criminals who are profiting from other people's crimes will be targeted by authorities who have more ability, now, to seize assets where the size of their wealth cannot be explained.


Organised crime can affect many unsuspecting Australians through many means, which may include bank account data and credit card theft through skimming of cards via ATMs and point-of-sale hubs or online attacks and investment scams.


The previous, Labor government introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill on 28 November in 2012. While it passed the House of Representatives it lapsed in the Senate before the last federal election. Now, the Minister for Justice Michael Keenan has re-introduced this bill, and it looks very similar to the one Labor introduced. In fact, it looks near identical, so I would like to acknowledge the government for supporting the previous, Labor government's bill.


Primarily, the legislation focuses on the various recommendations that the Parliament Joint Committee on Law enforcement brought down in 2012. They include recommendations such as preliminary unexplained wealth affidavits being streamlined; requiring the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to provide the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement with an annual report on unexplained wealth matters and litigation, along with empowering the committee to seek further information from federal agencies; restraining assets from being used to meet legal expenses, and making consistent legal aid provisions; securing payment from restrained property through an unexplained wealth order; including a statement in the objects clause about undermining the profitability of criminal enterprises; removing a court's discretion to make unexplained wealth restraining orders, preliminary unexplained wealth orders and unexplained wealth orders, once relevant criteria are satisfied; extending the time limit for serving notice of applications for certain unexplained wealth orders by a court; and, finally, evidence relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings being seized under a search warrant. 


Another measure not in the report but necessary to support the measures already stated includes someone not being able to frustrate an unexplained wealth proceeding by failing to appear, and clarifying orders being made. I am not sure whether many people are aware of the legal aid provisions of unexplained wealth cases but the current process is that suspect assets can be used to go towards a legal defence. This bill closes that gap.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement recommended the Commonwealth lead on the development of nationally consistent unexplained wealth regimes. The states and territories are still considering whether to go down that path, with former police commissioners Mick Palmer and Ken Moroney called in to negotiate with the states. To date discussions are still occurring, unless developments have occurred more recently.


Chris Hayes, the member for Fowler, who has contributed greatly to this bill through his involvement on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, made what I thought was a very good statement which summed up the whole reason for this bill. He said:


… for every crime, there is a victim of crime. Therefore, if you prevent a crime or deter the commissioning of a crime, there is one less victim.


I couldn't agree more. Labor has supported and will continue to support the laws which take the incentive out of organised crime. Thus, Labor will be supporting this legislation, as it basically mirrors the legislation we introduced in 2012. Before I complete my contribution, I want to compliment our federal, state and territory police forces around the country. They all work in a very difficult space and do a very good job in protecting us.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:53):  I rise to speak about the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014. In particular, today I want to speak about the aspects of this bill that entrench the inequality of arms, undermine the presumption of innocence and therefore offend the rule of law. Like every other senator in this place, I am repulsed by the idea of criminals benefiting from the proceeds of their crimes. Australia must and does already have an extensive proceeds of crime regime in place to ensure that those who break the law do not profit from their crimes. But let's be very clear about what the existing law already allows.


Under existing law, a person who may not even be suspected of engaging in a criminal offence can be required to front up to a court and prove that his or her home, car or other assets have been legally obtained. There is no requirement for the police to show that there is a link between the asset and the commission of any specific criminal offence. Even if the asset was legally obtained, the person will lose it unless they can provide sufficient proof that it was lawfully acquired.


But this bill seeks to extend this regime into a new frontier of unfairness, where those who are required to prove to a court that their assets were legally obtained would be denied access to the type of legal representation that they want and need. Currently, where a person's assets are restrained in an action like this, a judge hearing the matter has the discretion to allow the person to use their assets to pay for their legal defence. But this bill will remove that discretion totally.


The feature of this bill that raises particular concerns for the Australian Greens, and for many legal experts who have made submissions in relation to these amendments over consecutive parliamentary inquiries, is the removal of this discretion. Many of these concerns are also shared by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. These concerns arise both from the practical implications of them but also principle.


As a starting point, the amendments proposed in the bill are completely unnecessary. There has been no case made for these amendments. The court can already refuse to allow a person to use their assets for the purpose of obtaining legal advice where they have been issued with an unexplained wealth order if the court is concerned, for instance, that the real purpose is to dissipate the assets so they cannot be seized by the state, by the government.


There is no evidence in the explanatory memorandum that the existence of this discretion as it currently stands has been misused or has jeopardised the outcome of unexplained wealth proceedings. There is no evidence in the explanatory memorandum—the memorandum which is designed to explain the rationale for the legislation we are being asked to agree to. The government has given no compelling reasons to justify taking this discretion away from the party which is best placed to make this call: the court. As is usually the case, it is the judge, the court, who is privy to the information and the evidence and can assess the merits of the person's application—in this case, to use their assets to obtain legal advice and representation.


Then there are the principle issues. In the situation where a person is being subjected to a very significant action by government to remove their assets, this bill will force parties to look to legal aid for assistance. This will compound existing pressure on legal aid services in an environment in which the legal assistance sector is already notoriously overloaded. Victoria Legal Aid's submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, for instance, made it clear that diverting people who want to contest unexplained wealth proceedings into the legal aid scheme will see an increase in applications for funding for complex and protracted litigation, which would require sizeable payments to legal representatives and forensic experts, if indeed their defence is to be done properly.


In our society, under the rule of law, people are entitled to mount an appropriate defence to actions by government like this. This is a serious concern. There is clear evidence of already significant existing levels of unmet need in the legal assistance sector. They are in our newspapers. They are in our faces every day. This means that people are already prevented from getting the legal assistance they need. Increasingly, it is not just the poorest Australians but also middle Australians as well. It is having damaging consequences, both for individuals and also for the structure of our legal system, the basis on which our legal system has been established. For instance, there has been a huge increase in self-represented litigants in litigation generally but particularly in the Family Court, which means people are unable to get the legal advice and representation they need. They are being forced to try and run complex cases on their own. This is the existing situation, without the change that is mooted in this bill.


There is also doubt as to the capacity of any legal aid grant to meet the costs that would be sustained in an unexplained wealth matter. As discussed in the Law Council of Australia's submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, there is generally a need for specialist commercial expertise in responding to unexplained wealth orders. That does not come cheap, and there are often restrictions on using legal aid funding to obtain expert reports.


They are the practical implications. I said they were the matters of principle but in fact they are the practical implications of the provisions in this bill. But there are also really important matters of principle if we are going to be living in a country that is subject to the rule of law. Fairness and the rule of law require people to have adequate legal representation and the ability to defend themselves in legal proceedings, especially when they have not been charged with or convicted of a criminal offence. This is known as the equality-of-arms principle. It is colloquially expressed in a term we are all familiar with—the right to a fair go. The idea of a right to a fair go is an Australian principle and an Australian ethic.


In direct contrast to this principle, this bill forces those who face an unexplained wealth order to rely upon legal aid in order to be able to obtain legal representation. They might have means available to them but they will be forced to rely on legal aid. It will mean that a person who is required by law to explain to a court how his or her house or car was lawfully obtained has to join the end of a very long legal aid queue while the government instructs the best legal and financial experts that money can buy.


The government's recent announcement of $11 million of extra funding for litigation specialists tasked with conducting confiscation proceedings and forensic accountants in cases such as this makes it abundantly clear that that the inequality of arms is likely to be on a monumental scale. This gives rise to the real risk that innocent people who have failed to keep receipts or records may lose their lawfully acquired assets. It is totally unacceptable in Australia in 2015.


For these reasons, the Australian Greens recommend that items (3) and (24) of the bill be removed. This will preserve the existing judicial discretion about accessing restrained funds for legal costs and protect Australia's legal resources such as in the legal assistance sector without impacting on legitimate aims of Australia's proceeds-of-crime regime. It will mean that it is judges and courts that are best positioned to understand the risk of someone not being able to adequately represent and defend themselves in the face of these sorts of proceedings that make that call. The Australian Greens will be seeking to amend the bill in line with these recommendations in the committee stage.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:03):  I support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014 as presented and oppose the amendments. I will not go into the provisions of the bill as Senator Collins has already done so in her contribution to the debate. I acknowledge that this is a bill that was proposed by the previous government and referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which handed down a final report on its inquiry. The government of the day accepted 15 of the committee's 18 recommendations, indicating that organised crime is motivated by the huge profits that can be made through illegal activity. The government said that it was:


… committed to ensuring that it has strong laws to target the criminal economy; not only removing the proceeds of crime, but also preventing its reinvestment into further criminal activity.


I note in passing that the Greens political party indicated their general support for that recommendation back in 2012, so I am somewhat surprised that they now have amendments.


I will not deal with the bill as such, as I said, because Senator Collins and also the minister in his second reading speech adequately dealt with it. I just want to briefly respond to the Greens' comments regarding their amendments. What the AFP and others are concerned about is that these proceeds of crime may, under the current law, be used to mount a legal case. As those of us who have any connection with the law know, you can run legal cases ad infinitum and use most of the wealth that was got from illegal activities in fighting cases.


The Greens said in their speech that it is difficult for people to prove that their house or car was legally obtained. I think when most Australians buy a house they go to the bank and get a mortgage. There is never much doubt about where the proceeds have come from. I accept that in a very high-profile allegation about a former Prime Minister there was some doubt about where the money came from to purchase a house in Melbourne but, that aside, most Australians can clearly indicate that they bought their house or their car through a loan from a bank. Those records are readily available. It is only criminals, who are often very well advised by top-flight accountants and lawyers, who can mix up the money so that it is sometimes difficult to follow the trail of where it has come from. Whilst I hear what the Greens are saying about their amendments, I can say that for 99.9 per cent of Australians there is not much trouble in showing where we all got our money from to buy our houses or cars.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looked at this bill with some intensity. To a degree we were persuaded by the work of the joint committee on the same bill a couple of years previously, but we did seek submissions and we did conduct an inquiry.


I note that the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria was concerned, as are the Greens in their speech, that if people could not use the value of the assets in question to mount their legal defence, they might have to go to legal aid. I can understand the Victorian Legal Aid Commission being concerned about extra access to their very limited funds for these types of issues. As the Australian Federal Police pointed out, if the Legal Aid Commission does provide funds and it is found that the assets were legally obtained, then the assets stay with the person accused and that person then—with the benefit of those assets—can repay the Legal Aid Commission. In those instances, I do not think it is going to have a big impact on legal aid. Furthermore, the AFP said in evidence that they were :


… not expecting a huge volume of unexplained wealth cases.


And, further:


… if a person does need to resort to legal aid there are ways for them to do that and for the legal aid commission to recoup those costs.


That is, in the way I have just mentioned.


I do acknowledge the concerns of the Law Council of Australia, who did give evidence and did assist the committee with their work. I would point out—and perhaps I will not read it in full—page 29, clause 2.29 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's report, where the AFP explain that the current safeguards, which the Greens are saying are sufficient, were unlikely to 'operate as a concrete safeguard'. They go on in the passage quoted in the committee report to explain that:


The AFP added that the existing provisions, which provide for a person to access restrained assets for the purpose of legal expenses, have been found to be the 'type of provision [that] undermined the entire object of the act because ... people would rather spend their money on their lawyers than see the money going to be confiscated by law enforcement'.


In a lot of these issues, whilst they are matters for parliament to determine, clearly you have to take notice of the people at the cold face and the people who are there trying to protect Australians from crime—organised crime in particular—and the unexplained wealth that sometimes comes from organised criminal activities. The AFP and other law enforcement agencies obviously were the ones who approached the government of the day for the amendments to these bills to make it easier for them to fight crime and to protect all of us from the activities of organised crime.


I will not delay the Senate further. Suffice to say, for the reasons contained in the Senate committee's report and those enunciated by Senator Collins as well, I support the bill and oppose the amendments proposed by the Greens.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:10):  As we all know, organised crime can be a very profitable business; because if it was not, obviously criminals would not bother being involved with it. As many of us know, when the notorious gangster Al Capone was finally convicted of a major crime, it was not for murder, kidnapping or extortion: it was for tax evasion. That is because, while it can be very profitable to earn money via criminal activities, it becomes extremely difficult to hide large sums of money obtained through illegal means. It has a habit of being splashed around, because what is the point of earning large amounts of money by criminal dealings if not to live the high life? By following the money trail, as it were, it becomes possible to find the more substantive crimes which created the wealth in the first place. It becomes possible to connect the kingpins of organised crime to their underlings that actually commit the crimes on their behalf and at their direction.


Labor supports this bill, because it builds on the actions of the Labor Party when in government. It was the Labor Party that enacted the Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws that have been in place since 2010 and this bill enhances these laws. It was Labor that first acted on this issue, and I am glad that this government has followed our lead. The bill amends the Proceeds of Crime Act to strengthen the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth regime and improve the investigation and litigation of unexplained wealth matters.


Organised crime is serious business in Australia. According to the Crime Commission's Organised crime in Australia 2013 report, they conservatively estimate organised crime to currently cost Australia $15 billion annually. That is an extraordinarily large amount of money and a substantial drain on our society. But organised crime in Australia is not an issue that just affects Australians; it is inextricably linked to international organised crime. Serious and organised criminals operating in Australia necessarily have international links to facilitate their activities—particularly the movement of illicit goods into Australia—and overseas-based organised criminals actively target Australia.


As a relatively wealthy nation, we make a good target for overseas based cybercrimes. We have also seen the rise of online trading sites, like the now defunct Silk Road, which have made it easier for organise criminals to sell illegal and harmful products to Australians without ever stepping onto Australian soil. This means that strong and trusted partnerships with overseas law enforcement agencies are now more fundamental to combating organised crime than they have ever been.


The history of international action was outlined in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's report on the inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. They said in that:


The importance of serious and organised crime had already been recognised internationally, with a 1997 Interpol resolution recommending that member countries consider adopting effective laws, that give law enforcement officials the powers they need to combat money laundering both domestically and internationally, including reversing the burden of proof (using the concept of reverse onus) in respect of the confiscation of alleged proceeds of crime.


The idea of confiscation of unexplained wealth in international agreements can be traced back as far as the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).


We are debating this issue in this place today because the issue of organised crime is becoming more prevalent and is having a wider impact on Australians. As the Crime Commission said:


Once, encounters with organised crime were largely restricted to those who sought out illicit commodities or illegal activities. Today, any Australian on any day can be …


affected by organised crime.


It might not be entirely obvious how Australians can be affected by organised crime, so I will take a quick moment to outline some of the ways that everyday, ordinary Australians can be affected by organised crime. These ways include being defrauded in investment scams, the use of dangerous and volatile clandestine laboratories to produce drugs in suburban areas, the theft of credit card and bank account data through online attacks, or by means of skimming, and the violence between organised crime groups that takes place in public.


As the former Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety I heard stories time and time again of people, particularly senior Australians, losing thousands of dollars, even hundreds of thousands of dollars, through online fraud perpetrated by organised criminals. Hundreds of thousands dollars have been lost through fake emails phishing for information. I remember during a hearing of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety in Sydney the Australian Taxation Office showing me two emails purporting to be from the ATO. The first was a year old and was a relatively crude affair, but the second email, a year later, looked extremely professional, with the correct ATO logo, and was very difficult even for tax office officials to identify that it was a fake. The email claimed that the recipient was eligible for a small refund from the ATO. It was not a large figure; generally they are quite small. But when you add all these small amounts together you see that these people are making a substantial amount of money out of their crimes. When the victim clicked on the link they were sent to a website with an almost identical address to the ATO, which was a clone of the ATO site. These criminals are very smart and very clever. I do not think it is very smart or clever of anyone in this parliament to underestimate how much people are getting out of this sort of crime. Organised crime is getting larger and more sophisticated. It involves activities that can every single one of us. Organised criminals are using other sorts of crime, including human trafficking, but today we are talking about wealth.


We support this bill, so I will not take up too much more time. I will say that Labor started the process of this bill when we were in government. Despite assurances they would retain proceeds seized under their own laws the states and territories have consistently rejected this proposal. In June 2013, former police commissioners Mick Palmer and Ken Moroney were appointed by then minister, Jason Clare, to negotiate with jurisdictions and 'break the deadlock'. Unfortunately, that is yet to be achieved. It was reported in October 2013 that Mr Palmer and Mr Moroney were due to report to government 'within weeks'. However, we are not sure if this occurred or, if it did, what their report contained. It would be nice of the government to inform this place and the other place about the outcome of these negotiations.


Labor's Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 passed through the House of Representatives in February 2013 but lapsed in the Senate at the end of the last parliament. The bill we are debating today, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014 is fundamentally the same as the lapsed legislation and implements Labor's commitments of February 2013 in the government's response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. The bill implements eight out of 18 recommendations handed down in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained legislation and arrangements.


Minister Keenan, in opposition, made remarks about Labor not embracing the recommendations of the committee which involved the Australian Crime Commission pursuing unexplained wealth orders. In government, however, Minister Keenan has unfortunately failed to keep faith with his rhetoric in opposition. Once again, the coalition have said one thing in opposition and have done the opposite in government. The bill does not contain new provisions concerning the work of the ACC; it is just to continue on.


We support this bill. I am pleased that the government have finally come to the fore in supporting this bill that was begun when we were in government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-02-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:19):  I rise today to object to passage of the Crimes Legislation (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014. I am sure everyone in this place would be horrified if a neighbour simply took their car and sold it to pay a debt. They would likely be even more annoyed if it was later shown that the neighbour was in the wrong and there was no debt owing at all. But that is what this bill allows the government to do. I am always especially concerned whenever the government gets to do something obviously bad, simply because it is the government. Perhaps it is possible that people in this place do not appreciate what is being waved through the chamber today, so I will explain.


 Unexplained wealth regimes—Australia has one in every state and territory, as well as the Commonwealth version I am discussing now—allow the state to confiscate an individual's assets without proof of guilt. They are not to be confused with proceeds of crime legislation, which only come into play once a conviction has been secured. What sort of assets? It is merely wealth that you can't explain, wealth that is inconsistent with your tax records or that appears to have been obtained in a year when you filed no tax return. Wealth that is not obvious on an examination of tax records is actually deemed to be unexplained. People must go to court and prove that on the balance of probabilities they acquired it legitimately. However, it is rather difficult to go to court when your property has been taken from you, and you are not allowed to use it to defray your legal costs. The legislation refers to it as 'restrained property'.


You therefore have no money and must apply for legal aid in order to defend yourself against the government. In fact, you must not only defend yourself, but you must also prove that the money now held by the state is legitimately your own. But legal aid mainly deals with criminal and family matters. A legal aid lawyer is paid roughly $150 an hour. Unexplained wealth situations are different and far more complex. For a start, there is no crime, which means a criminal lawyer is of little use. Much of the relevant law in cases like this concerns taxation and corporate matters. Commercial lawyers are much more expensive than criminal lawyers; they cost between $350 and $400 an hour and very few do legal aid work. And because it is not possible to pay for a lawyer out of 'restrained property', the action becomes almost impossible to defend. At this point, many people simply give up and let the government keep their money.


Of course, you may be a bad person. You may be a drug kingpin. You may—thanks to the offensively high excise on cigarettes—be growing a bit of illicit tobacco on the side. There used to be a rule that the state had to prove you were a bad person before it could send you to jail or take your property. That was a good rule. In fact, it used to be our rule, derived from clause 39 of Magna Carta:


No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.


Thanks to bills like this one, that rule has been abrogated. The explanatory memorandum could not be clearer:


Under Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation, if a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person's total wealth exceeds the value of the person's wealth that was lawfully acquired, the court can compel the person to attend court and prove, on the balance of probabilities, that their wealth was not derived from one or more relevant offences. If a person cannot demonstrate this, the court may order them to pay to the Commonwealth the difference between their total wealth and their legitimate wealth.


So then, what makes this bill even more obnoxious than the confiscatory legislation it seeks to amend? Once again, I turn to the explanatory memorandum:


Courts hearing unexplained wealth matters currently have a general discretion to decline to make a restraining order, preliminary unexplained wealth order or final unexplained wealth order, even if all relevant criteria for making the orders have been satisfied. The Bill will remove this discretion and will require courts to make [those orders] once satisfied that the criteria for making them have been met.


That bit of airy legalese means that the judge's role is reduced to a box-ticking exercise. The judge cannot act independently—as the third arm of government, the judicial arm—to defend one of our most basic common law rights: the presumption of innocence. His judicial discretion has been swept away.


Indeed, when the New South Wales equivalent of the law before us today was litigated last year, the High Court, more in sorrow than in anger, had to concede that 'the principle of legality'—a rule of statutory interpretation that requires parliament to use clear language if it intends to restrict fundamental rights or depart from general principles of law—had genuinely been invoked. The New South Wales parliament intended—with a degree of clarity that is difficult to credit—to abrogate a fundamental common law right. This bill seeks to do exactly the same thing.


The bill represents a gross expansion of police power, and, as I have often noticed, a policeman never seems to see a power he does not like. It allows the government to steal our money, overturns the presumption of innocence, reverses the onus of proof and prevents the courts from protecting our rights. It ought to be condemned and not passed.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Special Minister of State) (11:26):  On behalf of Senator Brandis, I would like to sum up the debate on this bill. Senator Brandis thanks honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014 reflects the government's continued efforts to provide new tools to courts and law enforcement agencies to confiscate the illicit proceeds associated with serious and organised crime. Senator Brandis would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which inquired into the bill and its recommendation that the Senate pass the bill. He also thanks the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for their examination of the bill.


I would like to go through some of the matters that were raised by honourable senators during the course of this debate. Senator Wright argued against items (3) and (24) of schedule 1 to the bill, which would preserve judicial discretion after accessing restrained funds for legal costs in unexplained wealth matters. The parliamentary joint committee, which is not the government, does not accept these arguments. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, the PJCLE, has recommended the unexplained wealth laws be changed to prevent people from using restrained property from meeting their legal expenses under recommendation 10. The PJCLE considered submissions and evidence from a range of community, law enforcement and other government bodies in making this recommendation. Unexplained wealth proceedings are the only type of proceeds of crime proceedings in which people are allowed to use restrained assets in this way. The Proceeds of Crime Act generally prohibits restrained assets being used in this way to prevent the practice of dissipating wealth on legal expenses to frustrate potential proceeds of crime orders.


To ensure that people are not deprived of legal representation, the Proceeds of Crime Act provides a scheme to reimburse Legal Aid Commissions for costs incurred in representing people who are subject to a restraining order. Under the bill people who are not subject to unexplained wealth proceedings may seek legal representation through legal Aid if their unrestrained assets are not sufficient to meet legal costs to ensure that they are appropriately represented and are not disadvantaged. People are still able to use any of their unrestrained assets to pay for legal counsel of their choosing. The courts also have a wide discretion to revoke or refuse orders, such as where it is in the interests of justice to do so.


Senator Wright also made comments in relation to item 3 of schedule 1 of the bill. The government does not accept those arguments. The ability of a person to dispose of restrained property to meet their legal costs weakens the effectiveness of the unexplained wealth provisions, by allowing the wealth suspected to have been unlawfully acquired to be used to contest proceedings. This may lead to fewer assets being available for confiscation if an unexplained wealth order is successful, and is likely to cause more protracted litigation. This amendment will harmonise provisions relating to the payment of legal expenses for unexplained wealth cases with similar provisions relating to other proceedings under the POC Act.


Senator Wright also said that she was opposed to item 24 of schedule 1. Item 24 repeals section 179SA, which relates to the payment of legal expenses, and substitutes new sections 179SA and 179SB, relating to the creation and registration of charges over property subject to a restraining order. Unexplained wealth orders create a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth. As such, an unexplained wealth order does not attach to particular property of a person or require a particular property be forfeited. Other provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act which create a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth—such as pecuniary penalty orders and literary proceeds orders—allow for the creation and registration of charges over restrained property to secure payment of amounts owing to the Commonwealth. This ensures that property is available to satisfy a pecuniary penalty order or a literary proceeds order if a person does not pay the amount specified in the order. However, the same power does not exist for unexplained wealth orders. Proposed sections 179SA and 179SB will allow charges to be created and registered over restrained property to secure payment of unexplained wealth amounts. This amendment will improve the enforcement of unexplained wealth orders by ensuring that restrained property can be used to satisfy an unexplained wealth order, if a person does not pay an unexplained wealth amount. This amendment implements recommendation 11 of the final report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.


Senator Collins claimed that the bill is identical to a previous bill introduced by Labor in 2012. That bill, which was not passed, would have implemented only six of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement following its 2012 inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws. The government's bill implements two additional recommendations when compared to Labor's 2012 bill. These measures would (1) streamline affidavit requirements in accordance with the committee's recommendation 8, and (2) include a statement on the Proceeds of Crime Act's objectives clause about undermining the profitability of criminal enterprise, in accordance with recommendation 1. This bill also makes technical amendments to improve the operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act.


Senator Wright asserted that the unexplained wealth regime does not require suspicion of an offence and, more broadly, that the bill was fundamentally inconsistent with human rights. In response, the government says this: the unexplained wealth regime provides that if a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person's total wealth exceeds the value of the person's wealth which was lawfully acquired, the court can compel the person to attend court and to prove on the balance of probabilities that their wealth was not derived from one or more offences. The very point of unexplained wealth provisions is to turn the tables on criminals—to require them to demonstrate that their wealth was lawfully acquired. The bill amends the existing unexplained wealth regime, which was carefully crafted within constitutional limits, including ensuring that it did not breach the principles of the separation of powers or the acquisition of property on just terms.


Senator Bilyk noted the bill does not contain new provisions relating to the work of the Australian Crime Commission. The amendments proposed by the PJCLE that relate to the ACC have either been implemented or raise legal issues that require further consideration. PJCLE recommendation 2 proposed the amendment of Commonwealth legislation to allow the ACC board to issue a determination on unexplained wealth, to enable the ACC to use its coercive powers to provide evidence in support of unexplained wealth proceedings. This recommendation was considered, but it was determined that the ACC can already use its coercive powers to investigate matters relating to federal or other relevant criminal activity. Evidence gathered by the ACC is generally available for use in unexplained wealth proceedings. PJCLE recommendations 3 and 4 relate to amendments to clarify the role of the ACC with respect to unexplained wealth proceedings. These recommendations raise legal issues which require further consideration and which the ACC and the Attorney's department are working on to progress. While these issues remain under consideration, the ACC will continue to use its existing powers to assist in POC proceedings.


Unexplained wealth laws are a highly effective weapon in the fight against serious and organised crime. They allow a court, in appropriate circumstances, to order a person to demonstrate that his or her wealth was lawfully acquired. If the person is unable to do so, they may be ordered to forfeit their illegitimate wealth. These laws are vital because they take the profit out of serious and organised crime, and prevent criminal proceeds from being reinvested to support further criminal activity. They also provide an avenue to target the kingpins of criminal groups, many of whom live off the benefits of illegal activities but distance themselves from the actual commission of offences. In March 2012, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement made recommendations to improve the investigation and litigation of Commonwealth unexplained wealth matters under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.


The bill implements eight recommendations of the PJCLE to make the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws more effective, including: the streamlining of affidavit requirements; allowing a court to extend the time frame for serving notice; amending legal expense and legal aid provisions for unexplained wealth cases for other POC Act proceedings, so as to prevent restrained assets being used to meet legal expenses; and, finally, removing a court's discretion to make unexplained wealth restraining orders, preliminary unexplained wealth orders and unexplained wealth orders once relevant criteria are satisfied. The bill also makes technical amendments to clarify and streamline processes under the act. These measures are based on the advice of our law enforcement agencies about the best way to ensure that these laws meet their important aims. To balance the expansion of these powers, the bill requires the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to report annually to the PJCLE on the number of unexplained wealth investigations and applications. This will strengthen the PJCLE's oversight of the use of the provisions and ensure appropriate checks on the use of unexplained wealth investigative powers.


On behalf of the Attorney, I thank all colleagues across both sides of the chamber for recognising the need for these important reforms to the Commonwealth's proceeds of crime regime. The bill has a direct impact on the ability of our law enforcement agencies to confiscate illicit proceeds and to prevent serious and organised crime. The bill represents an important reform of Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws and a significant step in ensuring that serious and organised crime does not again gain a foothold in this country. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:48):  Organised crime in this country is something all levels of government need to tackle. And one way to do this is to target the unexplained wealth of individuals, especially those who are not directly involved in an act of criminality, to obtain benefits. Criminals who are profiting from other people's crimes will be targeted by authorities who have more ability, now, to seize assets where the size of their wealth cannot be explained.


Organised crime can affect many unsuspecting Australians through many means, which may include bank account data and credit card theft through skimming of cards via ATMs and point-of-sale hubs or online attacks and investment scams.


The previous, Labor government introduced the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill on 28 November in 2012. While it passed the House of Representatives it lapsed in the Senate before the last federal election. Now, the Minister for Justice Michael Keenan has re-introduced this bill, and it looks very similar to the one Labor introduced. In fact, it looks near identical, so I would like to acknowledge the government for supporting the previous, Labor government's bill.


Primarily, the legislation focuses on the various recommendations that the Parliament Joint Committee on Law enforcement brought down in 2012. They include recommendations such as preliminary unexplained wealth affidavits being streamlined; requiring the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to provide the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement with an annual report on unexplained wealth matters and litigation, along with empowering the committee to seek further information from federal agencies; restraining assets from being used to meet legal expenses, and making consistent legal aid provisions; securing payment from restrained property through an unexplained wealth order; including a statement in the objects clause about undermining the profitability of criminal enterprises; removing a court's discretion to make unexplained wealth restraining orders, preliminary unexplained wealth orders and unexplained wealth orders, once relevant criteria are satisfied; extending the time limit for serving notice of applications for certain unexplained wealth orders by a court; and, finally, evidence relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings being seized under a search warrant. 


Another measure not in the report but necessary to support the measures already stated includes someone not being able to frustrate an unexplained wealth proceeding by failing to appear, and clarifying orders being made. I am not sure whether many people are aware of the legal aid provisions of unexplained wealth cases but the current process is that suspect assets can be used to go towards a legal defence. This bill closes that gap.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement recommended the Commonwealth lead on the development of nationally consistent unexplained wealth regimes. The states and territories are still considering whether to go down that path, with former police commissioners Mick Palmer and Ken Moroney called in to negotiate with the states. To date discussions are still occurring, unless developments have occurred more recently.


Chris Hayes, the member for Fowler, who has contributed greatly to this bill through his involvement on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, made what I thought was a very good statement which summed up the whole reason for this bill. He said:


… for every crime, there is a victim of crime. Therefore, if you prevent a crime or deter the commissioning of a crime, there is one less victim.


I couldn't agree more. Labor has supported and will continue to support the laws which take the incentive out of organised crime. Thus, Labor will be supporting this legislation, as it basically mirrors the legislation we introduced in 2012. Before I complete my contribution, I want to compliment our federal, state and territory police forces around the country. They all work in a very difficult space and do a very good job in protecting us.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:53):  I rise to speak about the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014. In particular, today I want to speak about the aspects of this bill that entrench the inequality of arms, undermine the presumption of innocence and therefore offend the rule of law. Like every other senator in this place, I am repulsed by the idea of criminals benefiting from the proceeds of their crimes. Australia must and does already have an extensive proceeds of crime regime in place to ensure that those who break the law do not profit from their crimes. But let's be very clear about what the existing law already allows.


Under existing law, a person who may not even be suspected of engaging in a criminal offence can be required to front up to a court and prove that his or her home, car or other assets have been legally obtained. There is no requirement for the police to show that there is a link between the asset and the commission of any specific criminal offence. Even if the asset was legally obtained, the person will lose it unless they can provide sufficient proof that it was lawfully acquired.


But this bill seeks to extend this regime into a new frontier of unfairness, where those who are required to prove to a court that their assets were legally obtained would be denied access to the type of legal representation that they want and need. Currently, where a person's assets are restrained in an action like this, a judge hearing the matter has the discretion to allow the person to use their assets to pay for their legal defence. But this bill will remove that discretion totally.


The feature of this bill that raises particular concerns for the Australian Greens, and for many legal experts who have made submissions in relation to these amendments over consecutive parliamentary inquiries, is the removal of this discretion. Many of these concerns are also shared by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. These concerns arise both from the practical implications of them but also principle.


As a starting point, the amendments proposed in the bill are completely unnecessary. There has been no case made for these amendments. The court can already refuse to allow a person to use their assets for the purpose of obtaining legal advice where they have been issued with an unexplained wealth order if the court is concerned, for instance, that the real purpose is to dissipate the assets so they cannot be seized by the state, by the government.


There is no evidence in the explanatory memorandum that the existence of this discretion as it currently stands has been misused or has jeopardised the outcome of unexplained wealth proceedings. There is no evidence in the explanatory memorandum—the memorandum which is designed to explain the rationale for the legislation we are being asked to agree to. The government has given no compelling reasons to justify taking this discretion away from the party which is best placed to make this call: the court. As is usually the case, it is the judge, the court, who is privy to the information and the evidence and can assess the merits of the person's application—in this case, to use their assets to obtain legal advice and representation.


Then there are the principle issues. In the situation where a person is being subjected to a very significant action by government to remove their assets, this bill will force parties to look to legal aid for assistance. This will compound existing pressure on legal aid services in an environment in which the legal assistance sector is already notoriously overloaded. Victoria Legal Aid's submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, for instance, made it clear that diverting people who want to contest unexplained wealth proceedings into the legal aid scheme will see an increase in applications for funding for complex and protracted litigation, which would require sizeable payments to legal representatives and forensic experts, if indeed their defence is to be done properly.


In our society, under the rule of law, people are entitled to mount an appropriate defence to actions by government like this. This is a serious concern. There is clear evidence of already significant existing levels of unmet need in the legal assistance sector. They are in our newspapers. They are in our faces every day. This means that people are already prevented from getting the legal assistance they need. Increasingly, it is not just the poorest Australians but also middle Australians as well. It is having damaging consequences, both for individuals and also for the structure of our legal system, the basis on which our legal system has been established. For instance, there has been a huge increase in self-represented litigants in litigation generally but particularly in the Family Court, which means people are unable to get the legal advice and representation they need. They are being forced to try and run complex cases on their own. This is the existing situation, without the change that is mooted in this bill.


There is also doubt as to the capacity of any legal aid grant to meet the costs that would be sustained in an unexplained wealth matter. As discussed in the Law Council of Australia's submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, there is generally a need for specialist commercial expertise in responding to unexplained wealth orders. That does not come cheap, and there are often restrictions on using legal aid funding to obtain expert reports.


They are the practical implications. I said they were the matters of principle but in fact they are the practical implications of the provisions in this bill. But there are also really important matters of principle if we are going to be living in a country that is subject to the rule of law. Fairness and the rule of law require people to have adequate legal representation and the ability to defend themselves in legal proceedings, especially when they have not been charged with or convicted of a criminal offence. This is known as the equality-of-arms principle. It is colloquially expressed in a term we are all familiar with—the right to a fair go. The idea of a right to a fair go is an Australian principle and an Australian ethic.


In direct contrast to this principle, this bill forces those who face an unexplained wealth order to rely upon legal aid in order to be able to obtain legal representation. They might have means available to them but they will be forced to rely on legal aid. It will mean that a person who is required by law to explain to a court how his or her house or car was lawfully obtained has to join the end of a very long legal aid queue while the government instructs the best legal and financial experts that money can buy.


The government's recent announcement of $11 million of extra funding for litigation specialists tasked with conducting confiscation proceedings and forensic accountants in cases such as this makes it abundantly clear that that the inequality of arms is likely to be on a monumental scale. This gives rise to the real risk that innocent people who have failed to keep receipts or records may lose their lawfully acquired assets. It is totally unacceptable in Australia in 2015.


For these reasons, the Australian Greens recommend that items (3) and (24) of the bill be removed. This will preserve the existing judicial discretion about accessing restrained funds for legal costs and protect Australia's legal resources such as in the legal assistance sector without impacting on legitimate aims of Australia's proceeds-of-crime regime. It will mean that it is judges and courts that are best positioned to understand the risk of someone not being able to adequately represent and defend themselves in the face of these sorts of proceedings that make that call. The Australian Greens will be seeking to amend the bill in line with these recommendations in the committee stage.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:03):  I support the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014 as presented and oppose the amendments. I will not go into the provisions of the bill as Senator Collins has already done so in her contribution to the debate. I acknowledge that this is a bill that was proposed by the previous government and referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which handed down a final report on its inquiry. The government of the day accepted 15 of the committee's 18 recommendations, indicating that organised crime is motivated by the huge profits that can be made through illegal activity. The government said that it was:


… committed to ensuring that it has strong laws to target the criminal economy; not only removing the proceeds of crime, but also preventing its reinvestment into further criminal activity.


I note in passing that the Greens political party indicated their general support for that recommendation back in 2012, so I am somewhat surprised that they now have amendments.


I will not deal with the bill as such, as I said, because Senator Collins and also the minister in his second reading speech adequately dealt with it. I just want to briefly respond to the Greens' comments regarding their amendments. What the AFP and others are concerned about is that these proceeds of crime may, under the current law, be used to mount a legal case. As those of us who have any connection with the law know, you can run legal cases ad infinitum and use most of the wealth that was got from illegal activities in fighting cases.


The Greens said in their speech that it is difficult for people to prove that their house or car was legally obtained. I think when most Australians buy a house they go to the bank and get a mortgage. There is never much doubt about where the proceeds have come from. I accept that in a very high-profile allegation about a former Prime Minister there was some doubt about where the money came from to purchase a house in Melbourne but, that aside, most Australians can clearly indicate that they bought their house or their car through a loan from a bank. Those records are readily available. It is only criminals, who are often very well advised by top-flight accountants and lawyers, who can mix up the money so that it is sometimes difficult to follow the trail of where it has come from. Whilst I hear what the Greens are saying about their amendments, I can say that for 99.9 per cent of Australians there is not much trouble in showing where we all got our money from to buy our houses or cars.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looked at this bill with some intensity. To a degree we were persuaded by the work of the joint committee on the same bill a couple of years previously, but we did seek submissions and we did conduct an inquiry.


I note that the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria was concerned, as are the Greens in their speech, that if people could not use the value of the assets in question to mount their legal defence, they might have to go to legal aid. I can understand the Victorian Legal Aid Commission being concerned about extra access to their very limited funds for these types of issues. As the Australian Federal Police pointed out, if the Legal Aid Commission does provide funds and it is found that the assets were legally obtained, then the assets stay with the person accused and that person then—with the benefit of those assets—can repay the Legal Aid Commission. In those instances, I do not think it is going to have a big impact on legal aid. Furthermore, the AFP said in evidence that they were :


… not expecting a huge volume of unexplained wealth cases.


And, further:


… if a person does need to resort to legal aid there are ways for them to do that and for the legal aid commission to recoup those costs.


That is, in the way I have just mentioned.


I do acknowledge the concerns of the Law Council of Australia, who did give evidence and did assist the committee with their work. I would point out—and perhaps I will not read it in full—page 29, clause 2.29 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's report, where the AFP explain that the current safeguards, which the Greens are saying are sufficient, were unlikely to 'operate as a concrete safeguard'. They go on in the passage quoted in the committee report to explain that:


The AFP added that the existing provisions, which provide for a person to access restrained assets for the purpose of legal expenses, have been found to be the 'type of provision [that] undermined the entire object of the act because ... people would rather spend their money on their lawyers than see the money going to be confiscated by law enforcement'.


In a lot of these issues, whilst they are matters for parliament to determine, clearly you have to take notice of the people at the cold face and the people who are there trying to protect Australians from crime—organised crime in particular—and the unexplained wealth that sometimes comes from organised criminal activities. The AFP and other law enforcement agencies obviously were the ones who approached the government of the day for the amendments to these bills to make it easier for them to fight crime and to protect all of us from the activities of organised crime.


I will not delay the Senate further. Suffice to say, for the reasons contained in the Senate committee's report and those enunciated by Senator Collins as well, I support the bill and oppose the amendments proposed by the Greens.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:10):  As we all know, organised crime can be a very profitable business; because if it was not, obviously criminals would not bother being involved with it. As many of us know, when the notorious gangster Al Capone was finally convicted of a major crime, it was not for murder, kidnapping or extortion: it was for tax evasion. That is because, while it can be very profitable to earn money via criminal activities, it becomes extremely difficult to hide large sums of money obtained through illegal means. It has a habit of being splashed around, because what is the point of earning large amounts of money by criminal dealings if not to live the high life? By following the money trail, as it were, it becomes possible to find the more substantive crimes which created the wealth in the first place. It becomes possible to connect the kingpins of organised crime to their underlings that actually commit the crimes on their behalf and at their direction.


Labor supports this bill, because it builds on the actions of the Labor Party when in government. It was the Labor Party that enacted the Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws that have been in place since 2010 and this bill enhances these laws. It was Labor that first acted on this issue, and I am glad that this government has followed our lead. The bill amends the Proceeds of Crime Act to strengthen the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth regime and improve the investigation and litigation of unexplained wealth matters.


Organised crime is serious business in Australia. According to the Crime Commission's Organised crime in Australia 2013 report, they conservatively estimate organised crime to currently cost Australia $15 billion annually. That is an extraordinarily large amount of money and a substantial drain on our society. But organised crime in Australia is not an issue that just affects Australians; it is inextricably linked to international organised crime. Serious and organised criminals operating in Australia necessarily have international links to facilitate their activities—particularly the movement of illicit goods into Australia—and overseas-based organised criminals actively target Australia.


As a relatively wealthy nation, we make a good target for overseas based cybercrimes. We have also seen the rise of online trading sites, like the now defunct Silk Road, which have made it easier for organise criminals to sell illegal and harmful products to Australians without ever stepping onto Australian soil. This means that strong and trusted partnerships with overseas law enforcement agencies are now more fundamental to combating organised crime than they have ever been.


The history of international action was outlined in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's report on the inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. They said in that:


The importance of serious and organised crime had already been recognised internationally, with a 1997 Interpol resolution recommending that member countries consider adopting effective laws, that give law enforcement officials the powers they need to combat money laundering both domestically and internationally, including reversing the burden of proof (using the concept of reverse onus) in respect of the confiscation of alleged proceeds of crime.


The idea of confiscation of unexplained wealth in international agreements can be traced back as far as the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).


We are debating this issue in this place today because the issue of organised crime is becoming more prevalent and is having a wider impact on Australians. As the Crime Commission said:


Once, encounters with organised crime were largely restricted to those who sought out illicit commodities or illegal activities. Today, any Australian on any day can be …


affected by organised crime.


It might not be entirely obvious how Australians can be affected by organised crime, so I will take a quick moment to outline some of the ways that everyday, ordinary Australians can be affected by organised crime. These ways include being defrauded in investment scams, the use of dangerous and volatile clandestine laboratories to produce drugs in suburban areas, the theft of credit card and bank account data through online attacks, or by means of skimming, and the violence between organised crime groups that takes place in public.


As the former Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety I heard stories time and time again of people, particularly senior Australians, losing thousands of dollars, even hundreds of thousands of dollars, through online fraud perpetrated by organised criminals. Hundreds of thousands dollars have been lost through fake emails phishing for information. I remember during a hearing of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety in Sydney the Australian Taxation Office showing me two emails purporting to be from the ATO. The first was a year old and was a relatively crude affair, but the second email, a year later, looked extremely professional, with the correct ATO logo, and was very difficult even for tax office officials to identify that it was a fake. The email claimed that the recipient was eligible for a small refund from the ATO. It was not a large figure; generally they are quite small. But when you add all these small amounts together you see that these people are making a substantial amount of money out of their crimes. When the victim clicked on the link they were sent to a website with an almost identical address to the ATO, which was a clone of the ATO site. These criminals are very smart and very clever. I do not think it is very smart or clever of anyone in this parliament to underestimate how much people are getting out of this sort of crime. Organised crime is getting larger and more sophisticated. It involves activities that can every single one of us. Organised criminals are using other sorts of crime, including human trafficking, but today we are talking about wealth.


We support this bill, so I will not take up too much more time. I will say that Labor started the process of this bill when we were in government. Despite assurances they would retain proceeds seized under their own laws the states and territories have consistently rejected this proposal. In June 2013, former police commissioners Mick Palmer and Ken Moroney were appointed by then minister, Jason Clare, to negotiate with jurisdictions and 'break the deadlock'. Unfortunately, that is yet to be achieved. It was reported in October 2013 that Mr Palmer and Mr Moroney were due to report to government 'within weeks'. However, we are not sure if this occurred or, if it did, what their report contained. It would be nice of the government to inform this place and the other place about the outcome of these negotiations.


Labor's Crimes Legislation Amendment (Organised Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2012 passed through the House of Representatives in February 2013 but lapsed in the Senate at the end of the last parliament. The bill we are debating today, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014 is fundamentally the same as the lapsed legislation and implements Labor's commitments of February 2013 in the government's response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements. The bill implements eight out of 18 recommendations handed down in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained legislation and arrangements.


Minister Keenan, in opposition, made remarks about Labor not embracing the recommendations of the committee which involved the Australian Crime Commission pursuing unexplained wealth orders. In government, however, Minister Keenan has unfortunately failed to keep faith with his rhetoric in opposition. Once again, the coalition have said one thing in opposition and have done the opposite in government. The bill does not contain new provisions concerning the work of the ACC; it is just to continue on.


We support this bill. I am pleased that the government have finally come to the fore in supporting this bill that was begun when we were in government. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-02-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:19):  I rise today to object to passage of the Crimes Legislation (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014. I am sure everyone in this place would be horrified if a neighbour simply took their car and sold it to pay a debt. They would likely be even more annoyed if it was later shown that the neighbour was in the wrong and there was no debt owing at all. But that is what this bill allows the government to do. I am always especially concerned whenever the government gets to do something obviously bad, simply because it is the government. Perhaps it is possible that people in this place do not appreciate what is being waved through the chamber today, so I will explain.


 Unexplained wealth regimes—Australia has one in every state and territory, as well as the Commonwealth version I am discussing now—allow the state to confiscate an individual's assets without proof of guilt. They are not to be confused with proceeds of crime legislation, which only come into play once a conviction has been secured. What sort of assets? It is merely wealth that you can't explain, wealth that is inconsistent with your tax records or that appears to have been obtained in a year when you filed no tax return. Wealth that is not obvious on an examination of tax records is actually deemed to be unexplained. People must go to court and prove that on the balance of probabilities they acquired it legitimately. However, it is rather difficult to go to court when your property has been taken from you, and you are not allowed to use it to defray your legal costs. The legislation refers to it as 'restrained property'.


You therefore have no money and must apply for legal aid in order to defend yourself against the government. In fact, you must not only defend yourself, but you must also prove that the money now held by the state is legitimately your own. But legal aid mainly deals with criminal and family matters. A legal aid lawyer is paid roughly $150 an hour. Unexplained wealth situations are different and far more complex. For a start, there is no crime, which means a criminal lawyer is of little use. Much of the relevant law in cases like this concerns taxation and corporate matters. Commercial lawyers are much more expensive than criminal lawyers; they cost between $350 and $400 an hour and very few do legal aid work. And because it is not possible to pay for a lawyer out of 'restrained property', the action becomes almost impossible to defend. At this point, many people simply give up and let the government keep their money.


Of course, you may be a bad person. You may be a drug kingpin. You may—thanks to the offensively high excise on cigarettes—be growing a bit of illicit tobacco on the side. There used to be a rule that the state had to prove you were a bad person before it could send you to jail or take your property. That was a good rule. In fact, it used to be our rule, derived from clause 39 of Magna Carta:


No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.


Thanks to bills like this one, that rule has been abrogated. The explanatory memorandum could not be clearer:


Under Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation, if a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person's total wealth exceeds the value of the person's wealth that was lawfully acquired, the court can compel the person to attend court and prove, on the balance of probabilities, that their wealth was not derived from one or more relevant offences. If a person cannot demonstrate this, the court may order them to pay to the Commonwealth the difference between their total wealth and their legitimate wealth.


So then, what makes this bill even more obnoxious than the confiscatory legislation it seeks to amend? Once again, I turn to the explanatory memorandum:


Courts hearing unexplained wealth matters currently have a general discretion to decline to make a restraining order, preliminary unexplained wealth order or final unexplained wealth order, even if all relevant criteria for making the orders have been satisfied. The Bill will remove this discretion and will require courts to make [those orders] once satisfied that the criteria for making them have been met.


That bit of airy legalese means that the judge's role is reduced to a box-ticking exercise. The judge cannot act independently—as the third arm of government, the judicial arm—to defend one of our most basic common law rights: the presumption of innocence. His judicial discretion has been swept away.


Indeed, when the New South Wales equivalent of the law before us today was litigated last year, the High Court, more in sorrow than in anger, had to concede that 'the principle of legality'—a rule of statutory interpretation that requires parliament to use clear language if it intends to restrict fundamental rights or depart from general principles of law—had genuinely been invoked. The New South Wales parliament intended—with a degree of clarity that is difficult to credit—to abrogate a fundamental common law right. This bill seeks to do exactly the same thing.


The bill represents a gross expansion of police power, and, as I have often noticed, a policeman never seems to see a power he does not like. It allows the government to steal our money, overturns the presumption of innocence, reverses the onus of proof and prevents the courts from protecting our rights. It ought to be condemned and not passed.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Special Minister of State) (11:26):  On behalf of Senator Brandis, I would like to sum up the debate on this bill. Senator Brandis thanks honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014 reflects the government's continued efforts to provide new tools to courts and law enforcement agencies to confiscate the illicit proceeds associated with serious and organised crime. Senator Brandis would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which inquired into the bill and its recommendation that the Senate pass the bill. He also thanks the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for their examination of the bill.


I would like to go through some of the matters that were raised by honourable senators during the course of this debate. Senator Wright argued against items (3) and (24) of schedule 1 to the bill, which would preserve judicial discretion after accessing restrained funds for legal costs in unexplained wealth matters. The parliamentary joint committee, which is not the government, does not accept these arguments. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, the PJCLE, has recommended the unexplained wealth laws be changed to prevent people from using restrained property from meeting their legal expenses under recommendation 10. The PJCLE considered submissions and evidence from a range of community, law enforcement and other government bodies in making this recommendation. Unexplained wealth proceedings are the only type of proceeds of crime proceedings in which people are allowed to use restrained assets in this way. The Proceeds of Crime Act generally prohibits restrained assets being used in this way to prevent the practice of dissipating wealth on legal expenses to frustrate potential proceeds of crime orders.


To ensure that people are not deprived of legal representation, the Proceeds of Crime Act provides a scheme to reimburse Legal Aid Commissions for costs incurred in representing people who are subject to a restraining order. Under the bill people who are not subject to unexplained wealth proceedings may seek legal representation through legal Aid if their unrestrained assets are not sufficient to meet legal costs to ensure that they are appropriately represented and are not disadvantaged. People are still able to use any of their unrestrained assets to pay for legal counsel of their choosing. The courts also have a wide discretion to revoke or refuse orders, such as where it is in the interests of justice to do so.


Senator Wright also made comments in relation to item 3 of schedule 1 of the bill. The government does not accept those arguments. The ability of a person to dispose of restrained property to meet their legal costs weakens the effectiveness of the unexplained wealth provisions, by allowing the wealth suspected to have been unlawfully acquired to be used to contest proceedings. This may lead to fewer assets being available for confiscation if an unexplained wealth order is successful, and is likely to cause more protracted litigation. This amendment will harmonise provisions relating to the payment of legal expenses for unexplained wealth cases with similar provisions relating to other proceedings under the POC Act.


Senator Wright also said that she was opposed to item 24 of schedule 1. Item 24 repeals section 179SA, which relates to the payment of legal expenses, and substitutes new sections 179SA and 179SB, relating to the creation and registration of charges over property subject to a restraining order. Unexplained wealth orders create a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth. As such, an unexplained wealth order does not attach to particular property of a person or require a particular property be forfeited. Other provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act which create a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth—such as pecuniary penalty orders and literary proceeds orders—allow for the creation and registration of charges over restrained property to secure payment of amounts owing to the Commonwealth. This ensures that property is available to satisfy a pecuniary penalty order or a literary proceeds order if a person does not pay the amount specified in the order. However, the same power does not exist for unexplained wealth orders. Proposed sections 179SA and 179SB will allow charges to be created and registered over restrained property to secure payment of unexplained wealth amounts. This amendment will improve the enforcement of unexplained wealth orders by ensuring that restrained property can be used to satisfy an unexplained wealth order, if a person does not pay an unexplained wealth amount. This amendment implements recommendation 11 of the final report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.


Senator Collins claimed that the bill is identical to a previous bill introduced by Labor in 2012. That bill, which was not passed, would have implemented only six of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement following its 2012 inquiry into Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws. The government's bill implements two additional recommendations when compared to Labor's 2012 bill. These measures would (1) streamline affidavit requirements in accordance with the committee's recommendation 8, and (2) include a statement on the Proceeds of Crime Act's objectives clause about undermining the profitability of criminal enterprise, in accordance with recommendation 1. This bill also makes technical amendments to improve the operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act.


Senator Wright asserted that the unexplained wealth regime does not require suspicion of an offence and, more broadly, that the bill was fundamentally inconsistent with human rights. In response, the government says this: the unexplained wealth regime provides that if a court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person's total wealth exceeds the value of the person's wealth which was lawfully acquired, the court can compel the person to attend court and to prove on the balance of probabilities that their wealth was not derived from one or more offences. The very point of unexplained wealth provisions is to turn the tables on criminals—to require them to demonstrate that their wealth was lawfully acquired. The bill amends the existing unexplained wealth regime, which was carefully crafted within constitutional limits, including ensuring that it did not breach the principles of the separation of powers or the acquisition of property on just terms.


Senator Bilyk noted the bill does not contain new provisions relating to the work of the Australian Crime Commission. The amendments proposed by the PJCLE that relate to the ACC have either been implemented or raise legal issues that require further consideration. PJCLE recommendation 2 proposed the amendment of Commonwealth legislation to allow the ACC board to issue a determination on unexplained wealth, to enable the ACC to use its coercive powers to provide evidence in support of unexplained wealth proceedings. This recommendation was considered, but it was determined that the ACC can already use its coercive powers to investigate matters relating to federal or other relevant criminal activity. Evidence gathered by the ACC is generally available for use in unexplained wealth proceedings. PJCLE recommendations 3 and 4 relate to amendments to clarify the role of the ACC with respect to unexplained wealth proceedings. These recommendations raise legal issues which require further consideration and which the ACC and the Attorney's department are working on to progress. While these issues remain under consideration, the ACC will continue to use its existing powers to assist in POC proceedings.


Unexplained wealth laws are a highly effective weapon in the fight against serious and organised crime. They allow a court, in appropriate circumstances, to order a person to demonstrate that his or her wealth was lawfully acquired. If the person is unable to do so, they may be ordered to forfeit their illegitimate wealth. These laws are vital because they take the profit out of serious and organised crime, and prevent criminal proceeds from being reinvested to support further criminal activity. They also provide an avenue to target the kingpins of criminal groups, many of whom live off the benefits of illegal activities but distance themselves from the actual commission of offences. In March 2012, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement made recommendations to improve the investigation and litigation of Commonwealth unexplained wealth matters under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.


The bill implements eight recommendations of the PJCLE to make the Commonwealth's unexplained wealth laws more effective, including: the streamlining of affidavit requirements; allowing a court to extend the time frame for serving notice; amending legal expense and legal aid provisions for unexplained wealth cases for other POC Act proceedings, so as to prevent restrained assets being used to meet legal expenses; and, finally, removing a court's discretion to make unexplained wealth restraining orders, preliminary unexplained wealth orders and unexplained wealth orders once relevant criteria are satisfied. The bill also makes technical amendments to clarify and streamline processes under the act. These measures are based on the advice of our law enforcement agencies about the best way to ensure that these laws meet their important aims. To balance the expansion of these powers, the bill requires the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to report annually to the PJCLE on the number of unexplained wealth investigations and applications. This will strengthen the PJCLE's oversight of the use of the provisions and ensure appropriate checks on the use of unexplained wealth investigative powers.


On behalf of the Attorney, I thank all colleagues across both sides of the chamber for recognising the need for these important reforms to the Commonwealth's proceeds of crime regime. The bill has a direct impact on the ability of our law enforcement agencies to confiscate illicit proceeds and to prevent serious and organised crime. The bill represents an important reform of Commonwealth unexplained wealth laws and a significant step in ensuring that serious and organised crime does not again gain a foothold in this country. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (11:39):  by leave—On 15 December last year, as Australians were going about their normal activities in the busy period leading up to Christmas, truly horrendous events occurred in the heart of the commercial centre of our largest city. The actions of a lone gunman—taking hostages, 10 customers and eight employees, in the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, Sydney—and the aftermath horrified and shocked all Australians. After a tense, heart-wrenching 16-hour stand off and the heroic work of New South Wales and federal police and emergency service officers, the siege ended. As the siege ended, two of our fellow Australians—two innocent people, both of whom had left to go about a normal day's business and work that morning—did not return home later that day. One employee of the cafe and one customer lost their lives, three hostages and one police officer were wounded, and the lone gunman, who perpetrated this evil, was himself dead.


As our Prime Minister said when the siege was unfolding, Australia is a peaceful, open, and generous society. He urged Australians to respond in that way and not to allow the actions of this man to affect their daily lives. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Mike Baird, similarly said that Sydney would be tested and that the test would be whether we are the strong, democratic and civil society that we all strive for Australia to be. The test of the nature of our society was met. Australians from all walks of life responded strongly, not to be deflected from their daily lives by this sort of unthinkable atrocity. The actions of the perpetrator were rightly condemned by the Grand Mufti of Australia. Fifty Muslim organisations signed a joint statement condemning the perpetrator's actions and repudiating them as having no legitimacy in their faith.


Today we reflect on the victims of this senseless act. Katrina Dawson, aged 38, a highly-respected barrister developing her career, had been having a morning coffee with a friend. She, of course, will never return to her loving husband and children. Tori Johnson, aged 34, the manager of the Lindt cafe, by all accounts worked to keep the spirits of the hostages up during those awful hours. To the devastation of his family and wider circle of friends, he too lost his life. The public reaction, first with a few floral tributes and suddenly growing into a massive field of flowers, was seen across the television screens and newspapers not only of Australia but right around the world. Prominent Australians, the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, the Premier and the opposition leader, all laid flowers. The families of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson bravely laid their own tributes as well. Most poignant was the outpouring of stoic grief and shock from Australians from all walks of life. Whatever their age, beliefs, ethnic background or any other characteristic, thousands and thousands went to Martin Place to silently place their flowers. By this simple action, each of them was silently saying: 'We do not bow to terrorism. We do not bow to actions like this. We are a strong and cohesive society and we share values of tolerance and liberty, but hatred, revenge and religious extremes have no place in our Australia.'


On behalf of government senators, I express deep sympathy to the families of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, and our good wishes to all the other hostages involved, all of whom experienced a horrible ordeal. Our thoughts are also of course with those that were injured, both physically and emotionally. I express unqualified admiration to the professional police and emergency service officers, including ambulance officers and paramedics, for how they responded to the siege. It is unimaginable to think how any one of us would have responded and the pressure that these emergency service personnel were under; it is something that I personally salute and thank them for.


I congratulate the Dawson family on their exceptionally selfless action in the days after Katrina's death, announcing the establishment of the Katrina Dawson Foundation to support the education of women, and also the Baird government for their decision to establish a permanent memorial at Martin Place, using the flowers placed there as the basis of a garden of remembrance. 


15 December 2014 was a day that turned into one that changed the lives of many, and today the Senate reflects on them and honours the memory of the two innocent lives taken at Martin Place and those lives that will continue to bear the scars. But we have no doubt that the Australian spirit of tolerance, civil society and democracy will prevail, because it must. I thank the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:46):  by leave—I rise to join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in expressing the opposition's deep concern, support and sympathy for those caught up in the Martin Place siege. We grieve for those who lost their lives. We extend our thoughts to those who were traumatised and injured, to their families and to their friends, and to the police and other law enforcement and emergency service personnel who responded to the siege with professionalism and courage.


We all know that, on the morning of 15 December last year, a gunman walked into the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, Sydney. This is a place many Australians know well, in the heart of Sydney's financial, commercial and legal district. The gunman took staff and customers of the cafe hostage and held them against their will. Our nation waited and hoped and prayed. This violent act ended shockingly in the small hours of the morning of 16 December, and we know that Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson both lost their lives.


Tori Johnson was a young man of enormous promise—engaging, intelligent, generous and thoughtful, a loving son, brother and partner. It is clear that during those terrible hours in the Lindt cafe he displayed great courage, integrity and loyalty to his staff and customers. Katrina Dawson was a remarkable young woman, a talented barrister, well respected by her colleagues for her skills and her commitment to her profession. She was tremendously gifted academically yet willing to act as a role model and mentor to others, and of course she was a loving partner and a devoted mother to three children.


To the families and loved ones, to the friends and colleagues of Tori and Katrina, the opposition express our profound sympathy. Your loss is unimaginable, agonising and heartbreaking. We want you to know we are thinking of you. Several hostages and a police officer were injured in the siege, and for all of those this must have been a terrible ordeal and one that must continue to cause anxiety, grief and despair.


This siege gripped the nation as it unfolded, but for those who were directly involved it has had an enormous personal cost and it will continue to take its toll into the future. Words are never enough in a time of such grief and in the face of such loss. What we can say is we are thinking of you, and the compassion and empathy of millions of Australians are yours.


A coronial inquest into the Martin Place siege has commenced and a joint New South Wales-Commonwealth review has been conducted. When they are finalised, these inquiries will provide more information of what happened in the cafe, why it happened and suggest lessons to be learned. But what we can say is that this violent attack was completely at odds with the values of the Australian community. This violent attack was also completely at odds with the values of the peaceful religion of Islam.


With such a terrible event, it is important that we never lose sight of who we are and what we stand for. It was moving to see how Australians responded to the Martin Place siege. As the event was unfolding, the people of Sydney were patient, calm and supportive of the efforts of police and law enforcement agencies. In the days and weeks after the siege, Australians expressed sympathy and solidarity with the victims. They covered Martin Place with flowers, a field of flowers. They attended commemorative services and they paid their respects in many forums. Across our great and diverse nation, Australians rejected appeals to hatred and to hostility and displayed instead tolerance and good sense.


We can never respond to irrationalism with irrationalism, and we can never fight intolerance with intolerance. The siege at Martin Place was an assault on Australian values, but those values have held strong in the aftermath of the siege. The values that Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson embodied as individuals, the values that led so many to express their sympathy by laying flowers at Martin Place, and the values that led so many to offer, 'I'll ride with you'—these are the values that continue to bind us together as an Australian community.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:51):  by leave—I rise today to join the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in extending the sympathy of the Australian Greens to the friends and families of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, who were killed in a horrendous criminal act carried out by a violent man with a criminal record. 


Katrina Dawson was an outstanding young barrister. She had a great deal more to give to the community as a barrister, as a mother, as a person who cared for the community. We especially thank her husband, Paul Smith, and her three children, Oliver, Chloe and Sasha, for the generosity they have shown as they have come to terms with the most horrendous thing that could have happened to them—losing Katrina. Tori Johnson's partner Thomas Zinn and Tori Johnson's family are also suffering, and we are thinking of them. We send our support to the 16 other people who were victims of the siege, and also to the police officers and emergency personnel who were involved.


This is not something that anyone can come to terms with lightly or quickly. Those who have been hurt physically and mentally—anyone who witnessed what happened or intervened to try to prevent it from happening or from becoming worse—have our support, because for them it is not over. Throughout the coronial inquiry and throughout all the inquiries that go on they will be asked to relive those moments as they intervened or witnessed what happened, and they need to know that they have the support of the Australian parliament as well as the Australian community.


I was in Peru in South America when news of how the siege rolled out and then the aftermath was reported. I can tell you that it was extraordinary to watch something like this from afar and to see the reaction: Martin Place carpeted with flowers and expressions of peace, support and solidarity. That was such a great message for Australia to be sending to the rest of the world. We suffered a major jolt as a nation when something of that calibre of violence occurred in the heart of Sydney, but our response was to come together to reject violence. And that coming together to reject violence was the message we sent out to the rest of the world. It is a reminder that at heart we are a nation that values peace, community and social cohesion. We value and enjoy diversity and difference, and that was on show. And then, as certain people in the community felt fearful about what might occur, out came that wonderful outpouring of support with the 'illridewithyou' hashtag. It really demonstrates that what was a wake-up call for the nation was answered with the right response from the nation—not to marginalise, but to reach out; to redouble our efforts to reject messages of hate, fear, disrespect and violence, and instead to value those things which bring us all together as human beings, as a community and as Australian people. 


Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson were 38 years old and 34 years old respectively. They will not be forgotten by their families or their community, and I, too, join with everyone supporting the Katrina Dawson Foundation. How wonderful that this foundation will stand to raise money for women's educational opportunities. I wish everyone involved in trying to come to terms with the aftermath our support, love and encouragement.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (11:56):  by leave—I rise to join with other senators in making a contribution this morning. On behalf of the Nationals I would like to express our sincere condolences to the families of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson. Our thoughts are with all survivors. I want to commend police and law enforcement agencies on their actions to resolve this situation and I sincerely thank the outstanding emergency service personnel. Their professionalism and commitment was exceptional in what was an unprecedented and challenging time. 


The overwhelming support and compassion that was shown by the whole nation was inspirational. The floral tribute in Martin Place—a wave of colourful flowers—represented the outpouring of support for the victims of this dreadful situation. The event is another example of the deep sense of solidarity that Australians have in their nature to openly support one another in a time of need. 


Australia is a peaceful country; a country so very shocked at the events of that day. We are united in our sorrow that such a tragic event could have taken place and are united in our support for the families of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson and all of the survivors. On behalf of the Nationals I express our deepest sympathies.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:57):  by leave—I would like to take this opportunity to add my voice to the sentiments expressed in this chamber and in the other place today to support the fine words of Senators Abetz, Wong, Milne and Nash to the victims of the siege and to the families and friends of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson. We can only begin to imagine your grief, but I hope that in some small way the knowledge that so many people in Australia and around the world stand with you offers some support and comfort through these dark times. The support for the survivors and for the police is also unambiguous and unwavering.


The siege at Martin Place was an attempt to strike at the heart of our society and to sow fear in the hope that it would reap hate. It failed abysmally. Instead, Australians of all backgrounds and beliefs came together to turn against this act of hatred and terror. Where the gunman's goal had been to create division, there came unity. And where he sought to create fear and animosity, there grew a field of flowers. There will be an opportunity to examine the events of that awful day—what led up to it and whether it was in any way avoidable—but now is not the time to discuss those matters. Instead, we should reflect on the lives lost and those lives that have been irrevocably changed, and on what this tragic event means for us as Australians standing together. 


For me this cannot be put better than in the words of the writer and broadcaster Waleed Aly, who wrote these raw passages in the hours following the siege. He said:


… Islam has such permeable borders, such an absence of hierarchy, that anyone can become anything in their own mind. Its symbols are available to anyone who wants to claim them and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them. Australian Muslims had been disowning Monis for at least seven years. They'd even expressed their concerns to the authorities. But how can you stop the 'fake sheikh' being real to himself? There's no control order regime to account for this. There's no metadata inside an apparently deranged mind. We're busy fretting about the terrorists' tools of the future—which is all fair enough—while they wreak havoc with the tools of the past.


Waleed Aly concluded:


But there's another history to be written here.  One that is very much in control.  It's a history written not just in the statements of leaders, but in the minutiae of our everyday interactions.  It's the history we glimpsed as the siege unfolded when a single, humble Australian decided to declare #illridewithyou in solidarity with Muslims too scared to ride public transport.  It's a history that commenced with the interfaith vigil held at the Lakemba and Auburn mosques.  And it's a history to be determined by what we decide this tragedy symbolises: the sordid ideology of a man who deserves to be forgotten or the greatest virtues of those of us left behind.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-02-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (12:00):  by leave—I fully endorse the comments of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Abetz. I offer my condolences to the victims as well, but I also want to encourage changes to produce better outcomes when—and I say 'when'—something similar happens in the future.


Australians have a legal right to self-defence. What they do not have is a practical ability to exercise that right. That needs to change. Those trapped within the Lindt cafe were left helpless, as the carrying of items for self-defence is not allowed under state law—and, what is worse, the offender possibly knew it. These items include non-lethal options such as pepper sprays, mace, clubs and personal tasers. For those who are unable to flee, who are insufficiently strong or who have no improvised weapon to hand, there is no option but to rely on the police and, as the saying goes: when seconds count, the police are minutes away.


Self-defence is not a realistic option for most people, and it is especially not an option for the majority of women, the elderly and the disabled. This is not an argument for everyone to have a gun, as some people simplistically suggest. But what if amongst the hostages there had been a plain-clothes police officer or security guard carrying a pistol? If it is acknowledged that a police officer or someone similar may have been able to save lives, how can it be argued that any good guy who is trained to use guns could not have done the same?


Australia's ban on practical self-defence sets it apart from most other countries. Almost no other country prohibits non-lethal means of self-defence, and many permit ownership of firearms when there is a serious prospect of harm. There are perennial claims that resistance to violence is futile and that items of self-defence are routinely used against those using them. Any woman who has fought off a would-be rapist—and there are many —knows this to be untrue. Mythologising about firearms is a feature of Australian public debate Many seriously believe the solution to any crime involving a gun is more gun laws, and yet the offender in the Lindt cafe did not have a gun licence and, in any case, the sawn-off shotgun he was using was illegal.


I believe Australians agree that a battered wife dealing with a murderous ex-husband, a jeweller transporting valuable cargo and competent people who are well trained in the use of firearms, whether sworn police officers or just good guys, should be able to protect themselves and others if the need arises. I am certain that an overwhelming majority would unequivocally demand the right to practical self-defence, at least by using non-lethal means. It is time to stop pretending that the government can always protect us from events such as the Lindt cafe siege. Lives can be saved by allowing citizens to protect themselves.



The PRESIDENT:  I thank the Senate party leaders and senators for their contributions to this statement. It is very well that the Senate does this and recognises the same as the House of Representatives did earlier today.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:05):  The Greens oppose schedule 1 of the bill which would remove the judicial discretion as to whether a person who is subject to unexplained wealth proceedings can use their assets to defend themselves, to seek legal advice and to defend the application to seize those assets from them. We have heard some discussion from the minister about the problems that are posed in some cases where a person who is subject to unexplained wealth proceedings may wish to dissipate their assets by having protracted legal proceedings. These Greens amendments would not prevent a court apprised of all the information and evidence that is relevant to making a decision not to allow a person subject to the proceedings to use their assets; they merely seek to oppose the complete removal of any judicial discretion as to that. So it does not mean that the court could not order that a restrained person could not use their restrained assets for a legal defence; it merely means that it will remain a possibility for a judicial officer before the court to decide whether or not a person can use their assets. 


The issue at the nub of the government's defence of these far-reaching amendments is clear from the statement that was made by the minister earlier today. He said to the effect that this legislation is designed to turn the tables on criminals to force them to prove that their wealth has been lawfully acquired. Therein lies the assumption. The assumption is that these proceedings will only ever be brought against criminals who have unlawfully acquired wealth and it is therefore in everyone's interest for the government to be able to bring that proceeding. The difficulty starts when you actually allow yourself to consider the possibility that governments do not always get these matters right, that the person against whom the proceedings are being brought may not be a criminal and that, in fact, the wealth was legitimately acquired. And then you can see the justification for potentially allowing the person to use their assets—which, in the case I am posing, have been lawfully acquired—to defend themselves from this government action. Minister, what is the evidence—there is no evidence in the explanatory memorandum—that the existence of this judicial discretion has been misused or has jeopardised the outcome of unexplained wealth proceedings in the past?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:08):  The government does not support this amendment. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has recommended that the unexplained wealth laws be changed to prevent people from using restrained property to meet their legal expenses. That is recommendation 10. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement considered submissions from a range of community, law enforcement and other government bodies in making this recommendation. Unexplained wealth proceedings are the only type of proceeds of crime proceedings in which people are allowed to use restrained assets in this way. The Proceeds of Crime Act generally prohibits restrained assets being used in this way to prevent the practice of dissipating wealth on legal expenses to frustrate potential proceeds of crime orders. To ensure that people are not deprived of legal representation, the Proceeds of Crime Act provides a scheme to reimburse legal aid commissions for costs incurred in representing people who are subject to a restraining order. Under the bill, people who are subject to unexplained wealth proceedings may seek legal representation through legal aid if their unrestrained assets are not sufficient to meet legal costs to ensure that they are appropriately represented and are not disadvantaged. People are still able to use any of their unrestrained assets to pay for legal counsel of their choosing. Courts also have a wide discretion to refuse or revoke orders such as where it is in the interest of justice to do so.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:10):  I am glad that the minister has referred to the legal aid implications of this—and I will come back to those questions. But that did not actually answer the question I had, which is: what evidence is there that the existence of the judicial discretion, which is what we are discussing here, has actually caused a jeopardisation of the outcome of unexplained wealth proceedings in the past? What I would like to do is be really clear and ask the government to get their story straight on the rationale behind this particular aspect of the legislation. We are told that one of the bases of unexplained wealth legislation is to take the profit gain out of organised crime. And certainly the Greens are supportive of the view that that is an effective thing to be doing. I was involved in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement when it was first considering the first manifestation of this legislation—or the issue anyway—and one of the issues was that it is indeed quite effective to have criminals who have been used to having a lot of money to flash around, to drive flash cars and so on, to have that money not available to them. So I understand that rationale. But then we have the argument that we cannot allow judicial discretion in some cases to allow persons who are subject to these proceedings to use their restrained assets to get legal defence because they may dissipate the assets, which then would not be available to the government. But in that case, if the story is that it is in fact about separating criminals from their money, why is it such a problem if they are effectively removed from the benefit of the assets because they have had to use them on legal defence proceedings? Is that the issue, or is it in fact that the government is concerned that, if the money is being used on legal defence, it will not be available as revenue for the government? I am not clear on that. It is one or the other. But you cannot argue that the use of restrained assets for legal defence proceedings does not remove the money availability from the persons who are allegedly the criminals. In the end, if that is where the money is gone, they are not going to have that money available to live the high life, which is what we are wanting to prevent.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:12):  The ability of a person to dispose of restrained property to meet their legal costs weakens the effectiveness of the unexplained wealth provisions by allowing the wealth suspected to have been unlawfully acquired to be used to contest proceedings. This may lead to fewer assets being available for confiscation if an unexplained wealth order is successful, and is likely to cause more protracted litigation. This amendment—the government's amendment, not the Greens amendment—will harmonise provisions relating to the payment of legal expenses for unexplained wealth cases with those for other proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:14):  Can I indicate that I did not have an opportunity to make a second reading contribution, but I will just say in the briefest possible terms that I am broadly supportive of the legislation. I believe that this is the way to strike at the heart of organised crime. We have a very real issue with drug dealers in this country. We have a scourge, particularly in respect of crystal methamphetamine. There are reports that there could be a glut of heroin on the market, given what is happening in countries overseas.


However, in the context of being supportive of this legislation, I do want to ask the minister, in broad terms, how much money has been obtained through unexplained wealth legislation in the past? What does the government say will be the increase in funds being obtained as a result of the measures in this bill? Also, given the way that organised crime figures are always trying to find a way to circumvent legislation such as this, has the government anticipated that? It seems that organised criminals are always trying to find a way to get ahead of that.


In other words, does the legislation in its current form carry with it enough scope to look at associates of organised crime figures who are subject to these orders?


I do have some other questions, but perhaps I will now put those to the minister. Given that the Attorney has just entered the chamber, perhaps I could repeat them for his benefit. I can indicate my broad support for this legislation; this is the way to tackle organised crime. My questions are—and if some of these have to be taken on notice, to an extent, I would accept that, as long as I have an undertaking to get those details: through our current legislative regime, how much unexplained wealth has been seized over the past few years? What does the government say this legislation will do in terms of an increased seizure of assets in respect of that? Given this approach, which, in broad principle, I am very supportive of in this bill, has the government anticipated that organised criminal groups and individuals will find ways to get around this by perhaps siphoning money to associates so it is harder to trace? Will there be enough resources to anticipate these new changes by which criminal gangs will try to get ahead? I have some other questions, but I thought I would put those to the minister.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:17):  I suggested that if I take this moment to indicate Labor's position, then that might give the government a moment to consider Senator Xenophon's questions. The opposition will not support the Australian Greens amendments. The bill harmonises legal expense and legal aid provisions for the unexplained wealth cases with those of the other Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 proceedings to prevent restrained assets being used to meet legal expenses. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements recommended in its report, in recommendation 10, that this occur. In making this recommendation the committee noted that the Proceeds of Crime Act was amended in 2002 to prevent defendants from accessing restrained assets to fund their legal representation. This amendment was prompted by a recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission that allowed defendants to access restrained assets to pay their legal costs that was contrary to a key principle of the Proceeds of Crime Act that property liable to forfeiture should be preserved for that purpose.


The Australian Federal Police also gave evidence that the ability to access restrained assets for legal costs was open to abuse by criminals. As Commander Ian McCartney, of the AFP, said:


When the proceeds of crime legislation was brought in in 1987 there was an ability for suspects to access assets that had been restrained, for legal costs. We believe that that system was abused. It was used by suspects to frustrate the system and, basically, siphon off the assets that had been restrained.


The opposition supports the objectives of the Proceeds of Crime Act and accepts the advice of the Australian Federal Police. We therefore support preventing defendants from accessing restrained assets for expenditure on legal costs. This principle should be reflected in other unexplained wealth legislation as it is in the Proceeds of Crime Act. It is not necessary to revisit the importance of this uniformity. Therefore, the opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendments.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:19):  Can I perhaps deal with Senator Xenophon's questions. Senator Xenophon, in relation to the quantum of the assets seized under the legislation which this bill amends, I am advised that because of limitations in the existing act, which this legislation seeks to correct, there have been no assets seized. The legislation, as I am advised, as currently written, has been ineffective and that is why this bill is being brought forward by the government, to make it more effective through the various measures that the chamber has been discussing.


Secondly, Senator, you asked whether the government has given any consideration to whether or not organised criminal gangs or organised criminal syndicates will seek to, as it were, siphon or launder assets through associated entities. Of course, the government has considered that. That is always an issue in legislation of this kind and the legislation does, as I understand it, contain associated entity provisions and the capacity to trace through associated entities, trusts, third-party structures so that the purpose of the legislation cannot be thwarted by channelling or funnelling money through devices of that character.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:21):  I thank the Attorney for his answer. I have one more quick comment to make, not to hold up this bill, and also a question or something for the government to consider. I think it is important to put it on the record. If the government could give an idea—and I am happy for this to be taken on notice—as to what is expected in terms of the additional amounts in unexplained wealth that could be seized.


I do not think anyone can say that I am a great fan of the South Australian government on a number of issues, but they did come up with some interesting legislation that has since lapsed, last year, that extended the seizure of assets of those convicted of trafficking commercial quantities of drugs and, if it was a prescribed drug offender, whether it also involved the seizure of assets not related to their drug trafficking. That is something the South Australian government was committed to.


My state colleague, the Hon. John Darley was supportive of that. It has since lapsed. But an issue was raised by the honourable Mr Darley in the context of that as to being able to provide some of the funds for appropriate, effective drug rehabilitation, because the feedback I get from constituents, from those who have been affected by a serious drug problem, is that there just simply are not the resources and the funding for that.


I simply say this to the Attorney to flag the issue, because I think this will be revisited. Firstly, will the Attorney on notice indicate whether any consideration has been given to the South Australian government's approach, since lapsed, of a broader application of the seizure of assets—in other words, the 'all bets are off' approach, which some would say is draconian and others would say would act as a real deterrent. Also, most importantly for me, whether any of the assets seized are being hypothecated to an extent for drug rehabilitation. I have to say to the Attorney, through you, Chair, that I have heard heartbreaking stories from people who have contacted me: those who have a serious substance abuse problem and who cannot get assistance; families with a son who has a raging heroin addiction; and others who have been gripped by crystal methamphetamine addiction, which has just ripped those families apart. There appears to be a lack of appropriate facilities, rehabilitation services and support for them. If we can seize more assets from the organised criminal syndicates that profit from this, the question I respectfully pose to the government, simply to flag it, is: why not use some of those funds to improve rehabilitation services in this country?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:24):  As you are aware, because I know you take a close interest in this area of policy, there are various estimates as to the value of the criminal economy in Australia. Because of the nature of the covert and surreptitious and hidden nature of what we are dealing with, those estimates are necessarily very vague estimates. But, for example, the Australian Crime Commission has estimated that the annual value of the criminal economy in this country is up to $15 billion. So that is the order of magnitude of which we are speaking. The amount that could be recovered or is usually recovered under legislation of this kind would be but a very small fraction of a sum like that. But we are talking about a very substantial amount of money.


As I pointed out in answer to your previous question, the legislation as currently written has not proved to be effective, which is why we are strengthening it. So it is really impossible to give a reliable estimate as to how much we expect or hope the legislation in its amended form could recover. But if you think about the value of the criminal economy as $15 billion annually in transactions, then that is the order of magnitude with which we are dealing.


In relation to whether or not monies or assets seized under this legislation could be diverted to drug rehabilitation or drug prevention programs, the answer to your question is that, although the proceeds collected or recovered under the act are hypothecated to a proceeds of crime account, the proceeds of crime account is to be spent on crime prevention purposes. As you would be aware, most drug diversion strategies are health matters and not criminal matters. They are programs conducted through the Department of Health, so ordinarily one would not expect so. But that is not to say that there might not be some drug diversion strategies that bear a sufficiently close connection to criminal law enforcement that they might be considered as eligible programs for outlays from the proceeds of crime account. That is something that would have to be assessed on a case by case basis.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:27):  One of the rationales for restricting completely and totally the use of restrained assets for legal defence, which we heard about from Senator Collins as being a reason for the opposition not considering the Greens amendments, is the harmonisation of the approach with the Proceeds of Crimes Act. But I think it is really important to remind everyone that there is a fundamental difference between the Proceeds of Crimes Act and assets that are restrained or seized under that act and unexplained wealth legislation. That fundamental difference is that under the Proceeds of Crimes Act there is a link between a crime, which has been established, and the proceeds of that crime, and then, arguably, everyone would agree to a justifiable restraint or seizure of those assets, which are the proceeds of a crime. With unexplained wealth legislation, where there does not have to be any proof of any crime at all, there merely has to be assets for which a person who is brought to a court is unable to explain where the assets came from.


The Greens amendment is about allowing a court to determine in some circumstances that it is appropriate for the person who is subject to that action to be able to get legal assistance in proving where that unexplained wealth was generated, and then to prove that it was in fact legitimately acquired and not illegitimately acquired. So there is a fundamental difference. The assumption that concerns me is that we are always talking in this case about criminals. That is the fallacious position in a rule of law situation, where we are assuming we have the right person. So we just have to prove it. In fact, what we are talking about here is the ability of a person to be able to defend themselves adequately and fairly so that they have a chance, and, if the assets are indeed legitimately acquired, to be able to establish that.


It is clear, Attorney, that the amendments that the Greens amendments are designed to oppose are amendments that remove any possibility at all in any circumstances that a person could be found to have a legitimate reason to use their restrained assets to defend themselves in court. They are removing that judicial discretion so that there is never a circumstance in which a court can say, 'Weighing everything up, we think it is reasonable to allow this person to use their restrained assets.' What you said in response to the questions from Senator Xenophon is that there have been no assets seized under the current legislation. I am interested to know whether, drawing this back to the Greens amendments, that is because of the exercise of judicial discretion that the government is seeking to remove. Or are there other reasons that the legislation has not been effectively used whereby assets have been restrained?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:30):  Senator Wright, you correctly point out that there is a difference between proceeds of crime legislation and unexplained wealth legislation in the sense that we know that the assets that are the subject of proceeds of crime legislation are, as it were, the ill-gotten gains of the person whose assets are being seized. In relation to unexplained wealth legislation, there is not a direct relationship established between the assets and the crime. But the difference is not as great as you may think, Senator Wright, because the whole point of unexplained wealth legislation is that, where the statutory tests are satisfied, the unexplained wealth, because it is unexplained in circumstances sufficient to generate a reasonable belief that it was derived from illicit or illegal activity, is treated inferentially as if it were the proceeds of crime or ill-gotten wealth. So it does require an inference to be drawn. But the unexplained wealth is treated as if it were the proceeds of wrongdoing, and therefore the rationale for why the proceeds of crime should not be available for legal defence is the same as the rationale for unexplained wealth if one admits the inference.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:32):  I would like to follow up on that, Attorney-General. Thank you for that. I guess what I am saying essentially then is that the inference drawn from unexplained wealth, because it is not explained, is that it is illegitimately acquired. The problem that I see is that by removing any possibility that a person may be able to use the assets that they have to defend themselves you are nobbling their ability to explain the wealth. You are saying that it is unexplained wealth, and it is going to remain unexplained wealth if a person does not have the ability to use their available means in a court of law to explain from where the wealth has been derived. That is the central concern that the Australian Greens have. What we are saying is not that there should always be a capacity to use restrained assets but that we should allow the possibility for a judicial officer who is apprised of all the evidence and information to make a call as to when it may be appropriate.

I would like the Attorney-General to explain this to me so that I understand it. Is there a history of judges exercising their discretion in cases where the criteria for restraining assets have been met and yet the court has decided not to restrain those assets? If there is not a history of that, why is the independence of the judiciary being impeded in this bill?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:34):  With respect, Senator Leyonhjelm, I do not think this goes to the independence of the judiciary at all. The whole concept of the independence of the judiciary depends upon members of the judicial branch of government—that is, judges—being able to conduct hearings and trials, in this case, according to law without interference. It does not go to the question of whether or not there are limitations placed by the legislature on the way in which the law operates. That the legislature has imposed a particular limitation on what may be done in a court of law is not an interference with the independence of the judiciary. If that were so then, to give a very prosaic example, every act which sets out the law of evidence would be considered to be a limitation on the independence of the judiciary, because nothing is more integral to the processes of a court than the law governing the reception for admissibility of evidence. Yet legislatures, including this parliament, routinely codify the law of evidence, just as they codify various aspects of civil and criminal procedure. So this is not an issue of the independence of the judiciary at all merely because it says that the courts are required to conduct proceedings before them in a particular way according to particularly legislated principles. That is my answer to that observation, Senator.


But as to your first question as to whether there is a history, I am not in a position to inform you whether courts dealing with other legislation have exercised a discretion in one way or another. Every case depends on its own particular facts. But I would counsel against drawing inferences from the fact that certain courts may have resolved certain cases in a certain way if there is a particular, established or uniform judicial attitude to the question.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:37):  One of the major concerns behind the Greens amendments to remove any possibility that a person may be able to use their restrained assets to defend themselves is the implication on legal aid funding. That is because the only alternative then, if anyone is to be able to have any representation in court, is to be thrust onto the legal assistance sector. I would draw your attention to the submission from Victoria Legal Aid in relation to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, which looks at the potential implications for legal aid. The submission indicates that the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services currently lists unexplained wealth proceedings like this as a Commonwealth priority for legal aid funding.


The submission suggests that the effect of this bill, whereby there is no possibility of a court determining that it is appropriate for a person subject to the proceedings be able to use their restrained assets to defend themselves, is that it will most likely mean that these persons will now be eligible on financial grounds—because they will potentially not have many assets to their name at all—and having been declared a Commonwealth priority matter, applications, if made, will generally be approved. We know that there is a significant degree of unmet need in the legal assistance sector and that legal aid commissions are struggling to meet the need in relation to minor criminal, major criminal and civil proceedings, and yet we potentially have this effect that these will be priority matters for Commonwealth funding.


The commission goes on to say that:


It is true that legal aid commissions can be reimbursed for the cost of these cases, but a case must be finalised and a bill of costs provided … before reimbursement occurs.


The submission points out that:


As cases can run for many years, significant sums of money can be spent along the way…


Therefore, reimbursement to legal aid commissions will be down the track significantly, in an environment we would all acknowledge is extremely pressing for the legal assistance sector. My question is this: what would be the effect on legal aid funding? Has there been any modelling by the government as to what that effect would be and its consequent effect of less money being available for other very pressing matters?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:39):  The way in which legal aid services are provided through the state and territory legal aid commissions is ultimately a matter for the state and territory legal aid commissions. The Commonwealth, as you know, is a principal contributor to the funding of state and territory legal aid commissions. You will rightly point out that even though the assets of an accused person, under this legislation, may be frozen or be unavailable—that is, the assets they claim to be their own personal assets—nevertheless they have the capacity to apply for funding through legal aid commissions.


When you suggest that these cases may go for years, certainly there will be some of the most serious character that may go for a considerable period of time. That would be very much an exceptional case. The best way for me to answer your question is to tell you that the manner in which legal aid is distributed and the priorities of this. You and I have debated this issue in different contexts in many fora over the years; you know my view that legal aid ought to be prioritised so that it goes to the neediest cases. There is not enough money in the system, unfortunately, because the needs and demands on legal aid and for legal aid assistance will always outstrip the amount of money that is available for prioritisation and the award of legal aid, in particular instances, is a matter for the state and territory legal aid commissions.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Crimes Legislation Amendment (Unexplained Wealth and Other Measures) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,7,1
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:41):  That begs this question, then: are these the neediest cases? Because, indeed, as the submission from Victoria Legal Aid points out, these proceedings are a Commonwealth priority under the national partnership agreement on legal aid funding and, as a result, commissions would be required to actually give priority to those at the expense, potentially, of many other citizens in the country who are seeking to do something in the family court or in relation to other minor criminal matters. The question that I have is this: is this the best use of legal aid funding and to what extent has the government taken into account the fact that money is being required to be used for these sorts of proceedings, when in fact the money would potentially be available from the restrained assets that are there, which will mean that that money is not available for others?


In asking you to respond to that question, I would also say that the suggestion that some of these matters will be lengthy and that there will be a long lag time and potentially a cost-flow issue, if you like, for legal aid commissions to be able to recover any costs that they can recover comes from the submission from Victoria Legal Aid. Indeed, the government has recently announced $11 million of extra funding for litigation specialists tasked with conducting confiscation proceedings such as these and for forensic accountants, which indicates the complexity of these sorts of cases and how it is not hard to imagine that someone defending themselves to explain where their wealth came from may indeed need significant resources devoted to them from the legal assistance sector to be able to have recourse to that kind of forensic accounting and legal expertise as well. These are going to be expensive cases and it will be legal aid commissions that are required to fund them, because they are a priority matter for the Commonwealth under the partnership agreement. What are going to be the implications for those needier people that you would suggest should be prioritised?

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:44):  I am also interested in further implications for the legal assistance sector, again, by removing any possibility that a court could assess that it is appropriate in some cases to allow a person's own restrained assets to be used to defend them in a court under our rule of law. The Victoria Legal Aid submission indicates that directing persons exposed to unexplained wealth proceedings into the taxpayer funded legal aid scheme would certainly expose legal aid commissions to greater administrative burden as they take up more of a role in claims and cost management of these matters. That is because they are potentially protracted and complex proceedings. These would also be for a class of client who Victoria Legal Aid would not typically consider to be a priority client. Again I ask: has the government considered the implications of this and has there been any modelling as to what the likely effect of removing any judicial discretion in this way will have?

Legal aid lawyers, as I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, are typically criminal lawyers or family lawyers and would work on $150 an hour, whereas the expertise required in legal representation for these sorts of cases is more complex. Commercial lawyers would be demanding far more than that and would often not accept the legal aid cases in any event. Does that have implications for just outcomes?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:46):  I think you take a rather pessimistic and, if I may say so, ungenerous view of the professional skill of a lot of the people who work in the legal aid system. We all know that almost all legal aid cases are either family law matters or criminal law matters—those are the two priority jurisdictions—but those criminal lawyers who represent clients in the legal aid system are by no means to be dismissed as being, as it were, the least good lawyers. I can tell you from my own experience of the profession, although I was not a criminal law practitioner, that there are many, many very fine lawyers who work in the legal aid system who could earn a lot more if they worked at the private bar or for one of the big law firms but choose not to do that for the kinds of social justice reasons that you and Senator Wright have in your different ways been adverting to. So I do not think you should be so rude, really, Senator Leyonhjelm, as to dismiss legal aid lawyers as second-rate lawyers, because they are not. It follows from that that one of the competencies of good criminal lawyers is a capacity to deal with commercial crime. Criminal lawyers are not merely people who deal with cases in which the physical dimensions of crime are the most important probative or evidentiary issues, like, for example, murders. It is also within the competencies of good criminal lawyers to deal with the commercial dimensions of criminal conduct, including tracing money through various accounts, trusts and other structures that may be artificially created to launder or conceal its movement. So the competency that you say that criminal lawyers working in the legal aid system lack is not a competency which is entirely missing from that system; it is a competency of an element of criminal practice.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:05):  The Greens oppose schedule 1 of the bill which would remove the judicial discretion as to whether a person who is subject to unexplained wealth proceedings can use their assets to defend themselves, to seek legal advice and to defend the application to seize those assets from them. We have heard some discussion from the minister about the problems that are posed in some cases where a person who is subject to unexplained wealth proceedings may wish to dissipate their assets by having protracted legal proceedings. These Greens amendments would not prevent a court apprised of all the information and evidence that is relevant to making a decision not to allow a person subject to the proceedings to use their assets; they merely seek to oppose the complete removal of any judicial discretion as to that. So it does not mean that the court could not order that a restrained person could not use their restrained assets for a legal defence; it merely means that it will remain a possibility for a judicial officer before the court to decide whether or not a person can use their assets. 


The issue at the nub of the government's defence of these far-reaching amendments is clear from the statement that was made by the minister earlier today. He said to the effect that this legislation is designed to turn the tables on criminals to force them to prove that their wealth has been lawfully acquired. Therein lies the assumption. The assumption is that these proceedings will only ever be brought against criminals who have unlawfully acquired wealth and it is therefore in everyone's interest for the government to be able to bring that proceeding. The difficulty starts when you actually allow yourself to consider the possibility that governments do not always get these matters right, that the person against whom the proceedings are being brought may not be a criminal and that, in fact, the wealth was legitimately acquired. And then you can see the justification for potentially allowing the person to use their assets—which, in the case I am posing, have been lawfully acquired—to defend themselves from this government action. Minister, what is the evidence—there is no evidence in the explanatory memorandum—that the existence of this judicial discretion has been misused or has jeopardised the outcome of unexplained wealth proceedings in the past?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:08):  The government does not support this amendment. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement has recommended that the unexplained wealth laws be changed to prevent people from using restrained property to meet their legal expenses. That is recommendation 10. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement considered submissions from a range of community, law enforcement and other government bodies in making this recommendation. Unexplained wealth proceedings are the only type of proceeds of crime proceedings in which people are allowed to use restrained assets in this way. The Proceeds of Crime Act generally prohibits restrained assets being used in this way to prevent the practice of dissipating wealth on legal expenses to frustrate potential proceeds of crime orders. To ensure that people are not deprived of legal representation, the Proceeds of Crime Act provides a scheme to reimburse legal aid commissions for costs incurred in representing people who are subject to a restraining order. Under the bill, people who are subject to unexplained wealth proceedings may seek legal representation through legal aid if their unrestrained assets are not sufficient to meet legal costs to ensure that they are appropriately represented and are not disadvantaged. People are still able to use any of their unrestrained assets to pay for legal counsel of their choosing. Courts also have a wide discretion to refuse or revoke orders such as where it is in the interest of justice to do so.

 (South Australia) (12:10):  I am glad that the minister has referred to the legal aid implications of this—and I will come back to those questions. But that did not actually answer the question I had, which is: what evidence is there that the existence of the judicial discretion, which is what we are discussing here, has actually caused a jeopardisation of the outcome of unexplained wealth proceedings in the past? What I would like to do is be really clear and ask the government to get their story straight on the rationale behind this particular aspect of the legislation. We are told that one of the bases of unexplained wealth legislation is to take the profit gain out of organised crime. And certainly the Greens are supportive of the view that that is an effective thing to be doing. I was involved in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement when it was first considering the first manifestation of this legislation—or the issue anyway—and one of the issues was that it is indeed quite effective to have criminals who have been used to having a lot of money to flash around, to drive flash cars and so on, to have that money not available to them. So I understand that rationale. But then we have the argument that we cannot allow judicial discretion in some cases to allow persons who are subject to these proceedings to use their restrained assets to get legal defence because they may dissipate the assets, which then would not be available to the government. But in that case, if the story is that it is in fact about separating criminals from their money, why is it such a problem if they are effectively removed from the benefit of the assets because they have had to use them on legal defence proceedings? Is that the issue, or is it in fact that the government is concerned that, if the money is being used on legal defence, it will not be available as revenue for the government? I am not clear on that. It is one or the other. But you cannot argue that the use of restrained assets for legal defence proceedings does not remove the money availability from the persons who are allegedly the criminals. In the end, if that is where the money is gone, they are not going to have that money available to live the high life, which is what we are wanting to prevent.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (12:12):  The ability of a person to dispose of restrained property to meet their legal costs weakens the effectiveness of the unexplained wealth provisions by allowing the wealth suspected to have been unlawfully acquired to be used to contest proceedings. This may lead to fewer assets being available for confiscation if an unexplained wealth order is successful, and is likely to cause more protracted litigation. This amendment—the government's amendment, not the Greens amendment—will harmonise provisions relating to the payment of legal expenses for unexplained wealth cases with those for other proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

I am not clear on what the rationale for the legislation is.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:14):  Can I indicate that I did not have an opportunity to make a second reading contribution, but I will just say in the briefest possible terms that I am broadly supportive of the legislation. I believe that this is the way to strike at the heart of organised crime. We have a very real issue with drug dealers in this country. We have a scourge, particularly in respect of crystal methamphetamine. There are reports that there could be a glut of heroin on the market, given what is happening in countries overseas.


However, in the context of being supportive of this legislation, I do want to ask the minister, in broad terms, how much money has been obtained through unexplained wealth legislation in the past? What does the government say will be the increase in funds being obtained as a result of the measures in this bill? Also, given the way that organised crime figures are always trying to find a way to circumvent legislation such as this, has the government anticipated that? It seems that organised criminals are always trying to find a way to get ahead of that.


In other words, does the legislation in its current form carry with it enough scope to look at associates of organised crime figures who are subject to these orders?


I do have some other questions, but perhaps I will now put those to the minister. Given that the Attorney has just entered the chamber, perhaps I could repeat them for his benefit. I can indicate my broad support for this legislation; this is the way to tackle organised crime. My questions are—and if some of these have to be taken on notice, to an extent, I would accept that, as long as I have an undertaking to get those details: through our current legislative regime, how much unexplained wealth has been seized over the past few years? What does the government say this legislation will do in terms of an increased seizure of assets in respect of that? Given this approach, which, in broad principle, I am very supportive of in this bill, has the government anticipated that organised criminal groups and individuals will find ways to get around this by perhaps siphoning money to associates so it is harder to trace? Will there be enough resources to anticipate these new changes by which criminal gangs will try to get ahead? I have some other questions, but I thought I would put those to the minister.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:17):  I suggested that if I take this moment to indicate Labor's position, then that might give the government a moment to consider Senator Xenophon's questions. The opposition will not support the Australian Greens amendments. The bill harmonises legal expense and legal aid provisions for the unexplained wealth cases with those of the other Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 proceedings to prevent restrained assets being used to meet legal expenses. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement into Commonwealth unexplained wealth legislation and arrangements recommended in its report, in recommendation 10, that this occur. In making this recommendation the committee noted that the Proceeds of Crime Act was amended in 2002 to prevent defendants from accessing restrained assets to fund their legal representation. This amendment was prompted by a recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission that allowed defendants to access restrained assets to pay their legal costs that was contrary to a key principle of the Proceeds of Crime Act that property liable to forfeiture should be preserved for that purpose.


The Australian Federal Police also gave evidence that the ability to access restrained assets for legal costs was open to abuse by criminals. As Commander Ian McCartney, of the AFP, said:


When the proceeds of crime legislation was brought in in 1987 there was an ability for suspects to access assets that had been restrained, for legal costs. We believe that that system was abused. It was used by suspects to frustrate the system and, basically, siphon off the assets that had been restrained.


The opposition supports the objectives of the Proceeds of Crime Act and accepts the advice of the Australian Federal Police. We therefore support preventing defendants from accessing restrained assets for expenditure on legal costs. This principle should be reflected in other unexplained wealth legislation as it is in the Proceeds of Crime Act. It is not necessary to revisit the importance of this uniformity. Therefore, the opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendments.

Senator Xenophon, in relation to the quantum of the assets seized under the legislation which this bill amends, I am advised that because of limitations in the existing act, which this legislation seeks to correct, there have been no assets seized. The legislation, as I am advised, as currently written, has been ineffective and that is why this bill is being brought forward by the government, to make it more effective through the various measures that the chamber has been discussing.


Secondly, Senator, you asked whether the government has given any consideration to whether or not organised criminal gangs or organised criminal syndicates will seek to, as it were, siphon or launder assets through associated entities. Of course, the government has considered that. That is always an issue in legislation of this kind and the legislation does, as I understand it, contain associated entity provisions and the capacity to trace through associated entities, trusts, third-party structures so that the purpose of the legislation cannot be thwarted by channelling or funnelling money through devices of that character.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:21):  I thank the Attorney for his answer. I have one more quick comment to make, not to hold up this bill, and also a question or something for the government to consider. I think it is important to put it on the record. If the government could give an idea—and I am happy for this to be taken on notice—as to what is expected in terms of the additional amounts in unexplained wealth that could be seized.


I do not think anyone can say that I am a great fan of the South Australian government on a number of issues, but they did come up with some interesting legislation that has since lapsed, last year, that extended the seizure of assets of those convicted of trafficking commercial quantities of drugs and, if it was a prescribed drug offender, whether it also involved the seizure of assets not related to their drug trafficking. That is something the South Australian government was committed to.


My state colleague, the Hon. John Darley was supportive of that. It has since lapsed. But an issue was raised by the honourable Mr Darley in the context of that as to being able to provide some of the funds for appropriate, effective drug rehabilitation, because the feedback I get from constituents, from those who have been affected by a serious drug problem, is that there just simply are not the resources and the funding for that.


I simply say this to the Attorney to flag the issue, because I think this will be revisited. Firstly, will the Attorney on notice indicate whether any consideration has been given to the South Australian government's approach, since lapsed, of a broader application of the seizure of assets—in other words, the 'all bets are off' approach, which some would say is draconian and others would say would act as a real deterrent. Also, most importantly for me, whether any of the assets seized are being hypothecated to an extent for drug rehabilitation. I have to say to the Attorney, through you, Chair, that I have heard heartbreaking stories from people who have contacted me: those who have a serious substance abuse problem and who cannot get assistance; families with a son who has a raging heroin addiction; and others who have been gripped by crystal methamphetamine addiction, which has just ripped those families apart. There appears to be a lack of appropriate facilities, rehabilitation services and support for them. If we can seize more assets from the organised criminal syndicates that profit from this, the question I respectfully pose to the government, simply to flag it, is: why not use some of those funds to improve rehabilitation services in this country?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:24):  As you are aware, because I know you take a close interest in this area of policy, there are various estimates as to the value of the criminal economy in Australia. Because of the nature of the covert and surreptitious and hidden nature of what we are dealing with, those estimates are necessarily very vague estimates. But, for example, the Australian Crime Commission has estimated that the annual value of the criminal economy in this country is up to $15 billion. So that is the order of magnitude of which we are speaking. The amount that could be recovered or is usually recovered under legislation of this kind would be but a very small fraction of a sum like that. But we are talking about a very substantial amount of money.


As I pointed out in answer to your previous question, the legislation as currently written has not proved to be effective, which is why we are strengthening it. So it is really impossible to give a reliable estimate as to how much we expect or hope the legislation in its amended form could recover. But if you think about the value of the criminal economy as $15 billion annually in transactions, then that is the order of magnitude with which we are dealing.


In relation to whether or not monies or assets seized under this legislation could be diverted to drug rehabilitation or drug prevention programs, the answer to your question is that, although the proceeds collected or recovered under the act are hypothecated to a proceeds of crime account, the proceeds of crime account is to be spent on crime prevention purposes. As you would be aware, most drug diversion strategies are health matters and not criminal matters. They are programs conducted through the Department of Health, so ordinarily one would not expect so. But that is not to say that there might not be some drug diversion strategies that bear a sufficiently close connection to criminal law enforcement that they might be considered as eligible programs for outlays from the proceeds of crime account. That is something that would have to be assessed on a case by case basis.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,7,2
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:27):  One of the rationales for restricting completely and totally the use of restrained assets for legal defence, which we heard about from Senator Collins as being a reason for the opposition not considering the Greens amendments, is the harmonisation of the approach with the Proceeds of Crimes Act. But I think it is really important to remind everyone that there is a fundamental difference between the Proceeds of Crimes Act and assets that are restrained or seized under that act and unexplained wealth legislation. That fundamental difference is that under the Proceeds of Crimes Act there is a link between a crime, which has been established, and the proceeds of that crime, and then, arguably, everyone would agree to a justifiable restraint or seizure of those assets, which are the proceeds of a crime. With unexplained wealth legislation, where there does not have to be any proof of any crime at all, there merely has to be assets for which a person who is brought to a court is unable to explain where the assets came from.


The Greens amendment is about allowing a court to determine in some circumstances that it is appropriate for the person who is subject to that action to be able to get legal assistance in proving where that unexplained wealth was generated, and then to prove that it was in fact legitimately acquired and not illegitimately acquired. So there is a fundamental difference. The assumption that concerns me is that we are always talking in this case about criminals. That is the fallacious position in a rule of law situation, where we are assuming we have the right person. So we just have to prove it. In fact, what we are talking about here is the ability of a person to be able to defend themselves adequately and fairly so that they have a chance, and, if the assets are indeed legitimately acquired, to be able to establish that.


It is clear, Attorney, that the amendments that the Greens amendments are designed to oppose are amendments that remove any possibility at all in any circumstances that a person could be found to have a legitimate reason to use their restrained assets to defend themselves in court. They are removing that judicial discretion so that there is never a circumstance in which a court can say, 'Weighing everything up, we think it is reasonable to allow this person to use their restrained assets.' What you said in response to the questions from Senator Xenophon is that there have been no assets seized under the current legislation. I am interested to know whether, drawing this back to the Greens amendments, that is because of the exercise of judicial discretion that the government is seeking to remove. Or are there other reasons that the legislation has not been effectively used whereby assets have been restrained?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:30):  Senator Wright, you correctly point out that there is a difference between proceeds of crime legislation and unexplained wealth legislation in the sense that we know that the assets that are the subject of proceeds of crime legislation are, as it were, the ill-gotten gains of the person whose assets are being seized. In relation to unexplained wealth legislation, there is not a direct relationship established between the assets and the crime. But the difference is not as great as you may think, Senator Wright, because the whole point of unexplained wealth legislation is that, where the statutory tests are satisfied, the unexplained wealth, because it is unexplained in circumstances sufficient to generate a reasonable belief that it was derived from illicit or illegal activity, is treated inferentially as if it were the proceeds of crime or ill-gotten wealth. So it does require an inference to be drawn. But the unexplained wealth is treated as if it were the proceeds of wrongdoing, and therefore the rationale for why the proceeds of crime should not be available for legal defence is the same as the rationale for unexplained wealth if one admits the inference.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:32):  I would like to follow up on that, Attorney-General. Thank you for that. I guess what I am saying essentially then is that the inference drawn from unexplained wealth, because it is not explained, is that it is illegitimately acquired. The problem that I see is that by removing any possibility that a person may be able to use the assets that they have to defend themselves you are nobbling their ability to explain the wealth. You are saying that it is unexplained wealth, and it is going to remain unexplained wealth if a person does not have the ability to use their available means in a court of law to explain from where the wealth has been derived. That is the central concern that the Australian Greens have. What we are saying is not that there should always be a capacity to use restrained assets but that we should allow the possibility for a judicial officer who is apprised of all the evidence and information to make a call as to when it may be appropriate.

I would like the Attorney-General to explain this to me so that I understand it. Is there a history of judges exercising their discretion in cases where the criteria for restraining assets have been met and yet the court has decided not to restrain those assets? If there is not a history of that, why is the independence of the judiciary being impeded in this bill?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,7,2

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:34):  With respect, Senator Leyonhjelm, I do not think this goes to the independence of the judiciary at all. The whole concept of the independence of the judiciary depends upon members of the judicial branch of government—that is, judges—being able to conduct hearings and trials, in this case, according to law without interference. It does not go to the question of whether or not there are limitations placed by the legislature on the way in which the law operates. That the legislature has imposed a particular limitation on what may be done in a court of law is not an interference with the independence of the judiciary. If that were so then, to give a very prosaic example, every act which sets out the law of evidence would be considered to be a limitation on the independence of the judiciary, because nothing is more integral to the processes of a court than the law governing the reception for admissibility of evidence. Yet legislatures, including this parliament, routinely codify the law of evidence, just as they codify various aspects of civil and criminal procedure. So this is not an issue of the independence of the judiciary at all merely because it says that the courts are required to conduct proceedings before them in a particular way according to particularly legislated principles. That is my answer to that observation, Senator.


But as to your first question as to whether there is a history, I am not in a position to inform you whether courts dealing with other legislation have exercised a discretion in one way or another. Every case depends on its own particular facts. But I would counsel against drawing inferences from the fact that certain courts may have resolved certain cases in a certain way if there is a particular, established or uniform judicial attitude to the question.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:37):  One of the major concerns behind the Greens amendments to remove any possibility that a person may be able to use their restrained assets to defend themselves is the implication on legal aid funding. That is because the only alternative then, if anyone is to be able to have any representation in court, is to be thrust onto the legal assistance sector. I would draw your attention to the submission from Victoria Legal Aid in relation to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, which looks at the potential implications for legal aid. The submission indicates that the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services currently lists unexplained wealth proceedings like this as a Commonwealth priority for legal aid funding.


The submission suggests that the effect of this bill, whereby there is no possibility of a court determining that it is appropriate for a person subject to the proceedings be able to use their restrained assets to defend themselves, is that it will most likely mean that these persons will now be eligible on financial grounds—because they will potentially not have many assets to their name at all—and having been declared a Commonwealth priority matter, applications, if made, will generally be approved. We know that there is a significant degree of unmet need in the legal assistance sector and that legal aid commissions are struggling to meet the need in relation to minor criminal, major criminal and civil proceedings, and yet we potentially have this effect that these will be priority matters for Commonwealth funding.


The commission goes on to say that:


It is true that legal aid commissions can be reimbursed for the cost of these cases, but a case must be finalised and a bill of costs provided … before reimbursement occurs.


The submission points out that:


As cases can run for many years, significant sums of money can be spent along the way…


Therefore, reimbursement to legal aid commissions will be down the track significantly, in an environment we would all acknowledge is extremely pressing for the legal assistance sector. My question is this: what would be the effect on legal aid funding? Has there been any modelling by the government as to what that effect would be and its consequent effect of less money being available for other very pressing matters?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,7,2
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:39):  The way in which legal aid services are provided through the state and territory legal aid commissions is ultimately a matter for the state and territory legal aid commissions. The Commonwealth, as you know, is a principal contributor to the funding of state and territory legal aid commissions. You will rightly point out that even though the assets of an accused person, under this legislation, may be frozen or be unavailable—that is, the assets they claim to be their own personal assets—nevertheless they have the capacity to apply for funding through legal aid commissions.


When you suggest that these cases may go for years, certainly there will be some of the most serious character that may go for a considerable period of time. That would be very much an exceptional case. The best way for me to answer your question is to tell you that the manner in which legal aid is distributed and the priorities of this. You and I have debated this issue in different contexts in many fora over the years; you know my view that legal aid ought to be prioritised so that it goes to the neediest cases. There is not enough money in the system, unfortunately, because the needs and demands on legal aid and for legal aid assistance will always outstrip the amount of money that is available for prioritisation and the award of legal aid, in particular instances, is a matter for the state and territory legal aid commissions.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,7,2
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2015-02-09,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:41):  That begs this question, then: are these the neediest cases? Because, indeed, as the submission from Victoria Legal Aid points out, these proceedings are a Commonwealth priority under the national partnership agreement on legal aid funding and, as a result, commissions would be required to actually give priority to those at the expense, potentially, of many other citizens in the country who are seeking to do something in the family court or in relation to other minor criminal matters. The question that I have is this: is this the best use of legal aid funding and to what extent has the government taken into account the fact that money is being required to be used for these sorts of proceedings, when in fact the money would potentially be available from the restrained assets that are there, which will mean that that money is not available for others?


In asking you to respond to that question, I would also say that the suggestion that some of these matters will be lengthy and that there will be a long lag time and potentially a cost-flow issue, if you like, for legal aid commissions to be able to recover any costs that they can recover comes from the submission from Victoria Legal Aid. Indeed, the government has recently announced $11 million of extra funding for litigation specialists tasked with conducting confiscation proceedings such as these and for forensic accountants, which indicates the complexity of these sorts of cases and how it is not hard to imagine that someone defending themselves to explain where their wealth came from may indeed need significant resources devoted to them from the legal assistance sector to be able to have recourse to that kind of forensic accounting and legal expertise as well. These are going to be expensive cases and it will be legal aid commissions that are required to fund them, because they are a priority matter for the Commonwealth under the partnership agreement. What are going to be the implications for those needier people that you would suggest should be prioritised?

The Victoria Legal Aid submission indicates that directing persons exposed to unexplained wealth proceedings into the taxpayer funded legal aid scheme would certainly expose legal aid commissions to greater administrative burden as they take up more of a role in claims and cost management of these matters. That is because they are potentially protracted and complex proceedings. These would also be for a class of client who Victoria Legal Aid would not typically consider to be a priority client. Again I ask: has the government considered the implications of this and has there been any modelling as to what the likely effect of removing any judicial discretion in this way will have?

Legal aid lawyers, as I pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, are typically criminal lawyers or family lawyers and would work on $150 an hour, whereas the expertise required in legal representation for these sorts of cases is more complex.

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (12:46):  I think you take a rather pessimistic and, if I may say so, ungenerous view of the professional skill of a lot of the people who work in the legal aid system. We all know that almost all legal aid cases are either family law matters or criminal law matters—those are the two priority jurisdictions—but those criminal lawyers who represent clients in the legal aid system are by no means to be dismissed as being, as it were, the least good lawyers. I can tell you from my own experience of the profession, although I was not a criminal law practitioner, that there are many, many very fine lawyers who work in the legal aid system who could earn a lot more if they worked at the private bar or for one of the big law firms but choose not to do that for the kinds of social justice reasons that you and Senator Wright have in your different ways been adverting to. So I do not think you should be so rude, really, Senator Leyonhjelm, as to dismiss legal aid lawyers as second-rate lawyers, because they are not. It follows from that that one of the competencies of good criminal lawyers is a capacity to deal with commercial crime. Criminal lawyers are not merely people who deal with cases in which the physical dimensions of crime are the most important probative or evidentiary issues, like, for example, murders. It is also within the competencies of good criminal lawyers to deal with the commercial dimensions of criminal conduct, including tracing money through various accounts, trusts and other structures that may be artificially created to launder or conceal its movement. So the competency that you say that criminal lawyers working in the legal aid system lack is not a competency which is entirely missing from that system; it is a competency of an element of criminal practice.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Mr Deputy President, if you ever wanted an example of the chaos, dysfunction and dishonesty at the heart of the Abbott government, it would be the way in which the submarines promise and project has been handled. If you ever wanted an example of how this Prime Minister Abbott cannot be trusted by the Australian people or by his backbench, it would be in relation to the Future Submarine Project. Let us recall this sorry saga. 


Before the election, the Abbott opposition, as the Abbott government were then, promised that 12 submarines would be built at the Australian Submarine Corporation in Adelaide. They promised that. It was a clear open and shut case that the submarines would be built in Adelaide. All of sudden, after the election, that undertaking was dumped and this Prime Minister decided that he would have the submarines built in Japan. He broke his promise. It was a decision that not only sold out South Australia but also went against Australia's economic and strategic interests. 


We could not imagine that it could actually get any worse than the complete debacle, chaos, dysfunction and dishonesty that is the submarines project under this government—and that was, of course, we know, after Senator Johnston, as the former defence minister, talked about canoes. But even that appalling standard was breached again over the weekend. Things actually got worse. The jobs of South Australians and a multibillion dollar project became pawns in the leadership battle inside the Liberal Party, because the Prime Minister indicated to Senator Edwards that magically, instead of the deal with Japan, there would now be a competitive, open tender. Senator Edwards—who is not here, and I invite him to come in and clarify this, because it is quite clear that he has been sold a pup—got on Adelaide television, beat his chest and said to everyone: 'We've had a win. I've had a win.' He said that there would be an open, competitive tender. The only problem was that the Prime Minister did not say that when he was asked that in his interview with Chris Uhlmann. He did not say that he would have an open tender. We saw again today the finance minister running away from committing to an open tender—the open tender that Senator Edwards said was his big win. And then what did we have? We had Mr Briggs really putting the boot into Senator Edwards on 891 today, where he said:


… the position today is the same as the position was last week, and I'm pleased that Sean's happy about that.


As Matt Abraham, the ABC journo, tweeted—'Slam dunk', because Senator Edwards went out and told all the South Australians that he had got a deal with the PM to have a competitive, open tender. But the reality is: what we know about this is that there was a Prime Minister who was prepared to play politics with the largest procurement this country will ever see in order to get a vote in a leadership ballot. It is extraordinary—a multibillion dollar project is played to get a vote in a no-confidence motion, a spill motion, against a sitting Prime Minister. 




Senator O'Neill:
  Shameful!




Senator WONG:
  It is utterly shameful. The reality is that, when it comes to Future Submarines, this Prime Minister did not care about South Australian jobs, and did not care about Australian jobs, until his own job was on the line. What he did was send smoke signals out to a member of his backbench, who then stood up in front of the cameras at Adelaide Airport last night telling everybody that he had had a win—only to be told the next day by various ministers, in their public statements, that nothing had changed. Well, someone is telling lies, someone is telling porkies. Either the Prime Minister did tell Senator Edwards that there would be an open, competitive tender and is now backtracking on it—hoping that no-one will notice the weasel words when he talks about evaluation processes, as opposed to a competitive tender process—or Senator Edwards was lying when he stood up in front of the voters of South Australia last night and said, 'I've had a win.' Someone is telling lies. Senator Edwards should come into this chamber and tell South Australians precisely what was committed by the nation's Prime Minister in relation to the Future Submarines project. He should do that, and the Prime Minister should declare what his position is. (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:08):  I congratulate the Australian soccer team on winning the Asian cup, and I can only reflect on what a wonderful thing it is that Senator Wong was not a member of the team. Senator Wong scored an own goal today in asking that question of Senator Abetz. Senator Abetz's rejoinder was that, when this issue was resolved today, he did not turn on the leader as Senator Wong had done to Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard in her time as Leader of the Senate. What we saw playing out in this place today was the contrast between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. What we saw historically with Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard was the greatest act of bastardry and lack of loyalty—and, of course, it played out in the sense that the Australian people did not even have the opportunity to have their say.


What we saw today was a mature process enacted by a backbench. I again go to Senator Wong's supplementary question in which she demanded of Senator Abetz that he confirm that the cabinet had a free vote. The Labor Party just do not understand. A secret ballot, as I remember it, is a ballot that allows each person to state their position without fear or favour or influence. And that is what we had today in our party room. We had a secret ballot indicating a free vote—no opportunity for the Prime Minister of the day to put pressure on cabinet members, ministers or anybody else. When Labor went into opposition we had the spectacle of the rank and file having an opportunity to have a vote—and they supported Mr Albanese. But when the parliamentarians in the Labor Party had their vote, they selected Mr Shorten. So we have a Leader of the Opposition who does not enjoy the full support of those who had the opportunity to vote.


We have had questions asked today by Senator Moore. All this went to was the fact that on our side of politics—as evidenced by Ms Gambaro's comments, statements and questions—we are free to speak in public without any fear of retribution. We have a mature process. We have a process that is fully democratic. We have a process, as played out today, where people have the opportunity to decide whether they want to have a spill. That is in contrast to the circumstances in which Mr Rudd lost the prime ministership.


I would now like to address the issue raised now by Senator Wong with regard to submarines and the program for the replacement. What a lamentable situation it is for the senior South Australian senator in this place—a senior minister when Labor was in government and now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—to raise her nose above the spectre of the failure of the last government when it came to submarines for this nation and indeed for South Australia. Absolutely nothing was left for the incoming government in terms of a program to replace the submarine fleet. When the Labor Party was in government we heard nothing from Senator Wong, Senator Farrell or anyone else about what the future might hold. And we now have this sanctimonious bleating from Senator Wong and others. What the Prime Minister has said—echoed by the Minister for Finance—is that, in the interests of the Australian community, we will have a competitive process to determine who will build the future submarines of this country. We would not be in this position if Labor, in government, had acted. (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:14):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Abetz and Senator Cormann today in particular. Senators must have forgotten over the Christmas break what the purpose of question time is, because the answers given today bear little resemblance to the questions asked. It also seems that the entire Parliamentary Liberal Party has forgotten the purpose of government. They are now completely consumed not with matters that are important to the people of Australia but, rather, matters of personality in their own party and who could win a high-school popularity contest—the cool kid in his leather jacket, the member for Wentworth, or the athlete, the Prime Minister.


Today, the Australian people have been done a great disservice by the Liberal Party, who are unrepentant. In his answers today, Senator Abetz seemed unfazed by the fact that his Prime Minister bound his cabinet to support him at today's Libspill, taking away from the party room their usually robust free vote that we hear about so often. But even forcing his cabinet colleagues' support was not enough to make Tony Abbott's leadership secure.




Senator Abetz:
  That's Mr Abbott to you.




Senator O'NEILL:
  Forty per cent of his party room have deserted his chaotic leadership. The obeisance from that comment that we just had from Senator Abetz demanding that I call the Prime Minister Mr Abbott and not dare to speak his name reminds me of those—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is the correct form of address. I ask you to do so please.




Senator O'NEILL:
  The Prime Minister. Two-thirds of his backbench know that they do not keep their seats with Tony Abbott at the helm, making his captain's picks and guiding them from disaster to disaster. Bullying and intimidation were not enough to keep the backbench members in line. There has been a breakout of people who are sick to the teeth of the Prime Minister's constant promises of improving his behaviour and being more consultative. They have learned their lesson: they simply have to ignore what he says, because his actions have spoken very loudly. He ignores his own backbench in the way he ignores the Australian people.


Senator Abetz refused to comment when questioned about the cruel and unfair tactics that were being used to get members of parliament to back the faltering horse. But who can blame the Liberal backbenchers? They hear one story from their colleagues and they hear a different story from the media. Now they even have the Prime Minister on the phone at the eleventh hour, making conflicting promises to different members and senators to secure his leadership. Is the GP tax gone? The Member for Cowan thinks it is. I wonder where he got that impression. Senator Cormann says it is here to stay. Will our submarines be built in Australia? Senator Edwards thinks so, and he thought so so powerfully that he went out in public yesterday and again this morning, claiming that he had a deal with the Prime Minister to deliver those submarines for South Australia, to have an open tender. But today we have heard all the weasel words again. Tony Abbott obviously still wants them to be built in Japan.


Will the Prime Minister listen to Australians on higher education? Tony Abbott says he will be more consultative. Australians just do not trust him to listen to his backbench, do not trust him to listen to the experts and do not trust him to listen to the community. The Liberal Party promised to be a grown up, adult government that 'thinks before it acts', but the only thing they are thinking of is themselves. The Liberal Party promised to be a no-surprises, no-excuses government, but all we have seen is excuse after excuse from this dysfunctional, untrustworthy Prime Minister and his government.


But after all this the Prime Minister has promised that good government would begin today.




Senator Conroy:
  What were you doing for the past 16 months?




Senator O'NEILL:
  How could good government begin today? Was this the day that he foreshadowed and heralded to himself as the day that he would begin good government? It is more than 520 days since the Prime Minister took the leadership of this country—520 days of what I would say is clearly bad government. I absolutely agree with Senator Conroy there. If you are going to start good government today, that is all we can assume has been the case. That is why the fortunes of this Liberal Party-Nationals coalition are at such a low point: they lied to the Australian people to get into government. They came through and revealed their colours in all their darkness, despair and misery in the budget, and Australians are awake to you. They are on to you, and it only a short time before the Prime Minister loses his position. (Time expired)

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:19):  I am going to respond particularly to Senator O'Neill's contribution.




Senator Conroy:
  Deny you were the informal vote.




Senator SESELJA:
  I do deny it 100 per cent.




Senator Bilyk:
  Did you vote yes?




Senator SESELJA:
  No, I voted no and I made it clear before and after.


One of the reasons I do so is because, whilst there is no doubt that we as a government and the Prime Minister have acknowledged that we could have done better, I would like to outline for the Senate in the time I have available the significant achievements that this government has already made in its first 17 months in office. These are undeniable achievements. These are significant achievements. These are achievements that we now need to build on. We should not forget what we have done, the mess we have inherited and the efforts we have made to fix that mess over the last 17 months.


If there had not been a change of government, we would still have the carbon tax. Australians would still be forced to pay an extra $550 a year because the Labor Party decided that was a reasonable imposition. It is interesting in the context of debates about a co-payment that the Labor Party, who are opposed to any form of price signal, say they are happy for households, no matter how much money they might have, to have to pay an extra $550 a year as a result of their carbon tax. So we got rid of that, not just taking pressure of households but helpfully creating jobs, taking pressure off business, lowering the cost of doing business in this country so that we can grow jobs. That is the sort of thing we have seen.


We got rid of the mining tax for one of our key industries. Again it is about economic growth, it is about investor certainty and it is about jobs. It is, importantly, about jobs. The mining tax was another attack upon a key industry in this nation. The Labor Party and the Greens came up with this scheme, and we have managed to get rid of it.


What else have we seen? We have stopped the drownings at sea—a significant achievement—




Senator Ludlam:
  You've stopped the solar industry. Well done!




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Ludlam says, 'Well done,' and we do not ever hear that when we look at stopping the drownings at sea. When it came to Greens and Labor policy, there did not seem to be any angst about the fact that their policies were leading to people getting on leaky boats and drowning on the way here. That was the result of their policies. So that is another change we have seen, and this is one that we were told could simply not be done. We were told by those opposite—by the Labor Party—by the Greens and by other commentators that you could not stop them, because Labor had not managed to for the past few years, and we had seen the tragic consequences. Well, as outlined by Senator Cash today, with resolve and with the right policy mix, you actually can. If we are going to have the usual critics of the government then we should look at those significant achievements. We have seen the abolishment of the carbon tax, reducing the cost of living; getting rid of the mining tax, protecting our key industries; stopping the drownings at sea and securing our borders; and free trade agreements across the board with China, with Japan and with Korea. This is all about growing the economy and all about opening up economic opportunities for Australians and Australian businesses so they can create the jobs of the future, so that our service industries can go into these markets in Asia. What did the Labor Party do on free trade agreements? Well, they procrastinated. They could not get them done. They were not actually committed to them.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  I hear the interjections about Tasmania. The free trade agreements will be wonderful for Tasmania. Tasmania has suffered under the weight of a Labor-Greens government in Canberra and a Labor-Greens government in Tasmania. We have Will Hodgman and his team turning things around; we have things like a free trade agreement and getting rid of the carbon tax, which will also help turns things around, not just in Tasmania but also around the country; we are building roads of the 21st century and have hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental approvals, which, again, is all about growing jobs for the future and growing our economy. So whilst there is much more that can be done and we can do things better, they are significant achievements that should not be forgotten. (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:24):  What we have heard here today, not only in the responses to questions by the opposition but also in the responses by the coalition senators, is that nothing has really changed. After the chaos that we have seen in the government in the last few days, nothing has really changed. We have a Prime Minister who has admitted today that good government starts today—some 16 months after they came into office, 520 days since they came into office—good government starts today. And yet we have heard here today from coalition senators and their ministers that nothing has changed. Their responses are all the same. Nothing has changed. They need to understand what their back bench has been telling them. The Australian people have been telling them that their problem is that they delivered a manifestly unfair budget. They know it and the Australian people know it. The only difference is, they do not care. They did not care. The Australian people will not let you get away with this. No amount of restarts or reboots are going to change what this government is all about. They just do not care. They will continue their attack on low- and middle-income Australians. They will somehow continue with their GP tax, they will continue to inflict $100,000 university degrees on our children, they will continue with the cuts to pensions and family supports, and they have cut $80 billion from schools, education and hospitals. All of these things they said they would not do, and the Prime Minister said they would not do. He lied. He lied to the electorate. What we have now is—




Senator Abetz:
  Mr Deputy President, a point of order: accusations of that nature against a specific member of parliament are disorderly and need to be withdrawn.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I withdraw, but the Prime Minister's government lied. The coalition lied to the electorate. It does not matter how—




Senator Abetz:
  Mr Deputy President, a point of order: the withdrawal has to be unequivocal, and the allegation cannot be made against a specifically identified member of parliament. The senator knows that, and she should abide by the standing orders.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: I did withdraw and then I continued my contribution.




Senator Abetz:
  By saying the Prime Minister lied.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I said the Prime Minister's government.




Senator Bushby:
  And then you said that he lied.




Senator Abetz:
  And then you said he lied.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brown, I have taken some advice on this and the words you are using really get us close to the point of being unparliamentary. I think it would be useful if you would withdraw those remarks and continue with your contribution.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I withdraw. I thought that was what I was doing before.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  What we have seen here is a coalition that is now fighting amongst itself. We have a third of the coalition caucus room not supporting the Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who has no respect for his back bench. We saw recently in his Press Club speech that he would have no more captain's calls and more consultation—I am not sure what Mr Abbott thinks 'more consultation' means—yet he changed the meeting time for this spill motion with very little consultation.




Senator Conroy:
  Have you seen the video?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I have not seen the video but I cannot wait to—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  And just days after he said he would consult more he changed the party room time to wrong-foot the backbench, and others, to deny proper discussion and consultation for his own caucus room. That is what he did. That is what he did, because he knew that the backbench were unhappy, he knows that he has been leading a government that has broken many promises to the electorate and he knows that the outspoken complaints about the way he operates and the way this government has been operating were only going to gather momentum. After this cruel and unfair budget, I do not think anybody would really trust this government again to keep any of its commitments.


We have heard over the last few days some of the comments that the backbench have been making as to what is really occurring inside the Liberal Party caucus. We have heard from Ms Gambaro, who said: 'We cannot govern ourselves in an internal climate of fear and intimidation. And that is the unacceptable situation we have endured for the past five years.'

Keppel Earl Enderby QC, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the divisions of Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory from 1970 until 1975.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:36):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 7 January 2015, of the Honourable Keppel (Kep) Earl Enderby QC, former minister and member for the Australian Capital Territory and Canberra, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


The Hon. Keppel Earl Enderby QC, or Kep Enderby, was a member of the House of Representatives from 1970 to 1975 and a minister of the Crown from 1972 to 1975. He lived a long and full life. Although his parliamentary service was brief, his public service was lengthy.


Mr Enderby was born on 25 June 1926 in Dubbo and was educated at Dubbo high school. Among other things he was an exceptionally gifted golfer from a young age; remarkably, he became captain of the Dubbo Golf Club aged only 14. He later went on to be the New South Wales men's amateur golf champion in 1946 and played in the British amateur and open championships in 1951 and 1952, ranking No. 17 in a very talented field. In 1944 Mr Enderby enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force as a trainee pilot, being discharged when peace came the following year. He continued a lifelong interest in aviation, including piloting helicopters into his 60s.


After the war, he studied law at the University of Sydney and was admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1950. He then moved to London to work as a barrister and undertook further study at the University of London, graduating in Master of Laws. In 1955 Mr Enderby returned to Australia, resuming the practice of law, and lectured first at Sydney Technical College and, from 1962, at the Australian National University. From 1966 he practised as a barrister in Canberra and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1973. In 1970 he won the seat of the Australian Capital Territory at the by-election caused by the death of the then long-serving member, Mr Jim Fraser. He held the seat in 1972 and in 1974. He became the first member for Canberra when the ACT was divided into two seats. He lost his seat at the general election in December 1975.


With the election of the Whitlam government in December 1972, Kep Enderby was first appointed Minister for the Capital Territory and was the inaugural Minister for the Northern Territory. It was not easy for the local MP to also be the ACT minister and in 1973, in a reshuffle, he was appointed Minister for Secondary Industry and Minister for Supply. As an aside, I noted in one of the articles in the newspapers when he was minister: 'General Motors Holden will sack up to 5,000 workers next month.' It seems, no matter how far back we go, the same sort of vicious issues keep confronting this parliament.


In 1975, when Lionel Murphy was appointed to the High Court, Mr Enderby became Attorney General of the Commonwealth and Minister for Customs and Excise—later to be changed to Minister for Police and Customs, following the Whitlam government's announcement of a new Australia Police force. Following his defeat in the coalition landslide at the end of 1975, Kep Enderby moved to Sydney and returned to the bar. In 1982 he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, serving on the bench of that court for 10 years. In 1997 he was appointed head of the New South Wales Serious Offenders Review Council. He continued a wide involvement in community life, especially with the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties and as President of the Australian Esperanto Association and then president of the world body, the Universal Esperanto Association.


Kep Enderby had a good-natured and engaging personality and generally avoided the rancour of political debate, preferring the barrister's approach of reasoned argument. To his wife, Dot, and his two children—his son, Keir, and daughter, Jo—I offer deepest sympathies on behalf of the government, and I also extend those to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I express the deepest sympathy at the passing of Kip Enderby after a full and productive life in the service of Australia; I also thank the extended family for lending him to the nation throughout his distinguished career.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:42):  I also rise to speak on this motion of condolence on the death of the Hon. Kep Enderby QC. Kep Enderby, as he was known, died on 7 January this year at the age of 88, the closing chapter in a life devoted to the service of his profession, his party, his community and his country. He was a man of principles and ideals—a social reformer committed to human rights, civil liberties and the protection of the weak. He rose to the office of Attorney-General and he held the position for just nine months—the turbulent period at the end of the Whitlam government's time in office. But in that time, Kep Enderby made sweeping social reforms which have stood the test of time. He modernised Australian family law with legislation which included no-fault divorce. He legislated to tackle racial discrimination, to decriminalise homosexuality and to remove the death penalty from the federal statute books.


Kep Enderby was born in 1926 in the town of Dubbo. His parents owned the local milk bar and he attended the local state primary and high schools. He joined the RAAF in 1944 and trained as a pilot during the Second World War. As Senator Abetz has said, he was a top amateur golfer after the war and for a while considered turning professional; but in the end he decided to pursue a career in the law and trained as a barrister in London and Sydney. In the early 1960s he moved to Canberra to take up a position as a law lecturer at the then newly established Australian National University. He said that in those days he was drunk on the words of Karl Marx and the Russian anarcho-communist Pyotr Kropotkin. Well, it was the 1960s, I suppose!


He joined the Australian Labor Party and by 1970 had won preselection for the electorate representing the ACT. In those days there was just one seat for the ACT in the House of Representatives—the seat which he won at a by-election in May 1970. This was an exciting time for Kep Enderby himself but also for the Labor Party. Gough Whitlam was capturing the public imagination and the mood for social and political change was growing. In 1972 Kep became part of the Whitlam government, the first federal Labor government in 23 years. He served as Minister for the Capital Territory, Minister for the Northern Territory, Minister for Supply, Minister for Manufacturing Industry and Minister for Customs and Excise. Then, in February 1975, he became the Attorney-General.


As I mentioned previously, in the nine months from February to November 1975 he secured parliamentary passage of some ground-breaking legal reforms. They included the Family Law Act and the Racial Discrimination Act. He drew on his own experiences as a lawyer to make out the case for no-fault divorce, a major social reform in Australia. As he told the House, all of us who have done this work in the courts know of cases where the inheritance of the children is dissipated because the parties have been encouraged to hate each other to such an extent that they fight on.


In his second reading speech on the Racial Discrimination Act, he cited the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and its assertion that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. He argued that the bill was designed not only to give legal remedies to the victims of discrimination but also to perform a critical educational role in the community. He said, and those words are apposite today: 


The proscribing of racial discrimination in legislative form will require legal sanctions. These will also make people more aware of the evils, the undesirable and unsociable consequences of discrimination-the hurtful consequences of discrimination- and make them more obvious and conspicuous.


In addition to these two historic reforms, Kep Enderby was also responsible for decriminalising homosexuality and abortion in the territories. He was always a passionate advocate for Canberra and the ACT. He used his first speech in the House to advocate greater representation in the federal parliament for the people of the ACT and to advocate for self-government. 


He lost his seat in the double dissolution election of 1975, which swept Labor from office, yet his reforms have endured—they have not just endured, they have engendered real tangible and progressive social change, and they have made Australia a more just and tolerant country. For that, we owe Kep Enderby a great deal.


In 1982 he was appointed as a Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court, a position he held for 10 years. In retirement he was involved in the Esperanto movement, believing that a common international language would promote international peace and understanding. His commitment to human rights, civil liberties and social reform remain undented. 


People who knew him have described him as a whirlwind of ideas. One of his successors representing the people of Canberra, Mr Leigh, said recently that he was someone who never fluctuated in his principles, who held fast to his views as a social democrat. I extend our deepest sympathies to his family members in their loss.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2015-02-09,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (15:48):  I rise to make a contribution to the condolence motion on Keppel—or Kep—Enderby QC. Mr Enderby entered parliament at a by-election as the Labor member for the Australian Capital Territory in 1970. He was re-elected in 1972 and then, following a redistribution, was elected as the first member for the newly created seat of Canberra in 1974. He lost his seat in the double dissolution of 1975.


During the Whitlam government Mr Enderby held various portfolios, including Minister for the Northern Territory. However, he is most well known for his role as Attorney-General from February 1975 until the dissolution of parliament on 11 November 1975. Mr Enderby went on to become a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court and chairman of the Serious Offenders Review Council. 


Retirement allowed him to pursue his interest in Esperanto, becoming President of the Universal Esperanto Association. This involvement was borne out of a belief that if the world spoke a single language it would lessen conflict. He was also an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. From 1986 to 1998 he was the national president of the Australia-USSR society.


Kep Enderby lived a full life for a boy from Dubbo, whose first claim to fame was as an amateur golf champion before enlisting in the Royal Australian Air Force and after the war training as a barrister. He flew helicopters into his 60s. His contribution to the other place included introducing the Family Law Act, which included no-fault divorce, and the establishment of the Family Court as well as the abolition of the federal death penalty.


In his speech on the Territory's Senate bill, Mr Enderby said, 'It is true that a long-term policy of the Australian Labor Party is not to encourage the long future of the Senate, but here one has to grasp the facts of political life.' He concluded his contribution by saying, 'Let the government do the right thing by the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and let them have Senate representation.' He made news by backing working mums, the establishment of childcare services and sick-leave entitlements for either parent. This was big news in 1970. 


In 1971 he was the vice president of the Kanangra Society, the Aboriginal society, which sponsored the observance of National Aborigines Day in Canberra and Queanbeyan. He stated that Australians were becoming increasingly aware of all forms of social injustice but particularly in relation to the Aborigine. He really was ahead of his time. He stated that Aborigines suffered because they were discriminated against by their situation and lack of education and employment opportunities. Those are the very things we are trying to remedy by this government's commitments to get Indigenous children to school, adults to work and safer communities.


Interestingly, what also made the news back then was Mr Enderby's call for Australia to be republic and his opposition to the Black Mountain telecommunications tower. On behalf of the Nationals in the Senate, I extend to Mr Enderby's family our sincere condolences.

AUSTRALIAN CENTRE FOR SOCIAL COHESION BILL 2015



In Australia, we currently lack a comprehensive national plan to address extremism in our communities. If we are to address these issues at their root, if we are to work to prevent attitudes that accept terrorism and violence as acceptable, then we need to invest in programs that build social cohesion and work to prevent young Australians from becoming radicalised. 


As United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has said, ""the best response to a corrosive, malevolent ideology is a strong assertion of collective resistance"". It is this collective, comprehensive and unified response that the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion Bill 2014 pursues. The Bill establishes a centralised body to develop and implement key preventative programs that help stop young Australians from becoming radicalised. The Centre and its Director will focus on building social cohesion, working with communities to prevent violent extremism. Through bringing together government bodies, law enforcement agencies, academics, researchers and former extremists to consult and work together to build resilient and cohesive communities, the Centre will be well equipped to develop high quality, effective programs for social cohesion.


Currently in Australia, we are under-investing in prevention programs for young Australians at risk of involvement with extremist groups and ideology. To put it in perspective, of the $630 million Counter-Terrorism package currently being implemented by the Australian Government, just $13.4m is allocated in Australia to for prevention programs targeting young Australians involved with extremist groups. That's a mere, 0.5% of the total budget. Of this total funding, just $1 million is currently being utilised, leaving an enormous funding and capacity gap that fails our community. 


The lack of a central body dedicated to building social cohesion in our communities or preventing extremism compounds the impacts of this under-investment. Though we currently have in place individual programs such as Countering Violent Extremism, a four-year grant program that works to deter young people from extremism, this has been subject to cuts in funding at a time when we should be investing even more in such schemes. 


Furthermore, as Australian violent extremism expert Dr Anne Aly has noted, ""Other countries including the UK, Sweden and the US have non-government and not-for-profits working specifically to combat violent extremism, but in Australia much of the work is taken on by government or the research community. There are of course NGOs [Non-Government Organisations] who have developed projects that aim to address the root causes of violent extremism but there was no entity that could take on a coordinating role bringing together government, research and community. This is where we see ourselves having the most impact.""


The establishment of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion would act to break down this siloed approach, bringing together groups from various sectors to develop effective and comprehensive policies to address radicalisation. Research and experience has proven that violent extremism is best dealt with by civil society groups, in coordination and consultation with government and law enforcement agencies. In Australia, this is illustrated in groups such as People against Violent Extremism (PAVE), which grew out of recognition that civil society is a vital player in conflict resolution and developing community resilience against extremism. We also know that countering violent extremism through early intervention and individual and community engagement represents a smarter approach that recognises social as well as political and ideological factors that can make people vulnerable to extremism. This Bill, and the functions and powers of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion that it outlines, puts into practice these findings. 


Community engagement and consultation is necessary, but they do not hold all of the answers alone. Diversionary and educational programs, along with strong online campaigns, are all part of a necessary strategy to help stop young Australians becoming radicalised. It is not about targeting one particular community, but rather a collective approach across multiple communities, government and academia, to implement programs and strategies that that are more targeted at identified points in radicalisation where intervention is likely to succeed. We cannot continue to rely on decisions from the bureaucratic level alone. We need recognise that our failings, both at a government and community level, in preventing radicalisation, is largely due to a policy response that was based on assumptions rather than on a framework that has had proven success. Research from Curtin University has found that deradicalisation programs delivered by government ""lack viability and credibility within the target group and are most likely to be viewed manipulative and agenda serving."" By enabling relevant NGOs, community leaders, government departments and academic experts to come together we will be able to develop a best practice model for combating violent extremism.


There is precedent around the world for success using this model. The Australian Centre for Social Cohesion framework, focusing on community, government, research and dialogue, is largely based on Hedayah, the premier international institution for training and research to counter violent extremism. The Bill takes this successful international model, and replicates it at a domestic level, focused on the Australian circumstance, and tailoring their research and training to our domestic needs. Hedayah works closely with communities and stakeholders (e.g. youth, women, educators and community leaders) who have traditionally been on the outer when it comes to developing policies to combat violent extremism.


If we are serious about dealing with extremism and terrorism, we must not isolate our focus to reacting to acts of terror and extremism, but also be serious about prevention. Identifying those at risk, finding pathways to deradicalisation, and bringing together the community to find collective solutions, must be a focus of our proactive response to extremism as a nation. The establishment of the Australian Centre for Social Cohesion will provide the foundation that Australia needs to effectively implement such a response.


I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:46):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I am very pleased to be able to speak on this matter of public importance. And what could be more important now than the chaos, the division, the dysfunction and the mistrust that is at the heart of the coalition government? I have to say, Mr Deputy President, when you talk about the coalition government and you talk about heart, you really cannot focus too well—because there is no heart in this government. They are heartless. They are a heartless, divided, dysfunctional and chaotic government. When we talk about the Abbott government and heart, we are talking metaphorically, because this government has no heart.


Two-thirds of the backbench—at least—are so concerned about the heartless policies, the incompetent policies, and the economic incompetence of this government that they actually want to change their leader—two-thirds of the backbench of this government who was going to be a grown-up government! Well, grown-up government they are! They are so grown-up that they are at each other's throats continually, and the bubbling mass of discontent is bubbling away still. This is a government and this is a leader, Mr Tony Abbott, who is on his last legs. And why is this government in such disarray after such a short time? Why is this government in such chaos? Because their economic policies are wrong, their economic policies are bad, and their budget was totally unfair. That is what underpins the problems this government has.


The other issue is that this government came to power based on lies—based on commitments given to the Australian public that were never going to be kept—and the lies continue. We have the Prime Minister ringing up Senator Edwards and telling Senator Edwards that the submarines would be openly competitive—that there would be open competition for the submarines to be built in South Australia. He gets Senator Edwards to vote for the Prime Minister, and as soon as the vote is in, what do the Prime Minister and his cronies do? They turn around and leave Senator Edwards up a dry gully—with no commitment for the submarines to have an open tender; absolutely none. And we had Senator Edwards embarrassed, going out there telling the press that he has had a great victory, and that South Australian senators have had a great victory, with this commitment from the Prime Minister. Mr Acting Deputy President, the commitment from the Prime Minister was the same as the commitment he gave to the Australian people—not worth anything. That is the kind of commitment you get from this Prime Minister.


The dysfunction will continue. The square-ups will continue. Mr Turnbull's minions—Malcolm's minions—will continue to try and make sure that he becomes the Prime Minister. We have seen it, and we see it now: all that stuff that is going on behind the scenes to try and get Mr Turnbull to be the next prime minister of this country. But the question here is if you change the prime minister, do you change policy? And what we found out last week from Senator Cormann is that not one frontbencher in this parliament—not one frontbencher!—complained either to Senator Cormann or the Treasurer or the Prime Minister about the unfairness of the budget. So we had them all there supporting it—all the ministerial team supporting an unfair budget; a budget that will mean pensioners will be $80 a week worse off down the track, where the young unemployed will be $50 a week worse off—the unemployed can hardly survive now, but they will be a further $50 a week worse off under this dysfunctional and chaotic government. The unemployed will have to wait six months before they can even get access to any support—the poorest and the weakest people in this community cannot get access to government support—public support—because of the ideology of this government, and because of their dysfunction, and because their whole budget is dysfunctional.


A single-income family on $65,000 a year will be $6,500 worse off, and yet politicians and the well-off will not even know that they have had to make a so-called contribution to the so-called budget repair. They will not even know about it—will not feel it. Pensioners, young couples trying to survive and some of the poorest people in this country are the ones who are going to get hammered—people in New South Wales, in my area, in the western suburbs, in Penrith, in Blacktown, in Mount Druitt and in St Clair. These are battling families—doing it tough, many of them—and they will be the victims of this dysfunctional and chaotic government.


Under this budget, 1.2 million families will be $3,000 a year worse off. Those opposite are cutting the pensioner education supplement, cutting the seniors supplement, ripping $36 billion out from education, bringing in a GP tax, freezing indexation and making a further $5 cut, which they are putting in place because they could not get their $7 co-payment through the parliament. The doctors from Tamworth who appeared at the hearing last week of the Senate Select Committee on Health said that they will have to abandon bulk-billing and that, to keep their practices viable, they will have to charge concession card holders $65 and charge $100 for those who do not have a concession card. We heard in this place former Senator Joyce—now on the front bench of the coalition—talking, and trying to scare people, about a $100 leg of lamb under the carbon tax. What we have now is doctors in Tamworth, in Senator Joyce's own backyard, saying, 'If you're going to come and see a doctor, you'd better have $100'—$100 to see the doctor! That is because we have a dysfunctional government, a chaotic government, an erratic government and a government that is too busy fighting amongst itself.


I have said it before in here: we know that the Liberals hate the Nationals, we know that the Nationals hate the Liberals and we know that the Liberals hate each other. It has all been played out before us over the last few weeks. We have a Prime Minister who is not up to the game. We have a Prime Minister who is hopeless. We have a frontbench who are economically irresponsible. We have a frontbench who just do not know what it is to have fairness and equity. I could not believe it when Senator Cormann said that no-one in the coalition had raised the issue of unfairness in the budget—no-one! Everybody knows that this is the most unfair budget that has ever been delivered in this parliament. The big end of town and the high-income earners get off almost scot free, and yet, if you are a family battling away on an income of $65,000, 6½ grand is what it is going to cost you. It is not fairness when you take away support for health, when you take away support for education, when you take away welfare support, and when you take away from the weakest and poorest in this country. That is the reason that this government is on the nose. That is the reason this is a chaotic, dysfunctional government. The policies are rotten to the core.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:56):  Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards, before I address some of the other issues that Senator Cameron raised, may I take a point that Senator Cameron raised with regard to your own contribution to fighting for South Australia's industrial base and submarines. Senator Cameron—in true Scottish, pessimistic style—has decided to attack one of the individuals that have been fighting for a fair go for South Australia. From my point of view, I was satisfied that it was important to get good value for taxpayers' money in building the submarines, and I was satisfied that there was going to be a guarantee that South Australia would have more jobs as a result of the decision that the government was taking. I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with an open tender, because I want to see the best value for Australian taxpayers. I have no problem whatsoever with the government making a decision that they think is in the best interests of taxpayers, as long as South Australia is better off.


The problem that we have is people over the other side, who were economic vandals in their own governance of this country, who hate to see taxpayers' money being spent fairly and wisely and not thrust about in a cavalier manner for all sorts of ridiculous projects that have put us on a debt—

Senator BERNARDI:
 trajectory up to $667 billion. That is what Senator Cameron and his government, which he was unfortunately not a part of, did. Senator Cameron was the one who referred to his government as 'lobotomised zombies', if I recall correctly. The lobotomised zombies, as Senator Cameron described them, were on a debt trajectory of $667 billion.


Unlike Senator Cameron, I feel that I can approach this MPI with a degree of integrity because I have been a critic of some decisions that the government has undertaken over the last 16 months or so. Senator Cameron, you cannot deny that I have been a critic of some of those decisions, because I have stood up in this place and said, 'I can't support them.' The government has indeed made mistakes, but no government is perfect. It is about the framework in which it has evolved. Let me just tell you that a lot of the difficulties the government—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  Order! I remind everybody on the left and the right that it is disorderly to interject.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I remind the people of Australia that a lot of the difficulties this government has had have been because of the intransigence of those on the opposite benches. I understand that they are playing politics with this. I understand that they are not interested in rescuing Australia and our children and our grandchildren from the $667 billion debt legacy they built up. I realise they are more intent on clinging to power and getting back onto the government benches than doing the right thing by the country. But, in doing so, I truly think they discredit themselves and their cause. To be fair, as critical as I have been of this government on occasions for some decisions, I have to recognise the government has delivered on much of what it promised to do. 


Let us recall the government's promise to stop the tens of thousands of people travelling to this country without valid visas. It promised to put an end to the deaths and drownings at sea. It promised to enact a robust border protection policy to protect not only Australia but those people who are seeking a better life. The government delivered on that. It delivered where those on the opposite benches said it could not be done. As a result, our humanitarian refugee program is greater than it was before. As a result, we have stopped boats from entering Australian territorial waters illegally. We have saved—who knows?—perhaps hundreds, maybe thousands, of lives at sea. I say to Senator Cameron and his successors in this speaking debate: perhaps it would be ideal if just one of them could get up and congratulate and acknowledge the government for that achievement, because it was something they said could not be done.


Let me also make the point that we promised we would reduce electricity bills for Australian families. We said we would remove the carbon tax. I understand, once again, it is a bone of contention about whether a tax is somehow going to save the climate. Those on the other side say that it is. Let me tell you: it is not. No amount of tax is going to save us or stop climate change from taking place in this country. Climate change is something that has been occurring for aeons. If you want any understanding of that, I think you simply have to go back through history and realise that there were times when it was warmer than it has been now; there were times when it was cooler than it has been now. And let me assure you: none of those changes were due to any form of tax. We have delivered a savings for Australian families of some $550 or thereabouts per year because of that. 


We also recognised that having a tax that actually costs more to implement than you are collecting is a demonstration of economic illiteracy. Some would call it the height of stupidity. But it was the tax that Mr Swan and Ms Gillard introduced. It was called the mining tax. What they saw was the goose that was laying the golden eggs in the mining industry, and they said: 'If it's successful, let's tax it. And, if it's hopelessly unsuccessful, let's subsidise it.' That was the original plan for the mining tax. It was ridiculous. They were going to socialise the losses and allow the profits to be corporatised. It was just a joke of a policy. We got rid of that, thanks to the support of some intelligent people who understand that higher taxes are bad for business. We have removed billions of dollars worth of red tape and we have got billions and billions more to do, let me tell you, because we need to reduce the permits and the licences and the bureaucracy and all the requirements that were necessary under previous administrations to establish a business or to build up an enterprise in this country. 


So there are some significant achievements that this government has delivered on. Of course, it has made mistakes. There is no question it has made mistakes. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that. He has said that the Paid Parental Leave scheme is not appropriate at this point in time, and he has heard that message from the backbench; he has heard it from the people of Australia. Rather than congratulate a Prime Minister for heeding the message that he has received, those on the other side use it as an opportunity to somehow attack and exploit him. Let me suggest that, when the Labor Party were in office, if their prime ministers had decided to listen to the Australian people more than to their own factional henchmen, if they decided they were going to act in the national interest rather than in the selfish, self-centred self-interest of their union buddies and their bosses, the country would be in better shape today. But they did not, and the Australian people realise that. 



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I note that Senator Polley is interjecting, but the Australian people rendered their judgement. In rendering their judgement, they said: 'We don't like how they behaved. We want a new government. We don't like how they conducted themselves and dealt with their leadership and how they divided up the spoils of power,' because it was all about power, whatever it takes. They did not like that, so they voted for a person who they thought had some integrity, who they thought had some credentials, who was going to act in the best interests of the country. 


Let me tell you: I believe the Prime Minister and the government have overall, on any real assessment of it, delivered on much of what they promised. They have faced difficulties—there is no question—because we have a runaway debt situation. And I do not believe in putting up taxes. I think we should be lowering taxes, because that will stimulate economic activity. But we have been unable to get through savings measures which are about sustainability—I know it is a buzzword, but it is about sustainability—and ensuring that our country can function appropriately in an economic way for decades and decades to come. 


Those opposite make fun of the level of Australia's debt, saying, 'It doesn't compare with Greece or America or anywhere else.' You know what, it always starts somewhere. It has got to start somewhere, and you have got to start saving and arresting the growth in debt at another point. 


This is about responsibility. It is about being responsible to the Australian people. It is not about self-interest, it is not about making it hard for people who are finding it difficult; it is about getting the balance right. That is what we are trying to do as a government. I am making my modest contribution to it by saying where I think they go wrong, and I tell them when I think they have gone right. It is about time you did too.

 (Tasmania) (17:06):  I am grateful that Senator Moore, from Queensland, has submitted for discussion today's matter of public importance, which has told of the chaos, division, dysfunction and mistrust at the heart of the coalition government. 


Today has been a historic day. A Prime Minister survived, by the skin of his teeth, a serious attempt by members of his own party to get rid of him. The only person to blame for this attempted political hit is the Prime Minister himself. Of course, he and his apologists will attempt to blame others for the Abbott ministry's near-death political experience. They will attack the backbenchers and lay the blame for government chaos, dysfunction and mistrust at our feet. However, any Australian with common sense, eyes that can see and ears that can hear will know that the deep dissatisfaction and lack of trust felt by members of the Liberal Party—indeed, by the great majority of Tasmanians and other Australians—has been caused by the Prime Minister's tin ear, heart of stone and inability to admit he got it wrong and to apologise for his actions.


Up until today the chaos, division, dysfunction and mistrust at the heart of the coalition government has been caused by one man and one man only, and that is Tony Abbott. But from today onwards the chaos, division, dysfunction and mistrust at the heart of the coalition government is shared by every member of the Liberal Party room. This morning they had an opportunity to use the knowledge and the common sense that God gave them and elect a new leader who would govern in the best interests of all Australians, not just a select few—the rich at the top end of town. When the time came for that this morning, the Liberal Party room choked and failed to show courage. This morning the Liberal Party room was once again controlled by cowards who are more concerned about their damned titles and the perks of office than about the suffering of normal Australians.


Tonight, if you are a homeless person in Tasmania you have an official wait of 21 weeks, or over five months, on the public housing list. According to the Tasmanian Council of Social Service report, the latest waiting list figures for public housing show there are 2,465 applicants on the wait list—and that is growing by the day. The average wait time for people who are housed is 36 weeks. How do you think the 2,465-plus Tasmanians who are struggling to feed and house their families would view this Abbott government's record of government and their behaviour today? I think they would be entitled to view the behaviour of this government with a sense of mistrust. No-one would be surprised if a homeless Tasmanian described the federal Liberal government's performance as one of chaos, division and dysfunction. And if the homeless knew that one of the main reasons they were denied the chance of state public housing was because the Abbott federal government insisted that over half—or $17 million—of the federal housing budget of $32 million a year invested in Tasmania's public housing be paid back to the Commonwealth government to service a federal debt of $200 million, then I have a feeling that words a little stronger than 'chaos', 'division', and 'dysfunction' would be expressed.


Parliamentary Library research I commissioned, which studied the funding crisis surrounding the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, states: 


Leading Australian housing researcher, Professor Patrick Troy describes the funding situation under the CSHA:


Most of the Commonwealth funds advanced to the States since the 1945 CSHA were actually repayable interest bearing grants (the average citizen held the mistaken belief that a 'grant' was just that when in the arcane language of the Commonwealth it was actually a 'loan').


One consequence of this was that each year the States were forced deeper into debt and was one reason they could not fund the needed infrastructure. It was a neat pea and thimble trick.


So here we have the federal government caught out big-noting themselves about giving, in Tasmania's case, $32 million while slyly taking straight back off them—that is right!—a cheque for $17 million within 24 hours. Is it any wonder this Abbott government is mistrusted and viewed as dysfunctional?


In order to help this government recover the trust they have shattered with ordinary Australians and to help them repair their damaged reputation, I call on the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, to waive the $200 million of Tasmania's public historic housing debt. A debt of $320 million for South Australia was scrapped a few years ago, and while I do not begrudge the people of South Australia that money, I make the point that both South Australia and Tasmania are suffering from similar social and economic crises and challenges—unemployment, economic stagnation and homelessness. 


If the Commonwealth government can scrap the public housing debt of $320 million for South Australia, they can also scrap the public housing debt of $200 million for Tasmania. They can just scrap that $200 million debt for Tasmania, because Tasmania needs it. This would mean that the backlog of $90 million in housing maintenance could be addressed. I agree with retiring TasCOSS CEO Mr Reidy, when he says that Tasmania needs more affordable housing, and that waiving the public housing debt would be a great start to fixing our public housing crisis in Tasmania. Waiving Tasmania's public housing debt would also have an immediate effect of fixing the crisis of public confidence in this government's ability to prioritise the proper investment of public funds.


It would not be right of me to stand up today and not mention Defence pay. Put aside Mr Abbott's lies and broken promises to every Australian in higher education, health funding, Medicare co-payments, funding of the ABC and SBS, aged pensions, workers' superannuation, veterans' superannuation and entitlements, and God only knows what is coming up over the next few weeks. Put aside the fact that Mr Abbott's leader in the Senate—our very own Tasmanian Senator Abetz—has twiddled his thumbs and enjoyed the prestige of political office for 21 years and has done absolutely nothing to save the jobs of 10,000 Tasmanian workers that are at risk because of the outrageous Renewable Energy Target and our Bass Strait crisis. Put aside the fact that Senator Abetz has allowed his Liberal Party to put its foot on the throat of the Tasmanian economy by creating a crisis with the Bass Strait shipping and transport costs. Put aside the fact that Senator Abetz and his prime minister are happy for Tasmanian business to be placed at a huge disadvantage compared with the mainland states and to pay unfair and excessive freight charges. Put aside all those facts and outrageous injustices and there remains one injustice that the people of Tasmania and other states of Australia will not easily forgive the PM for, and which contributes to the deep level of mistrust for this Abbott government.


How can the Prime Minister and his cabinet, even after today, steal money from the men and women of our Defence Force—especially at a time when we rely on their protection so much? It would only take $121 million to deliver a fair pay rise for our Australian Defence Force personnel. If Mr Abbott wants to make a fair dinkum attempt to repair the damage he has caused to the office of prime minister and to the morale of our diggers, then all he has to do is announce—like his backbench member, Mal Brough—that he will support a fair pay rise for members of our Australian Defence Force. In the centenary of Anzac—and I say it again; this is the centenary of Anzac—how can he, in all good conscience, stand with our diggers and have photos taken with them with a smirk on his face as he takes food from their children?


Mr Brough had me cheering in front of the TV when he told a reporter on 3 February 2015:


Our defence force is one of the best in the world because of its people and the very least we can do is to ensure that their wages are not diminished.


Being a Liberal, Mr Brough is not without his faults but I am glad he has supported my stance on ADF pay. He is a former officer in the Army, but unlike the lazy Tasmanian Liberal backbencher, former Army officer and ex-brigadier, Mr Nikolic, Mr Brough has on this matter shown courage, honour and a sense of loyalty to his former colleagues by challenging the PM and speaking out for our diggers and their families.


Department of Defence figures indicate that nearly 800 Tasmanians are employed: 90 on a permanent basis and 700 in the ADF Reserves. There are almost 8,000 veterans living in Tasmania. We should never forget the thousands of Tasmanians who have left our state and served in mainland or overseas locations. Every one of those people would be prepared to reassess their opinion this government—that it is cruel, unfair and cannot be trusted—if it would only do the smart and conscious thing and give a fair pay rise to our ADF. 


It is now time for action. The PM has a perfect opportunity to step up to the plate. He can do that with the flick of a pen today. The men and women in the ADF put their lives on the line for us every day. I want to see some action out of this PM, and this is the first action I want to see. I want the PM to replace the money that he has stolen from them—and I want it done today! (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-02-09,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:16):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance today, which is the chaos, division, dysfunction and mistrust at the heart of the coalition government. We all know that the good ship, the Liberal Party, is sinking. It is floundering in a sea of gross unpopularity. The captain, Prime Minister Abbott, has driven the ship into the iceberg and survivors are battering each other to get to too few lifeboats. They have not just tried to rearrange the deck chairs; they are actually battering each other to get to those lifeboats. The government's competence and judgement have been tested and found sorely wanting. They are chaotic, divided, dysfunctional and certainly unable to be trusted. This is what they meant when they said, 'The adults are back in charge'!  


The Liberal Party had a leadership contest this morning, and it has shown that a large proportion of the Liberal Party backbench want to roll Prime Minister Abbott. They did not even have an identified alternative putting their hand up; they wanted anyone but Abbott. It is the 'ABA' group, and we have heard about it quite a lot of late. The Liberal Party room is divided, dysfunctional, chaotic and full of animosity. I can give you a precise figure on just how divided: it is 39 per cent divided. However, I am sure this figure has become out of date since this morning and that it will be rising fairly quickly, I should expect, after Mr Abbott's statement that 'Today is the day good government starts.' I think the Australian people should really stop and listen to that comment, because after 520 days in government, what have the government been doing? What has been happening for the last 520 days if today is the day that good government starts? They should have started good government 520 days ago. They should have been thinking about what they were doing 520 days ago. I am really concerned that one member of the government is so dysfunctional or so concerned about the whole Liberal Party that he or she was unable to write 'yes or no' correctly on a ballot paper that only provided those options. Obviously, one person in that room has absolutely no faith in the Liberal Party. They wrote 'pass'. What a joke! Although Mr Abbott survived this morning's attempt to remove him, his government is still in chaos; it is still dysfunctional. This government is still divided and it is still racked with mistrust. I am sure that we will see another leadership challenge against Mr Abbott in the future, as his government keeps on focusing on itself rather than on the issues that matter. 


In last Monday's speech at the National Press Club—a speech designed purely and solely to shore up his own leadership—Mr Abbott promised a more collegiate and consultative government. His backbenchers and ministers must take such a promise with a grain of salt since, as reported in the media, he has made that comment, that same promise, 12 to 15 times since 2009. When I worked in child care, if I had a child that kept promising to change their behaviour 12 or 15 times in a few years, I would be taking very severe action against that child when their behaviour was so unacceptable. I think the Australian people will show what they believe at the next election, whenever that might be. They will not put up with untruths and broken promises from the government of the day. Maybe Mr Abbott will change, but I doubt it—I very strongly doubt it. That is unfortunate, because this government needs to change. Many of the obviously sensible senators and members that were in their caucus room this morning knew that; they knew that it had to change. 


Some in the government blame the sales pitch—'We haven't sold our policies very well'—but Australians know that it is not so much the salesmen but the policies that are so bad. So you have got a bad salesman or two or three or four or five and you have got disgusting, absolutely unacceptable policies coming out. The Australian people are not fools. It does not matter what those opposite decide to do in their caucus room with regard to leadership. It will be shown at the next election that they will have done the wrong thing. The thought-bubbles, the captain's picks—and very dodgy captain's s picks at that—the directives of Rupert Murdoch and the hard-core ideology of the Institute of Public Affairs are not the policies that Australians need. 


The Australian people want their government to act on their behalf, not on behalf of foreign media magnates, Sydney based lobbyists or the rich miners. Whilst Mr Abbott might be Prime Minister today, when they do decide to replace him—with Mr Turnbull, Ms Bishop, Mr Pyne or whoever—their policies will still be the same; they will be thoughtless, they will be heartless and they will be targeting the most vulnerable in our society. The government do not need a change of face; they actually need to have major heart surgery—because they are not looking after the people in Australia who need to be looked after. And the people in Australia who really do need to be looked after are feeling betrayed and angry that this Liberal-National government wants to transform Australia so drastically and so cruelly. And, should the policies change, it will say, 'Actually, we didn't need to be that hard.' That will be an interesting dilemma for those on that side as well.


We all know that Australians believe in a fair go, in helping the underdog—and that is why they are so opposed to what this government is doing. The Australian people do not want a GP tax. The Medicare system, which allows access to health care for all Australians no matter what their financial circumstances, has been a key right of Australians—except for a shortcut under the Fraser Liberal government—for 40 years. How can the Australian people trust this government when they did not even announce that they wanted to destroy Medicare? And what is even more ridiculous is the continued back-flipping on this issue. Chaos? Chaos rules! First, there was going to be a $7 co-payment, which was then taken off the table. Then they wanted to cut the Medicare rebate for short consultations by $20, which they then pulled out just days before it was to come into effect. Now there are comments that, after this morning's spill attempt, any form of co-payment will be taken off the table. What does that say? It says, in actual fact we did not have to have that co-payment, we did not have to be so harsh and unrealistic and treat so harshly those in Australia who cannot look after themselves. It is just a joke as far as I am concerned, and the people of Australia think you are a joke. This position will probably change a few more times—as long as they are in government, who knows.


Another thing the Australian people really do not like is this government's attempt to introduce $100,000 university fees. They are proud that they have got a university sector that allows their children and grandchildren to gain access to world-class higher education in an affordable manner. Australians know that a higher education benefits not only the individual but the nation as a whole. If you want to have a smart Australia, you need to let people have access to higher education. But by making a degree cost $100,000 you remove the aspirations of young Australians from low-income backgrounds, who are quite seriously afraid of being saddled with such a debt for their entire lives. It is a figure that will leave higher education to the children of the wealthy. It is ideology again, coming through loud and strong. And that is not how our egalitarian society should be working.


Senior Australians are concerned about a cut to pensions despite the government's promise it would not do so. As a result of changes to indexation arrangements, in 10 years time pensioners will be $80 worse off than they would otherwise have been. So there is a cut.


Australians hate the attacks on the ABC and the SBS. Those TV stations show how diverse we are, how clever we are, how hardworking we are as a nation. But no, 'There will be no cuts to the ABC.' Well, bless my cotton socks, there have been. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:26):  At 8.30 this morning Senator Moore presented this ridiculous MPI on 'chaos, division and dysfunction'. Of course, by 9.30 it was shown to be the lie that she always knew it was going to be. It is a shame she did not have the common courtesy to withdraw it. The simple fact of the matter is that, yes, there is chaos, division and dysfunction—and I am going to explain over the next few minutes why it has been caused in the Senate by the Labor Party and some of their hangers-on and why the Australian people are so badly disadvantaged.


Mr Abbott did make one mistake when he came to government. He made the mistake of—



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  Order! You were heard in silence, please afford the same.




Senator BACK:
  Mr Abbott made the mistake of believing that the then Labor government's deficit for that year was $18 billion. The reality is that it was not $18 billion, it was not $20 billion, it was $40 billion.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I would ask those on my left to remain silent. Interjections are disorderly, and I remind you that you were heard in silence.




Senator BACK:
  Senator Fifield made the opposition today—and he is quite right—that economic policy must lie in parallel to social policy.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BACK:
  What the other side, in their bleating, conveniently overlook is that, what they inherited as a surplus in this country they managed to turn into an accumulated deficit of $200 billion, running towards $600 billion of debt. What that means is that we pay $1 billion a month in interest on our overseas debt. That is a new teaching hospital that we forgo every month as a result of the interest on the debt incurred by this crowd over there. That is $33 million a day. That is two new primary schools, seven days a week, that we are giving up because we are paying interest on money borrowed overseas. I will not listen to the nonsense being put forward by the other side when it comes to responsibility.


Let me come to the higher education sector. The Labor Party are opposing the changes. The fact that every vice-chancellor in Australia is now in favour, and the fact that the Labor Party in government lifted the caps on numbers but did not lift the cap on the capacity to deliver quality education, seems to have escaped them.


Senator Bilyk goes on about $100,000 degrees. It is time she went to school and learnt the cost of a four-year agriculture degree—at a cost of $16,000 a year—at one of Australia's top universities, UWA. As far as I know, four 16s are 64, not 100. Senator Carr, the shadow minister, continues to go on with this ridiculous statement.


But, of course, that is also affecting our international higher education sector. I remind you that international higher education is the fourth largest export income earner and indeed the highest non-commodity export income earner in this country, of some $16 billion. Why is it being put at risk? Because, internationally, the universities in our region and elsewhere are now perfectly capable of exceeding us in terms of quality. Why is it that the vice-chancellors are asking and begging the Labor Party and indeed the crossbenchers to pass the legislation? Ask yourselves that question. My good friend and colleague Senator Xenophon says, 'All we need is another inquiry.'


We have had the Bradley inquiry, commissioned by Labor. We had the department's inquiry, in 2009. We had the Behrendt inquiry, in 2011, commissioned by the Hon. Chris Evans. We had the Lomax-Smith inquiry, the Phillips inquiry, the Kwong Lee Dow and Braithwaite inquiry—how many more inquiries do we need before we actually move and pass this legislation?


I do remind you, Deputy President, and those who might be listening that this is the same Labor opposition, claiming chaos, division and dysfunction on our side, which actually brought into this place $5 billion of budget savings when it was in government, which were accepted by the coalition. What has this crowd done in opposition? It has simply opposed what were its own policies when it was in government and we are invited to come in here today and talk about chaos, division and dysfunction. We are a government about improving employment and the economic circumstances of this country. 



Senator Lines interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I can explain exactly, through you, Deputy President, the three free trade agreements. Let me give you one illustration. The services sector in this country accounts for 70 per cent of our economy and yet only accounts for 17 per cent of export income. With respect to the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement, yes, the Chinese want our commodities. What the Chinese want more than anything else is our services. If we could increase the services sector's export-earning income, from 17 per cent up to 25 per cent, 30 per cent or more, you bet your life, through you, Deputy President, to Senator Lines, we would be in a position then where this country would be returning to the sort of stability and economic position we need to be in to achieve these goals.


I speak of international competitiveness. I speak about the offshore gas industry in my home state of Western Australia. There has been $200 billion of recent investment, a tremendous story. Gas prices are going down, as are oil prices and iron ore prices. They are going to adversely affect state and Commonwealth royalties. But we must remain internationally competitive. It is now costing $4,000 a tonne—and these are McKinsey's figures, not mine—to develop an offshore facility off WA. The cost of production in an equivalent field, the most recent one being the Sabine field, on the American side of the Gulf of Mexico, is not $4,000 a tonne but $1,500 a tonne. This is what we have to compete with internationally.


I am an optimist and I say that this is one of the greatest countries in the world, but we must get out there and understand that we do not exist in an international vacuum. We exist in the overall international economy. Greece is currently defaulting on its debt. We have Europe watching what will happen to Greece as it defaults. We have the powerhouse Germany, saying, 'We are not prepared to forgive you that $400 billion or $500 billion euros of debt.'


The United States of America, which, because it found cheap energy through shale gas, has now brought manufacturing back into its country. We see employment levels going up. But remember that we have $1 billion a month interest on our debt; the Americans are borrowing $1 billion per working day. Each year they are borrowing $250 billion each year. 


We have phenomenal opportunities in this country. We must not as a Senate, as a country and as an economy be held back by an irresponsible opposition, which itself caused the economic malaise and demise. I finish with the words of Senator Fifield, 'You must have economic policy aligned to social policy if you wish to succeed.'

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (17:35):  I rise to speak today on this matter of public importance. What we heard from the Abbott government was more spin than you would get from a whirling dervish. They cannot tell the truth, even on a day when their poll results have hit absolute rock bottom. Never before in this country have we had a Prime Minister as unpopular as Mr Abbott. Since Australia Day, after the Prime Minister's 'knightmare' backlash from the Australian public in knighting Prince Philip, the chaos, the division, the dysfunction and the mistrust eating at the heart of the coalition government have been well and truly on display. It culminated this morning in a spill motion where 39 MPs and senators, a majority of backbenchers, voted for a spill motion to have a new leader—any leader—anybody other than the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott. Surely, the Prime Minister himself admitted to this chaos, division, dysfunction and mistrust today in his own government when he said after the spill motion, 'Good government starts today.' What an insult to Australian voters! Australian voters had a right to good government from September 2013. But no, 18 months later, Mr Abbott finally says, 'I'll have a go at good government from now on.' What a disgrace!


Almost 40 people in the Liberal Party—because I believe even a Liberal member is capable of filling out a ballot paper without getting it wrong—deliberately wanted anybody other than the Prime Minister. What confusion we saw.


What we see from the Abbott government and the ministers in this place is that they are living in a parallel universe. They are claiming everything is fine. Clearly things are not fine when the Prime Minister of the country commits to good government from today. Clearly things are not fine when at least 39 backbenchers say they want anyone except the current Prime Minister.


It is one thing, perhaps even expected, that a conservative tea party government like the Abbott government would let down low-income earners and Australian workers and would put trade unions offside. However, this government has managed to get everyone offside with its bucketful of broken promises, back flips and captain's picks.


Doctors are out campaigning against the mistrust they have in the government. Perhaps the PM has not been into a doctor's surgery lately, but let me assure him that in my doctor's surgery I recently saw not just one notice opposing the Abbott government's cuts but three notices and a petition. I can assure those opposite that the Abbott government's cuts to Medicare were the talk of that waiting room.


Are the Prime Minister and his team listening? Of course they are not, because they are committed still to cutting Medicare. The AMA is not convinced, because their campaign continues. Turning to business groups, the Abbott government has even managed to put off its mates at the big end of town. They are asking: you have done the big backflip on PPL, but what about the levy? What are they being met with? Absolute silence. So, now, business groups, which are the Abbott government's traditional mates, are offside. What about farmers? What is the National Party doing? We have been suffering drought in this country. The PM went out on a farm but again there were just empty promises. We have seen nothing but poor policy delivered in that area.


The chaos, the division, the dysfunction and the mistrust will continue, because that genie is out of the bottle, and once the genie is out of the bottle it cannot be put back. Those low polls and the backflips and broken promises of the Abbott government will continue, and they will continue to live in their parallel universe trying to pretend that everything is somehow fine in the country, when all of us know better, until the next election. A change in government is what this country needs, and it needs it sooner rather than later.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:40):  I had the opportunity during the earlier take note of answers session to talk through some of the significant achievements of the coalition government over the last 17 months, so I will not go over them again, except to say that they are significant and we now need to build on those. Given the tenor of the MPI and some of the ridiculous statements we have heard from those opposite, you get a sense of a notion of projecting, because we have seen how they were in government. They are looking to project that chaos and dysfunction onto us.


In UK newspaper The Telegraph I found a nice summary and timeline of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. They give an excellent summary of the real chaos and dysfunction, which is in stark contrast to what this government is about. I wanted to highlight it, because I think there is a lot of projecting here from the Labor party:


2010


June 23—Then deputy prime minister, Gillard challenges Rudd to a leadership ballot as his popularity plummets following a series of policy mis-steps including shelving an emissions trading scheme and skirmishes with the powerful mining industry over tax hikes. 


June 24—Gillard goes on to win unopposed, with Rudd declining to contest the ballot. She quickly calls national elections.


August 21—The Labor party fails to win a majority, prompting Australia's first electoral deadlock in 70 years.


September 7—Minority lawmakers throw their support behind Gillard after lengthy negotiations, ensuring Labor's return to power with a fragile coalition. Gillard appoints Rudd as foreign minister.


2011


March 8—Gillard's popularity drops to a record low amid plans for a pollution levy, despite pledging there would be no such tax under her government. Furious protests break out around the country.


August 31—High Court strikes down Gillard's refugee swap deal with Malaysia, seen as a solution to the inflammatory issue of boat people, forcing Labor to scrap offshore processing and release refugees.


November 8—Labor passes its controversial emissions reduction scheme, but fails to make any headway in the polls. Rudd consistently places ahead of Gillard as preferred leader.


2012


February 22—Rudd resigns as foreign minister in Washington and says he is returning home to consider his future.


February 23—Gillard calls a leadership ballot and says both contenders must accept the outcome as final.


February 27—Gillard wins the ballot with a commanding 71 votes to 31 and vows to lead a unified front to the 2013 election. Rudd promises full support and says he holds no grudges.


2013


January 30—Amid renewed talk about Gillard's leadership, she announces national elections for September 14.


February 15—Rudd dismisses mounting speculation he will again challenge Gillard, telling everyone to take 'a long, cold shower'.


March 12—An opinion poll shows Gillard would be crushed in a national election, but Labor would easily win if Rudd was leader.


March 21—Senior cabinet minister Simon Crean demands Gillard call a leadership vote and urges Rudd to stand. Gillard immediately calls a ballot but Rudd declines to challenge and she retains the leadership unopposed. Rudd vows not to challenge again.


June 26—After weeks of rising speculation Gillard announces a party leadership ballot cutting short party-room moves to depose her. Both Rudd and the prime minister commit to quit politics if they lose.


Rudd wins the ballot by 57 votes to 45.


Labor lost the election. That is a nice summary of the last few years of Labor government. What Labor is trying to do is to somehow contend that it is the coalition that has the issue and the problem.


I think there is another contrast they will want to draw. It is the vicious way in which the Labor Party publicly treated each other.




Senator Polley:
  Unlike those saints on the other side.




Senator SESELJA:
  In comparison to you lot we bring civility to a new level. We all remember what Wayne Swan said about Kevin Rudd. This, of course, is a leader who you put back into the prime ministership after you had gotten rid of him. You all knew how dysfunctional he was. Wayne Swan said: 


… for too long, Kevin Rudd has been putting his own self-interest ahead of the interests of the broader labour movement and the country as a whole, and that needs to stop.


The Party has given Kevin Rudd all the opportunities in the world and he wasted them with his dysfunctional decision making and his deeply demeaning attitude towards other people including our caucus colleagues.


He sought to tear down the 2010 campaign, deliberately risking an Abbott Prime Ministership, and now he undermines the Government at every turn.


He was the Party's biggest beneficiary then its biggest critic; but never a loyal or selfless example of its values and objectives.


For the interests of the labour movement and of working people, there is too much at stake in our economy and in the political debate for the interests of the labour movement and working people to be damaged by somebody who does not hold any Labor values.


This is what Wayne Swan thought of Kevin Rudd. This is the guy that those opposite put back into leadership after all of those years of dysfunction.


We know that all the players have admitted what they thought of him. We saw on 29 June 2014 the headline ""Julia Gillard admits political war with Kevin Rudd was 'all about ego'"". Then there was the article with the great line from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate which said:


Senior Minister Penny Wong came to her in tears. She, too, was abandoning Gillard. Why? “It's the South Australian seats,'' Wong replies.


“I knew then that I'd lost it,'' Gillard said.


Then there was 'Bill Shorten: The man who knifed two prime ministers'. That article said:


Mr Shorten did not believe he had been dishonest in telling the media over the past two weeks he was still supporting Ms Gillard.


""As I was going through the process of thinking what to do, do you think it is my job to be a public worrywart? That just destabilises the situation,"" he said.


""Up until the spill ... I was going to support the prime minister.""


Of course, that was until he did not.


Then we had the Gillard article titled ""She says: 'Why I had to knife Kevin Rudd'"". Then we had Nicola Roxon's classic line in another article. It said:


She acknowledged that removing Mr Rudd from The Lodge in 2010 was ""an act of political bastardry"" but she said it was only possible ""because Kevin had been such a bastard himself"".


That is what we have left behind.


Let's be clear: all governments face their challenges. You can react to it in that way, as the Labor Party did, or you can react to it in a far more sensible way. That is what we in the coalition are going to do. We are going to get on with building on our achievements. Getting rid of the carbon tax, stopping the boats and the deaths at sea, securing our borders, conducting free trade agreements, hundreds of millions of dollars of environmental approvals, removing red tape all over the place—these are the achievements that we need to continue to build on. We are not going to be lectured to by the Labor Party.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:52):  I believe when I left off before question time I was saying that the government does believe that mandatory minimum sentences are necessary and will act as a strong deterrent for those who would otherwise engage in illicit firearms trafficking. As I said, the bill introduces mandatory minimum sentences of five years imprisonment for offenders charged with trafficking firearms or firearm parts, though this does not apply to minors. The introduction of even a small number of firearms or firearm parts into the illicit market can have a significant impact on the community.


This provision aims to ensure that offenders receive sentences proportionate to the seriousness of their offending. The government believes that mandatory minimum sentences will act as a strong deterrent for those who would otherwise engage in illicit firearms trafficking. This is a similar view to that taken by the Queensland and United Kingdom governments, which have both introduced mandatory minimum sentences for firearms trafficking offences. The introduction of this penalty is appropriate to ensure that high-culpability offenders receive sentences proportionate to the seriousness of their offending, while providing the courts with discretion to set custodial periods consistent with the particular circumstances of the offender and the offence.


The Australian government believes that the current approach to firearms policy strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of those with a genuine need to have access to firearms and the interests of the broader community to live safely and securely. However, the government also recognises and respects the importance of preserving discretion in sentencing and the court's ability to take into account the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender. Therefore, there is no nonparole period prescribed by the amendments and the actual time a person is incarcerated will be at the discretion of the sentencing judge. The absence of the nonparole period will allow courts to take into account factors such as cognitive impairment, the public interest and the broader circumstances of the offence when setting the period offenders spend in custody.


I also note that all mandatory minimum penalties for firearm trafficking offences will not apply to those under the age of 18. This again preserves judicial discretion in sentencing by ensuring that the courts can take into account minors' particular circumstances. This approach is consistent with the application of mandatory minimum sentences for offences under the Migration Act 1958 for minors involved in people smuggling offences. It is also consistent with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.


There has been some concern about this provision and the government notes the concern of the Law Council of Australia in relation to mandatory minimum sentences. However, the government is of the firm belief that the introduction of these penalties will send a strong deterrent message to those who would otherwise engage in firearms trafficking. The government notes that the Law Council of Australia has suggested the presence of mandatory minimum sentences reduces the likelihood of offenders pleading guilty. This is because offenders are aware that a guilty plea will still result in the prescribed minimum sentence; they are therefore less likely to enter the a guilty plea, which in turn results in trials running their full course.


However, as I mentioned earlier, given that the government has not attached a nonparole period to the mandatory minimum sentences, this ensures there is still an incentive to enter a guilty plea as the particular circumstances of each case will be considered by the court and the sentencing judge. That to me seems to be an eminently sensible approach.


The government has noted the concerns of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in relation to arbitrary detention. However, the government believes that there are appropriate limitations and safeguards in place to ensure that the detention is reasonable, necessary and proportionate to each individual case and therefore not arbitrary. Consistent with the concerns raised by the committee, the government has amended the explanatory memorandum of the bill, which now notes that the mandatory minimum sentence is not intended as a guide to the nonparole period, which in some cases may significantly differ from the head sentence.


I would also like to briefly note the elements of this bill regarding the International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme. Australia's International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme promotes the successful rehabilitation and reintegration into society of a prison, whilst preserving the sentence imposed by the sentencing country in the prisoner's home country. The scheme is important the community safety and ensures that prisoners can be reintegrated into that country's community and appropriately monitored, supervised and supported during the enforcement of the sentence.


The International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997, which governs the International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme, came into operation nearly 20 years ago. While it has been effective in enabling prisoners to be transferred back to Australia and out of Australia to their home country, there are opportunities to make this scheme more efficient, more timely and simplified. The existing processes will be streamlined in a number of ways. This includes improving arrangements governing unviable transfer applications, implementing time frames for reapplications and simplifying the process of notifying and seeking the consent of the transfer country.


In conclusion, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014 is an important update to our nation's criminal law so that it remains in step with the key issues of the day. We all know that the consequences of this kind of criminal activity are all too real. We know them well. We see, tragically, that gun-related violence and drug-related deaths are an all too common feature in our community. The Australian government believes very strongly in ensuring that we have the appropriate laws to deal with these issues and also in ensuring that we have the appropriate balance of people's civil liberties. I believe that this bill strikes that balance and I commend it to the Senate.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (17:58):  I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014, which delivers on the government's continuing commitment to combating drugs and gun-related crime. This bill will also ensure that Australia's criminal justice arrangements for the international transfer of prisoners, anti-money-laundering regime, counter-terrorism regime and investigation and prosecution of slavery offences remain up-to-date and effective.


The bill will reduce the availability of new psychoactive substances by banning their importation and allowing the Australian Customs and Border Protection officers and the Australian Federal Police officers to stop, seize and destroy these substances where they are detected. This will ensure that drug laws keep pace with new and emerging substances where they are presented as alternatives to illicit drugs. The bill also demonstrates the seriousness with which this government considers firearms trafficking and the gravity of supplying firearms and firearms parts to the illicit market by creating a more comprehensive set of firearm offences and penalties.


Australia's international transfer of prisoners scheme is important for community safety, as it ensures that prisoners can be reintegrated into that country's community and appropriately monitored, supervised and supported during the enforcement of the sentence. The bill will make existing processes governing the scheme more efficient, timely and simplified while appropriately maintaining prisoner rights.


This bill will also make clear that slavery offences within Commonwealth criminal law have universal jurisdiction. Slavery is amongst the most abhorrent of all crimes, and this amendment will ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies have the appropriate tools to target this crime wherever it occurs. In addition, the bill will take steps to improve Australia's anti-money-laundering regime by enhancing the ability of the Australian Taxation Office to coach tax cheats and bolster the budget's bottom line.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:01):  The government does not support these amendments. Firearms trafficking is amongst the most serious of crimes, particularly given its ability to facilitate violent and potentially deadly criminal acts. The entry of even a small number of illegal firearms into the Australian community will have a significant impact on the threat posed by the illicit market and due to the enduring nature of firearms a firearm can remain within that market for many years. 


Mandatory minimum penalties send a very strong message on the seriousness of gun related crime and violence and certainly act as a deterrent for criminals. The government believes that mandatory minimum sentences are a stronger deterrent than increased maximum penalties. There are protections in place to ensure that mandatory minimums do not cause unjust results. Mandatory minimum sentences will not apply to children, and there is no minimum non-parole period. The offences preserve a level of judicial discretion to allow courts to take into account mitigating factors when setting the period offenders spend in custody. The government amended the explanatory memorandum in response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's report to make clear that mandatory minimum sentence is not intended as a guide to the non-parole period, which in some cases may result in significant differences between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:03):  I would like to put on record that the Greens will be supporting this amendment. For the reasons already described, we do not support the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences of five years imprisonment for illegal firearms trafficking. We think that the appropriate sentence is that left to the discretion of the judge. I would like also to ask the minister representing the Attorney-General a question around the definition of 'psychoactive substance'. What test will be applied for a substance to be officially determined as a psychoactive substance?

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:04):  The bill builds on Customs officers' existing powers to stop and seize suspicious goods by allowing officers to seize new psychoactive substances. The bill does not use a broad definition of psychoactive effects to capture these substances but includes 12 broad categories of exemptions. The only substances caught by this offence are those that are going to be used or supplied as alternatives to illicit drugs. It is true that offenders will not be required to know with absolute certainty that a substance has a psychoactive effect. They will only need to reasonably suspect that the goods contain a new psychoactive substance. The goods will only be released if the importer shows that they have a legitimate use or are not psychoactive. This approach is the best way of staying ahead of an ever-changing drug market. The bill will clarify that new psychoactive substances are illegal and potentially very dangerous. It will give Customs officers appropriate powers to stop these substances at the border and will allow the government time to develop and implement more-specific controls. The government believes these changes are critical to protect public safety.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:05):  Thank you for that explanation, but it still does not address the question that I was asking, which was: what test will be applied to determine whether a substance fits into that category?

I ask again: what specific test will be used to determine whether a substance is captured under this legislation?

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:14):  No. Just in response to Senator Di Natale's question, the government believes that this approach is, as I said before—



The CHAIRMAN:  If those senators who do not intend to participate in the debate would either take their seats or leave the chamber, that would assist us in conducting our business. Minister.




Senator COLBECK:
  Thank you, Chair. I understand Senator DiNatale has had an interest in this for a period of time. As I have said, the government believes that having this broad definition is the best way of staying ahead of an ever-changing drug market. I would just reinforce a couple of the points that I made a moment ago. The only substances caught by this offence are those that are going to be used or supplied as alternatives to illicit drugs. That is an important point. The bill deliberately uses a broad definition of 'psychoactive effect' to capture these substances but, importantly, it includes 12 broad categories of exemptions. The ban will clearly not apply to any substance with a legitimate use that is imported in accordance with relevant regulatory schemes. Substances without a listed legitimate use are those that are most likely to be imported for use as alternatives to illicit drugs. So the definition of psychoactive substance is deliberately very broad, but it has to be read in the context of the rest of the legislation and, as I have indicated, there are 12 broad categories of exemptions that form part of that overall context for the rest of the legislation.


I know you are looking for something definitive, Senator DiNatale, but the government has taken an approach—as I have indicated to you now on a couple of occasions—that it is about being able to stay ahead of a rapidly changing market. Governments are often criticised for not being able to keep up with changes in the way that the community works, and in this circumstance we have made the deliberate attempt to put in place a provision that allows us to stay ahead of an ever-changing drug market. We understand the damage that that can cause in the broader community. We are looking at the opportunity to develop and implement more specific controls, but we are in a situation where we need to act on this as quickly as possible.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:17):  Perhaps it might be instructive to use a couple of scenarios. Under this legislation, why wouldn't a substance like a herbal tea that contains caffeine but is not currently registered for use in Australia—such as some of the caffeinated beverages that are used by particular cultural groups—be captured under this bill? We know that caffeine has psychoactive properties; it can produce anxiety and tremor and so on. Why is it that a substance like that is not captured under this bill? It seems to me that it would be.

 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:18):  Senator, that is clearly not the target of this piece of legislation.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:19):  There are some beverages that are ingested that are not listed as foods. In fact, we had a presentation to the inquiry into this legislation which highlighted a specific example of a Uruguayan beverage; we have also had examples listed that include particular therapeutics used in some alternative or complementary medicines: they do in those instances have psychoactive properties. Why is it that they will not be captured under this legislation?

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:19):  My advice is that the ban will not affect the importation of these goods. Customs and AFP officers will continue to have their current practice of stopping these goods for further investigation if they suspect that they may contain illicit drugs. These goods may be required to comply with other regulations; for example, those regarding quarantine and biosecurity. So it is a matter of giving the flexibility to our law enforcement agencies to make those assessments. I think I said to you earlier: it is about giving officers the flexibility to stay ahead of changes, and to make those assessments. It does not necessarily mean, as I understand this, that they will be captured but that they may be captured.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:21):  With respect, the question I am asking is not whether they will or will not be captured, but why: what is it that allows you to make a statement that says you understand they will not be captured, when many of the substances that have been described are not listed in the exemptions that are outlined in the legislation. They are not listed in the exemptions. They are used for particular indications that do not satisfy any of the exemptions. I understand that it is not the intention of the police to capture these substances, but if they are being imported, and if they are being imported with the very specific purpose of inducing some psychoactive effect, how is it that they will not be captured by this legislation?


I understand that it is not the intention of the bill. I understand that they are not being targeted. I understand all of that. But for the purposes of this bill, they satisfy the definition of 'psychoactive effect', they satisfy the definition of 'consume', and they are not listed with this substances that are exempt. Why won't they be captured?

 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:22):  I go back to one of the points that I made to you earlier: substances without a listed legitimate use are those that are the most likely to be imported for use as alternatives to illicit drugs. So what we are looking at is substances that are the most likely to be used as alternatives to illicit drugs. The ban will not apply, as I have said to you before, to any substance with a legitimate use. So some of those that are already being brought into the country, which have a recognised legitimate use, fall into that category under the exemptions.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:23):  I feel we are in a bit of a circular argument here, but I have already indicated to you a number of examples where a particular substance with an active ingredient produces a psychoactive effect—it may be used for a therapeutic purpose; it may be that somebody who is anxious is prescribed a particular medication from an alternative health practitioner—and that substance is not listed under the exemptions. It is currently being imported, it is being prescribed by an alternative health practitioner and it produces a psychoactive effect. It may be to reduce someone's anxiety; it may be to assist somebody with sleep—some of the reasons that illicit drugs are used. Why is it that that drug—which is going to be used for those indications, which will produce a psychoactive effect and which is not currently listed along with the exemptions in the bill—will not be captured under this definition? I still have not had a satisfactory explanation.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (18:24):  Firstly, if a substance is presented as having a therapeutic use, it will be exempt. I think I have mentioned that to you before. If substances are captured, it will be open to the importer to establish that they have a legitimate use. So I go back to the point that I made at the outset: we are taking this approach deliberately to stay ahead of an ever-changing market. You can attempt to prescribe as much as you like—as occurs in some other places—but you will never capture everything; I do not think it is possible. I know that you are looking for a very specific definition. The government has taken a deliberate decision to have a broad definition. I think that you are also right that we could go around this for a considerable period of time if that is what you want to do. You are looking for something specific; the government has taken a deliberate decision to have something that is not so specific but is broad. The reason that we have done that is to stay ahead of an ever-changing drug market, and it is a deliberate strategy of the government.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (18:26):  I just ask you to perhaps reflect on the answer that you have just given. The claim that if a substance has a therapeutic use it will be exempt is patently false. Many of these social tonics are marketed as having therapeutic uses—to help control anxiety, help with sleep or help relax. As a former physician, we prescribed medications for those indications; we prescribed drugs that had psychoactive properties to control those particular conditions. It cannot be that if a drug is simply promoted as having a therapeutic use it will be exempt, because it makes the legislation meaningless. I ask you to reflect on the answer that you have given and see if you can provide me with a satisfactory explanation.

That is what I am trying to get at. You cannot argue on one hand that any drug with a therapeutic indication will be exempt and then on the other hand argue that it needs to be registered under a particular framework like the TGA and so on. There are many, many substances that are imported and are used for therapeutic purposes that are not registered and are not listed in the list of exemptions, so they will be captured—they must be. What you are suggesting to me is that they are not the target. It does not matter whether they are the target or not. They satisfy the definition under the law, and, therefore, you are not providing any assurance that these substances will not be restricted.

In respect of the effect, it would also have to establish that the substance would have that effect. Even in our food laws, to make a claim about a therapeutic effect, you have to actually establish that; you cannot just put it on the label. Also under our food laws, it is not legal to mislead. I am surprised that you would make that statement. An importer would have to establish that a substance is for legitimate use and would have to establish the effect. I think that clarifies the point. Therefore, as I have stated previously, it is dealt with under the legislation.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (19:31):  Yes, that is true if the substance is going to be imported under the Therapeutic Goods Administration or under FSANZ regulations. That is absolutely true. But there are other substances that are imported that are not covered by those regulatory frameworks. I have got a list of substances, if you would like me to go through them with you. There are a number of them. They were brought to our attention through the course of the inquiry. There is, for example, the extract of an Amazonian plant, Guayusa. The leaves of this plant contain caffeine. It has a range of polyphenol antioxidants in it. There are claims that it is healthier than other caffeinated alternatives. It has been used traditionally for thousands of years in Ecuador. That specific extract would be captured by this definition. It is not listed under the TGA or FSANZ and therefore it does not have to demonstrate that it has a therapeutic effect. It does not have to substantiate the claim because it is not imported under either of those regulatory frameworks. So why is it that that substance would not satisfy the definition of a psychoactive substance, given that it does contain caffeine and other substances? Why is it that it is not captured?

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (19:34):  Senator, we actually have been through all this, and that is the intent of the legislation. As I have said to you a number of times, that is the intent of the legislation. It has a broad definition deliberately. The reason it has a broad definition is so that we can stay ahead of an ever-changing drug market. You can keep asking the question and, Senator, I will keep on giving you the answer. That is fine. I am quite content with that. That is the rationale of the government. I have stated that to you a number of times. And that is the reason that we have taken the approach that we have. 


I do not believe that it is unreasonable that someone who wants to put something into the Australian market should demonstrate its efficacy or its use. We do that for a number of products. We say that, if a food wants to make a therapeutic claim under our Food Standards Australia New Zealand legislation—and you have acknowledged that—it should demonstrate that. I have acknowledged that a new substance may be caught in the process. I have also said on a number of occasions that the purpose of this is to capture substances that are most likely to be imported for use as alternatives to illicit drug use. So, if you are telling me the substance you have just described might be imported as an alternative to illicit drug use—




Senator Di Natale:
  No, I haven't said that.




Senator COLBECK:
  well, that is the implication that comes to me from your question—and it is captured, and I have said that it may be, then it is open to the importer to demonstrate, to establish, that it is there for a legitimate use. It goes back to a strategy which I said is deliberate, and I will keep repeating the strategy. It is deliberately a broad definition and it is designed so that the government can stay ahead of a rapidly changing drug market. It is a deliberate strategy.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (19:36):  I am yet to get an answer on how they establish that it is not used for that intended purpose and it does not have a psychoactive effect. We are talking about a product—in this case one that contains caffeine, which we know has a psychoactive effect—that is imported by particular outlets, that is used as an alternative to other caffeinated beverages and that satisfies the definition under the legislation of being a psychoactive substance. You said that it may be caught; it sounds as if it is not a particularly effective piece of legislation if substances like this 'may be caught'. You have also said that the onus is on the importer. What I am asking is: how does the importer satisfy the authorities that this is not a substance that is being imported with a view to mimicking the effect of other psychoactive substances? How does that occur? What is the test that is applied?

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (19:37):  The test is clear on the face of the bill. A substance may be seized if an officer has a reasonable suspicion that a substance has a psychoactive effect and is not otherwise covered by another import scheme. Further, the bill contains a clear definition of 'psychoactive effect', and I will read that out for you. It says:



psychoactive effect, in relation to a person, means:


(a) simulation or depression of the person's central nervous system—


you have already described some of these in your questions this evening—


resulting in hallucinations or in a significant disturbance in, or significant change to, motor function, thinking, behaviour, perception, awareness or mood; or


(b) causing a state of dependence, including physical or psychological addiction.


So that is very clear.




Senator Di Natale:
  No, it is not.




Senator COLBECK:
  Well, it is very clear, and I have said to you that our strategy in this is—

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (19:39):  You have said in your answer, Minister, the conditions for which a substance may be restricted, and you have also said that the onus will be on the importer. What you have not demonstrated, and what I need an answer to, is: how does an importer demonstrate to the authorities that this is not a psychoactive substance that should be captured by this definition? For example, I am company X; I import product Y into the market. The authorities say to me, 'We suspect that this may be a substance that has psychoactive properties. We are going to restrict the importation of your product.' How do I satisfy the authorities that this substance does not have psychoactive properties that are intended to be captured by this bill? How do I, as the importer, satisfy to the authorities that my substance should not be captured by this piece of legislation?

 (Victoria) (19:40):  I may not be claiming anything. That is the whole point. You keep coming back to the issue of claims. I might be importing this product and there might be absolutely no claim to it, but the authorities may suspect that it is a psychoactive substance. We may have our border enforcement authorities look at a product and express concerns because they might get a tip-off to say, 'We're worried that the product that's being imported has psychoactive properties and is being used to mimic other existing illicit substances.' The onus is then on me to prove that it does not have those properties. How do I do that? (Quorum formed)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-02-09,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:52):  I believe when I left off before question time I was saying that the government does believe that mandatory minimum sentences are necessary and will act as a strong deterrent for those who would otherwise engage in illicit firearms trafficking. As I said, the bill introduces mandatory minimum sentences of five years imprisonment for offenders charged with trafficking firearms or firearm parts, though this does not apply to minors. The introduction of even a small number of firearms or firearm parts into the illicit market can have a significant impact on the community.


This provision aims to ensure that offenders receive sentences proportionate to the seriousness of their offending. The government believes that mandatory minimum sentences will act as a strong deterrent for those who would otherwise engage in illicit firearms trafficking. This is a similar view to that taken by the Queensland and United Kingdom governments, which have both introduced mandatory minimum sentences for firearms trafficking offences. The introduction of this penalty is appropriate to ensure that high-culpability offenders receive sentences proportionate to the seriousness of their offending, while providing the courts with discretion to set custodial periods consistent with the particular circumstances of the offender and the offence.


The Australian government believes that the current approach to firearms policy strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of those with a genuine need to have access to firearms and the interests of the broader community to live safely and securely. However, the government also recognises and respects the importance of preserving discretion in sentencing and the court's ability to take into account the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender. Therefore, there is no nonparole period prescribed by the amendments and the actual time a person is incarcerated will be at the discretion of the sentencing judge. The absence of the nonparole period will allow courts to take into account factors such as cognitive impairment, the public interest and the broader circumstances of the offence when setting the period offenders spend in custody.


I also note that all mandatory minimum penalties for firearm trafficking offences will not apply to those under the age of 18. This again preserves judicial discretion in sentencing by ensuring that the courts can take into account minors' particular circumstances. This approach is consistent with the application of mandatory minimum sentences for offences under the Migration Act 1958 for minors involved in people smuggling offences. It is also consistent with Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.


There has been some concern about this provision and the government notes the concern of the Law Council of Australia in relation to mandatory minimum sentences. However, the government is of the firm belief that the introduction of these penalties will send a strong deterrent message to those who would otherwise engage in firearms trafficking. The government notes that the Law Council of Australia has suggested the presence of mandatory minimum sentences reduces the likelihood of offenders pleading guilty. This is because offenders are aware that a guilty plea will still result in the prescribed minimum sentence; they are therefore less likely to enter the a guilty plea, which in turn results in trials running their full course.


However, as I mentioned earlier, given that the government has not attached a nonparole period to the mandatory minimum sentences, this ensures there is still an incentive to enter a guilty plea as the particular circumstances of each case will be considered by the court and the sentencing judge. That to me seems to be an eminently sensible approach.


The government has noted the concerns of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in relation to arbitrary detention. However, the government believes that there are appropriate limitations and safeguards in place to ensure that the detention is reasonable, necessary and proportionate to each individual case and therefore not arbitrary. Consistent with the concerns raised by the committee, the government has amended the explanatory memorandum of the bill, which now notes that the mandatory minimum sentence is not intended as a guide to the nonparole period, which in some cases may significantly differ from the head sentence.


I would also like to briefly note the elements of this bill regarding the International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme. Australia's International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme promotes the successful rehabilitation and reintegration into society of a prison, whilst preserving the sentence imposed by the sentencing country in the prisoner's home country. The scheme is important the community safety and ensures that prisoners can be reintegrated into that country's community and appropriately monitored, supervised and supported during the enforcement of the sentence.


The International Transfer of Prisoners Act 1997, which governs the International Transfer of Prisoners Scheme, came into operation nearly 20 years ago. While it has been effective in enabling prisoners to be transferred back to Australia and out of Australia to their home country, there are opportunities to make this scheme more efficient, more timely and simplified. The existing processes will be streamlined in a number of ways. This includes improving arrangements governing unviable transfer applications, implementing time frames for reapplications and simplifying the process of notifying and seeking the consent of the transfer country.


In conclusion, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014 is an important update to our nation's criminal law so that it remains in step with the key issues of the day. We all know that the consequences of this kind of criminal activity are all too real. We know them well. We see, tragically, that gun-related violence and drug-related deaths are an all too common feature in our community. The Australian government believes very strongly in ensuring that we have the appropriate laws to deal with these issues and also in ensuring that we have the appropriate balance of people's civil liberties. I believe that this bill strikes that balance and I commend it to the Senate.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (17:58):  I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Psychoactive Substances and Other Measures) Bill 2014, which delivers on the government's continuing commitment to combating drugs and gun-related crime. This bill will also ensure that Australia's criminal justice arrangements for the international transfer of prisoners, anti-money-laundering regime, counter-terrorism regime and investigation and prosecution of slavery offences remain up-to-date and effective.


The bill will reduce the availability of new psychoactive substances by banning their importation and allowing the Australian Customs and Border Protection officers and the Australian Federal Police officers to stop, seize and destroy these substances where they are detected. This will ensure that drug laws keep pace with new and emerging substances where they are presented as alternatives to illicit drugs. The bill also demonstrates the seriousness with which this government considers firearms trafficking and the gravity of supplying firearms and firearms parts to the illicit market by creating a more comprehensive set of firearm offences and penalties.


Australia's international transfer of prisoners scheme is important for community safety, as it ensures that prisoners can be reintegrated into that country's community and appropriately monitored, supervised and supported during the enforcement of the sentence. The bill will make existing processes governing the scheme more efficient, timely and simplified while appropriately maintaining prisoner rights.


This bill will also make clear that slavery offences within Commonwealth criminal law have universal jurisdiction. Slavery is amongst the most abhorrent of all crimes, and this amendment will ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies have the appropriate tools to target this crime wherever it occurs. In addition, the bill will take steps to improve Australia's anti-money-laundering regime by enhancing the ability of the Australian Taxation Office to coach tax cheats and bolster the budget's bottom line.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-02-09,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (21:50):  I want to talk a little bit about beef prices and agriculture prices more generally tonight. A couple of weeks ago I went to the Gracemere saleyards near Rockhampton. They are getting record prices for beef right now, which is a great thing for our farmers because particularly in the beef sector they have been doing it tough for a very long time. When I was there young steers were going for 288c a kilo that week. There were not too many yardings; there were only 400 there that week because of rain, and that affected how much could get there. But last Friday, when I was not there, just over 4,000 head were sold and prices were still very strong. Light feeder heifers went for 200c to 234c a kilo, grown steers averaged 236c a kilo and bullocks—there were not that many of them, apparently—went for 245c a kilo. These prices have massively increased over the past year and are some of the highest prices we have seen since the 1970s.


Last year a guy from Bruce Farrel Dorn & Associates reported in the paper that prices for these types of cattle were averaging $1.60 a kilo at the same time last year. For a 400-kilo bullock you would get around $650 a head--$650 you would take away. This year, because the prices have gone up, that same bullock would get you $1,000 a head. So, if you were bringing 50 head to market that week, you would get an extra $17,500 for your product. That is solely because of that increase in prices.


When we came to government around 16 months ago, the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the trade minister, Andrew Robb, said that we would get money into the back pockets of farmers and we would increase profitability for farmers, and we have done that. We said we would do that, and we have done that. We have done that across more than just the Gracemere saleyards. It is across the beef sector generally. At the election, prices were around 313c a kilo—that is according to the Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, which is the most comprehensive cattle price indicator in the country. Back at the election, 313c a kilo dressed weight—that is not live weight. The prices that I quoted before were live weight and that is why this one is a bit higher. Then, 313c a kilo; today, 450c a kilo. That is an increase of 44 per cent in just 16 months. Lamb prices have gone up as well. At the election they were 417c a kilo and today they are 565c a kilo, an increase of 35 per cent. Milk prices as well have gone up across the country. The farm-gate milk price has increased from 40.2c per litre at the election to 51.2c per litre today, an increase of 27 per cent. Milk solids have gone up as well, from $5.41 a kilo to $6.89 a kilo, also an increase of 27 per cent.


I am not trying to claim that these increases are all because of government policy. There are always lots of things that affect market prices, demand of course being one of them. But demand for agricultural products has been high for a number of years. It was high during the Labor government and it has continued to be high, particularly in beef markets across the world. But what has changed is that this government is making sure that our farmers have more access to overseas markets and that they can export the product that they want without uncertain and onerous restrictions from government policies and knee-jerk reactions. Of course, top of the list there is the live cattle trade. When you shut down an element of trade for a market you bring down prices. It is not very hard to work out. If you make it harder for people to sell their product overseas, they are going to get a lower price. People who have invested in that industry and have put their livelihoods on the line in Northern Australia in that industry were getting a lower price thanks to the Labor-Greens policies to shut down the live cattle trade in the last government. Since the election, in the live cattle market, we have opened up access to six more countries—or the Minister for Agriculture has got access to six more countries. He has access to Egypt, Bahrain, Iran, Cambodia, Thailand and Lebanon. A report was released the other week and we have 99 per cent compliance with the ESCAS. I do recognise that the Labor Party brought that system in, but only after much prodding because of the disastrous decision to shut down the live cattle trade. But there has been a 99 per cent compliance rate. What other industry could claim that? It is actually more than 99 per cent, but I am using that as a round figure. There has been a 99 per cent compliance rate with the ESCAS. 


Of course we have also signed trade agreements with three countries that have given substantially more access to beef: Korea, Japan and China. In Korea, our beef tariffs will be gone after 15 years, and we are no longer disadvantaged relative to the US, whereas before, if we had not signed that agreement, each year we were getting worse and worse relative to the US and we would have lost Korean markets. In the Japanese market, which still remains our biggest market—I think the US is actually going to beat it this year, but that is because of their drought—we have had tariffs fall by 20 per cent in just the last two weeks. They fell from 38.5 per cent for both chilled and fresh beef to 30.5 per cent for frozen beef and 32.5 per cent for fresh beef. That is a 20 per cent reduction for our farmers. That helps them get better prices.


We have had better access to horticulture as well. We have got table grapes into Japan and Korea for the first time. Our first shipment of mangoes to the US has left in the last couple of weeks. Our focus has been on making sure we can get more money into the back pockets of our farmers, because we know that if we do that they will have more confidence to invest in their region, they will have more confidence to employ people in their region and more money gets spun around the town, around the community. A lot of these communities have been doing it very tough both because of those low beef prices that I spoke about earlier and because of the drought. The drought does remain in many areas, but at least we are not creating a government induced drought here for our farm sector by turning our backs on the failed policies of the former government.


There is much more to do here. We have a lot more plans to make sure we have a stronger agricultural sector in this country. Getting prices up was a prerequisite, because if prices had not increased we could not make any more investments in agriculture. No-one would be willing to do that if prices were at record lows. If prices stayed at that $1.60 per kilo we would not have any need to invest in dams or new ports or rail lines, because there would be no need to use that infrastructure with prices so low. No-one would be able to make a buck growing a beast on grass—they would not bother doing it. So we have got those prices up now and we can take the next step and make further investments in infrastructure. That is why I am very happy that last week the Nationals had our first party room meeting for the year. We had it in Wodonga on the Murray. At that meeting we discussed a number of things that we think we need to do for regional Australia. Two of the four priorities we chose are more investment in regional Australia, one of which is to create some real funding to build dams in this country and the other is to introduce stronger competition laws to protect farmers and small businesses from the large supermarket chains. Both of those things can help give a further shot in the arm to our farming sector, because we know there are so many water resources in this country.


The area where I live, the Fitzroy Basin, is the largest catchment on the eastern seaboard. More water goes out from the Fitzroy River to the Pacific Ocean than any other river in Australia; yet it only really has one major dam in its system, the Fairbairn Dam at Emerald. There are other sites for dams that have environmental approval already or environmental approval is not far away. There is the Connors River Dam into the north of Rockhampton, the Nathan Dam to the south-west of Gladstone and the Urannah Dam further up closer to Mackay in the Burdekin catchment. But there is lots of potential in Central Queensland for further investment in dams that will allow people to invest in more intensive irrigated agriculture so that they can fatten more cattle and make more money for our country.


We also need those stronger laws for small businesses and farmers to make sure they have the confidence that they can make a return, because no-one is going to invest in farming in this nation unless they can make a buck doing it. That is why we put our sole focus on making sure we get farmers' profitability up before we start talking about their productivity. In my view, there has been far too much concentration in agricultural policy in this country on just making farmers do better and run faster without being able to make more money. There is no point in investing in ways to become more productive unless you can make more money from it. That is why our focus has been on getting prices up and costs down for farmers, boosting their profits so that we can have a stronger agricultural sector in this country—an agricultural sector that has a positive outlook—and it can provide more jobs, employment and investment for communities in regional Australia.
