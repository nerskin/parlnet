"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-09,"—We have here a motion proposing the exemption of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Bill 2002 and the Venture Capital Bill 2002 from the provisions of standing order 111, which means the cut-off, so that they can presumably be debated this week. This is an abuse of the spirit of that part of the standing orders which gives the Senate time to adequately look at the legislation and consult with the wider electorate, and which allows the Senate to use the cut-off for matters that are urgent or important to the governance of the country and which are beyond the minister's ability to get to this Senate in due time for debate. That is not the case here.

(14)	Schedule 2, item 124, page 68 (line 22), omit “this section”, substitute “subsection (1)”.
(15)	Schedule 2, item 124, page 68 (after line 30), after section 151BUAA, insert:
151BUAAA  Minister to give direction to Commission about Telstra's wholesale operations and retail operations
	(1)	The Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that a special Telstra direction is given within 6 months after the commencement of this section.
	(2)	For the purposes of this section, a special Telstra direction is a direction under section 151BUAA that:
	(a)	relates to Telstra's wholesale operations and retail operations; and
	(b)	requires the Commission to exercise its powers under section 151BU to make rules requiring Telstra to:
	(i)	keep and retain particular records; and
	(ii)	prepare reports consisting of information contained in those records; and
	(iii)	give those reports to the Commission; and
	(c)	requires the Commission to exercise its powers under at least one of sections 151BUDA, 151BUDB and 151BUDC in relation to those reports.
	(3)	Before giving a special Telstra direction in compliance with subsection (1), the Minister must:
	(a)	publish a draft of the direction and invite people to make submissions to the Minister on the draft direction; and
	(b)	consider any submissions that are received within the time limit specified by the Minister when he or she published the draft direction.
	(4)	This section does not, by implication, limit the Minister's powers to give subsequent directions to the Commission in relation to Telstra's wholesale operations and retail operations.
	(5)	In this section:
Telstra has the same meaning as in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991.
wholesaleoperations includes operations in relation to services that Telstra supplies:
	(a)	to itself; or
	(b)	to other persons, in order that the other persons can provide carriage services and/or content services.
The amendments are designed to improve the proposed accounting separation framework to require that all reasonable steps be taken to ensure that a special Telstra direction is given within six months of the commencement of the bill. A special Telstra direction is one that relates to Telstra's wholesale and retail operations and it requires the ACCC to exercise its powers to make rules requiring Telstra to keep and retain particular records, prepare reports based on these records and deliver the reports to the ACCC. The amendments also set out the procedure that must be followed before the minister can make a special Telstra direction: the minister must publish the draft of the direction, invite people to make submissions on the draft direction within the specified time limit and consider any submissions that are received, before making the direction. The amendments also clarify that the minister may only give a direction that requires the ACCC to exercise its powers under sections 151BU, 151BUDA, 151BUDB and 151BUDC or that requires the ACCC exercise its powers under those sections in a particular way. This means that the minister would not be able to give a direction to the ACCC not to exercise its powers under those sections. The amendments also enable the minister to give a written direction to the ACCC requiring it to prepare a specified kind of analysis of the report and to publish the analysis within a specified period after receiving the report. 
To enable matters in an instrument to be incorporated by reference, one of the amendments amends section 589 of the Telecommunications Act to allow instruments made under parts XIB and XIC of the Trade Practices Act to apply, adopt or incorporate provisions of any act, instrument or other writing as enforced or existing at a particular time or from time to time. This will allow ministerial direction in relation to accounting separation to refer to the regulatory accounting framework enforced from time to time. The government's amendments will also refine the proposed preselection provisions so that the ACCC makes the threshold decision on which services should be preselectable, but the ACA is responsible for implementation, including technical matters. This refines the proposed preselection amendments in the bill to provide that the ACCC specifies which services should be subject to preselection, but the ACA determines the preselection requirements for those services, including exemptions from the requirements. The amendments also provide a right to seek merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal in relation to access disputes that were notified to the ACCC before the introduction of the bill in the House of Representatives on 26 September last.
The proposed amendments include some minor technical amendments. One is an amendment to ensure that provisions relating to the expiry time of ex-ante class exemptions and individual ex-ante exemptions are similar—that is, so that an expiry time of an exemption order:
... may be described by reference to the end of a period beginning when the service or proposed service becomes an active declared service.
Another amendment provides two provisions relating to ex-ante undertakings, proposed sections 152CBA and 152CBF, to make it clear that the reference to `act of declared service' is to declaration in the ordinary sense under proposed section 152AL(3), not the deemed declaration that results from the proposals in the bill, proposed section 152AL(7). Another amendment to proposed section 152AL(7) clarifies that if a special access undertaking is subject to limitations then the service specified in the undertaking is deemed to be a declared service—and therefore subject to the standard access obligations—only to the extent to which the service falls within the scope of the limitations.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—These amendments are predominantly technical in nature and strengthen the provisions of the Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002. I would like to make a few comments about the range of amendments contained in this group. Items (1) to (5) modify the new preselection arrangements so that, whilst responsibility for declaring which services are subjected to preselection will be given to the ACCC, the ACA will be responsible for determining the technical requirements for preselection. Item (6) is a technical drafting amendment. Item (7) allows for the merits review of access arbitrations that were notified before 26 September, the date of the bill's introduction to parliament. This amendment satisfies a key concern identified by Labor senators in the minority Senate report on the bill. Under the current bill, arbitrations currently on foot with the ACCC would lose their ACT merits review appeal rights and this amendment ensures that parties involved in these arbitrations would retain these rights. This was a particular concern to Seven, who had ongoing arbitrations in relation to pay TV, of which I understand there were two outstanding. Labor support this amendment fully, having already advocated it, and if the government had not moved the amendment then we certainly would have. 
Items (8), (9), (10), (11) and (12) are technical amendments, and items (13), (14) and (15) amend the accounting separation provisions of the bill. Labor reflected on these in our minority report, and this is an appropriate opportunity to restate the concerns we have that this bill is generally a weak response to the recommendations contained in the Productivity Commission report. We expressed our concern and surprise at that at the time of hearing about this bill in committee. We will be supporting the bill nonetheless, on the basis that Labor will continue to develop our responses and policies as far as accounting separation for Telstra goes.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—I want to briefly note that the Democrats will be supporting these amendments and also, like Senator Lundy, note that we particularly support amendment (7), which is to grandfather two arbitrations under way currently which involve the Seven Network, a matter on which we had made representations to the government prior to this debate.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I rise to indicate that One Nation will support the government's amendments, and I would like to make some general comments in relation to the Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002 and its proposal to change sections of the act. These proposed changes originally were designed to encourage foreign and domestic companies to compete with Telstra in the domestic market. However, following the release of the Productivity Commission's report, the government to a large degree initially ignored the report and tended to focus on the complaints of Singapore Telecom, Optus, New Zealand AAPT, MCT and Primus. As a result, One Nation believes that the original proposals put forward by the government would have left Telstra exposed in the market in a way that would not be in the best interests of Australia. Subsequently, Telstra has held considerable consultation with the government, and the government, as we see here today, is bringing in a considerable group of amendments to the bill in its original form.
One Nation does have concerns with some of the proposals by both the Labor Party and the Democrats to alter the bill in such a way that would require Telstra to give an unfair competitive advantage to those other competitors. Let me explain it this way: if the Labor and Democrat amendments are successful, they will require Telstra to provide to the public arena some areas that are more profitable than others. Their proposal would allow the competitors to be able to select, based on Telstra's data, the areas that they should concentrate on and then, to a degree, leave Telstra to carry the more unproductive areas. I believe that that is not in the best interests of Australia. It is in the best interests of keeping Telstra as a government majority owned entity. I believe that ultimately, if the Labor amendments and the Democrat amendments were to succeed, we would end up with a situation where Telstra could in all probability lose its market dominance and, to some degree, be exposed to being taken over by overseas interests. I do not believe that is in the best interests of Australia as a nation, both from a security point of view and purely from the point of Telstra returning to the government a considerable amount of revenue.
So One Nation places on the record very clearly that we will be supporting the government's amendments and the bill but will be opposing both Labor's and the Democrats' amendments. We believe that they would undo, to a large degree, Telstra's input and the work that Telstra has been able to achieve by convincing the government of the dangers of allowing the other market players to have unfettered access to Telstra's profit margins, its statistics and the like. Finally, I place clearly on the record that One Nation is supporting the government's bill and the government amendments in the form that the government puts them forward.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—Labor opposes the section of the Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002 removing the requirements of carriers to produce industry development plans. Carriers are currently required to present industry development plans to the minister, summaries of which are then made public. This enables the minister, the parliament and the public to scrutinise the industry development performance of carriers. While Labor acknowledges that these reports can be burdensome for some smaller carriers, simply removing these provisions altogether is unacceptable. It is appropriate that carriers, particularly Telstra, be encouraged to remain accountable in regard to their industry development plans. The core of these provisions should remain, so as to ensure the industry development plans of the major carriers can be monitored. I foreshadow Labor's support of the next amendment, which does remove an additional burden for future carriers in relation to the preparation of an industry development plan. I will speak to that in more detail later, but is our intention to support the follow-on amendment for this, which further clarifies the role that future smaller carriers can play. That amendment will be moved by the government, and the opposition will be supporting it.
In general, industry development is an issue very important to the federal Labor opposition. It is something in which I have been involved in relation to information technology for a long time and it relates directly to the telecommunications industry. It should come as no surprise in the current public debate about the relative status of the information communication technology trade deficit in this country that Australia would be well suited and far better off if we were able to improve our exports in relation to our imports in the area of ICT. It would be the most inappropriate time to reduce or remove any accountability requirements for telecommunications carriers to state what they are doing in relation to industry development in ICT. A brief history lesson shows how crucial Telstra, in particular, has been to the growth and formation of many Australian companies and the growth of their capability—particularly in telecommunications technologies. Taking into account the sheer size of Telstra, I have no doubt that, as it and other carriers grow, their purchasing power in the Australian marketplace will have a directly determinant effect on the health of our local indigenous ICT sector.
This amendment is to prevent a watering down of those commitments. We believe that industry development plans should stay and that we should continue to be able to scrutinise the larger carriers—in particular, Telstra's purchasing plans and what they contribute to industry development in this country. I should add that—as stories emerge from time to time about the plans and intentions, alleged and otherwise, of Telstra to source a growing number of services and technology from overseas, including outsourcing various aspects of their own IT to other places—it is a really important issue. I would like to know the government's thoughts about the need to retain that level of accountability as far as industry development goes.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—I think there was probably a time when IDPs had some relevance, although some might have argued even then that they were largely cosmetic because, whilst indicating areas in which the company's performance should be specified in the plan, they essentially left it on a `best endeavours' basis. In other words, the companies indicated their proposed levels of R&D and what they hoped to achieve in other areas, but there was never any suggestion that they would be compelled to do things which did not make sense or which were quite uneconomic. The IDP provided a measure of visibility as to their plans, rather than our simply not having a clue what they might be up to or what their intentions were. Having that in front of you does not detract from the criticism that ultimately it does not make a great deal of difference. 
The Productivity Commission found no compelling arguments for continuing with IDPs, on the basis that larger carriers are well aware of local capabilities and will continue to use local industry for cost and efficiency reasons. Smaller carriers are either resellers or carriers serving a limited or regional market and would have a limited impact on the local equipment industry. IDPs may act as a barrier to entry. Firms will be asked to comply with the principles set out in the Australian industry participation framework run by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. This framework provides full, fair and reasonable access in the preparation of Australian industry development plans to maximise opportunities for suppliers and the development of industry. The government continues to support Australian ICT industry development through its endorsed supplier arrangement. In this regard, on 21 June 2002, the government released its voluntary procurement and strategic industry development guidelines to encourage its suppliers to undertake strategic activities in Australia in areas including R&D, exports, investments, SME alliances, skill development and technology transfer.
It comes down to this: if the Labor Party really only has Telstra in mind, it may as well come out and say what it will require Telstra to do. However, if it says that it should apply to the industry generally, it has to accept that these decisions are often made globally. If there is an unnecessary degree of paperwork involved in complying with what is essentially a feelgood exercise, they take that very much into account in deciding where to locate for all sorts of levels of activity. We have to get the balance right. We should not for a moment be out there saying that none of these things matters. We should be reminding them that quite often there is a mutual benefit to be derived. But to go beyond that and to force them to do things which they just do not think are commercial is not a good idea. I presume that Labor agrees with that. The halfway position is to get them to spell out plans in great detail and usually to engage consultants and others to prepare them so that everyone can feel a bit better about them. That is a much more significant burden on SMEs than it is on an organisation like Telstra. At the end of the day we would be better off having the resources of all concerned applied to competing in the marketplace rather than simply complying with red-tape requirements which ultimately will make no difference to commercial outcomes.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—The Democrats also will be moving to delete from the bill the provisions relating to industry development plans. The bill seeks to enact the Productivity Commission's recommendation to scrap the requirement that a carrier develop and report against industry development plans. The Democrats oppose the removal of this requirement. We note the commission's conclusion that it could find no compelling argument for continuing industry development plans, because commitments, apart from R&D, were formerly voluntary, and benefits including information on industry-wide investment and product development are not really part of the instrument. But, while we accept these arguments to a degree, in our view the appropriate course is not to scrap the plans but to re-evaluate and streamline the criteria. In particular, we believe that the plans should focus on R&D and technology transfer issues. Accordingly, we will look carefully at future legislation that sets out to improve the strategic focus of plans. I note that on 21 June the minister outlined streamlined ICT industry development arrangements. Whilst some of those measures are welcome and clearly overlap with the elements and scope of IDPs, we do not see them as a replacement.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I rise again to indicate that One Nation will oppose the Labor and Democrat amendments. Part 2 of schedule 1, as the minister has said, refers to the production of industry development plans. I believe that both Labor and the Democrats are very much out of step with the industry position. I would be very interested to hear from both the shadow minister and Senator Cherry how they relate their position to a letter that I assume they also have received from Optus. I will quote it verbatim. It is a very short letter and it is dated 3 December 2002, so it is relevant. It states: 
Dear Senator Harris
The Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002 is due to be debated in the Senate today or tomorrow. Optus supports the Bill.
I write to urge you to vote against a likely Labor amendment.
One provision in the Bill would remove the regulatory burden imposed on carriers to develop and report against Industry Development Plans (IDPs).
Optus and other telcos collectively spend billions of dollars each year on goods and services purchased from Australian industry. IDPs do not change what we do—they are simply a time consuming and costly regulatory burden.
For this reason, removal of IDPs was recommended by the Productivity Commission, in its inquiry into the Telecommunications Competition Regime.
Removing IDPs is particularly important for Telstra's competitors. Telstra is four times the size of its largest competitor, Optus. It earns three quarters of industry revenues and 95% of industry profits. This means that regulatory burdens like the IDP fall much more heavily on players like Optus than they do on Telstra.
Optus understands that Labor will move to delete this provision.
Optus believes the provision should be retained—and IDPs removed.
I therefore urge you to vote against Labor's amendment.
There we have from Optus the inference that other telcos are in agreement with them and that they want the government's amendment retained to remove the necessity to do IDPs. As they say, they spend billions of dollars a year purchasing goods and services within Australia, and IDPs have no effect on them and do not improve the situation whatsoever. IDPs actually create a greater burden on the smaller players. It is quite logical if you work out the arithmetic: if Telstra has to produce an IDP from 75 per cent of the funds in the market, there is a relative cost per unit to it. Then we have all the other players who have to produce their IDPs—exactly the same as Telstra—from 25 per cent of the remaining value of the market. So the cost per unit on all of the other players is, disproportionately, three times greater. When you have Optus writing to senators, asking us to support the government's position—that is, to remove IDPs—I find it quite perplexing that the Labor Party and the Democrats are moving to remove them. I place it on the record that One Nation will oppose the Labor and Democrat amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I would like to clarify a point. I do not know whether I moved the opposition amendments, but I would like to do so.
 (Senator Ferguson)—No, you have not yet, Senator Lundy. The question is that part 2 of schedules 1 and 3 stand as printed, so it is not an amendment.
—Thank you for that clarification. For the benefit of Senator Harris, I would like again to clarify Labor's position. Labor are taking this position on this aspect of the bill because we want to maintain industry development plans, not because we want to remove them.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—I think I understood Senator Harris's point to be that he is not aware of anyone in the industry these days who sees much virtue in retaining IDPs. He is really citing Optus as a classic example. But I think he is also saying that you will find a lot of smaller players as well who hold the same view that these might have been relevant once upon a time, but who say: `Who is in favour of them now apart from those who earn a living out of bureaucracy?'",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I concur with what the minister is saying. The industry wants the bill to stand as it is printed. If the Labor and Democrat amendments are passed, that will defeat the section of the bill that will remove the requirement of the industry to produce IDPs. Clearly, the industry—and this is the position of Optus—have said that they do not see any value in the IDPs. It does not impact on how they provide their service and it does not impact on the goods that they purchase. Generally speaking, it covers a five-year period. As everybody knows today, the telecommunication industry is a moving feast, so what is relative this year, when these companies will spend millions of dollars to produce the IDPs for the next five years, may be totally irrelevant in 12 months time because of the changes in the industry. This is what the industry is saying: it wants the burdensome requirement to produce the IDPs removed. That is why One Nation supports the government's position.

Accepting the Senate's decision to retain the requirement for IDPs, the government remains concerned that the requirement for IDPs may act as a barrier to market entry, particularly for smaller carriers. Currently, applicants for a carrier licence must prepare an initial IDP in order to obtain a carrier licence, but thereafter they may fall within a category of exemptions as declared by the minister. This is a disallowable instrument subject to scrutiny by the parliament. The current exemptions are for small carriers with a total annual revenue of less than $5 million and with an annual capital expenditure of less than $20 million, and for carriers whose services are primarily to research or educational institutions. 
Accordingly, the government proposes a further amendment that will improve the current process by allowing the ACA to issue exemption certificates to an applicant or a carrier where it is satisfied that the applicant or carrier would be or is an exempt carrier as declared by the minister. This will facilitate market entry by smaller carriers by removing an unnecessary administrative step saving time and money for both the applicant and the taxpayer. We welcome Labor's support.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—As the minister has said, this amendment makes some improvement to the operation of the industry development plan reporting exemptions for smaller carriers. Labor has been convinced in this circumstance that it is a sensible change to the act. Currently, the ACA can exempt smaller carriers from preparing industry development plans. As the minister said, carriers in this category include those with revenue below $5 million and capital expenditure below $20 million. This amendment further strengthens the provisions to ensure that these smaller carriers do not have to prepare such reports prior to being issued with a carrier licence, so it increases the consistency within the act. I think this will help reduce the regulatory costs and burdens on the smaller start-up carriers, because after all we are all about encouraging competition.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—The Democrats will also be supporting this amendment, and we note that it has been developed after discussions between the government and the other parties. It allows the ACA to provide exemptions for small prospective carriers to provide IDPs when they are seeking a licence. This makes the exemption provisions consistent with those that apply to existing carriers. The exemptions will be set out in a ministerial instrument and the current thresholds are expected to total annual revenue below $5 million and annual capital expenditure below $20 million. A further category of exempted carriers covers those whose services primarily relate to research or educational institutions. The Democrats understand that as a consequence there will be around 15 to 25 IDPs, including renewals, requiring approval by the minister each year. We further note that the proposed new section 15A, subsections (4) to (7) inclusive, provides for the ACA to verify that prospective and current carriers meet and continue to meet the conditions of the exemptions as determined. These are prudent amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—Obviously, we have an interesting situation where both Labor and the Democrats have decided, to a large degree, who will and who will not have to develop IDPs. It is also interesting that, based on the figures that we have been given, Optus is not one of those mentioned. So there again, we have a situation where the two main players in the industry, Telstra and Optus, are stuck with this burdensome requirement to provide industry development plans. Telstra has indicated that they have no impact on the service it provides and they have no impact on any purchases that they make within Australia. In their letter dated 3 December, Optus have clearly set out exactly the same, and yet there is the situation where Optus and Telstra now—effectively as of this minute—have to produce their industry development plans. If the amendment before us is successful, the minister will have the ability to exempt a licensed carrier, and it has been indicated to the chamber that there is going to be a numerical cap on that. My question to Labor is: when Telstra and Optus, because of the unfair market advantage of other carriers and because they are losing their market place, are required to lay off staff, how is the Labor Party going to convey to their union members that they were partially responsible for creating that situation? ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I am tempted to respond to that. Senator Harris tries to imply that somehow this will deprive Telstra and Optus staff of their jobs. We are dealing with an amendment which is quite technical. It means that smaller carriers who would not otherwise be eligible to provide an IDP are not required, in preparation of becoming a carrier, to provide an industry development plan in advance of that process. This amendment is about reducing the red tape for the applications of smaller carriers for their carrier licences. We are not talking about doing away with jobs. I have a great deal of trouble in trying to reconcile Senator Harris's comments with the amendment before us.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—by leave—I move amendments (2) to (6) on sheet 2752:
(2)	Schedule 2, item 10, page 16 (lines 12 to 20), omit subsection (4), substitute:
Extension of expiry date
	(4)	The Commission may, by notice published in the Gazette, extend or further extend the expiry date of a specified declaration under section 152AL, so long as the extension or further extension is for a period of not more than 5 years.
(3)	Schedule 2, item 10, page 16 (after line 27), at the end of section 152ALA, add:
Public inquiry during 12-month period ending on the expiry date of a declaration
	(7)	The Commission must:
	(a)	during the 12-month period ending on the expiry date of a declaration, hold a public inquiry under Part 25 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 about:
	(i)	whether to extend or further extend the expiry date of the declaration; and
	(ii)	whether to revoke the declaration; and
	(iii)	whether to vary the declaration; and
	(iv)	whether to allow the declaration to expire without making a new declaration under section 152AL; and
	(v)	whether to allow the declaration to expire and then to make a new declaration under section 152AL; and
	(b)	prepare a report about the inquiry under section 505 of the Telecommunications Act 1997; and
	(c)	publish the report during the 180-day period ending on the expiry date of the first-mentioned declaration.
	(8)	If:
	(a)	after holding a public inquiry under subsection (7) in relation to a declaration, the Commission allows the declaration to expire and then makes a new declaration under section 152AL; and
	(b)	the report mentioned in paragraph (7)(b) was published during the 180-day period ending when the new declaration was made;
the Commission is taken to have complied with paragraphs 152AL(3)(a), (b) and (c) in relation to the new declaration. 
	(9)	If:
	(a)	after holding a public inquiry under subsection (7) in relation to a declaration, the Commission revokes or varies the declaration; and
	(b)	the report mentioned in paragraph (7)(b) was published during the 180-day period ending at the time of the revocation or variation;
the Commission is taken to have complied with paragraphs 152AL(3)(a), (b) and (c) in relation to the revocation or variation (as those paragraphs apply to the power of revocation and variation because of subsection 152AO(1)).
(4)	Schedule 2, item 11, page 16 (line 29), omit “152ALA(4)(b)”, substitute “152ALA(7)(a)”.
(5)	Schedule 2, item 12, page 17 (line 2), omit “152ALA(4)(b)”, substitute “152ALA(7)(a)”.
(6)	Schedule 2, item 13, page 17 (line 4), omit “152ALA(4)(b)”, substitute “152ALA(7)(a)”.
The purpose of these amendments is to require that the ACCC make a deliberate decision concerning the ending of a declaration rather than simply allowing it to lapse as a result of a sunset mechanism provided for in schedule 2, item 10 of the bill. Amendment (2) allows the ACCC to extend or further extend the expiry date of a declaration for a period of up to five years. That means that a declaration could be for 10 years, as desired by the opposition, if the ACCC has conducted a public inquiry halfway through. Amendment (3) requires the ACCC to conduct a public inquiry within 12 months of the expiry date of a declaration. The inquiry will consider whether to extend or further extend the expiry date of the declaration, revoke the declaration, vary the declaration, allow the declaration to expire without making a new declaration or allow the declaration to expire and then make a new declaration.
In respect of amendment (3), subclauses (7)(b) and (7)(c) require the ACCC to prepare and publish the report within 180 days of the expiry of the first declaration. This period is consistent with other public inquiry provisions. Subclauses (8) and (9) seek to streamline the possible workload of the ACCC by removing the obligation to conduct a second inquiry to meet its obligations under 152AL(3)(a), (b) or (c) if it has carried out the process outlined in subclause (7). It does that by allowing that, if the ACCC has conducted a public inquiry and decides to allow a declaration to expire but then makes a new declaration, or decides to revoke or vary the declaration, and the ACCC report of the public inquiry was published within 180 days, then the ACCC is deemed to have made a public inquiry for the purposes of 152AL(3)(a), (b) or (c). Amendments (4), (5) and (6) are technical amendments to update references in items 11, 12 and 13 in schedule 2 of the bill which will change as a result of amendment (3).
I note that the opposition have proposed an amendment concerning the duration of declarations which is in conflict with our amendments. As I have already indicated, we will not be supporting the opposition's amendment. If our amendments are successful then the opposition might decide not to move theirs, in which case we would like to put a few comments about the opposition's amendment on the record. Whilst we acknowledge the rationale that 10 years provides greater certainty for investors for the duration of declarations, we question whether this is appropriate for all declarations. Clearly there will be circumstances where 10 years is appropriate. However, some services might not warrant such a length of time due to technological change or declarations in similar services. In any event, our amendments specifically provide for a 10-year declaration if the ACCC determines in the fifth year that an extension is so warranted.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—The Democrats' amendments modify the operation of the new provisions for the automatic expiry date of declarations every five years. The amendments ensure that the ACCC must, by way of a public inquiry, make a positive decision about whether to extend, revoke or vary a declaration during the 12-month period prior to the five-year declaration expiry date. Under the original bill, the ACCC needed to hold a public inquiry only if they wished to extend the declaration. If the declaration automatically expires or is varied, there is no provision for any hearing at all. We will be opposing the Democrats' amendments. 
We are opposed to the automatic expiry of a declaration after five years, as we feel that this period is too short to provide for industry and regulatory certainty. For instance, the Senate inquiry received evidence pointing to the fact that many commercial contracts in the communications industries extend beyond five years. It would also mean that the ACCC is bogged down in constant regulatory reviews of access declarations. In any case, the ACCC has the power to revoke declarations that have become outdated, as happened with the AMPS service under the current access regime. Whilst I think that the Democrats' amendments are well intentioned, in effect they further increase the burden on the ACCC to hold regular inquiries regarding access declarations.
I foreshadow Labor's amendment to extend the sunset period for access declarations to 10 years. Labor feels that this provides a far more sensible solution to this dilemma. It is a simple amendment that accepts the government's premise that access declarations need a defined expiry period, but it provides for a period more acceptable to the general terms of contracts that occur in the industry, and I think it is more appropriate for the efficient regulatory oversight of the industry.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—Senator Lundy has spoken to these amendments and the following amendment. We take the view that the Democrats' approach is not just well intentioned but is sensible policy. We understand that stakeholders want to have their views explicitly considered before the ACCC makes its decision. We therefore agree with Senator Lundy that automatic expiry after five years is no longer sufficient. We certainly oppose the extension to 10 years. Given the dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry and rapid changes in technology, five years is a more appropriate period than 10 years, particularly given that contracts in the telecommunications sector generally run for around three to five years. I think that means that the Democrats and the government are in agreement on these amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I indicate to the chamber that it is obvious that the Democrats have the support of the government on these particular amendments. The concern that I have with these amendments, first of all, is that we are extending or giving the possibility to extend a declaration. Senator Lundy raised the issue that some of the contracts for people accessing these services have been written for up to seven years. I understand the reason for that: if they are going to go to a major movie house and make a commitment to purchasing programming over a long period, they are going to need an applicable amount of time to have the surety to be able to deliver those movies through that carrier service, whoever that may be. But the point is that they have entered into these seven-year contracts knowing full well that the declaration is for only five years. They have entered into a commercial contract for seven years, knowing that there is only security there for five years. So, having done that, they have made an economic and strategic decision. Therefore, I believe that has no bearing on the length of period of the declaration.
I have two concerns. I ask the minister: if the ACCC does extend the period of a declaration—in other words, if it carries forward the legal requirements for access for a person—does the actual carrier have a right of appeal or is the ACCC decision to extend final? That is one issue. The other issue that causes me great concern is that we have amendments proposed by the Labor Party where the intent is to remove the minister's ability to give a direction to the ACCC. So these two are linked. If the chamber passes these amendments—and it appears that it will—the concern I have is whether the carrier who has a legal contract that was previously five years has a right of appeal against the ACCC. Also, provided the Labor amendments are successful, will the minister still have a right to give a direction to the ACCC?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—I think the position is that we fully understand the importance of the players and all of the stakeholders having their views properly considered but, at the end of the day, we think it is more appropriate that the ACCC makes that decision rather than government. So, if the public inquiry provides that opportunity, we do not think it is appropriate for the government to come in over the top of the ACCC and contradict it, in effect. The government would always have the ability to legislate a different position, but that is not what we think is the best approach here. We prefer the Democrats' amendments, which require the public hearing and then provide the basis on which the ACCC can make a decision about an extension of the declaration, rather than the government itself doing that. At the end of the day, you can always appeal everything, but these are considered judgments that have to be made, and we think that the ACCC is in a better position to do that and have its objectivity unquestioned. If it is done by the government, then often it is seen to be for someone's benefit or not for someone else's benefit. We would rather take that tension out of the system wherever possible.

—As stated in our speech in the second reading debate, Labor have concerns about the ministerial power of direction under the new special anticipatory access provisions. There is a major difference between the new special anticipatory arrangements and the existing ordinary access arrangements. The new special anticipatory category requires the ACCC to take into account the views of the minister by disallowable instrument in determining whether or not to grant anticipatory access undertakings or exemptions. To ensure legislative parity between special, or anticipatory, and ordinary undertakings and exemption provisions, Labor's amendments remove the ministerial power of directions under the new special anticipatory access provisions.
Given the current controversy over the Foxtel-Optus content sharing deal, it is important that the government ensures that access arrangements legislated for anticipatory services are the same as those for existing ordinary services. The ACCC should continue to use the long-term interests of end users test to guide its access decisions. The ACCC should not be subject to undue political interference. It must be left to do its job. I would like to quote the minister from a few minutes ago in this debate. He stated himself that he would rather see the ACCC's objectivity `unquestioned' in relation to ministerial direction. I look forward to the government's support in relation to this amendment. 
I believe Labor's amendments will ease concerns that the regulator could be influenced by the short-term political considerations of the minister rather than using the existing long-term interests of end users test, as is currently the case for ordinary access decisions. I think this very important amendment is worthy of support as it will strengthen the anticipatory access provisions, which Labor supports in principle. I would be interested to hear what other parties have to say, and I would like to make a few more comments before we conclude this aspect of the debate.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—Just to be clear, we are not in any shape or form suggesting that the minister ought to be able to override the clear objects of the act, which of course include the long-term interests of end users. To the extent that the minister is able to give the ACCC any guidance, it will simply be in the context of making it aware of the government's views and asking the ACCC to take them into account. That is pretty harmless stuff. It is really just saying: `This is what we think; have a good look at it.' Otherwise, it might be unaware of some matters. None of us have perfect information from all sources, and this is simply designed to provide the ACCC with that level of awareness.
I want to make it clear that the minister will not be able to direct the ACCC to take into account matters that it could not in any case have regard to in deciding whether to approve an ex ante undertaking or grant an ex ante exemption. Nor will the minister be able to direct the ACCC to give particular weight to a matter notified in the minister's instrument. The proposed formal notification procedure will provide a transparent and accountable statutory mechanism for the minister to bring particular matters to the ACCC's attention. The minister's notification is also subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—The Democrats will be supporting these opposition amendments. The legislation extends the ACCC's powers by enabling it to deal with access issues before an investment is made. This is consistent with how it currently deals with access arrangements after the infrastructure is established. However, there is one notable difference between the new anticipatory access arrangements and existing access arrangements. The new anticipatory arrangements require the ACCC to take into account the views of the minister in determining whether or not to grant anticipatory access undertakings or exemptions. These views are intended to be put as a disallowable instrument. I take on board the minister's statement that his policy statements are `pretty harmless'. I am sure that does not apply to the rest of the minister's portfolio—I am thinking about the possible appointment of a former minister to the ABC board, which would not be described as `pretty harmless' at all.
—Who? Gary Johns?
—I would describe Gary Johns as pretty harmless. There is an argument that such a provision as the ministerial policy statement in this area may lead to the politicisation of the ACCC's consideration of anticipatory access arrangements. The opposition's amendments ensure legislative parity between anticipatory and ordinary undertakings and exemption provisions. The Democrats are staunch defenders of the role of the ACCC and believe that a ministerial direction may impinge on its independence. Whilst we acknowledge that a disallowable instrument does allow for parliamentary scrutiny of a ministerial decision, on balance we feel there is no substantive reason why the current approach for ordinary undertakings should not be followed. As I noted previously, the Democrats welcomed the government's decision not to accept the Productivity Commission's recommendation about the long-term interests of end users or the LTIE test. We believe this remains the most appropriate general framework for the ACCC to consider anticipatory undertakings in. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I rise to indicate that One Nation will be opposing Labor amendments (R5), (6), (R7), (8), (R9) and (R10). We are doing this because the removal of the ministerial powers with respect to special access undertakings and exemptions would affect the integrity of a very important part of the entire bill. The government has quite rightly instituted a process whereby investors can approach the ACCC before they invest and seek assurances as to how they will be regulated. As part of this process, it is proposed that the minister can write to the ACCC and say that the ACCC needs to take into account a particular issue or policy objective when making a decision.
As a classic example of this we have seen pay TV companies run multiple cables down the same streets in the same cities and none of them is returning a profit on the investment. The government has correctly set out to allow a telecommunications carrier, prior to physically making the commitment of substantive funds to a particular project, to go to the ACCC and say, `This is what we are proposing to do; how would you allow our competitors access to this?' The proposal is that, before they invest the money, they have a reasonable understanding of how they are going to get a return on it. There is not a business anywhere in this world that does not require that certainty, whether it is for their shareholders' capital or their own capital from that particular company.
As part of the process in the amendments that Labor is proposing, the minister would not be able to go to the ACCC and say, `Telstra are going to run a fibre-optic cable out to Mount Isa but they need to know what return they are going to get on that investment.' So they would go to the ACCC and the ACCC would come back with a regime of access to that infrastructure that was not viable for Telstra. You are saying that the minister cannot go to the ACCC and say, `Based on the benefit of that cable being run out to Mount Isa, there are social and economic issues that you should take into account when you are allowing other access to it.' If the Labor amendments are passed, they will stop any telco from entering into a major project in a rural area because it will not have certainty as to how it would get a recovery on that investment. Most certainly the minister will not have the ability to go to the ACCC and say, `You have not taken this into consideration.' You are condemning rural Australia, from this point on, to staying with the present infrastructure, because nobody will go out and invest in those areas if they do not have the ability to go to the minister and say, `This is for social or economic reasons in the rural areas.' For those reasons One National believes it is absolutely critical that the ministerial powers be retained in this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I would like to clarify again what the amendments are about. The amendments are about removing the ministerial direction and what prevails is the long-term interest of end users test. It is very strange for the amendments to be presented in the way that Senator Harris has chosen to present them because, as I explained in my earlier comments, the intent of the bill overall is to make sure that carriers have the opportunity, through the anticipatory undertakings, to plan for the future. That is exactly the opposite of what Senator Harris is saying the amendments will do.
The amendments strengthen the provisions and remove the opportunity for what we are concerned about—political interference. The bill will have the effect of providing the anticipatory undertakings regime, which is what Senator Harris is passionately arguing is the core outcome of this bill. I think we need to acknowledge that rural and regional Australia is currently in dire need of support. The fact is that the infrastructure in rural and regional Australia, which effectively has been in the hands of a monopoly— Telstra's—for some time, is not getting better; it is actually getting worse. I think it would be a very positive outcome if the provisions of this bill were implemented so as to allow other competitors a far greater ability to determine the value of their investment in advance by determining anticipatory access undertakings.
I do not accept for a second the argument that to do such would undermine Telstra's position in the market and would make it less likely that Telstra will in fact make those investments. That does not follow, and it is not supported by the evidence that we have before us. For many years Telstra have been in a position to make the choice to invest in rural and regional Australia, and they have chosen not to. They have chosen not to in a way that has left rural and regional services not only depleted but deficient—knowingly so, as has been recently documented, albeit in a perhaps less strident way than it could have been, in the Estens report. I believe that there is probably even some genuine intent by the coalition government here to try to strengthen the competition regime with a view to encouraging alternative investors to Telstra and, through that, hopefully encouraging Telstra to make the sorts of investments necessary. 
I do not accept the argument, Senator Harris, that to remove ministerial direction lessens that; I actually think it strengthens that. You are arguing that ministerial direction would come by way of encouraging rural and regional investment and that not to have ministerial direction there would somehow undermine that. I think the opposite will occur. I think there is a potential risk that ministerial involvement will actually strengthen Telstra's position at the expense of competition—and that is my concern. So I think we are coming at this from a fundamentally different premise. I have alleged on many occasions that I think the government and Telstra are far too close and that indeed they work together to prop up Telstra's position in the market to the detriment of competition and services, particularly in rural and regional Australia. That is why we are moving these amendments, because we think that at this point in time political interference is moving in that direction. I accept where you are coming from if you are arguing the case that you believe ministerial direction actually strengthens competition and will in fact improve services in the bush. But, quite frankly, I think the evidence has shown us otherwise. I think we want to achieve the same thing— improving rural and regional services—but we are at odds over the role that ministerial direction will play. I think that is why you feel the way you do about our amendments, but I hope that clarifies our intent with this amendment. As an opposition we have more faith in the independence of the ACCC in using the long-term interests of end users test than we have in ministers involving themselves in the decision making of the ACCC. So I hope that clarifies your concerns about Labor's position.
I would like to go to another matter that relates to the impact that the anticipatory undertakings have on pay TV. It is worth while laying out for the Senate in committee a number of the major concerns expressed during the consideration of this bill and the inquiry into this bill. One of the major concerns expressed not just by the Seven Network but also by Fairfax included the implications of this bill for pay TV. What we found out, of course, was that the anticipatory undertakings and exemption provisions of this bill did have a direct impact at the time on the negotiations that were occurring in relation to the Foxtel-Optus content-sharing deal. In fact, the successful passage of this bill enabled a crucial part of the Foxtel-Optus content-sharing deal to occur. The crucial part was that these anticipatory undertakings are a prerequisite for Foxtel's willingness to digitise their pay TV network. I, as well as many parties, have certainly expressed serious concern about this, because it is only with the successful passage of this bill that Foxtel will have the opportunity to seek anticipatory exemptions under these provisions so as to create an environment— effectively a six-months access holiday or up to 100,000 subscribers upon the digitisation of the pay TV network.
The government and other parties have been asked to excise the aspects of this bill that would relate to pay TV. Labor have not seen it as being appropriate for us to do that at this time, primarily because the ACCC will have to go through that formal process of listening to the arguments presented by Foxtel as to whether or not those anticipatory exemptions should be granted to digitise their service. So there will effectively be an opportunity for the ACCC to decide whether or not they believe anticipatory exemptions are an appropriate condition for the digitisation of the pay TV network. Foxtel have made it clear that they do see them as a prerequisite, hence our concern that there appears to be a too-cute-by-half aspect to the negotiations on the part of Foxtel and certainly by Telstra, given that they own that hybrid fibre coaxial—HFC—pay TV network and given their involvement in Foxtel. The minister has said on the record: 
... I have requested the ACCC to report to me in January 2003 on the wider competition implications of emerging industry structures in the Pay TV sector, including implications for the telecommunications sector.
He has done this in the hope that this report will cast `further light on this issue'. Given the context of this bill providing the preconditions of the ACCC's formal contemplation of an exemption for a period of time or of set conditions for a future digitised Foxtel network, I would like to ask the minister about his key concerns over the emerging relationship between Telstra and the Foxtel network, particularly in the context of digitisation. I put it to you, Minister, that concerns have been expressed about Telstra's place in the pay TV market and that you yourself have commented about the concerns over that structure.
I ask the minister to give some assurance to the Senate that the structure of pay TV and its relationship with this bill will not in any way serve either to reduce competition in pay TV or to set in place unfair conditions in pay TV. Indeed, could the minister elucidate further his concerns about what he has called the implications of emerging industry structures in pay TV? I have to say that I interpret these as being concerns about new verticals and old verticals being re-established in the new digital pay TV regime, particularly when the regulatory authorities in most other jurisdictions around the world have sought to prevent a residual monopoly extending from telecommunications into other areas of carriage and infrastructure, such as pay TV. I would be very interested if you expressed your concerns, Minister, and provided the Senate with some assurance that this will not lead to any uncompetitive environment or suppression of true competition in our pay TV network, particularly the future digitised pay TV network.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—It looks as though we are going to miss out on lunch, so maybe I will spend a couple of minutes—
—If you are quick, you might not, Minister.
—I hope that is so, but I did see Senator Murray lurking and I suspect he will want more than his one minute of sunshine. The short answer to the question is this: I am indebted to Senator Lundy for effectively foreshadowing Labor's policy—a policy that has been a very badly kept secret in recent times—which is to force Telstra out of Foxtel. I think that is a very serious step to take, particularly in the absence of any evidence that it is uncompetitive. We will see what the ACCC has to say about these issues and it may well express a view on a desirable industry structure in terms of vertical integration. However, that is not to say one should assume that because of an apprehension you need to fundamentally destruct the current industry. Yet, that is what Labor is proposing to do. We know that, Senator Lundy, because we have been told by a number of people and, quite clearly, when the time comes there will be an almighty explosion, I can assure you.
This current provision, it must be understood, still requires a public inquiry. The ACCC still has to satisfy itself that any proposal is in the long-term interests of end users. There can be no suggestion of access holidays, special deals or backdoor assistance; it has to meet a test which is very transparent and visible. The advice which will be forthcoming—I hope we will have it by early next year; I have not asked to have it by next year; I would have asked to have had it quite some time ago—will address a number of issues which impact on the long-term future of the telecommunications and broadband industries. Things like video services will obviously be part and parcel of that. It may well address bundling; it may address the availability of new services; it may raise the need to ensure that there is full competition between HFC networks and the DSL networks. We know that Telstra is in both of those networks. I have made it plain that, if there is any indication that Telstra is running dead on DSL, we would take a very dim view. That is one thing; it is another thing to say that simply because they are in Foxtel and there is a possibility that they might act in a way that you disapprove of that would then justify a policy decision to excise them, presumably against their wishes and against the wishes of the shareholders in Telstra, not to mention the shareholders in the Foxtel consortium. That would be a very big step. So, we are ready for you when you finally make that announcement. In the meantime, we will see what the ACCC has to say. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—Senator Lundy is correct when she says that One Nation is very passionate about rural areas but that passion extends also to urban areas. Senator Lundy is wrong in her statement that Telstra has not been investing in the rural areas. Two years ago I did an extensive tour through Queensland and at well over 100 meetings the issue of Telstra's services was a major concern, yes. It was raised at each and every meeting during that tour around Queensland. This year I have been doing something similar and have had close to 50 meetings, at only two of which the issue of Telstra services in rural areas was raised. I would like to put very clearly on the record that I do not see any connection between people being satisfied with the service and making a commitment to privatise Telstra. I would not like to be misquoted in the media on that issue.
For example, the government has put in place a program in relation to Internet access in rural areas, which has been administered by Telstra. Through that program a person in a remote area can get satellite access or hardwired cable access. Telstra is working extremely hard in rural areas implementing that today. So the commitment has been made by Telstra to improve the service in rural areas.
I also believe that by removing the minister's direction we are removing part of the possibility of the Senate overseeing an ACCC decision. Senator Lundy quite clearly said that they believe that the decision should stay with the ACCC. I do not believe it should. I believe that the decisions made by the ACCC should be able to be challenged in this place or supported if they are correct. I ask the minister: is it correct that if you were to give a direction to the ACCC under this legislation then the ACCC decision would be a disallowable instrument? That is my understanding of the bill. If that is the case then what you are doing is removing the ability of the Senate to be able to oversee and scrutinise an ACCC decision. I will be corrected if I am wrong, but it is my understanding that if the minister were to give a direction to the ACCC it would become a disallowable instrument and therefore come to this place.
Senator Lundy said that she is focusing on competition. I understand exactly where Senator Lundy is coming from, but we need a very careful balance in this legislation. There are times when being driven purely by competition can be detrimental to providing a service. Senator Lundy gave pay TV as an example, where under a competition regime multiple providers have rolled out the same cables down the same streets or strung cables on the same telegraph poles, power poles or whatever they are to create an unsightly mess in some of our areas. I believe that if the industry had had the ability to sit down together, go before the ACCC and set out an access regime for one single set of infrastructure then they would be a lot better off today. That is the example that I give in relation to finding this balance between competition and providing infrastructure that has a social and economic benefit for the community. I look forward to the minister giving us some clarification in relation to that direction. I place very clearly on the record that I believe that, for the purpose of the government being able to say that the ACCC has got it wrong in relation to a question of national interest, the ministerial direction should remain.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—I think I understand Senator Harris's concerns; however, we do take the view that ultimately the ACCC should not be subject to direction. The provisions that we are canvassing are really a notice in advance requiring the ACCC to have regard to government concerns. That notice is a disallowable instrument but any decision of the ACCC is not. Most decisions of the ACCC can be taken to higher courts or tribunals under ADJR legislation and probably other legislation as well. In that way, I think the system does allow those who are not happy with the ultimate outcome to challenge it in the courts. From the government's point of view, we quite rightly say that we think it is important for the ACCC to be aware in advance of our concerns so that they are not acting in ignorance and so that they can properly have regard to them. That document, as you say, is disallowable. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-09,"—This is a complicated argument with good points on both sides. The Greens will be supporting the opposition amendments, effectively in opposition to this provision. There is always the opportunity for legislation to override a decision by the ACCC and there is always the opportunity for a ministerial statement to concentrate the ACCC's mind on what the government's concerns are. A disallowable instrument is not of itself adjustable, and that presents a difficulty. I take into account the minister's own words that the ACCC has a good track record and has the ability to look after the long-term interests of the end users under existing legislation.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-12-09,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. If it is not true that the minister will not rule out increasing the preservation age, why did the Treasurer state publicly on 7 August:
More flexible working arrangements, training and re-training, and raising the preservation age for superannuation would all be positive moves ...
That is the Treasurer's own public comment on 7 August 2002. How can the minister continue to evade and deny the Liberal government's plans to increase the superannuation preservation age?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Preservation Age</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-12-09,"—Thank you, Senator Sherry, for repeating the question of a couple of days ago. The government provides substantial tax concessions for superannuation in order to promote self-provision in retirement. Appropriate restrictions on the release of superannuation moneys are of course required. The government recently increased the preservation age from 55 to 60 on a phased basis between the years 2015 and 2025. This means that for someone born before 1 July 1960 the preservation age will remain at 55 years, while for someone born after 30 June 1964 the preservation age will rise to 60 years. This change aims to reduce the opportunities for people to double-dip— that is, to use their concessionally taxed superannuation benefits for non-retirement income purposes and then to access the age pension. What Senator Sherry appears to be referring to is a report that was apparently prepared by a temporary employee of the Department of Finance and Administration which raised the prospect of increasing the age pension age. This paper has absolutely no official status and the premise of the question is a complete furphy.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Preservation Age</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-12-09,"—Thank you, Senator Sherry, for the supplementary question. If that quote is correctly attributed to the Treasurer, it does not in any way mean that other options cannot be canvassed. The report that appears to have excited so much interest is an internal working document only and was prepared for the basis of an internal discussion. The Prime Minister has recently announced the establishment of an interdepartmental task force reporting to the Treasurer on labour force participation, particularly for older Australians who wish to continue to work; superannuation retirement incomes policy, which is extremely important; and managing expected increased government spending in areas affected by demographic change, particularly health and aged care. The work of the task force is under way and it is not surprising that the Treasurer would make some comment in relation to it.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-12-09,"—I seek leave to incorporate the answers to questions asked by Senator Evans on 4 December relating to the Westralia fire.
Leave granted.
The answers read as follows—
On December 4, 2002, Senator Evans asked a number of questions in relation to the Westralia fire.
I provide the following advice from the Navy.
1.	Can the minister confirm reports that the initial Navy Board of Inquiry into the Westralia fire was held before the ship's engines had been stripped down and examined?
There was no “initial” Navy Board. The Navy Board of Inquiry (BOI) was directed by the terms of reference to determine the cause of the fire, which it did as the result of the evidence of the Western Australian Police Arson Squad Report as to the cause being the failure of a fuel supply hose. While other theories were initially submitted to the Board their proponent did not press them. None of those theories or the evidence of the Arson Squad required any investigation of the internal elements of the engines. The internal examination of the engines was done in 2 stages as part of the restoration of the ship, not to determine the cause of the fire; first by way of determining what if any damage had been sustained by the engines as the result of the fire, second by way of work commissioned as preventative maintenance, intended to ensure the engines served the planned period between major overhauls and was based on recommendations flowing from the first fire damage report
2.	How could that BOI have thoroughly examined the causes of the fire if it did not have the report from the detailed engine inspection?
As the issue for the Board was the cause of the fire and this was determined on the basis of reliable evidence, subjected to full testing by cross examination from all represented parties, it was not consistent with the role of the Board to order a stripping of the engines when there was no probative value as to the cause of the fire in following that course.
3.	Does it show that a number of faults other than the flexible fuel line could have caused the fire?
No. The first report addressed the fire related damage to the engine and included the results of an examination of the two cylinders on the Starboard Main Engine around which the fire had erupted. The report stated “Combustion spaces were in the condition that might be expected for an engine that had been operated on lower loads in recent times.” The nature of the examination could nevertheless have been expected to identify such other causes had they been present. No such matters were raised in the report. The second report was based on the findings of a substantial overhaul operation concerning the technical state of the engine which included taking measurements of wear and distortion of components. While some wear and distortion was identified this was consistent with the use of the engine and not of any failure of the engine or component. Both of the examinations and reports were provided by Rolls Royce.
4.	Can he also confirm that the Commonwealth representative at the coronial hearing this week into the Westralia fire argued that the hearing should not be held in public? Did you, as minister, authorise that submission and if so why?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>HMAS Westralia</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister's response.
The first question that I referred to, No. 304, is now more than six months overdue. Question No. 405 is now more than four months overdue. They are certainly detailed questions—as I think the minister would expect when I ask questions in respect of superannuation matters—but the Senate standing orders require a 30-day response period. If the minister or her office cannot respond within that 30 days, then I believe it would be courteous to give some sort of indication as to why such important issues are left unanswered for such a considerable amount of time.
There is another important issue in relation to question No. 705. That question relates to why the government and the minister responsible for superannuation policy have failed to respond to a number of Senate committee reports. In themselves, the answers to those Senate committee report recommendations are between nine and 18 months overdue. This is yet another indication of the parlous state of the government's approach to superannuation and retirement income matters in this country. These are important issues that have been raised by the Senate, and ministers—and, in this case, this minister in particular—should ensure a swift response. I am certainly not an unreasonable person.

AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill:
·	amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to modernise the Australian aviation security regulatory framework;
·	amends the International Air Services Commission Act 1992 to implement government decisions to simplify and streamline the processes for allocating capacity to Australian international airlines and promote economic efficiency through competition in the provision of international air services; and 
·	repeals the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 as the Federal Airports Corporation ceased operation on 25 September 1998. 
Reasons for Urgency
Following the events of September 11, 2001 and the Bali bombings of 12 October 2002, there has been a significant shift towards increased aviation security in Australia and internationally.
The passage of this Bill will allow the introduction of an over-arching legislative framework for the handling of aviation security information. The framework is designed to further encourage industry to provide regular information on how it complies with the aviation security standards and help the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DoTRS) to better assess aviation security performance in the Australian aviation industry. This will also empower DoTRS to deal with, and help resolve, compliance problems (whether anticipated or actual) in a timely and effective manner.

COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT (PARALLEL IMPORTATION) BILL 2002
Purpose of the legislation 
To amend the Copyright Act 1968 to allow the parallel importation of books, computer software, periodical publications, sheet music, and parallel importation of copyright material associated with these items and with sound recordings. To correct errors and misdescriptions in the Copyright Act 1968, arising from amendments in the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000.
Reasons for Urgency
The terms of the Bill have had substantial Parliamentary and community consideration. Further delay in its consideration may leave the issue as an unnecessary irritant for affected businesses and possibly the USA. The Bill was reintroduced in March 2002 after the Federal Election in October 2001. Its predecessor Bill which it almost substantially replicates was then awaiting debate in the Senate. The 2001 Bill was considered and reported on by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee in May 2001. The Bill proposes substantial changes to the importation provisions as they relate to printed materials and to computer software. Uncertainty over the passage of the legislation impacts on the business environment in the affected industries and should not be unnecessarily delayed.

CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PEOPLE SMUGGLING, FIREARMS TRAFFICKING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Bill 2002 contains new people smuggling offences, interstate firearms trafficking offences and makes minor amendments to a number of criminal justice Acts.
The firearms offences are an important part of moves by the Commonwealth, States and Territories to strengthen controls over the misuse of firearms, in particular, handguns. The offences in this Bill are designed to combat the increasing interstate trade in illicit firearms, which includes the trafficking of illicit handguns. Research indicates that those who engage in firearms crime are invariably sourcing their weapons illegitimately and do not comply with licensing and registration requirements. The offences in the Bill impose tough penalties on those who in the course of trafficking firearms across interstate borders breach State and Territory firearms laws.
The Bill's new people smuggling offences would cover smuggling activity not already covered by the Migration Act 1958. In particular, the offences would target the involvement of Australian citizens and residents in overseas people smuggling operations, and smuggling activities coordinated from Australia. Aggravated people smuggling offences would provide larger penalties for people smugglers who smuggle five or more people, and smugglers who endanger the life, plan to exploit or otherwise ill-treat those people being smuggled. 
These offences would broaden the focus of Australia's people smuggling legislation, and would demonstrate Australia's commitment to combating people smuggling in both Australia and the region. 
Reasons for Urgency
It is desirable that the measures in the Bill be in place as soon as possible, to strengthen firearms laws in line with agreement on 6 December 2002 by the Council of Australian Governments to improve community safety and control access to firearms, particularly handguns.
Timely passage of this Bill would implement an important measure in the combined Commonwealth, State and Territory effort to fight the spread of illegal firearms, and emphasises the priority the Commonwealth places on strengthening national firearms controls.
The Commonwealth's timely adoption of firearms trafficking offences is consistent with the aim of introducing increased penalties for trafficking. State and Territory maximum penalties for the illegal possession and sale of a firearm are generally significantly lower than those being proposed under the Commonwealth's legislative amendment.
Passage of the people smuggling offences by the end of this year would fulfil the commitment made by Australia at the Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, held in Bali in February this year, to combat people smuggling in the region.

FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2)
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill amends seven Acts relating to the financial sector. Amendments are aimed at improving corporate governance in the banking industry through introducing a `fit and proper' test for directors and senior managers, enhancing the ability of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to monitor the financial industry and ensuring that Australia is in compliance with international best practice standards in supervision, particularly in the banking industry. There are also many amendments of a minor and technical nature.
Reasons for Urgency
Appropriate corporate governance practices in financial firms and the ability of regulators to thoroughly monitor the financial industry are recognised as very important features in encouraging a sound and efficient financial sector. The passing of this Bill will particularly improve the environment for Australia's banking (or deposit taking) industry through ensuring that regulation and corporate governance practices comply with international best practice standards. Improved corporate governance and regulatory practices have recently been introduced to other financial industries, such as insurance, and it is desirable that these improvements extend to the banking industry as a matter of urgency.

—————
INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF TAXATION BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill establishes the office of the Inspector-General of Taxation as an independent statutory authority. The Inspector-General will provide a new source of advice to the government on tax administration. The Inspector-General will identify systemic issues of concern in tax administration.
Reasons for Urgency
The office of Inspector-General of Taxation is intended to be operational by the end of 2002 and funding was included in the 2002-03 Budget for the establishment of the office.
There is a government commitment and community expectation that the office will be established and operational by the end of 2002. The creation of the office of Inspector-General is a response to serious concerns of taxpayers and tax professionals regarding tax administration. The urgency of the Bill stems from a need to address systemic problems in taxation administration without further delay.

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The National Environment Protection Council Act 1994 is being amended:
·	to allow for the National Environmental Protection Council (NEPC) Service Corporation to provide Secretariat support to the new Environment Protection and Heritage Council;
·	to permit variations agreed unanimously by NEPC to be of a `minor' nature, to be made through less complex notification and consultation procedures; and
·	to provide for another review of the operations and achievements of the Act after a further five years.
Reasons for Urgency
The Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 June 2002. States and Territories need to pass mirror legislation based on a final Commonwealth Act to enable the Act to come into force 12 months after Royal Assent.
Some States and Territories have now drafted mirror legislation but await the passing of the Bill (to be certain of the final text for their Bills) before introducing the corresponding legislation into their Parliaments.

RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will clarify key definitions in the original legislation and provide for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of the legislation.
Reasons for Urgency
At present there is considerable uncertainty that is negatively impacting on the business sector and investment in renewable energy. The uncertainty arises from the lack of clarity in various provisions of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 and in the context of longer term energy market reform. Resolving these administrative issues in advance of the mandated independent review of the Act, scheduled to begin in January 2003, will enable market participants to focus on policy issues and plan for the future. The potential exposure of business and government to legal challenge will also be reduced as a result of the Bill.

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (EARLIER ACCESS TO FARM MANAGEMENT DEPOSITS) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will provide for earlier access to Farm Management Deposits (FMDs). This will be achieved by providing an exception to the 12-month waiting period for access to FMDs for farmers in Exceptional Circumstances area. This will help farmers manage the cash flow impact of the drought.
The Bill also includes a number of technical amendments to ensure the law operates as intended.
Reasons for Urgency
The legislation is required to be enacted by the end of the Spring sittings so as to provide farmers with the necessary assistance.

WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR TERMINATION) BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bill 
The Bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the WR Act) to: restore the exclusion of short term casual employees from termination of employment provisions to the position that applied before the Federal Court decision in the Hamzy case; and make the filing fee for lodgement of termination of employment claims a permanent requirement and to provide for annual indexation of this fee. 
Reasons for Urgency
The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 20 February 2002 and subsequently referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee which reported in May.
The Bill principally seeks to restore the provision that prevents short-term casual employees from accessing termination of employment remedies otherwise available under the WR Act. 
In the Hamzy case in November 2001, the Federal Court invalidated Workplace Relations Regulations excluding specified categories of casual employees from the termination of employment provisions of the WR Act, including the unfair dismissal provisions, because they went beyond what was authorised by the regulation-making power provided for under the WR Act.
The Federal Court's decision raised significant concerns in the business community about their liability under unfair dismissal laws.
On 7 December 2001, replacement regulations came into operation, preventing casuals who have been working for their employer for less than 12 months from accessing termination of employment remedies. However, these Regulations do not fully restore the short-term casual exclusion as it operated from 1996 until the decision in Hamzy.
The Bill has now been before the Parliament for some months, has been considered by a Senate Committee and is still necessary to address specific ongoing employer concerns about the operation of unfair dismissal laws. Recent independent research has confirmed the negative influence that these laws have on business and employment. The sooner this legislation is passed, the sooner the benefits will flow to business and the wider community.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like the Senate to take note of and accept the resolution that was agreed to by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. This motion relates to the current plight of the East Timorese asylum seekers based in Darwin in the Northern Territory who are seeking to stay in Australia. I want to reiterate some of the comments that were made during this debate in the Northern Territory when this motion was endorsed. As the Chief Minister said at the time, the Territory leads Australia in many respects. Of course, the most important among those is the cultural diversity of our society in the Top End—that is, the way in which people from many parts of the world and from many parts of Australia live together in peace and harmony with a sense of complete cooperation in Darwin.
We often hear people pay lip service to multiculturalism in other parts of our country but in the Territory it actually does work. It is readily seen in the schools, on the sporting fields and in our workplaces. We are a small community and a very tight-knit one, so we rely on this peace and harmony and the integration of our multicultural groups to a very large extent. What happens to one family affects all of us in the Top End. That is why the plight of the 80 or more East Timorese who have made the Northern Territory their home and are now probably facing, at the end of the day, deportation back to East Timor has raised many concerns within our community. That is why there are so many people working to ensure that this is not the case. 
Many of these people are known to us. Some have spent up to 10 years or more living in the Top End and many have had children there. They have opened businesses. Many are studying or working. They are good neighbours, good friends and, in fact, they have been good immigrants. They are part of the Territory. As the Leader of the Opposition, Denis Burke, said in his contribution to this motion last week, everyone refers to them as Territorians. We feel they are a part of our community and they are Territorians.
These are people who once faced very grave fears for their safety in East Timor, some fleeing for their lives and losing family and friends in the outbreaks of violence leading up to and following the independence vote. They have found peace in Australia. They have found a home in Darwin and a haven in which they can bring up their children. That is why I think—and I agree with the Chief Minister—that it is devastating to hear that the federal government has given them a short deadline before planning to send them back to East Timor forcibly. Many of these people will lose everything if they leave now, and they will return to nothing. They face a very difficult time of dislocation, language problems for their children and unemployment. The small Territory population needs building up through good immigrants like the East Timorese, not the loss of families such as these.
We note that the federal government does not consider these people to be refugees following Australia's involvement in restoring peace in East Timor, but, of course, those of us who are fighting to ensure that these people stay in this country do not accept the federal government's ruling. There was a belief in, and a commitment to, ensuring that they would be considered a special case because of their great contribution to the Darwin community and the widespread support and respect they have won. Unfortunately, our attempts to date to get the federal government to agree to a special purpose category visa have failed.
I believe it would be so easy for Minister Ruddock to decide to grant resident status to the 1,700 or so East Timorese refugees who came to this country having fled East Timor many years ago prior to the start of that country's campaign and crusade to become an independent nation. It is unfortunate that this government has seemed to actually put a fence around these people and designate them as having a special case for refugee status as was the case in the 1980s when the Labor government recognised that needed to occur for people from China who were here during the Tiananmen Square massacre. Seventeen hundred people is not a lot of people for this country to welcome with open arms and to have as residents of this country forever without having to put them again through the trauma and dislocation that they will experience if they are sent back home.
We have 80 or more East Timorese people in the Northern Territory. Many of them, of course, have relatives amongst those 1,700 East Timorese who are in Melbourne. As I have said before in this chamber, they have played a significant role in contributing to our community. It is a role that should be acknowledged and these people should be accepted as part of our population in this country. It is within the minister's powers to do that. It is unfortunate, I must say, that Minister Ruddock was in the Northern Territory over the weekend. I came across him out at Jabiru on Saturday night. I realise that he had been in the Territory to take part in a land hand back at Kybrook Farm and he had flown on to Darwin on Sunday.
—It was not unfortunate.
—It is unfortunate that he did not make himself available to meet these people or their representatives or to perhaps give them some acknowledgment that he knows there is a path that they are endeavouring to take. It is unfortunate that he did not make himself available to meet with representatives of this community while he was in the Northern Territory.  
However, the community has been working long and hard on this. I noticed in the Sunday Territorian last Sunday week that some schoolchildren from Karama Primary School were raising funds to assist these people to gather together the $1,000 that they will need to appeal the initial decision. Last night at the Italian Club in Darwin there was a fundraising concert, again to gather together the funds that these people are going to need to appeal the decision to send them back to East Timor. That is exactly the nature of multiculturalism in Darwin when you have the Italian community offering their venue and their services to assist the plight of the East Timorese families. The work of St Vincent de Paul has been significant in that, and Mick Fox has been crucial in coordinating this campaign.
The Northern Territory government has pledged assistance through the Office of Ethnic Affairs, which will be supporting the Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission to provide assistance to these people so that they get the best sound advice and strong legal representation to be able to mount a case to stay. I understand that the Chief Minister had a conversation with Minister Ruddock in which he gave an undertaking that each case will be looked at individually under section 417 of the act, which is where the minister has the discretion. I hope that the minister would find that he has the discretion, at the end of the day, to grant these people residency in Australia based on humanitarian reasons. I hope that is the path these people go down and that they are entitled to stay, and are welcome to stay, in this country.
This motion passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is an important one. It continues the campaign to ensure that the East Timorese people are recognised as being strong contributors to the community, to support those who are living in Darwin and to support the affected families. Of course, it also recognises the many contributions of individuals, businesses and community organisations that are supporting the East Timorese people. One of those would be the Hakka Association. In the speeches that have been tabled that accompany this resolution there is recognition of the role that the Chinese Timorese association has played and the role that significant Chinese Timorese leaders in Darwin are playing in an effort to try to ensure that this federal government recognises that they can be in a win-win situation here. The win-win situation is that they could grant people a visa under particular humanitarian reasons or for whatever reason the minister chooses. This would acknowledge the substantial contribution of these members to our community and ensure that they can stay forever in Darwin, and in Australia—a place they have made their home and want to continue to make their home for themselves and for their children.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Resolution of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly</title>,Documents,12,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-12-09,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrat Party in noting the motion relating to the proposed deportation of East Timorese asylum seekers that was passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly last week. My understanding is that the motion was passed unanimously—that is, with the support of Country Liberal party members. If I am wrong, I am sure someone will tell me otherwise. The assembly certainly passed it and it is a motion that the Democrats wholeheartedly endorse. Indeed, it should be one that the Senate endorses because it expands upon a view already expressed by way of a motion agreed to by the Senate a few weeks back in relation to the situation faced by people of East Timorese background who are now well and truly part of the Australian community.
It is particularly relevant for people in Darwin and for the Territory community, which is no doubt why the Northern Territory assembly has taken this issue so seriously. It is also particularly relevant for people in Melbourne, where there is another large East Timorese community made up of many of these people who have been made to suffer for such a long period of time and who have been left in limbo because of the consistent policy of this and the previous Labor government when people first arrived while the Indonesian occupation of East Timor was, of course, still well and truly a reality. 
The resolution of the assembly rightly acknowledges the substantial contribution which members of the East Timorese community have made to the Northern Territory community over many years. That applies to those who are in other parts of the country as well, but it is probably more noticeable in Darwin because it is a smaller community than somewhere like Melbourne—the proportion of East Timorese there is more noticeable—and because Darwin has stronger historical links with the region, obviously, being a lot closer geographically.
The Democrats are pleased that the Northern Territory parliament has expressed its support for the East Timorese asylum seekers and is extending support, including funding for legal aid. It is a crucial issue and it is one that the Democrats have raised many times over many years. It is very unfortunate that it has got to a situation now where, finally, the government is starting to process these people's claims when the situation is such that they are unlikely to meet the very strict refugee criteria that apply in Australia. It is probably the case that many people do not fit the very tight criteria for refugee status, although it is undoubtedly the case that most or all of them did fit the criteria when they arrived in Australia and when they put in their initial applications many years ago.
The opinion of the Northern Territory government and parliament is that the East Timorese should remain in the communities that they are now well and truly a part of. Certainly I and, I expect, many others in this chamber—particularly the Northern Territory representatives, Senator Crossin and Senator Scullion—have received many representations from individuals wanting assistance to ensure that they can remain in Australia, in some cases permanently and in others at least until they can finish their studies. Surely it would be in Australia's interests, let alone those people's individual interests and in the interests of the East Timorese nation, that people who are partway through higher education should be enabled to finish that education, which they could then use much more effectively to assist their former nation of East Timor. There is no doubt that Australia still owes a significant debt to East Timor, in terms of not just the actions and occurrences during the Second World War but also, as a government, our insistence on turning a blind eye to their plight for around 25 years.
Clearly, East Timor is now amongst the most impoverished nations in our region. The East Timorese are clearly in a situation of significant instability and they need our support. They do not need a government that dumps 1,000 or so people back into the middle of that fledgling nation, many of them without homes to go to, without support and, for the younger people, without even the ability to speak a language other than English and with no real direct experience of or connection with the land that they are now being sent back to other than their historical connection to it.
The Democrats note and endorse the statement seeking support for the resolution and for the deportees' applications to the minister for immigration. It is another sign of how the stringent, very hardline approach to migration law which this government takes is not only harsh and cruel for the individuals involved but also counterproductive for Australia. Here we have a group of people— it is not particularly large; 1,500 to 1,700— all of whom are desperate to stay in Australia. Certainly all those whom I have met, which would probably be about 30 individuals with different histories and backgrounds in Australia for many years, desperately want to contribute. There is no doubt that, on average, they would contribute to this nation far more, far more passionately and in a far more committed way than many others in the country.
In addition to that, we have a process where, rather than simply apply a blanket approach to all of them, which has been done in the past, the minister, for what seem to be policy purity reasons—or perhaps it is because he is not allowed to do so by the government more broadly—is insisting that each case be dealt with individually. Each of them has to go through the departmental assessment. Over 700 have been assessed already, every single one of whom has failed. Each of them will have to go to the Refugee Review Tribunal, which could certainly do without the extra workload. Each of them would then almost certainly also fail. Then, and only then, are they able to apply for discretion from the minister. Rather than circumventing all that process and simply having ministerial intervention at the start and, even better, rather than having ministerial intervention looking at each case individually, which would also take an enormous amount of time, it will tie up not just the department and the minister, who have to make these decisions, but all the advocates, supporters in the community, legal aid and legal services staff who will help to prepare their cases and people such as ourselves who will assist in advocating on behalf of these people. Huge amounts of effort will be put in just to get the minister to exercise his discretion to allow those people to apply for some other visa. It will take a long time and it will lead to ongoing suffering for these people, who will have an uncertain future. They will not know what is going to happen.  
One of the worst things about ministerial discretion, as the Democrats have pointed out time and again, including in the Senate committee report on our onshore refugee determination process—it was clearly a unanimous recommendation by all those who participated—is that it is totally arbitrary. You cannot compel the minister to use it and you cannot appeal against it. Whilst there are guidelines that he is required to use, you have no idea what it is that led him to accept one person or to agree to exercise his discretion with one person and not to agree with another. Nobody knows and nobody can ever know. It is almost a massive global lucky dip as to whose future is positive and whose future is negative. Those people and all the people helping them are in the middle of that ridiculous environment and they will suffer it for many months to come. 
It is worth noting that it has been done before. There is the well-known case of the Chinese students in the Tiananmen Square massacre. A blanket exemption for all those people ended up allowing 42,717 visas to be granted. You say that that is a special case, and it was. I argue that the East Timorese people have a better case than even the Chinese had, not that I opposed that case. It was also applied back in 1997, when the present immigration minister, Minister Ruddock, announced decisions to resolve the status of certain groups of people who had been in Australia as long-term residents. That clearly applies here. Those groups included people who had come from Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, China, Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia. 
I argue that this case is more compelling than any of those cases. They are people who, as we all know, are part of our community, are effective and will contribute well. Let us save ourselves all the trouble and expense; let us save these people the extra suffering. Let us add our support to the Northern Territory parliament. Let us get state parliaments around the country, particularly Victoria, which has a large East Timorese community, to build the pressure on the immigration minister and the federal government to change their minds, to do the right thing by these people and by Australia and to show a bit of commonsense as well as compassion.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Resolution of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly</title>,Documents,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-09,"—I support the previous two speakers and note that it is not without precedent, nor is it common, for us to receive such messages from state or territory administrations or governments. It should be given special credence and supported. I have given notice in writing to convert that motion into one that the Senate can support and I foreshadow that I will be asking Senator Crossin and Senator Bartlett to add their names to that motion when it comes before the Senate on Wednesday. 
Senator Bartlett has just referred to the special exemption given in the case of the Tiananmen Square students from China, and there have been other cases. But it is quite extraordinary that the suffering of the East Timorese has been ignored by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Prime Minister in the case of those who came to Australia and who have never been given a home here in the sense of security, in the sense of knowing that they could get jobs in the long term or that their kids could go to school here, and in the sense of recognising that Australia was, in effect, their home. Ordinary immigration processes should have allowed them to be granted citizenship long ago. But they have been denied that and they have been held in limbo. Now the minister is saying that they have to pack their bags and go back to East Timor. Just last week we saw the eruption of troubles in East Timor—the death of two people and widespread looting and destruction. As an Australian, I feel partly responsible for that. There is no doubt that underlying the troubles that East Timor has at the moment is insufficient support coming from the Australian government, private enterprise and insufficient backup from the rest of the world. It has fallen far short of what it should be.  
Instead, we are seeing the Australian government, in conjunction with a number of big oil and gas companies, trying to defraud the East Timorese people of their greatest potential source of revenue—that is, the Timor Gap oilfields—under the so-called Timor Gap Treaty. This is a total travesty by a big, rich neighbour like Australia on a poor country like East Timor that needs so much to get revenue and income for its future. Talk about good neighbour policy! It is anything but that. If there is one thing that East Timor needs it is foreign investment. One de facto way of getting that investment is from the thousands of East Timorese who are gainfully employed in Australia and who are repatriating money—and that is what they do. 
Just last week in parliament, we had a delegation of such folk here under the auspices of the Catholic sisters. In speaking to those East Timorese, they said they want to finish their school here and they want to develop their skills here. We know that if they go home that will stop. What use is that to the future of their country? What use is it if the income earners here who are sending dollars home to their folks in East Timor are suddenly going to be sent home where they will have no income at all? They will become extra mouths to feed and they will have people to support in a country whose economy is in great trouble. What an alien attitude it is for the minister, the Prime Minister and this government to be taking to these poor neighbours of ours who have suffered so much. They have been bypassed or left on the wayside for a quarter of a century. Finally, after gaining their initial freedom, they have a different wayside to deal with— that is, the direct statement, implicit in the processes that Minister Ruddock is going through, that they are foreigners, they are not wanted here and they should get out. 
Where is the heart of this great country of ours? It is missing from the pronouncements of the minister for immigration to these East Timorese friends of ours—these lovely people who are in our cities, particularly in Melbourne but in all other cities around the country, including this great community in Darwin. The Territory administration is right: they deserve our support. I ask all members to think about that in converting this motion, which went through the assembly, into one that we can support in the coming days.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-12-09,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I wish to make an oral presentation by way of a report entitled Annual review ofAustralia's relations with the United Nations and present the Hansard record of the proceedings and submissions received by the committee. I rise to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade about the committee's ongoing review of Australia's relations with the United Nations. The review has its origins in a report presented by the committee in the last parliament entitled Australia's role in United Nations reform. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: would the senator tell us if this oral presentation will convert into a written presentation to the Senate? Is this annual report simply going to be an oral presentation to the Senate?
 (Senator Chapman)—Senator Brown, as with all remarks in this chamber, it will be in Hansard.
—In that report, the former committee concluded:
The ideals of the United Nations, as expressed in the [United Nations] charter, are as important today as they were when they were first written.
The report did acknowledge, however, that the United Nations is in clear need of reform if it is to contribute effectively to peace, security and improved human rights. Many of the former committee's recommendations focused on the need for greater and more stable funding of the United Nations and called on the Australian government to actively support reforms directed at promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the UN's administration and financial management and encouraging more representative structures in various UN institutions, including the Security Council. The former committee also expressed the view that more active involvement by parliament in discussing and debating Australia's activities at the United Nations might help improve community awareness and understanding of the role of the United Nations. To help promote greater parliamentary debate, the report proposed that an annual program of public hearings be conducted on the subject of Australia's participation in United Nations activities.
I can report to the Senate that earlier this year the committee resolved to convene an annual program of review hearings, as recommended by the former committee. The first of these annual hearings was held on 2 July this year and involved an examination of officials from the government agencies most closely involved in facilitating Australia's activities at the United Nations— namely, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Defence, the Australian Agency for International Development and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The hearing focused on a series of issues identified by the former committee as warranting continuing attention: the status of Australia's treaty obligations; Australia's involvement in UN peacekeeping operations; Australia's involvement in UN programs, funds and specialised agencies; the work of Australia's permanent missions to the United Nations; the progress of structural and financial reform in the United Nations; and the overall costs and benefits of Australia's participation in the UN.
We also invited those organisations and individuals who had contributed to the former committee's inquiry to provide additional or updated information. A number of witnesses chose to do so and we received 20 written submissions. I would like to present to the Senate the transcript of evidence taken at the review hearing in July and copies of the written submissions received. Copies of all these documents are also available on the committee's Internet site. We found the hearing to be a valuable opportunity to be briefed on and to discuss the nature of Australia's current activities at the United Nations. We were pleased to note, for example, that Australia's initiative to promote reforms in the way that the UN treaty review bodies conduct their work is making good progress, despite initial reservations being expressed in some quarters; that reforms to the management of UN peacekeeping operations are being implemented; that Australia is developing strategic partnerships with United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to increase the engagement and effectiveness of these agencies in the Asia-Pacific region; and that the leading role taken by successive Australian governments in developing the statute for the International Criminal Court has come to fruition, with Australia's ratification of the statute and the creation of the court on 1 July 2002. 
There is also some evidence that the Secretary-General's second term reform agenda, which includes a focus on improving internal financial and administrative processes, is being implemented effectively, although much remains to be done. It seems, however, that little progress has been made or is expected on the bigger issues of institutional reform. Proposals to expand both the permanent and the non-permanent membership of the Security Council and to remove the veto power held by the existing five permanent members, which Australia and others have advocated for many years, are deadlocked. The reality seems to be that in the absence of dramatic shifts of geopolitical opinion, particularly on the part of the existing five permanent members, the prospects for Security Council reform are slim at best.
While there is growing agreement that the United Nation's informal system of voting blocks, or electoral groups, is out of date and does not accurately reflect current membership, there is little agreement on alternative models. Unless there is widespread acceptance that a credible alternative would work more effectively than the current blocks, there seems little prospect of change. Despite these and other limitations, we have seen in the last 12 months that the United Nations can play a central role in giving voice to and helping bring together world opinion. It has been an influential forum for the coordination of responses to the threat of terrorism and the debate about crises such as Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction. We remain firmly of the view that it is in Australia's interests to be fully committed to the United Nations.
This is not to say that we should be uncritical of our engagement with the United Nations. As a large organisation driven by international political will and with a complex agenda, the United Nations does have many failings. For example, sometimes the agenda of its conferences is hijacked by special interest groups, sometimes its programs or initiatives are poorly focused or managed and sometimes individuals working on UN sponsored activities act in an unethical or illegal manner. In our view, the appropriate response is not to withdraw but to build coalitions with other member nations and the organisation itself to challenge resistance to reform and to ensure that when mistakes are made remedial action is taken. As noted by the former committee:
... remaining fully committed to the United Nations is the only choice ... the United Nations has the potential to provide a more ordered and just international community, in which smaller powers have some influence in the world and serves to promote our national interests.
As I have already remarked, this annual review has been a valuable opportunity to continue the process of parliamentary consideration of Australia's relations with the United Nations. Given the dramatic changes in world affairs over the past 12 months, particularly the new and unpredictable threat posed by terrorism, I have little doubt that the committee will continue to review Australia's relations with the United Nations on an annual basis.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,13,1,speech

We were pleased to note, for example, that Australia's initiative to promote reforms in the way that the UN treaty review bodies conduct their work is making good progress, despite initial reservations being expressed in some quarters; that reforms to the management of UN peacekeeping operations are being implemented; that Australia is developing strategic partnerships with United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to increase the engagement and effectiveness of these agencies in the Asia-Pacific region; and that the leading role taken by successive Australian governments in developing the statute for the International Criminal Court has come to fruition, with Australia's ratification of the statute and the creation of the court on 1 July 2002. 
There is also some evidence that the Secretary-General's second term reform agenda, which includes a focus on improving internal financial and administrative processes, is being implemented effectively, although much remains to be done. It seems, however, that little progress has been made or is expected on the bigger issues of institutional reform. Proposals to expand both the permanent and the non-permanent membership of the Security Council and to remove the veto power held by the existing five permanent members, which Australia and others have advocated for many years, are deadlocked. The reality seems to be that in the absence of dramatic shifts of geopolitical opinion, particularly on the part of the existing five permanent members, the prospects for Security Council reform are slim at best.
While there is growing agreement that the United Nation's informal system of voting blocks, or electoral groups, is out of date and does not accurately reflect current membership, there is little agreement on alternative models. Unless there is widespread acceptance that a credible alternative would work more effectively than the current blocks, there seems little prospect of change. Despite these and other limitations, we have seen in the last 12 months that the United Nations can play a central role in giving voice to and helping bring together world opinion. It has been an influential forum for the coordination of responses to the threat of terrorism and the debate about crises such as Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction. We remain firmly of the view that it is in Australia's interests to be fully committed to the United Nations.
This is not to say that we should be uncritical of our engagement with the United Nations. As a large organisation driven by international political will and with a complex agenda, the United Nations does have many failings. For example, sometimes the agenda of its conferences is hijacked by special interest groups, sometimes its programs or initiatives are poorly focused or managed and sometimes individuals working on UN sponsored activities act in an unethical or illegal manner. In our view, the appropriate response is not to withdraw but to build coalitions with other member nations and the organisation itself to challenge resistance to reform and to ensure that when mistakes are made remedial action is taken. As noted by the former committee:
... remaining fully committed to the United Nations is the only choice ... the United Nations has the potential to provide a more ordered and just international community, in which smaller powers have some influence in the world and serves to promote our national interests.
As I have already remarked, this annual review has been a valuable opportunity to continue the process of parliamentary consideration of Australia's relations with the United Nations. Given the dramatic changes in world affairs over the past 12 months, particularly the new and unpredictable threat posed by terrorism, I have little doubt that the committee will continue to review Australia's relations with the United Nations on an annual basis.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2002-12-09,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 171st Inter-Parliamentary Union Council held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 23 to 27 September 2002. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Honourable senators will know that the Inter-Parliamentary Union usually holds two conferences a year, at which delegations from over 140 countries debate a range of topical issues and adopt resolutions on them. Over the last couple of years the IPU has been debating reform of its own practices and procedures, and as part of this process a second conference was not held in 2002. Instead a council meeting of the IPU—the 171st—was convened in Geneva to advance this reform process. Mr Con Sciacca and I, as the permanent delegates to the IPU Council, attended these meetings from 23 to 27 September.
The report I have just tabled documents in detail the debates and decisions taken in Geneva, and I would like to review a number of these. Senators should note that Senator Sergio Paez of Chile was elected as the new president of the council of the IPU. Mr Sciacca and I met informally with Senator Paez on several occasions, as we were staying in the same hotel, and we are confident that he will enhance the work of the IPU during his presidency. We congratulate him and look forward to working closely with him. 
In the past, successive Australian delegations have taken a keen interest in the budget of the IPU and in a constructive way have argued for comprehensive reforms, including financial discipline and clarity in reporting. In Geneva, the IPU council noted that the draft budget proposal called for a 10 per cent increase in member fees—a situation that Australian delegations argued could be alleviated by more comprehensive cost cutting. It was particularly pleasing when the council was told that the executive committee had reviewed the spending estimates carefully and that, as a result, assessed contributions would be increased by seven per cent and that further cost-saving mechanisms would be explored. Reference was made to the influence Australian delegates had exerted in achieving this spending discipline and greater budget transparency.
The meeting in Geneva also included a special session to debate the topic `financing for development'. I welcomed this debate at the IPU, having participated in a similar debate at the parliamentary meeting arranged under the auspices of the IPU at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, which was held in Johannesburg. At this meeting, I had highlighted the need to reduce trade barriers as a prerequisite for sustainable development in poorer countries, and I consequently secured amendments to paragraphs relating to trade issues in the final declaration. At the Geneva meeting of the IPU, I drew the attention of delegates to the Australian draft memorandum and draft resolution and indicated that the Monterey Consensus represented a significant step towards increasing understanding of what is needed to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in today's globalised world. Combating global poverty and providing a stable and secure future for all requires an integrated approach, including pursuing dividends from meaningful trade liberalisation; enhancing aid effectiveness; governance reform; capacity building; harmonisation of aid delivery; and integrating all streams of finance, including foreign direct investment, available to developing countries for their sustainable development.
I again emphasised the need to reduce trade barriers as a prerequisite for sustainable development in poor countries. In this regard I advised that, according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, complete liberalisation of global agricultural trade, including removal of agricultural subsidies, could generate benefits to developing countries of $A28 billion per year through improved market access, higher export prices and economic efficiency gains. The IPU adopted a resolution on this issue and this appears in full in the delegation's report, along with the IPU budget, member contributions and details of other meetings and decisions made at the council meeting. I thank the Hon. Con Sciacca MP, one of my colleagues from the opposition side, for his contribution to the success of the Australian effort at the IPU Council meeting in Geneva, and I also thank the delegation secretary, Mr Neil Bessell, for his assistance and efficiency in ensuring that the trip went smoothly. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 2760:
(1)	Schedule 2, page 14 (after line 4), after Part 1, insert:
Part 1A—Merit selection of Chair and members of Commission
4A  At the end of subsection 7(3)
Add:
	; and (d)	be satisfied in accordance with section 7A that selection for appointment is made on merit.
4B  After section 7
Insert:
7A  Procedures for merit selection of Chair and members of Commission
	(1)	The Minister must by writing determine a code of practice for nominations and appointments to the Commission that, in addition to the matters contained in section 7:
	(a)	sets out general principles on which nominations and appointments of members to the Commission, including the Chair, are to be made, including but not limited to: 
	(i)	merit; and
	(ii)	independent scrutiny of appointments; and
	(iii)	probity; and
	(iv)	openness and transparency; and
	(b)	sets out how these principles are to be applied to the selection of the Chair and members of the Commission.
	(2)	After determining a code of practice under subsection (1), the Minister must publish the code in the Gazette.
	(3)	Not later than every fifth anniversary after a code of practice has been determined, the Minister must review the code.
	(4)	In reviewing a code of practice, the Minister must invite the public to comment on the code.
	(5)	A code of practice determined under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
7B  Independence of Commission
		Before the Chair or a member of the Commission is appointed, the Minister must ensure that the balance of interests on the Commission is such that no one interest may dominate the Commission or derogate from its independence.
The Democrats have moved similar amendments to this in the chamber on many occasions in the past. They seek to ensure that appointments, such as those of ACCC commissioners, are done using a merit based process. The Democrats were delighted to hear the comments made by ALP frontbencher Mark Latham on the ABC program Insiders on 24 November 2002, which appeared to suggest that, after many years, we can finally look forward to the support of the ALP on merit based appointments. Mr Latham's comments attacked what he called `the establishment figures who've had power concentrated in their hands'. His comments about political appointments of mates to the ABC board were particularly strong.
Every Democrat senator has at one time or another called for an end to jobs for the boys. Wherever appointments are made to the governing organs of public authorities—whether they be institutions set up by legislation, independent statutory authorities or quasi government agencies—the process by which these appointments are made should be transparent, accountable, open and honest. One of the main failings of the present system is that there is no empirical evidence to determine whether the public perception of jobs for the boys is correct, as these appointments are not open to sufficient public scrutiny or analysis. It is still the case that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of the minister with the relevant portfolio responsibility. There is no umbrella legislation that sets out a standard procedure regulating the procedures for the making of appointments. Perhaps more importantly, there is no external scrutiny of the process and merits of appointments by an independent body.
The Democrats have put up amendments designed to compel ministers to make appointments on merit on 17 occasions in this place over the last few years, and this will be occasion No. 18. Every single time, Labor and the coalition have combined to block them. Thus the trend of parachuting mates into lucrative positions on various boards and authorities at the expense of the taxpayer continues. Perhaps Mr Latham's remarks indicate that Labor is at last in the process of changing its mind. Another encouraging sign was the ALP's recent support for Senator Murray's notice of motion which noted the rejection of Graeme Samuel by a majority of the states and territories as nominee deputy chairman of the ACCC. In that motion the Senate asked the federal government:
(i)		to ensure that it consults fully with the state and territory governments regarding Professor Fels' replacement, and
(ii)		to establish criteria for the selection and appointment process that include not just selection on merit, but that any candidate should be demonstrably independent, and have a strong interest in consumer and small business needs. 
Even the British eventually accepted appointments on merit. Lord Nolan, head of the 1995 Nolan commission, managed to persuade the UK government to accept that appointments should be based on merit. He set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments. They were: (1) a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; (2) a minister must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on the grounds of gender or race; (3) all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; (4) except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; (5) selection on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards which include a balance of skills and backgrounds; (6) the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their role should be explicit; and (7) the range of skills and backgrounds which are sought should be clearly specified. The UK government fully accepted the committee's recommendations. The office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments was subsequently created, with a similar level of independence from government as the Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. 
I go back to Mr Latham's comments on 24 November, when he finally recognised the importance of appointments on merit, which the Democrats have been advocating so strenuously. In particular, we have referred to and used those Nolan committee recommendations in our amendments. Mr Latham argued, `Labor should be pro-market but not necessarily pro-business, in the sense that, wherever power and privilege is concentrated, Labor needs to be anti-establishment, to give them hell.' He also commented:
Insiders look after themselves.
You've only got to look at some of the appointments and actions of the Howard Government to see this is an administration that governs for just a small clique of Australians.
They're into preferment, they're into appointments for their mates and this is a real problem.
	...	...	...
We need to break up the insiders and disperse power as widely as possible, particularly to the outer suburbs and the great regions of this nation.
It is hypocrisy for Labor to criticise the Howard government's insider recruitment program and the moralities of corporate responsibility when it is a well-known fact that Labor indulged in the same practice for years. Here are some recent examples. The Bracks government in Victoria has the worst track record on jobs for the boys, and the adequacy of its methods of appointment has been exposed and heavily criticised. In Queensland, the factional heavyweight Jack Camp was appointed to a $72,000 a year, four-day-a-week state government job without the position being advertised and without proper procedure. A former Labor Kirner government minister was paid almost $10,000 over a two-month period for a report that has never been published. Freedom of information documents have revealed that former police minister Mal Sandon was paid $320 a day for at least 28 days work on a VicRoads road safety strategy. And, of course, there was the appointment of disgraced former Senator Mal Colston to a water board. There are dozens and dozens of other `mates' examples.
Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability. Until the notion of jobs for the boys is nipped in the bud, there will not be that much moral difference between the political patronage of Suharto's Indonesia, Marcos's Philippines or Mahathir's Malaysia, where nepotism and favouritism have run rife, and our own system of political patronage.
The amendment I have moved today would insert into the bill a section requiring that a code of practice be determined for the nomination or appointment of ACCC members. It is recommended that the process of appointment be based on merit, be subject to independent scrutiny and have transparency, openness and probity. The bill in its current form has no provision at all for this process, which in my opinion would be negligent to ignore—especially for a body as important and powerful as the ACCC.
We need to establish a workable system to ensure that appointments on merit occur. This amendment does that. The public needs to be reassured that there is an adequate system of transparency and independence where favours are not exploited and mates are not rewarded. Political patronage is corrupt and corrupting. It should be reined in, particularly for a body as important as the ACCC, where its role in the competition regime that we have been discussing is fundamental and where its powers are so overriding in ensuring that the public interest is protected. We need to ensure that the ACCC is independent and fair and that the best possible brains are brought to bear on the task, which is why merit based appointments are so important and why I commend this amendment to the chamber.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—Although there is merit in striving for a balanced range of views on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Labor do not believe the Democrat amendment is an appropriate way of achieving that goal. Parliament, to which the ACCC is accountable and to which the government is accountable for appointments, is the proper forum to achieve this. We are of the view that the procedures proposed in the amendment put forward by the Democrats are unnecessarily prescriptive. They are particularly inappropriate in a context where appointments are made or are supposed to be made through a federal process, after consultation between the federal, state and territory governments—a view expressed by Senator Murray.
Under this arrangement, any competent Treasurer would engage in a round of dialogue with the states about nominations to the positions of chair, deputy chair, members or associate members of the commission. This requirement for consultation, preferably extensive consultation, makes the kinds of procedures proposed in this amendment particularly problematic. It may be difficult to meet both the requirements for consulting with the states over the appointment of the ACCC chair and the procedures proposed in the amendment.
In response to Senator Cherry's ruminations on Labor's position and the views of various Labor members, particularly in relation to the ABC, we have said that we are looking at some different approaches that could enhance the merit selection process. However, our view on this matter is clear and it is not our intention to support the Democrat amendment in this case.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—I will put it on the record that the Democrat amendment presumes that appointments to the ACCC are supposed to represent particular sectional interests. Such an assumption is incorrect and misunderstands the legislation and the role of the commission, which is to administer and enforce the legislation in the interests of all Australians, not in the interests of particular groups.
It is redundant to amend the bill to provide for merit as a requirement for appointment to the ACCC. The nine elected governments in Australia involved in the process of ACCC appointments will of course ensure that any ACCC appointment is meritorious. I am not aware, for example, of anyone criticising the ACCC on those grounds, let alone identifying any particular appointee that they would regard—
—You mustn't have read many papers lately.
—Concerning the ACCC? I profess ignorance. If there has been someone appointed to the ACCC whose process of appointment you say has been criticised then I would be interested to know who that might be. I hope it is not Professor Fels. What might happen in the future is an entirely different matter, but I am not aware of anyone having been appointed on that basis. 
Appointments to the ACCC are already subject to a high level of scrutiny under the existing requirements of the Trade Practices Act and the 1995 intergovernmental Conduct Code Agreement. Nominees for appointment to the ACCC are subject to a cabinet selection process to ensure that only suitable and qualified persons are put forward. A nominee for appointment must have knowledge of or experience in industry, commerce, economics, law, public administration or consumer protection. Each nominee must then be supported by a majority of state and territory governments. The amendment is therefore unnecessary because there are already in place perfectly adequate mechanisms to ensure scrutiny of ACCC appointments by nine elected and fully accountable bodies. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I rise to speak in support of Senator Cherry's amendment, much to his amusement. But I think I can explain to him very clearly why it should be supported. To a degree, we need not only an open, public process in the selection of the chair of the ACCC but a fundamental change in the operation of the ACCC. 
I believe that one of the best ways of explaining why the operation of the ACCC should be changed is to put on record fairly clearly how the commission at times operates. Imagine that you have attended a conference that has been organised to implement some regulation that the ACCC is involved with. As a member of the public, you go along to gain a better understanding of how this regulation should be followed. You find yourself sitting next to a member of the ACCC's staff. You get into conversation and basically ask them what is the purpose of them being there. To your astonishment, you find that the ACCC employee is at the conference to ensure that a member of a corporate entity, who has been directed by the ACCC to attend that conference, publicly sets out where they have been in breach of an ACCC ruling.
So what we actually have is the ACCC being the administrator, the judge, the jury and also the body who ensures that the sentence is carried out. Imagine you are that person that the ACCC has ordered to attend the conference and, in front of the public, set out where your corporation has breached those rules. How humiliating! It is the closest thing to corporate schoolboy bully tactics that I have ever heard of.
—Did they breach the rules or not?
—Irrespective of whether a corporation has breached the rules or not, there is no way that any department can substantiate putting a company through the humiliation of admitting that breach in front of their peers for no other purpose than to ensure that all the other corporate entities come into line—such is the power of the ACCC.
—Humility hurts no-one.
—Senators may question the validity of this but, believe me, it does happen. Senator Cherry has moved an amendment that there should be merit in the appointment of the chair of the ACCC, but I do not believe that it goes anywhere near what should actually happen. The powers of the ACCC should be reined in to a greater degree because, as I said earlier, at present they are the administrator, they are the judge and they are the jury, and they also have the ability to ensure that the sentences are carried out. I believe that is way beyond the power that should be given to any individual agency. Senator Cherry, you may be amused that One Nation are supporting you, but we believe very clearly that this should be only the first step in the process of bringing accountability to the ACCC.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-12-09,"—I am delighted that One Nation is supporting my amendment; it is a pity that we did not get a bit more support around the chamber. I want to put on the record that I am pleased that Senator Lundy in her comments noted that the ALP has been looking at the issue of appointments to the ABC board. I have noted the comments of ALP senators in the recent Senate committee report on that issue. We will ensure you get a chance to vote on that some time early next year. So we will have that debate then.
I want to talk about whether the issue of consultation with the states is an adequate substitute for merit based appointments. I do not believe it is, because the notion of state ministers and a federal minister negotiating over an appointment—while that is better than a federal minister making that appointment on their own—still does not get to the fundamental issue of who is the best person for the job. In that circumstance you are considering the appointment put up by the federal minister. There has not been a merit based process to come up with the name that the federal minister puts forward to the state ministers. We saw that difficulty with the recent nomination of Graeme Samuel as the deputy chair of the ACCC, which apparently the minister has not seen reported in the media. 
—I did not say that. You were talking about appointments that had been made.
—I was talking about the appointment process.
—You are now talking about appointments that mightn't be made.
—It was not made, and probably will not be made. The key point is that, if there had been a merit based process in place before that name was put forward by the federal minister to the state ministers, the government would not have got into so much trouble. So, with this amendment, we are trying to save the government from trouble by ensuring that the names that go forward are the best possible names in a transparent process. It is a pity that the government is not prepared to accept our bit of help on this matter.
Question negatived.
 (Senator Cook)—The question now is that the bill, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I have a question for the minister about the definition of core services under the bill. This issue was subject to some discussion during the inquiry. I want to hear the minister's explanation as to why the definition of core services is limited in the way that it is, particularly in relation to a service like ISDN, which provides for a slightly faster Internet connection rate. My question is: why was that not included in the core services definition for the purposes of model access undertakings?
A general criticism of this bill not being strong enough is that many of the provisions deal with fixing or trying to fix some of the problems with the access regime and with disputes and arbitration that have been held in the past. While many of the provisions are designed with that intent, two issues stand out that I think are worthy of clarification. The core services issue concerns those model undertakings and exemptions related to technologies that are of the past, not so much of the future. So in that respect the bill does not extend itself into the types of services that will be used and in demand in the future— such as ISDN, which is a faster connection service but which is not captured by the model undertakings. I think it would be quite helpful in preparing new infrastructure providers and existing infrastructure providers to provide those types of services. I would like a response from the minister in relation to that.
The other issue, on which I think it is important to hear the minister's explanation, is his assurance that the removal of merits review from arbitrations will not result in further interplay or regulatory gaming between the merits review process for access undertakings and exemptions and the arbitration process, which now has no merits review. Witnesses at the inquiry expressed a lot of concern that the changes would just lead to regulatory gaming in another forum or in another way, despite the efforts outlined in this bill to prevent further regulatory gaming and to put a stop to some of the existing regulatory gaming, which I think everyone acknowledges has occurred. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2002-12-09,"—On the first point, core services were essentially identified as those where there has been continuing disputation in industry. In practice, those services are always where there is the greatest degree of difficulty in getting access to the existing network, particularly where you have bottleneck services and where you are beholden to the incumbent—those are classic opportunities for gaming. As a result, you want some cut-through arrangement. But you ought to proceed sparingly in the sense that it is not the job of the government or the regulator to try to resolve every dispute ahead of giving the parties commercial opportunities to sort matters out for themselves. It is a last resort situation where the minister is persuaded that there are ongoing difficulties which warrant the declaration of core services. The three that we did nominate are the ones where there have consistently been problems. That does not for a moment mean that you cannot add new services, and the bill specifically allows for that. But your example of ISDN is really an example of what many people would regard as yesterday's service, not tomorrow's service. 
—Telstra are saying it's tomorrow's service. They are trying to roll it out.
—I can remember being there in 1989 or 1990 when Ros Kelly was the minister and Telstra's ISDN service was launched with great fanfare. I do not think it has ever been taken up to the extent that it should have been, and I think that is because—
—Because it was too expensive for Telstra.
—Yes, I think that is right. That is why the new regime does allow people to have disputes resolved more quickly. I think Optus might have complained about ISDN. If people were to come along and argue that this is the next classic example of bottleneck and that there is gaming going on, obviously we would give it serious consideration. But we thought we would nominate those three main areas where there have been a number of disputes to date.
As far as gaming is concerned, the whole rationale for eliminating the right of merits review to the ACT was to avoid the prospect of gaming. It has always been my view, despite Telstra's vigorous protestations to the contrary, that to have a situation where PSTN disputes could still not be finally resolved by way of a definitive judgment after five or more years—and, even if a decision had been forthcoming from the ACT, in theory it still could have been taken to about another three levels of courts—lends itself classically to gaming. We do not eliminate gaming by removing that merits review appeal right. All we do is truncate the appeals process to a limited extent. The idea of being able to go back and start all over again and to introduce new material, which is what led to our identification of this as a problem area, is quite unacceptable. The problem with future gaming is that you do not really ever know about it until people find ways of stalling the system or stringing things out. Gaming does not arise because someone says, `You've got a right to game.' It arises because what seems to be reasonable on the surface is misused. And people can misuse the courts. The classic example of that, if you remember, was in the early nineties when there was a licence hearing for a third free-to-air commercial television licence in Western Australia. It was in the interests of the incumbent to make life as difficult and expensive as possible for potential new entrants. As a result, there were something like 18 appeals at all levels—AAT, Federal Court, High Court and back again. 
That is gaming. Do you therefore take away people's appeal rights? You cannot do that. But if you found, for example—and there is some evidence to support this, and again the Federal Court judges would not like it—that the Australian Competition Tribunal were taking forever to make a decision (the Sydney airports matter, which went to the ACT, took nearly two years) and that comes about because judges are getting around to it when they are ready or because they have a lot of other things on their plate and they do not regard this as having any particular priority and someone takes advantage of that knowing that it is likely to slow things down quite dramatically, then you may well say, `Enough is enough, we will have a new streamlined body.' So I am quite happy to say, here and now, for the benefit of the industry that if we see evidence of those sorts of practices we would look very seriously at some sort of cut-through to ensure that the system was not just dragging on and on. 
I probably said to you before, Senator Lundy, that the best book to read on this is the Deal of the century which describes how MCI spent the first 10 years of its existence in court trying to get access to AT&T's network. That was a classic example of using the courts. Fortunately, MCI had the stomach and the pockets to be able to survive the exercise, but lesser players could not have done that. The American system seems to be almost unable to come to grips with that sort of gaming. We do not want that to happen here. I think we have been remarkably free of it. It is not a litigation industry at the present time, and it should not be. We have made three sets of changes over the last four or five years designed to speed up the process in various ways—finetuning, getting information out earlier, making sure that people have access to the system as quickly as possible and then speeding up the process. They are all anti-gaming measures, if you like, but you cannot say in advance where gaming is likely to surface. But when it does the trick is to ensure that you do not let it go on for too long. 
Bill, as amended, agreed to.
Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I echo the comments of the shadow Attorney-General in the other place that, while the opposition supports many of the measures in the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, it is disappointing that the government has not heeded the opposition's criticism of it. The amendments moved by the opposition were intended to alleviate the harsher consequences of the bill for low-income bankrupts and to address abuse of the Bankruptcy Act by high-income individuals intent on avoiding tax. In this instance, it is worth reminding the House that Labor's amendments would have retained the early discharge provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and enabled an application for early discharge to be made after two years. They would have also ensured that a person could not be prosecuted under section 265(8) for incurring reasonable or necessary personal or household expenses, such as utility bills, rent payments and so on.
One of the amendments which Labor supported was the repeal of section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act. This had the potential to retrospectively criminalise problem gamblers. We left that amendment for the Democrats to move, and I will comment on that shortly. We also supported and sought to have strengthened provisions in part X of the Bankruptcy Act for protection against abuse by high-income individuals intent on defrauding the Taxation Office. I will not go back over the speech I made then in relation to part X; I understand the government has a review of that provision under way. We welcome the fact that, in response to the opposition's concerns, the Attorney-General has asked Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia to undertake that review. The opposition of course welcomes the opportunity to make a contribution to that.
It is regrettable that the government has failed to acknowledge the inequities in its approach to reforming the bankruptcy law. As I have indicated previously, there are measures in this bill that the opposition do support. For that reason, we will not oppose the passage of this bill now. However, we will monitor—to the best of our ability, and with the assistance of community organisations—the impact of these changes on persons on low to middle incomes who struggle the most under the Howard government. We will revisit these issues where it seems appropriate to do so.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-12-09,"—The Attorney-General in the House of Representatives is a thoroughly nice man, but I think he has one terrible flaw. I think in his education he was trained in the school of Russian negotiation, which consists of just one word: no. I have had dealings with the Attorney-General for different bills over a number of years and I have never seen a proposition go down to the House, to the Attorney-General, to which he has found the ability to say yes. Only numbers are ever able to beat the Attorney-General. Despite being an astonishingly nice fellow, I do think he has a flaw in his character and I hope that at some time he will take some therapy to try to address it. 
Here we are again. We have eight good opposition amendments and two good Democrat amendments and, essentially, the House of Representatives has sent back a message which is longspeak for the Attorney-General's no. There are some inconsistencies in the arguments. For instance, some good points were made in the attempts by Senator Ludwig and his party to address part X, and that is why we supported them. But if you read through the summary of the House's views the logic is quite strange. Referring to Senate amendments (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7), sheet No. 6 says:
The Government has announced a comprehensive review of Part X which is currently under way. It is appropriate to wait for the findings of that review ...
That is quite a reasonable approach. You would expect them to say: `We think you may have a point but we really need to look into this a little more deeply. We'd rather put it aside and address it again later on.' Instead they say, `The amendments will add to the cost and complexity of Part X arrangements,' and, `There is no evidence that these amendments are needed,' et cetera. They are going to look awfully silly if the review of part X agrees with the opposition. Frankly, what it signals to me is an attitudinal issue. It is quite reasonable to say, `There's a review under way and we'll hold off an opinion until then,' but it seems to me a little inconsistent.
I briefly draw attention to Senate amendment (10). The Senate has made that amendment, I think, four or five times— certainly three or four times—and each time the House has rejected it. This bill did amend the Corporations Act; otherwise you could not have put that amendment in there. The amendment addresses the Senate's very real concern with the intersection of insolvency and related corporations. To simply say, `The House of Representatives doesn't accept the amendment because it is inappropriate to make amendments to this bill,' runs away from the very issue that it is attempting to address.
Whatever the House of Representatives may think of senators or their parties, the fact is that neither Labor nor we—and I am quite sure it is true of all other parties and Independents—will make amendments for the fun of it. The amendment reflects a concern expressed to us from the constituencies whereby it is believed that the legislation needs to be changed. I remind the chamber that Senate amendment (10) comes from the 1988 Harmer Law Reform Commission recommendation. It is well grounded in a review process. I would hope that the rejection of our amendments has a little more substance in the future.
Turning to Senate amendment (9), the House of Representatives message stated— and it summarised the amendment—that the intention of the Senate was to repeal section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 271 is the criminal offence provision, whereby gambling or speculations are regarded as criminal in nature. We argued, and the opposition agreed with us, that where gambling or speculation derives from an addiction it is absolutely inappropriate—probably to use that word inappropriately—to jail somebody or to have the potential of a criminal conviction arising from it. Addictions are things people cannot help. Lo and behold, when I looked at the wording of the House of Representatives message I was quite excited, because they actually accepted the proposition. They said:
The offence—
that is, the existing offence in section 271—
is not directed at gambling which results from addiction and removing the offence will not address problems relating to such addiction. The existence of the offence also assists some trustees in the administration of estates. Trustees and creditors report that some mischievous bankrupts will often claim that they have incurred losses `at the races' or `at the casino' when they are questioned about what has happened to money they have borrowed. When trustees mention the offence, the bankrupt will often come up with a more truthful answer which helps locate assets.
We do not disagree with the government— you do want to nab the crooks, the fraudulent and the people who abuse the offences—but we were merely trying to address the issue of addiction. 
We have decided to say, `We'll accept your rejection of our amendment and simply produce an amendment which acknowledges in legislation the very argument that the House of Representatives accept and that is that the offence is not directed at gambling which results from an addiction.' So we propose an amendment which very narrowly and succinctly confines and reflects our concern. Since the House of Representatives, in their remarks on Senate amendment (9), accept that that is the policy purpose of the act, we see no reason why the government should not support it. Although the remarks in the message from the House of Representatives confirm what government policy is, neither the act nor the new bill does. We therefore propose putting into law a clear intention which they acknowledge and which is not yet in the legislation. Accordingly, I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 2766:
Add, “but agrees to the following amendment:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 42 (after line 3), after item 182, insert:
182A  At the end of section 271
Add:
	(2)	It is a defence to the offence in subsection (1) if the person became bankrupt as a direct consequence of a genuine addiction to gambling or hazardous speculations.
I seek the support of the opposition for this amendment. I advise the government that, despite our passionate concern about the Attorney-General's saying no, we will not insist on the remainder of the amendments.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: if the three of us are agreeable, can we debate both the motion and the amendment at once so as to save time and avoid canvassing the issues again?
 (Senator Cook)—I see nodding heads around the chamber, and I am guided by the chamber.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-12-09,"—Now that we have the Democrats' proposed amendment to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 before us, the opposition will take the opportunity to comment on it. We understand Senator Murray's passion in relation to this. We also understand his view that, by the look of it, the Attorney-General is playing a game of Russian answers to questions. But we have come to a conclusion, having had a long look at the amendment moved by Senator Murray. Ultimately, we were not persuaded to support the proposal; however, it is worth setting out some of the reasoning we went through to get there.
The Democrat amendment to section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act was moved by Senator Murray at the committee stage. Although this amendment is not one that we will finally accede to in this debate, it is one that we saw particular merit in. When you unpack the argument put by the government you find that the amendment would make it a defence under section 271 if a person became a bankrupt as a direct consequence of a genuine addiction to gambling or hazardous speculation. In essence, the government has argued that prosecutions are only brought under section 271 where there has been a blatant attempt to defeat creditors by a person who patently does not have a gambling addiction. The government has stated that in the majority of cases it only takes a reference under section 271 by a bankruptcy trustee to prompt debtors to remember where they really disposed of their money. That is the shallow argument that was put.
That may be. But the government still fails to acknowledge the advice of the financial counselling community, which fears prosecution under section 271. In the opposition's view, in this instance it could act as a disincentive to problem gamblers facing insolvency to admit their problem and turn their lives around. Looking at section 271, this amendment does not appear to us to add anything to the offence or the evidentiary burden of the prosecution. The government's view is that it would undermine the effectiveness of section 271. To our mind, this amendment would place a not-insubstantial burden on a defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities not only that they had a genuine addiction to gambling but also that this was a direct cause of their bankruptcy. 
Therefore, save from the conclusion we finally came to, although it sounds an argument in support—we think the original motion is very good and the amended one is also good—in the end, the difficulty we have is that we accept there should be a period of consultation on the motion and the proposed amendments, which would allow the matter to be fully aired and be in a better position to be able to become effective. We then find that, in response, the government has accepted the task of doing a review, and we understand that Senator Abetz will outline that at the committee stage of the debate. We accept that the review will include this option. We then say, perhaps both to the government and as encouragement to Senator Murray, that we will reserve our right to revisit all of these issues, including the ones that we have not insisted on today, such as the proposed amendment to section 271, and to take another look at it the next time these matters are before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-12-09,"—The government has previously explained why it does not support the amendments made by the Senate when it considered the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. Those reasons have been confirmed by the House of Representatives. As the reasons for disagreeing with the amendments are set out in the statement from the House of Representatives, I will not repeat them; however, I urge the committee to pass the bill today. From the contributions of honourable senators, I understand that that is what will happen. The measures have broad support amongst stakeholders in the bankruptcy industry. The bill was first introduced in 2001 and industry has been waiting for these changes since then.
I will turn to the Democrat amendment. Can I say to Senator Murray that I thought he was unusually grumpy in his contribution. Something that may cheer him up is that, on the news on Sydney radio this morning, Mr Barns indicated that he is going to allow his membership of the Democrats to lapse. That will undoubtedly come as very good news and cheer Senator Murray up. The government does not support the Democrats' amendment to section 271. As we have said previously, in practice very few people are prosecuted for this offence. The reasons for our wanting that section to remain in its current form have been indicated in previous contributions. More thought needs to be given to the amendment.
The application of the Criminal Code may in fact make the amendment quite unnecessary—I refer to section 7.3 of the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code generally provides a range of generic defences, including the defence of mental impairment. These defences may apply to these circumstances. I am not sure as to whether they do or not, but they may apply—it would depend whether an addiction is seen as a mental impairment or not. But that also raises the issue of whether an addiction should, of itself, provide a full excuse in relation to other matters that excite the attention of the criminal law. But that is undoubtedly a debate for another day.
I am happy to indicate to the committee that the Attorney-General will ask his department and Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, to examine section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act and determine whether an amendment to address the issues raised by financial counsellors is required. The Attorney will ask ITSA to consult with relevant stakeholders, including financial counsellors and the Director of Public Prosecutions, in its examination of the issue. In light of this, I suggest to the chamber that the amendment proposed by the Democrats is not required at this stage. Should the examination determine that an amendment is required, this can be considered in the context of future legislation that amends the Bankruptcy Act.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-12-09,"—I thank the two senators for their reaction to our amendment. Because they are both lawyers, I will recount a bit of legal trivia. You are fully acquainted with the issues of extenuating or mitigating circumstances. I was quite interested some years ago to see that in South Africa they were going to suggest that drunkenness should in fact be an aggravating circumstance in law. I never did find out what happened, but it seemed to me quite an interesting new direction to take with aberrant behaviour, shall we say. 
Question negatived.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-12-09,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 deals with the central issue of the excision, or exclusion, or removal, of thousands of islands from the Australian political jurisdiction with respect to the landing of refugees on those islands. The Senate has already considered this issue in the context of regulations that were rightly and very firmly rejected by the Senate some months ago. The Liberal government has repackaged the excision, removal, exclusion, of these thousands of islands around Australia's shore into the bill that we are now dealing with.
This bill is a political opportunity for the government to rerun the 2001 election campaign, which, as we all know, was conducted on the themes of exploiting the intersection between race and fear. The Liberal government knows this is fertile ground politically—but exploiting it, and exploiting it continuously, inevitably leads to self-destruction, a loss of national confidence and a nation that turns inwards and is paralysed by the issues that confront us. There is no lofty motivation for this bill. There is no assertion of principle in relation to it. It is just another piece of opportunistic politics by the Liberal government that has proven time and time again that it is willing to do anything and say anything for political advantage. The words `children overboard' summarise that approach. 
It is a blatant and incorrect attempt to characterise the Labor Party as soft on border security. Nothing could be further from the truth. When Australia faced a border security threat in World War II, when it truly faced the threat of invasion, it turned to the Labor Party to lead, and it was the Labor Party that delivered. It repudiated Mr Menzies, who was the creator of the party that currently holds the government benches and was the mentor of the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard. 
I will now go to the ineffectiveness of this piece of legislation. The Liberal government is somehow pretending that excision, exclusion, removal, of these islands would stop people-smuggling. It is trying to create this image that excision is somehow a stop sign. How on earth does it follow that you can exclude thousands of islands from the Australian political jurisdiction? Determined people will still come. If a part of the nation is removed and if they think they would be advantaged by landing at some other point in the country, particularly on the mainland coast of Australia, that is simply where those people attempting to land will head for.
If we excise all of these islands, Australia will be sending a signal that people should go to the mainland. How does it help with border security if we send the signal `Go to the mainland'? We will have unauthorised arrivals on the mainland of Australia, with all of the associated disease, security risks and humanitarian issues that follow, as people will pull up on very remote stretches of the Australian coastline. It cannot be logically contended that excising islands that you can see from the coastline, that you can swim to—and you can actually walk back and forth to some of these islands at low tide—is going to effectively prevent people-smuggling. It is a nonsense claim.
If we look at the other side of the coin and assume that the Liberal government gets this bill through the Senate and these islands are excised, is that a stop sign? No, it is not. People come to excised places now. What happens when they go to these excised places is that they are taken to Papua New Guinea and Nauru for processing. Excision is not a stop sign: it is a different processing regime in a different place. As these people who enter Australia, refugees, are processed they are sorted into refugees and non-refugees. What happens in the longer term? We take the genuine refugees. But what else happens over the longer term? We have all of the return problems with the non-refugees that we have with those who are processed on mainland Australia. It is a fantasy world of getting this wider excision in place.  
Labor support fast processing arrangements. If the Liberal government had a credible plan to make Australia's arrangements faster, we would support it. The Labor Party came up with a faster processing regime in their policy announcement last week. The Liberal government knows that it is not going to be able to operate the so-called Pacific solution forever, no matter how many excisions it can obtain. We have to confront the real problem. The Labor Party will support genuine attempts to deal with the real problem. A comprehensive and long-term solution is necessary. Activities that have been undertaken overseas by the Federal Police and by Immigration Compliance have made a difference. They have made a difference to people-smuggling and the opportunity for people smugglers to go about their evil trade.
What we have is a Liberal government that is adopting a political strategy rather than a credible strategy for dealing with the refugee issue. It is very important that refugees are processed in their source countries. Fixing the issues which cause them to flee, engaging in processing and care and protection in countries of first asylum, and engaging in agreements with those transit countries are all important aspects of finding a long-term solution to this issue. What has stopped boats coming, so far, is the effective work of the Australian Federal Police and Compliance personnel. The Labor Party supports that. If there is anything additional that can reasonably be done—and the Labor Party has outlined a number of additional initiatives in its policy launch of last week—the Labor Party is prepared to support it, consistent with the policy it announced last week. But the Labor Party does not support this irrational political agenda which calls for the removal of thousands of islands from the Australian political jurisdiction.
We have had a number of so-called border protection strategies from the Liberal government. This bill represents its fifth strategy. The first was the pre-Tampa strategy, when 213 boats came into Australian waters carrying thousands of refugees and, of course, nothing happened. Then the government adopted its second strategy, which was the post-Tampa strategy—the so-called Pacific solution. It is no coincidence that that was adopted shortly before the election was called. In April we had the third strategy— the long-term detention strategy for Australia. Then in May this year we had a fourth strategy put forward in the context of the May budget. The fourth strategy was different from the April strategy announced only some 34 days before. Now we have the fifth strategy from this Liberal government, which is to remove from Australian jurisdiction thousands of islands around the coastline of Australia.
What sort of defence of Australia as a nation does removing thousands of islands from our political jurisdiction represent? It represents a capitulation, a surrender. Removing bits and pieces of Australia represents an admission that we cannot defend the longstanding borders of Australia. What will be next? Presumably, if this fifth strategy does not work, the government will go on and remove places like Fraser Island—or King Island or Flinders Island located in Bass Strait—or perhaps go even further and remove the island on which I live, Tasmania. Where does all this stop? To cut out bits of Australia is not an effective strategy for dealing with refugees.
Since one of my colleagues spoke on this matter in the other place, the legislation has been before the Senate committee for a comprehensive examination. I understand that Senator Bolkus and other colleagues of mine in this place carried out a thorough examination of this legislation. Looking at the transcript of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee to which this bill was referred, there are a couple of very interesting pieces of evidence. The first that I refer to is that of the Acting Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ed Killesteyn. He told the Senate committee that the effect of the bill would be to encourage people smugglers to head for the Australian coast. He said: 
It is a simple matter of geography. If you remove the outlying islands from the capacity of smugglers to simply drop off their cargo, they are forced to look for other routes ...
Then we had another piece of very interesting evidence from the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Mick Keelty. He went even further and confirmed that with regard to refugees seeking to enter Australia they would prefer to have people arrive on shore. He said:
This is a far preferable way for us to go ...
	...	...	...
... if they are going to commit a crime in the way they are sending people to Australia, we can at least try to get them sent to where there is ... some infrastructure support for them.
These are two statements from senior bureaucrats. They show that aiming for the mainland is not just an effect of this bill; it is the intent. The Liberal government is effectively saying that the job of defending our borders is so difficult that we will cop out of it and surrender off bits and pieces of Australia. It is an indication that this government does not care about genuinely solving this issue. It is simply playing politics and maximising votes in respect of the matter.
Over the last three or four years unauthorised boat arrivals have landed on Australia's east coast in places such as Cairns, Townsville, Macksville—near Kempsey in New South Wales—and even as far south as Port Kembla. This government bill is fundamentally flawed. It is fundamentally stupid and counterproductive legislation. It simply lays out the welcome mat for similar landings to occur in future. It is in the national interest that the Labor Party will not be supporting this particular bill, as on the previous occasion we voted against the regulations that sought to accomplish the removal of thousands of offshore islands from political jurisdiction, islands that have been within the jurisdiction of the Australian nation since Australia was founded as a nation. Effective defence is defending all of Australia's borders—the Australian nation—not cutting bits and pieces out of it and establishing different political jurisdictions. This bill is a surrender sign from this government. It is a sign, given that this is its fifth strategy since September of last year, that the government intends to surrender up parts of the Australian jurisdiction. It should not be tolerated. Consistent with its previous vote on the regulations that were attempted to be shoved through this place, the Labor Party will not be supporting this particular bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-12-09,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002. In short, this legislation is re-running an initial attempt to put through by regulation an excision of many thousands of islands—I think over 4,000 was the eventual advice the committee received— across all of Northern Australia. The area is basically from halfway up Western Australia, all the way over the top of Australia, then back down past a large chunk of Queensland, with the intent of having all of that area exempt from the operations of the Migration Act for the purpose of claiming protection. The Democrats opposed the attempt by the government to excise those islands by way of regulation earlier this year and we likewise oppose the attempt to do exactly the same thing now by way of legislation.
I commend to the Senate and to the public at large the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee into the migration zone excision issue. The report put forward a number of recommendations, one of which was to oppose the legislation, and quite a good outline of the issue. From the Democrats' point of view it is a great tragedy that before the last election the major parties in the Senate prevented the Senate committee from having the opportunity to examine the whole proposal to excise islands from the Australian migration zone. The Democrats welcome the Labor Party's opposition to this legislation. It is impossible, however, not to comment on the Labor Party's ongoing support for the existing excision of Christmas Island, the Cocos Islands and Ashmore Reef from the migration zone. It is difficult to see the logic in opposing the excision of all the other islands but continuing to support the existing excision of some islands from the migration zone. Obviously we need to welcome the Labor Party's willingness not to extend those excisions, but what is needed is a winding back of that injustice. 
An interesting component of this report, which I have recommended that all people read, is the last couple of pages—appendix No. 3—which talk about the classes of visas and the merits review and judicial review rights of various people depending on how they entered Australia and which part of it they entered. The additional levels of complexity that this government, with the support of the ALP, has put into the Migration Act, creating all these different classes of people depending on that aspect, are a source of continuing amazement. If unauthorised people land on the mainland or on these other islands that the government is attempting to excise, without having contact with Christmas Island, for example, then they could get an onshore temporary protection visa. If they land on the mainland with a tourist visa or a visitor visa of some sort and then claim protection, they can get a permanent protection visa. In both cases, they can get their applications reviewed by an independent tribunal—independent in theory— such as the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Migration Review Tribunal. In both cases, there is still scope—although it is very limited scope and it is still arguable how limited it is—for them to appeal through the courts.
On the other hand, if they land on the mainland in an unauthorised way having previously landed at an excised place such as Christmas Island, then that same person can be standing next to another person in Australia but have no right to any visa in Australia unless the minister exercises his discretion and lifts that bar on applying. Therefore, they have no right to a visa and no right to merits review by the Refugee Review Tribunal; they are called an offshore entry person.
Similarly, if people apply whilst at sea in territorial waters and with no previous contact with Christmas Island, they are eligible to make an application. As they are not in the migration zone, their protection claim would be assessed, subject to meeting criteria. But they would have no rights to review, although an Australian sponsor might have review rights to the MRT for certain classes of visa and they might still have review rights in the courts. Again, there is a different set of criteria for people who apply while at sea having previously had contact with an excised place but whose boat was not intercepted at those areas. So they land on Christmas Island, go back out to sea and then apply while at sea—there is a different set-up again. If they apply from the Christmas Island processing centre after being intercepted at sea, then again they have no rights to a visa.
What this means, and what will be continued under the Labor Party's policy, is that people who are on excised lands in Australia have no right to apply directly for a visa under the Migration Act. Therefore, they have no right to any independent review of that visa and no access to the High Court, at least in relation to a visa decision. Ironically, they will have access to the High Court in relation to anything else that happens to them on Christmas Island under Australian law, as long as it is not to do with the actions of Commonwealth officers operating under the auspices of the Migration Act. For example, if they were robbed or anything else whilst they were on Christmas Island, they would have access to the courts for that but not in relation to a visa decision.
Similarly, people who apply from a declared country processing centre such as Nauru and who have had previous contact with an excised place such as Christmas Island do have access to a visa class—an offshore visa class called a secondary movement offshore entry (temporary) visa class. If they apply from a declared country processing centre such as Nauru after being intercepted at sea but without being in contact with Christmas Island, then there is a different visa class again—the secondary movement relocation (temporary) visa class. All of those have no right to review and usually have no right to a judicial review.
So, apart from anything else, you have this ridiculously complex visa regime applying to a whole lot of different people, all of whom are basically just seeking protection or asylum, and, depending on when they were intercepted and which piece of dirt they put their toe on first, they have a whole set of different rights. This is clearly a blatant breach of the refugee convention. Despite this, as we have heard time after time in various inquiries in this place and in government responses to opinions from the UNHCR, other UN bodies, and Australian bodies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Australian government simply says, `That might be your opinion but it's not ours; we don't breach anything.' It just so happens that nobody else in the world agrees with them, but that does not matter! This legislation is simply another attempt to extend that absurdity. 
The report is useful because it also highlights the way the whole process works in terms of the offshore entry components of the Migration Act. In terms of what this bill seeks to do, the fundamental principle from the Democrats' point of view is that you should not have people in different parts of Australia with different rights depending on which part of Australia they are in or, even worse, people who are side by side in Australia with different rights depending on whether they got here via the mainland or got here via Christmas Island and then were put on the mainland. That is a ridiculous principle and it should not be recognised in any context.
Once it is recognised—as it currently is, unfortunately, under the existing Migration Act—then the same sorts of principles can be extended or applied to other areas of the legislative regime. That adds an extra reason to why the Democrats so strongly oppose this whole legislative regime. It is not just because of the terrible impact it has on genuine asylum seekers but also because of the general principle, the general undermining of the rule of law and the introduction of very dangerous legal precedents that, once they are in place, are able to be pointed to by this government or future governments to say, `This is already operating in this area of the law. There should therefore be no objection to extending it to another area of the law.' That is a very dangerous path to go down.
Fundamental components about equal treatment under the law are something that should not be waived, except in the most extreme circumstances. And despite all the rhetoric and all the hype about the so-called security risk and the need to protect Australia's borders et cetera, it is quite clear that asylum seekers do not pose a significant risk to the Australian community. They certainly do not pose a security risk and they certainly do not pose a threat to our safety. As we are now so tragically aware, the real threat to our safety comes from terrorists and extremists in our region, not from asylum seekers, many of whom are trying to flee such extremists and terrorists in the areas which they came from.
Surely it is now time to revisit the entirety of the Pacific solution and to recognise that we need to refocus our attention and our resources. By that I mean refocusing not just the money but the enormous amount of defence resources and personnel, intelligence resources and personnel and bureaucratic resources away from this area, which does not present a significant threat to Australia's security, and channelling those resources to where the real threat is.
Similarly, we can scrap the absurd legal regime that puts in place legal principles and legal precedents that fundamentally undermine our rule of law and instead once again have a legal framework that is consistent, that meets our international obligations and that enables us to have a framework for assessing refugees that we can once again market to the rest of the world, which has a much bigger issue with this matter than we do. That is where this debate needs to go. I hope the fact that the ALP are holding firm on this provides a good benchmark for us to then start winding back in some of the other areas. I recognise the political difficulties they are in, and I do not want to make massive political capital out of it, but eventually they have to decide which side they are on. I think there has been an attempt to reconcile two fundamentally contradictory positions.
I go to some of the recommendations in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee's quite positive report. I was a member of this committee during its inquiry and signed up to its recommendations. The committee recommended: 
... initial assessments of claim for refugee status by offshore entry persons should be reviewed by an external body such as the federal magistracy or the Refugee Review Tribunal.
I agree with that, but that does not match Labor's new policy. The abolition of declared countries should be welcomed, and I understand that Labor's new policy does go that far whilst shifting things across to Christmas Island. The one thing you could say is a benefit of Christmas Island rather than Nauru and PNG is that at least it is in Australia, at least there is potential scope for people to try to exercise their rights under the Constitution. I have no doubt that there will be some interesting legal cases in the next year or two trying to determine exactly what those rights are and whether or not the legislation that was passed last year in a rush before the federal election is constitutional in some aspects. I certainly hope that it is not. There is no doubt that there are strong legal arguments that parts of it are not. As always, we will have to wait for the judgment of the High Court in that regard, rather than speculating about it here.
An interesting part of the report goes to section 46A of the Migration Act. This is the part of the act that allows the minister to exercise discretion to enable people to apply for a visa. The committee recommended that the government review the operation of section 46A:
... to ensure that those asylum seekers coming directly from a place of persecution are not penalised by virtue of their place of entry into Australia.
It is quite clear that the law as it currently stands means that asylum seekers can be penalised by virtue of their place of entry into Australia, and that will continue. Thankfully, with this legislation being defeated this will not be expanded, but the fact remains that an offshore entry person who comes directly from a place of persecution—and that has occurred; people have come direct from Sri Lanka, for example, across to the Cocos Islands—will be treated differently from a person who has come direct from a country and landed in some other part of Australia. That is a legal absurdity and it is an arrangement that beggars belief, particularly when you look at trying to build alliances with other countries about how best to deal with this broader problem.
I was fortunate to be able to spend two or three weeks in July visiting a number of countries in Europe, looking at how they are dealing with the issue of unauthorised movements of people. All of us here would know that the numbers of unauthorised people that European countries have to deal with are vastly greater than those which Australia has had to deal with in recent years. People may also know that a much lower percentage of those people that apply for asylum in most parts of Europe end up being accepted and recognised as refugees, although another proportion are accepted on humanitarian or family grounds.
This does not contrast at all with the sort of situation that Australia has had. Previously, Australia could have been engaging, selling internationally and highlighting the strengths of our positive system with our humanitarian program, our resettlement program and our migration program across the board, which many European countries do not have. We could be looking at greatly increasing our direct assistance to countries of first asylum. Instead of spending all of the hundreds of millions of dollars that we are spending, for example, on building the new detention centre on Christmas Island, that money could be put into countries of first asylum or countries adjoining refugee hot spots. It would make a great deal of difference in preventing secondary movements of people.
All of this would be far more effective and far more constructive in terms of the long-term solution, which will only come about through working cooperatively with other countries. Instead of that, we have put out a message and a legislative regime that says, `The way you deal with this is to put up a wall, take away people's legal rights and be as nasty to them as you possibly can so that they will not come here and will go somewhere else.' All that could possibly do—if that works—is encourage everybody else to do the same thing and be equally as nasty. I do not think that is an effective or sustainable long-term way of dealing with the issue. The global pressures are too big to simply deal with it by having all of the developed world saying, `We'll just be more nasty towards people fleeing persecution and that'll stop them coming here.' That is not going to work. You do not need to think about it for too long before you recognise that it is not going to work. 
The government may say, and I am sure that the minister in his final statement will say, that this policy has succeeded—nobody has arrived for a year: success. They have already said that a number of times in this chamber. On a very narrow definition of `success'—which is, `Let's not have people arriving here unauthorised in boats'—that is successful. If you are looking at a broader definition of `Let's not cause immense suffering to vulnerable people, let's not split up families, let's not have people drown at sea, let's not have people who are part of the Australian community suffering enormously in immense poverty for prolonged periods of time'—
—Ha!
—Senator McGauran finds that amusing, but I do not think many other people do—then let's not call that successful. That is what we are causing directly as a result of this government's policy.
—No-one has drowned for 12 months.
—If Senator McGauran likes the idea of having lots of impoverished refugees in the Australian community unable to settle down, unable to be reunited with their families—if you put it in that context—I do not think he is in the majority. If he is in the majority, then I can tell you that the Democrats will not rest until that view is in the minority—not just for political purposes but because it is in Australia's interests to have a country that will treat every person equally.
Beyond all else, that is what is fundamentally abhorrent about this legislation: it does not treat people equally. That is a principle we should never adhere to. Once the principle is accepted that one group of people in the community—because of particular characteristics they have—can be treated differently under the law in the assistance they get or do not get and in whether or not we will let them be part of the community, it is a very short step to create different political dynamics to make it acceptable for another group of people to be so treated. And who knows what the next group of people to be targeted will be.
That is why it is important to resist these sorts of things. More broadly, we have already seen the targeting of Muslims in some of the rhetoric of Senator McGauran and his fellow travellers. We have seen a targeting of people who want to promote peace, rather than just blindly going to war. Once you get a divisive approach that is legitimised via a legislative framework, it could be applied in all sorts of different ways. That is why it is crucial that people stand up in the face of legislation like this. That is why the Democrats will continue to oppose this measure.
We welcome the ALP's opposition to it as well. We will continue to encourage them— constructively, I am sure—to move their position even further so that the disgracefully negative and destructive legislative framework that was passed by this chamber in September last year can be wound back and, once again, Australia can hold its head up high as a country that defends human rights and tries to work with vulnerable people rather than punish them.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2002-12-09,"—I rise to speak in support of this very important bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002, and I rise not only proudly as part of government but also as a senator for the Northern Territory. I have a number of constituents who reside on the islands that this bill deals with. They have comprehensively told me that they would like me to support this bill going through this place.
This bill is a very important part of the coalition's overall strategy to combat people-smuggling. I can recall, even before I came to this place, as someone who was a user of the seas in the Northern Territory, that much of the discussion revolved around what appeared to be almost a tidal wave of people coming to this country. In the first three weeks of August 2001—it was almost unprecedented—we had 1,212 unauthorised arrivals in Australia. Credible intelligence suggested that another 5,000 people were already signed up to travel in the same way. Clearly, unless something was done, around 8,000 unauthorised arrivals were due in 2001-02, growing to 12,000 in 2002-03. 
Not only was this tidal wave of people coming to this country in an unlawful manner and giving great concern in relation to our resources; it would also have eliminated our capacity to help the most needy in this particular regard—those forgotten refugees; those people who cannot afford to pay people smugglers to bring them to places of protection. I am talking about the people in long-term camps in Palestine who, for three generations now, have been behind the walls of refugee camps. I am talking about individuals in Somalia. You can imagine their plight. For example, there is the plight of one woman with five children in a camp in Somalia who now has to prostitute herself just to feed her children. Even if she survives AIDS, the chances of her being able to get to this country while other people interdict the process and pay people smugglers to come here are extremely unlikely. While her position—where things may seem to become better every month because one of her children dies and she has fewer mouths to feed—is not a very palatable one, it is a fact.
Australia has been particularly attractive to what is parochially referred to as queuejumpers. They get access to a comprehensive and generous refugee determination and to medical benefits and income support, and the support of various NGOs, churches and civil libertarian groups. That is what this country is all about. It is a beautiful sun-kissed country, and no-one denies the right of people to wish to come to live here. The rest of the world probably want to come to live in Australia, but they will need to do so in a lawful way. Most importantly, people smugglers are able to offer refugees the potential to obtain lawful residence in Australia. That is well beyond what the convention on refugees gives anyone. Refugees do not have the right within the convention to determine the place under which they can seek protection. It is interesting, in terms of leadership, to hear a bit about the policy from the other side. Mr Kim Beazley, the leader at the time, said:
It is in the national interest of all Australians that our generous attitude towards refugees is not undermined by people who seek to flout that generosity by placing themselves ahead of others in the queue who are determined by an orderly process to be more deserving. These are all positions which ought to be commonly agreed in this nation and commonly agreed in this parliament.
Good advice—and no doubt some in the Labor Party would say it was good advice from a good leader.
Something had to be done at that stage to prevent the growing trend of people-smuggling. People smugglers were selling this very attractive package of Australia and what it had to offer, which would effectively have undermined the international system of protection. How were we to respond? How did the Howard government respond? There were a number of steps. This was a very comprehensive challenge which needed to be met with a comprehensive suite of processes to ensure that we could ameliorate the scourge of people-smuggling. In a legislative sense, we had the power to move people to declared countries like Nauru and Manus Island. We had the power to detain vessels and to interdict at sea. We introduced a new offshore humanitarian program that would encourage people not to take this very dangerous journey from the places which they departed to come to Australia. It was run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, a very respected organisation. These were accepted processes which ensured that those people, under this Australian government funded program, who wished to have a determination made on their refugee status could be heard in those places so that they did not have to leave those very safe shores.
We introduced a maximum sentence of 20 years and a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for people-smuggling. We introduced a $220,000 fine—certainly a disincentive to come to this place in that way. But, most importantly, we prevented visa applications from unauthorised arrivals on Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island. They were very important parts of legislation that we changed. We went beyond that. This is not only about legislation but about policy. It is about how we act in a number of other ways. We have increased the number of speciality compliance officers in key overseas posts. We have placed departmental officers in key overseas airports where they train airline staff to ensure we do not get bogus documentation. 
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Before the dinner break I was sharing with the house the very positive nature of the comprehensive strategy and policy regime laid down by the Howard government to ameliorate the worst parts of the heinous crime of people-smuggling. In terms of policy, the government have not only posted special liaison officers to key overseas posts to liaise on important issues like re-admission and resettlement but also maintained multifunction task forces, both in Australia and overseas, which coordinate investigations and, very importantly, collect intelligence. The task forces frequently update Australia's movement alert list, which is a key tool governing the entry of non-citizens and in establishing the character and security status of those people.
The intergovernmental consultations on asylum in Europe, North America and Australia are leadership roles. We are showing the world the way in regard to these matters. The Asia-Pacific consultation on refugees concerns irregular migration and migrant traffic in East and South-East Asia. There is the Pacific rim intelligence officers conference. Another great step in leadership was taken and a real bipartisan approach—unlike what we get from the other side of the chamber—was shown by both Indonesia and Australia when they cohosted the regional ministerial conference on people-smuggling in February this year.
All the changes the government have made are quite clearly not only lawful but also consistent with our international obligations. At the moment we have credible information to indicate that people smugglers could be turning their interests away from the areas we have excised—because those very good disincentives have worked, have hit home—and looking to places further to the east, particularly islands further to the east. Most importantly, people smugglers are looking for places that are not excised offshore locations, because the product that they are selling requires a migration outcome.
This information has not come from someone we just had a yarn to in the pub; this came from the People Smuggling Task Force, which was set up to coordinate all aspects of intelligence, including from the Attorney-General's Department—and ASIO through that department—the Australian Federal Police and Customs. The task force coordinated all the intelligence it could get together in a cooperative sense to ensure that the information we had was validated. As I said, we had credible information to indicate that people smugglers have now turned their interests to non-excised places to the east, which are clearly the islands we are intending to deal with in this legislation today. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill proposes nothing that is too complicated—it is further border protection, which this entire house agreed to.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I have just laid out for you the credentials of the Howard government that show that we are experts in this policy. We are international leaders. I wonder why the Labor Party are resisting this border protection measure. In their recent policy announcement, they actually supported the existing legislation regarding Christmas Island, Cocos Island, Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island. In fact, they fought so hard for it that it has been reported it was a substantial plank in the decision of one of their frontbenchers to move from the front bench. Why would they have gone through all of that division in their party? It was because they knew that there is only one policy in this regard. If you look at the great mountain in front of you there is only one path up it. The Labor Party should just see that we have the right path. We are internationally renowned experts in this matter, and the Labor Party should look to us for the policy. 
The whole issue of trying to pander to the far left of the Labor Party is really going to put them out of step with reality and the wider community. As Kim Beazley, one of the previous leaders of the Labor Party, said at the time:
This bill is being supported because it is legal, because it is workable and because it will be effective
These are prophetic words indeed because that is exactly what this legislation was. This legislation became the most effective suite of policy measures that has been put in place to ameliorate the problem of 1,212 people coming to these shores in three weeks. I have heard people say in this place: `What's that to crow about? You've only gone for 12 months without a boat coming here.' This is absolute evidence that this is the only policy.
I am absolutely mystified as to why the Labor Party think walking on both sides of the street is going to somehow impress people. The current leader of the Labor Party, Simon Crean, said:
I don't see how we strengthen our borders by surrendering them ...
He is alluding to the issue of sovereignty. A bipartisan committee looked at the issue of sovereignty and found there was no issue with sovereignty. In fact, we are talking about the sovereignty of the islands that I represent in my constituency—and that Senator Crossin represents in her constituency. Those people have said to us clearly: `We support the legislation. Make sure it goes through the house. It is most important to protect our borders, our culture and our environment.' The existing excision of Christmas Island has worked comprehensively and it has been based on excellent policy. Again, I will quote Mr Sciacca, a former opposition spokesman on immigration, who stated:
I want to say on behalf of the opposition that we support these bills in the spirit of bipartisanship, because we are concerned about the effects of people-smuggling and about the integrity of our borders. 
I do not see that bipartisan spirit here today. I would suggest to the opposition: do not be ashamed of following the only path up the mountain; do not be ashamed of following the only good policy that is around; do not be ashamed of perhaps admitting that, coming from a policy-free zone in this area, we actually have to go somewhere. If the Labor Party continue to pander to the Jurassic Park of the Left, they are going to continually be out of step with the wider community. I really believe that, unless the Labor Party support this legislation, the public will quite rightly see that Labor have been soft on border protection and out of step with the views and demands of the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-12-09,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 is a self-defeating bill that, if enacted, will do much harm to Australia's international reputation and will show the government's defiance of international law conventions and proper practice. It will do little to achieve the government's stated aim of border protection. With this bill, the government is attempting to excise from Australia's migration zone approximately 4,900 islands off the western, northern and eastern coasts of Australia that are home to approximately 21,000 residents.
The bill seeks to extend the definition of `excised offshore place' under the Migration Act, such that any person arriving on these excised islands would be deemed an offshore entry person. Some of these 4,900 islands are so close to the Australian mainland that, as Senator Sherry said earlier, they can actually be seen by the naked eye, and in some cases you can even walk to them. We have to ask ourselves why an asylum seeker, after a torturous and dangerous journey on a leaky boat, would land on such an island with mainland Australia in sight. In my view, this is beyond comprehension. The effect of the bill will be to establish mainland Australia as the goal for asylum seekers arriving by boat. The bill will not stop asylum seekers from coming to Australia—desperate people will do whatever they can, and there is no doubt that asylum seekers are desperate people. An ill-conceived bill such as this will not form any part of a long-term solution for border security. 
This was the conclusion reached by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, of which I am a member, which inquired into this legislation and reported to the Senate in October this year. Despite ministerial statements that the objective of this legislation is to enhance border protection by deterring people from arriving on mainland Australia, the committee heard that this will not be achieved under the terms of this bill. For example, in its submission to the committee the Australian Federal Police acknowledged that this bill will `draw people towards the mainland'. DIMIA also told the committee that the bill will require people smugglers to bring their vessels closer to mainland Australia. In an answer to a question on notice DIMIA acknowledged this when they said:
The Bill, by extending excised offshore places to islands off the northern coast of Australia, and therefore requiring people smugglers to bring their vessels closer to mainland Australia ...
Not only will people smugglers bring their human cargo closer to the mainland if this bill is passed; they will also put those people in even graver danger than at present. The International Commission of Jurists argued before the committee:
... by forcing refugees fleeing persecution by sea to push on for the mainland in order to activate their rights under the [Refugee] Convention, Australia is placing them in a more perilous situation with further grave risk to their health and safety, particularly in areas with coral reefs.
It is because of these concerns that I have referred to, and others to which I will refer shortly, that recommendation 1 of the Senate committee's report is that the bill not proceed. It is the self-defeating nature of this bill that has led the opposition to oppose it both here and in the other place. After hearing evidence given to the Senate inquiry into this bill, I for one was left wondering when the government would begin to excise parts of the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The Prime Minister has claimed that excising parts of the Australian mainland is an absolutely ludicrous proposition, but does that mean never, ever? Senator Scullion, from the Northern Territory, who spoke a moment ago but has now left the chamber, has said that he feels very strongly that we should excise parts of mainland Australia. While the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs told Senator Scullion that excision of the mainland is not the government's current policy, Senator Scullion has since stated, `But I'm not so sure that that's necessarily off the radar.' So with that public admission from a government senator that this may be a future plan of the government, one does wonder where the excisions will stop.
The Senate and the Commonwealth parliament must not head down the legislative path of passing this bill in an unamended form. The Senate committee that I referred to earlier heard of numerous other concerns about the bill over the course of its inquiry. Many witnesses warned of the possible breaches of Australia's international obligations that will be effected by the bill if it is enacted into law. The committee heard of significant concerns in this regard from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, international law experts and legal and human rights groups, as well as many other individuals and organisations. It is clear, and it was made clear to us over the course of the committee's hearings, that the refugee convention applies to all of sovereign Australia, based on our signing of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969. Article 27 of that treaty provides that a state cannot `invoke the provisions of its internal law as a justification for its failure to conform with the provisions of the treaty'.
Much of the evidence that the committee received concerned Australia's international obligations, particularly the obligation of non-refoulement of refugees under the refugee convention. When Australia signed the refugee convention, it committed this country in article 33(1) to non-refoulement of refugees. This obligation prohibits Australia from returning a refugee `in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened.' This article also extends to `chain refoulement', whereby Australia shall not send a refugee to a country where he or she will be returned to the place of persecution. Similar obligations are imposed under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is also a party. The committee heard about instances of possible refoulement—in particular, when the government turns boats around and sends them back to Indonesia. The Australian Lawyers for Human Rights submitted to the committee: 
If an asylum-seeker is returned to Indonesia by Australia and subsequently refouled, Australia remains responsible for that person. Australia is the precipitator of chain refoulement.
Because Indonesia is not a party to the refugee convention, we in Australia can have little confidence that, by sending boats back to Indonesia, the asylum seekers will not be refouled. We could be creating a situation where refugees are in effect left in limbo: they find themselves in Indonesia without protection, they cannot find a resettlement location and, most certainly, they cannot return to where they were persecuted. Concerns were also raised with the committee of possible refoulement in the situation where Australia sends refugees from excised islands to declared countries such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru in accordance with the government's so-called Pacific solution. When this occurs, again there is no guarantee that asylum seekers would not be refouled, particularly those sent to Nauru—a country which is not a signatory to the refugee convention. As South Australian law lecturer Rebecca LaForgia told the committee:
If the non-refoulement provision is to mean anything, then it must be a substantive right that, if you are a refugee, you will not be returned. A substantive right requires a certain element of publicness, accountability and lawfulness. 
This is the core of the issue. It is impossible for Australia to know whether or not these refugees sent by Australia to other nations are being refouled or not. This government will not make inquiries as to, nor will it monitor, the fate of these asylum seekers. Our international obligations are not satisfied by turning people around and sending them on their way. As I said, under this bill Australia will send offshore entry persons—the asylum seekers who land on excised islands—to countries that are declared by the minister. However, there is no requirement in the Migration Act that these countries give an undertaking of non-refoulement. Furthermore, because of the government's well-known dislike of judicial review, the minister's declaration under section 198A is not reviewable in any court.
The committee, of which I was a part, heard various concerns about the lack of open and accountable guidelines in processing claims of asylum seekers in these declared or third countries. Before the committee, DIMIA denied that there is any breach of Australia's international obligations associated with the processing of asylum seeker claims in declared countries. In evidence to the committee, DIMIA said that our international obligations are met through ensuring that any asylum seeker who arrives at one of those places has his or her claims for recognition as a refugee individually assessed. Despite the assurances of DIMIA, the committee still had significant concerns about the entire process of declaration of countries for the processing of refugee claims.
Under the bill, as I said, the minister will have the power in section 198A of the Migration Act to declare a country as one for processing. This power is not reviewable. It requires no undertaking by the country concerned as to the non-refoulement of asylum seekers and it does not require the minister to revoke the declaration if he or she is no longer satisfied that the country meets appropriate human rights standards. In response to these concerns expressed to the committee, the committee in recommendation 3 of its report stated:
... that the use of declared countries for holding and assessing claims for refugee status by those who have entered Australian territory at an excised offshore place should be abandoned.
The committee further recommended in recommendation 4 that if the government does not abandon this practice then the Migration Act should be amended to incorporate requirements as to the meeting of appropriate human rights standards and in recommendation 5 that there be statutory recognition of standards in processing claims. 
Further concerns expressed to the committee in relation to the bill focused on the reliance on the ministerial discretion under section 46A. Under this section, the minister has a discretion to lift the prohibition on an offshore entry person applying for a visa while in Australia. However, there is no obligation on the minister to take any action in relation to offshore entry persons, nor even to consider an application. The committee heard evidence that the act does not oblige Australia to take any action but merely allows the government to detain and transfer offshore entry persons. There were also serious concerns expressed to the committee that offshore entry persons could remain on an excised island and be left, in effect, in legal limbo with no recourse to apply for a visa and no right to judicial review. Such persons may be unable to apply for a visa while still in Australia and yet be barred from initiating any legal proceedings. Under section 494AA of the act, certain legal proceedings relating to offshore entry persons are barred. These include proceedings relating to an offshore entry, to the status of an offshore entry person and to the taking of a person to a declared country. Although this provision recognises that the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution is not affected, this would be of little practical benefit to an asylum seeker. The committee was of the view that the ministerial discretion to `lift the bar' is not an adequate mechanism. Recommendation 7(i) of the committee was that the government review the operation of section 46A to ensure that there is no possibility that offshore entry persons are left in a `legal limbo'. 
The committee also heard submissions that article 31 of the refugee convention is another international obligation which is not complied with in the terms of this bill. Article 31 deals specifically with people coming directly from a country where their freedom is threatened and states that no penalties shall be placed upon them for their illegal presence. The government points to the ministerial discretion to allow a refugee application under section 46A, to which I just referred, in order to show its compliance with article 31. However, the committee was not satisfied with this for the reasons I stated earlier: the ministerial discretion does not require the minister to do anything in relation to people coming directly from persecution and it is not judicially reviewable. There is no guarantee under this legislation that such persons will not be penalised, contrary to article 31. As a consequence, the committee recommended in recommendation 7(ii) that the government review section 46A to ensure that this cannot occur.
Finally, the committee was concerned about the retrospective operation of this bill. The bill proposes retrospective excision of the islands to which I have referred, back to 19 June 2002—that is, the date the regulations were rejected by the Senate. Retrospective legislation will always require a high level of justification for it to be enacted. The committee was of the view that there is no such justification for this bill. Even if such retrospectivity may have once been justified because of concerns that boats were en route to Australia, the lapse of time has made such retrospectivity unnecessary and excessive. Recommendation 10 of the committee's report is that if the bill does proceed its application should not be retrospective.
This bill is a short-sighted attempt at border protection. There are better, more sustainable ways to protect our borders and to ensure a fair opportunity for refugees to seek asylum in this country. I refer to Labor's recently announced policy on asylum seekers and refugees. A Labor government would put an end to the Pacific solution, which was the subject of extensive criticism during the hearings into this bill. Labor's policy will implement a long-term solution to the processing of asylum seeker claims. It will end processing of claims in declared countries, such as Nauru and Manus Island, thereby removing any potential for refoulement of refugees contrary to our international obligations. The committee heard many concerns about this during our inquiry. Under Labor's policy, Christmas Island will be maintained as a processing and detention facility where refugees will be processed in accordance with UNHCR guidelines. Such processing will deter unauthorised arrivals, because there will be no incentive to come to Australia by a leaky boat when the same processing guidelines apply on Christmas Island as in overseas refugee camps. 
Unlike Labor's long-term approach to providing a just and fair processing system for refugees while at the same time protecting Australia's borders, this bill fails in every intended respect. It fails to achieve border protection and at the same time exposes Australia to criticism for its failure to adhere to its international obligations. The Senate should not allow this cynical, short-sighted bill to pass unamended. I urge senators to support the opposition's amendments, which will reflect the recommendations in the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2002-12-09,"— I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002. It is important to recognise that this bill does not introduce any new concept in border protection. It does not propose any new measures in migration law. And it most certainly does not affect the rights of any Australian citizen or resident. It is entirely noncontroversial, except that it exposes the uncertainty and ambiguity that the Labor Party tries so desperately to hide as to how or even whether it would protect Australia's national interests. Rather, this bill makes minor extensions to the definition of excised offshore place which was inserted into the Migration Act by the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001—an amendment that was supported by the Labor Party and, it should be noted, continues to be supported by the Labor Party. This bill is an important part of the government's overall strategy to combat people-smuggling. We should all recognise the simple fact that this strategy has already worked. The message has gone out and it has been heeded. There has been no unauthorised boat arrival in Australia for nearly a year. Indeed, the Senate should note that the effectiveness of the government's policy has been recognised by the Labor Party. The retention of the excision of these offshore places is a key part of Labor's asylum seeker policy announced last week after much agonising by the ALP—and further agonising since then.
The Labor Party says it opposes this bill because of concerns about Australian sovereignty. The provisions in this bill have no effect whatsoever on the rights and wellbeing of any Australian citizen or resident in Australia on a valid visa, whether it be for permanent or temporary residency. This is an extremely important observation to make because of the type of red herring that the Labor Party constantly raises. The simple fact is that if Mr Crean, Ms Gillard and the rest of the Labor leadership were truly concerned about sovereignty then they would have—indeed, they should have—raised these concerns during the debate about the excision of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands last year. They did not raise them then and, as I noted before, they do not today.
So why do the Labor Party make such a hoo-ha about the nation's sovereignty being violated by excision? They do not want to be seen to oppose a policy that obviously works and they know that the extension of this policy would further strengthen the border protection capabilities instituted by the government, yet Mr Crean persists with the fiction that this bill means that we would be surrendering our borders. The truth is that Mr Crean is trying to walk both sides of the street, but he runs the risk of pandering to the lunatic sections in the Labor Party only to assist the people smugglers—those international criminals who are Australia's real enemies.
This bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee when it was introduced into this chamber. That inquiry turned into a classic political stunt by the Labor opposition. While every non-existing concern about human rights received an airing, notwithstanding lack of evidence, the only submission the inquiry received that expressed substantive and verifiable concerns, from the Indigenous communities in those places to which this bill is applicable, received no consideration in the recommendations of the inquiry. 
What the inquiry process did make clear—though this was not reflected in the inquiry's report—was that the provisions of this bill will have no effect whatsoever on Australia's continued observation of international treaty obligations regarding asylum seekers. We heard earlier Senator Kirk quote chapter and verse supposedly from the inquiry's report. What Senator Kirk did not tell the Senate is that none of the witnesses she quoted would declare, when pressed, that they were certain that any breach of such obligations would result from this bill passing into law. In fact, the representative of the UNHCR, when asked this question, specifically said that he did not believe this bill would cause Australia to violate human rights under our international treaty obligations.
An important outcome of this bill is that it would reinforce Australia's prospect of continuing to protect the people, the communities and the environment of Northern Australia from introduced pests and diseases by successfully discouraging unauthorised arrivals of people assisted by people smugglers. This was a concern repeatedly raised by the Indigenous communities of Northern Australia, who gave the bill their unqualified support. Senator Scullion—undoubtedly the one genuine representative in this chamber of Territorians and especially of the Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory—has already covered this aspect in his excellent discourse on this matter. I need only note that the ALP has once again ignored the interests—the expressed interests—of Indigenous Australians when these do not coincide with the ALP's own agenda.
This bill is about the government's commitment to work comprehensively in Australia's national interest by ensuring strong border protection and that no weak messages are being sent to people smugglers overseas. The previous decisions to excise Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef, Carter Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have, with a range of other initiatives, been successful in deterring boats from seeking access to Australia. The government believes that the additional excisions proposed would provide an additional deterrent and are an important part of the broader strategy of prevention, interdiction and deterrence. I urge ALP senators to put Australia's interests first and support the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I rise this evening to add a contribution to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002. As we all know, this bill is intended to excise more than 3,000 islands off the coast of Australia. As Senator Sherry said in his contribution, this bill was introduced probably minutes after the Senate disallowed the regulations under which it was first proposed to excise these islands. The government claims that this bill is aimed at deterring people smugglers. However, there is very little evidence to support this claim. The government has not offered a clear justification for the excisions detailed in this bill.
The government has stated that people smugglers are likely to look for new routes, given the excision of the usual routes—that is, to Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef. If the response to this is to cut off more islands, what is stopping the government from excising sections of the mainland next— Broome or Darwin, for example—under the same justification? Many of the islands lie extremely close to the Australian mainland. In some cases, people are able to walk to islands off the Northern Territory coast during low tide. That is certainly the case with islands which are as close to the northern shore as Milingimbi. The Darwin Surf Life Saving Club row their boat to the Tiwi Islands, and it only takes them some hours to do it. So we are not talking at all about sections of land that are large distances from the mainland. That demonstrates how close some of these islands are and how ridiculous it is to expect this bill to deter people smugglers. 
This legislation expects people smugglers to go past the islands to the mainland. This would in fact encourage those people smugglers to move past the islands to the mainland, rather than deter them. It also shows the level of understanding the government has about the region of Northern Australia— which seems, as the days roll on, to be very little—and the practical inadequacies that this bill presents. In addition, these islands are not necessarily on any direct route from Indonesia. A boat travelling from Indonesia could reach parts of the mainland more easily than it could divert to a number of the excised islands. 
I also mention that this bill does nothing to impact on the number of unauthorised airport arrivals, for example, which constitute a significant number. Unauthorised arrivals who land in an excised zone are not covered by Australian law, and consequently do not have any right to appeal a decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal or to access any Australian court. But, of course, that is exactly the way this government would want it. At the same time though, Australia has signed and ratified conventions and is obliged by international treaties not to expel, return or extradite people who are in danger of being persecuted. Therefore, it seems that asylum seekers who make the dangerous journey to an excised island will be stranded on an island that possibly does not have the resources or the infrastructure to support the people, and they may be homeless, desperate and traumatised, living in fear of their own and their families' lives.
Let us have a look at the process that this bill underwent in order to get here. We know that the local communities, particularly the ones that I have spoken to in the Northern Territory, were not consulted about this piece of legislation. In fact, there was much confusion about what this bill would generate.
—What did the Tiwi Islanders say?
—Let me pick up on that interjection from Senator Macdonald. The Tiwi Islanders are not happy about this piece of legislation. Robert Cleary, the new executive officer of their local government association, spoke without authorisation on their behalf and has since been chastised by those Indigenous people for doing so. Senator Macdonald, you know that Mr Cleary is a former local government minister for the Liberal Party in Tasmania. Given his background, why wouldn't he go on radio to champion the benefits of this legislation without the authorisation of the Indigenous people for whom he worked? So it is not correct to say the Indigenous people on the Tiwi Islands supported this legislation, because their spokesperson had no right to make the comments he did on radio. Perhaps you should do your homework before you make such interjections, Senator Macdonald.
The lack of consultation on behalf of the government has led to considerable community confusion about the nature of this measure. Even Senator Nigel Scullion himself admitted on radio that there has been significant confusion in the Northern Territory and on the islands as to what this is all about. He also admitted that the island residents were not consulted at all. Senator Scullion was sent on a rescue mission to the islands to save face. In the government's defence, however, Senator Scullion stated in a radio interview:
But, because it had no impact at all on Australians, there was an assumption that we didn't need to talk to anybody.
When it was suggested by the reporter that the idea to excise over 3,000 islands off the coast of Australia was hatched overnight, Senator Scullion replied, `Well, it was pretty much overnight.' It is no wonder Australians are confused, and no wonder there is little explanation given for this measure. It is little wonder that it has received so much criticism from the community and from the Labor Party as being an ad hoc bill.
The extent of these misunderstandings is not insignificant. There were newspaper reports of people in the Torres Strait actually welcoming the excision, based on a misunderstanding that it would increase their independence. People deserve to know what the government is conjuring up behind their back, especially when it is literally in their own backyard. These misunderstandings are not surprising, considering the government's lack of consultation with Indigenous people and people who live on these islands. No affected Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander communities were consulted before the government made the decision to excise them from Australia. In fact, I travelled to Goulburn Island and Croker Island and spoke to the people about this very matter. They were quite confused about it and wondered why on earth we would want to excise islands that they believed, under their law, were part of the mainland. 
If you know anything about Croker Island and Goulburn Island, you will know that they have a significant attachment to Oenpelli and Maningrida, which are communities on the coast of Northern Australia. That is their traditional land and cultural link, so to them this made absolutely no sense. The other thing that worried them when I spoke to them was that they were very frightened that this would mean that, if people landed on their island or were struggling on a boat off the shore of their coastline, they may be somewhat hesitant to assist those people. A comment was made to me: `Perhaps we should head out with a boat and ensure they get to the mainland so that their rights are protected.'
So it is true: these people were not consulted and did not understand this legislation. Then the government went ahead and launched an information kit 13 weeks after a decision was made, which simply compounded the insult. Regulations were made by the government to excise these islands on 7 June 2002; however, it was not until September that an information kit was distributed by mail to community organisations in the Northern Territory. Are we surprised at the date of the launch of the release of this kit? It happened to be the day before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee was coming to town to conduct its inquiry. My, my; what a coincidence!
Given that the government attempted to make regulations to excise islands in early June, it is interesting—and quite appalling— to note that an information kit was distributed three months after the decision was made to excise over 3,000 islands off our coast. If I remember correctly, what this government actually asked Indigenous organisations and ATSIC to do was to distribute the kit on its behalf. This made matters far worse. My office had a number of phone calls asking if I knew where the kit ought to be sent to—people in ATSIC were wondering what they ought to do with this kit. Far be it from me to suggest that, as always when it comes to Indigenous people, the government had not done its work and consulted them properly and consistently. But that is never an issue or a priority with this government. Despite the fact that no-one at all on these islands was consulted prior to either the regulations being made or this legislation being drafted, the government intends to excise those islands. The minister has asked island residents to look out for suspicious vessels in the region. The government has actually decided that these residents will now be Australia's front line of defence. Consultation prior to the decision being made to excise islands was not even attempted by this government.
This is quite significant, as it illustrates very well the lack of thought that has gone into this so-called policy. This is not even a quick fix in an attempt to discourage people-smuggling. This bill is ill-conceived and ill-targeted, to say the least. Not even the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier of Queensland, or Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, were consulted on this issue. They were subsequently informed, on 6 June, but no initial consultation was pursued prior to the decision being made. When the government was questioned about the level of consultation with the communities and how information was distributed, a response was given that was absolutely inadequate. In answering questions that I put on notice, Senator Ellison, representing the Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, stated:
The Government's Anti-People Smuggling Taskforce provided information in early June that people smugglers would target islands closer to the Australian mainland. The organisers were believed to be avoiding Christmas and Ashmore Islands, and intending routes via waters off northern Australia.
In order to ensure the integrity of Australia's borders, it was necessary for the Government to act as quickly as possible to discourage future people smuggling operations. Accordingly, the Government made Regulations on 7 June 2002 to excise further offshore islands.
Given this explanation, and reasoning given by this government, there is nothing stopping the government from excising parts of the mainland. If the government receives similar information which suggests that people smugglers will in the future target the mainland, what on earth will be the government's course of action then? It seems logical that this government will simply excise those parts of the mainland that may be targeted. In fact, Senator Scullion, again in a radio interview, stated: 
I felt very strongly that we should excise in fact parts of mainland Australia.
Senator Scullion only changed his mind in relation to this statement because, I understand, the minister called him and explained that that may be a breach of international conventions. Therefore, Senator Scullion changed his tune, but he still maintains that it is `not off the radar'. The minister may want to clarify for us whether or not there are plans to excise parts of mainland Australia. It certainly has not been ruled out in radio interviews in the course of this debate.
There is obviously no genuine policy agenda behind this bill. In fact, this bill has been inaccurately titled as including `further border protection measures'. There are no further border protection measures included in this bill. The government is simply cutting off parts of our country for immigration purposes. There is a significant lack of evidence justifying the excision, and this is primarily because it is an ineffective solution. This is a political decision, not a long-term policy solution. It takes no consideration of the current global situation and does not even attempt to provide a humane and long-term commitment to Australia's national security.
Labor reaffirm our support for tough border protection and for smashing people smugglers. However, Labor can see the inadequacies of this bill. We have recently produced a policy which encompasses the current global and national situation, international treaties and conventions, as well as consideration of community attitudes. We have presented Australia with an alternative that is both humane and practical in protecting our borders. The government in this bill has delivered nothing more than a fractured and minimal approach which does not provide any solution to the current inadequacies. 
The excision of islands does not strengthen our border protection. It weakens us. It shrinks our borders. It is in fact an invitation for people smugglers to attempt to reach the mainland. The inevitable consequence of this policy is that the risk that unauthorised persons would end up landing on the mainland is in fact substantially increased, not diminished. There has been serious criticism of the idea of distinguishing between different parts of Australia for migration purposes and it has been suggested that excisions will only result in asylum seekers seeking to land on mainland Australia, further endangering the lives of asylum seekers, potentially increasing the quarantine problems on the mainland and potentially leading to the situation where parts of the mainland of Australia might also be excised from the migration zone in the future. 
This legislation was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee stated:
There is little evidence to support assertions that the excision of islands close to the mainland is likely to deter asylum seekers. In fact, some evidence was received that the likely effect of the Bill would be to drive asylum seekers closer to the mainland, either with the intent of landing there, or incidentally. Either may increase the likelihood of landings on the mainland.
The very first recommendation that features in the report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee is:
The Committee recommends that the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 not proceed. 
It is plain and simple: this is not the solution to people smugglers. 
Finally, the budget papers disclose that the Howard government intends to maintain processing in third countries such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru over the next four years, at a disclosed cost of $430 million. Clearly the government faces substantial difficulty with the strategy, given that it does not have a four-year agreement with either Papua New Guinea or Nauru and that recent comments by the President of Nauru indicate considerable dissatisfaction with the current agreement and disputation over the terms of the agreement. It should be noted that, in respect of the Tampa asylum seekers, the Howard government has called for global burden sharing—that is, nations other than Australia should offer resettlement places to any of these asylum seekers found to be genuine refugees. There are no future global burden sharing arrangements for non-Tampa asylum seekers, and Australia will have to resettle those found to be genuine refugees. The government has no ongoing agreement with any country, not even with Indonesia, our closest neighbour. 
The budget papers disclose that it is the Howard government's intention to have no new asylum seekers processed on mainland Australia. It is obvious that this government has avoided creating adequate solutions, because it was not provided for in the budget. This government has no intention of providing a long-term solution to this global problem which would include strong relationships with not only our neighbours but also the UNHCR. This government has not bothered with that. The Howard government thinks that it can simply dump asylum seekers on Pacific Islands and New Zealand. This has proven to be a flawed policy which has cost the Australian taxpayers millions of dollars and taken away from important aid programs elsewhere.
This is an inappropriate bill. It has been introduced without adequate consultation, explanation or justification. It shows, once again, that this government has taken the attitudes and the views of Indigenous people, particularly those living on the islands, absolutely for granted. We have had regulations not passed by the Senate which were followed by legislation minutes later. Then it took some three months before an information kit was produced and, in a fairly clumsy way, distributed to those communities so they were aware of what was happening. This government surely is not serious about making sure that everyone who will be affected by this legislation—and people in these communities will be affected by the legislation if a boatload of people rocked up on their beaches—understands the impact of this legislation, understands their rights and responsibilities and understands what their response ought to be. People smugglers will not be deterred by this legislation; they will be encouraged to go right past those islands to the mainland. The Australian public will not be fooled again by the actions of this government, which does not have a long-term sustainable policy to deal with this issue effectively.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-12-09,"—I congratulate Senator Crossin on her excellent speech and her outline of the case against this nasty piece of legislation from the government.
—You know you are on a loser when you have Bob's support.
—The minister probably sees the world in terms of losers and winners. You can line that up basically as the poor and the rich; the have-nots and the haves; the dispossessed and the possessed; the powerless and the powerful. He is exemplifying an inhumanity in the policies of this government, which plays to the lowest common denominator in the people of this nation and in so doing lowers the kudos that the nation has in the eyes of the world and that we have in ourselves—
—You are talking about the Greens, are you?
—as a humanitarian, warm and accommodating country. It always amazes me how, when a government comes in with a piece of legislation like this, its ministers—and there are only two government members opposite supporting it at this stage—can be so desultory, down in the mouth and crabby in their demeanour. It is as if, inherently, they know they are doing something wrong. It swings from that to artificial laughter—
—What a clown.
—but the matter is serious. We are dealing with the lives and fortunes of dispossessed women, children and men—people who are escaping fear and hardship. These people have, if nothing else, internationally agreed rights which they expect would be upheld by a nation as lucky as ours—but not under this small-minded Prime Minister; not under this narrow-minded and selfish government of the Howard epoch.
—Or under the UNHCR. 
—The minister opposite objects, but let me list again some of the abuses of international law which are involved in Prime Minister Howard's legislation which we now have before us. This is only one example of his abuse of international law and long-held international standards, as this country dives below the surface of those standards on which we once so proudly floated and were so keen to uphold. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in making a submission to the government on the matter, pointed out that these amendment bills erode the universal application of human rights. It is a basic tenet of human rights, they said, that such rights should be applied equally, without distinction. Everyone within Australian territory is entitled to have his or her human rights respected and protected. For example, Australia has undertaken to ensure those rights—in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child—to all persons within its territory. Our nation, under more noble past leadership, signed these international conventions.
—Who was that? Gough or Paul or—
—The minister has no idea of when or how these were signed. I will allow him to go and do research on that. Maybe the first port of call would be to former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser; he could be a reference point for a finer line of thinking on the matter. HREOC quotes from those two covenants. Firstly, paragraph 1 of article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:
Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant ...
The government, in this legislation, is smashing the nation's adherence to that international convention. Paragraph 1 of article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states:
States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind ...
—When was this approved by Australia?
—The Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, in an extraordinary intervention, indicates that he does not know when it was signed. I have no doubt that he does not know who signed it; he does not know anything about it at all.
—Paul Keating.
—He says Paul Keating signed it. I will not say anything more than that he underscores his own utter ignorance of the importance, historicity and international value of such covenants as these when he makes such comments. Article 26 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights provides for the rights of non-discrimination. This piece of legislation is inherently discriminatory. HREOC points out that the bills undermine core international human rights guarantees, including the right of non-refoulement—that is, Australia's obligation to people presenting in its territory, people coming to any part of our territories, claiming to be at risk of persecution. They are set out in four international treaties to which Australia is a party, not only the refugee convention. That convention and those treaties are debased by this legislation. Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides:
No State Party shall expel, return ... or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
The right of such a person to resist expulsion is not made dependant upon him or her satisfying the definition of `refugee'. Yet, in this legislation, that right is being denied people in Australian territory. Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child:
No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily.
What a disgraceful abrogation of its duty as a national citizen Prime Minister the Hon. John Winston Howard has made Australia commit in the light of our signature on that particular binding part of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The same clause goes on to say: 
The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time ...
Yet we have children locked up in concentration camps in this country—mainland Australia—behind razor wire, not for days or weeks but for months. And now we are going to remove the rights of such children, not only to not be arbitrarily detained but to be heard under the laws of Australia, by excising 1,000 islands around the north of Australia from the reach of the international conventions to which we are signatories.
The Greens will, of course, sit on the other side to the government on this legislation. We totally oppose it. We will fight it all the way down the line. It is interesting that the government which brought this in as a regulation and had that defeated in the Senate is now trying to pass it as legislation. In so doing, the government simply compounds the abrogation of its responsibility to uphold Australia's reputation as a lawful citizen around the world. This is a government that talks about law and order, and breaks it internationally—in front of the world and in front of its own citizens—and uses the parliament in an attempt to stamp approval on the serial breaching of international law. This is a government which says, `We line up with the United States in an impending attack on Iraq'—they will, and it is inherent in everything we have heard so far—in another breach of international law, which is in fact the Charter of the United Nations itself, as we move into a new period of lawlessness by the most powerful states on the face of the planet, without an ability to understand history or to understand the danger which the Howard government puts Australian citizens in by that line of action. All of this goes counter to the whole last century of Australia being at the forefront of promoting international rights for all human beings equally.
Senator Crossin mentioned Mr John Cleary, a former minister in the Tasmanian parliament in a number of Liberal governments between 1979 and the late 1990s who is now administering the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory. I happened to be in the parliament with Mr Cleary for at least half of that period. Senator Crossin reiterated the appalling fact that the Indigenous people of the islands that are being excised have not been consulted by this government at any point in the development of these regulations and this piece of legislation. What an appalling insult that is to those people! It is again an indictment of the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of a government which not only breaches law, as I have outlined, but breaches the whole spirit of recognition that people, where their rights are affected by government action, ought to be consulted. The difficulty, I guess, for the Indigenous people on those islands is that they are not recognised as equal citizens by this government. Whatever else Mr Cleary is doing in his administrative post, let me reiterate some of the things he stood for during that period in Tasmania. It may enlighten us a little as to why that consultation did not occur or, if it failed to occur before he became the administrator, why it is not occurring now.
Mr Cleary was an avid proponent and supporter of the destruction of the Franklin River and all the Aboriginal history—the cave sites and the connection for thousands of years—involved with that river. You might remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, Aboriginal people leading the protests and being taken to jail while trying to defend their cultural history in Tasmania. Mr Cleary was one of those who passed the legislation which enabled them to be arrested and sent to jail. When it came to the great forests of Tasmania, Mr Cleary was always at the forefront of supporting legislation and regulation that meant they would be destroyed in the interests of the wood chippers sending those forests to Japan.
When it came to the Wesley Vale pulp mill in northern Tasmania, where there was concern that farmlands would be polluted and that 13 tonnes of organochlorines would go into Bass Strait each year, Mr Cleary avidly supported the pulp mill against the wishes of the fishermen, the farmers and a great number of members of the Tasmanian community. Western Tasmania, which is a great job producer and attractor of investment in Tasmania, was largely made a World Heritage area because of its Aboriginal history and extraordinary importance to the world, given the Aboriginal sites and the ongoing connection for the Aboriginal people. Mr Cleary opposed that all the way down the line. 
When it came to establishing Aboriginal land rights in Tasmania, which were proposed by the Labor-Green accord in 1989-92, John Cleary opposed that as well. He opposed gun law reform before the Port Arthur massacre. He was also opposed to legislating to help with the establishment of support for those who wanted home births in Tasmania. Of course, there is much more to it, but I thought that those things should go on the record.
I want to get back to the legislation and say that this is not just an ordinary piece of end-of-year legislation. It is again an indictment of a government which has gone far off centre and far from the average of the thinking of this country over the past decades to put Australia into an age of right-wing, sectionally divisive government interested not in the Christian philosophy of share and do unto others as you would do unto yourself, but in a philosophy of greed, selfishness and walking to the other side of the road to avoid even looking at people who have great misfortune, are down on their luck and are down on the road in this life.
I do not know what the creed of this government is. Could somebody explain its philosophy? What is the human thought behind this legislation? Perhaps one of the two government senators opposite might get up and explain. What is the spiritual, humanitarian, Christian—if you will—credo that manifests itself in a selfish, rejectionist, antihumanitarian piece of legislation like this? I suspect that neither will attempt to answer that, because this legislation is built on self-interest, greed and denial of the misfortune of others.
We have a government that says we must globalise and bring down the barriers—but that is for money. Here we have a piece of legislation which is the exact opposite and says, `Let's compartmentalise and put up the barriers,' because we are not dealing with money here, we are dealing with human beings. Can a senator opposite get up and explain that? I do not think so. We will be opposing this piece of legislation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2002-12-09,"—During the course of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's inquiry into the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002, we were presented with very little evidence to suggest that this legislation will be able to achieve its stated aims. It is a piece of legislation that in fact has the potential to do more harm than good. According to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the bill has the aim of border protection. It is intended to prevent people from using excised offshore places to achieve migration outcomes. Its aim, then, is to prevent people from entering Australia without a visa.
However, I am not convinced that excising almost 5,000 islands along Australia's coastline, many of which are very close to the mainland, will in any way add to the efficacy of the existing system. This bill may well prevent people from using excised offshore places to seek asylum, but it is likely to encourage them to head for the mainland instead. The committee found conflicting reports amongst and between government departments as to what role this excision could play in the border security of Australia. The one thing that they could agree on was that excising islands so close to the mainland would force boats to make that extra step and land on the mainland itself. So, like the Pacific solution, this bill can be seen as nothing more than a PR exercise. It sounds tough but in fact it achieves little.
This government has engaged in what has become an extremely dangerous world contest with other destination nations to develop the harshest deterrence mechanisms, because in the current system there is a sense that the country with the weakest deterrence mechanisms will be targeted. This is a gross and punitive waste of resources in an international competition that no-one can win. Labor has proposed to work cooperatively with other nations to stop competing to deter asylum seekers and start developing multilateral policies for resettling or repatriating them. This is not a situation we can ignore. It is not going to go away. This bill is yet another Howard government mechanism to make it look like it is doing something about the problem when really it is just biding its time, wishing it would all go away. 
The minister has claimed that such legislation `will significantly reduce incentives for people to make hazardous voyages to Australian territories'. Many submissions to the inquiry questioned whether this will be effective as a deterrent: `What,' they asked, `is standing in the way of them simply landing elsewhere?' Obviously, the danger of a journey to Australia on an overcrowded boat is a much stronger disincentive than questionable migration outcomes. If someone is fleeing their home or, as is so often the case now, travelling to join a family member who is in Australia on a TPV and has no right to family reunion, the incentive to find somewhere safe for them and their families is particularly strong.
But this bill will not deter asylum seekers from coming to Australia, as the islands it has excised are simply too close to the mainland. Deterring people smugglers from making the journey would be a legitimate policy aim, but this is clearly not the aim of this legislation. I am quite sure that people smugglers would not offer a money back guarantee if their cargo did not achieve migration outcomes.
Apart from the fact that the legislation will not achieve its stated aims, the major concern that I have with it is that it has the potential to add to the costs—the financial, social and political costs—of the disaster that has been the Pacific solution. According to the repeated pledges of the Australian government to the people of Australia—and to Nauru and to Papua New Guinea—the processing of asylum seekers in these Pacific nations is a temporary measure. The government, however, has budgeted $430 million over the next four years for offshore processing in Pacific island countries. The memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru and Papua New Guinea also allows for the situation to continue for `as short a time as is reasonably necessary'— in other words, the time frame is open ended. This causes enormous difficulties for these countries and, in my view, is an unnecessary extension of the policy of detaining people in conditions far worse—and at far greater expense—than those in Australia.
In 2001-02, the detention of asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island cost the Australian taxpayers more than $150 million. While expenditure on the Pacific solution and aid to Nauru continues to soar, Australia has been cutting funds to the UNHCR. From 2000 to 2002, funding of $14.3 million was allocated to the UNHCR in the budget. Core funding in the 2002-03 budget has dropped to $7.3 million, although now the UNHCR will be able to compete with other organisations for additional funding. While the minister claims that refugee flows must be addressed at their source, the Australian government is cutting funds to the very agency responsible for dealing with the refugee crisis at its source.
Under Labor, funding to the UNHCR will be increased to $25 million. Labor will also abolish the special program funding introduced in the 2002-03 budget. This shows a real and serious commitment to addressing refugee flows at their source—we have yet to see such a commitment from the government—not only in terms of funding for the UNHCR but also in terms of aid priorities. Labor has also committed to boosting aid to address the root causes of refugee movements, contributing to lasting solutions not unworkable stopgaps. As Margaret Piper from the Refugee Council of Australia noted:
Iran has 2.5 million asylum seekers and gets $30 million from the international community. Now we are spending—if estimates are correct—between $350 to $400 million on trying to keep out a couple of thousand people. If we were to spend even a portion of that on helping Iran, these people would not have to look to the smugglers to get on the boats to come halfway around the world to risk their lives to get to somewhere where they have protection.
Using foreign aid to buy the assistance of poorer nations, as this government has done with Nauru and PNG, is a case of really misplaced aid objectives. Pacific expert Greg Fry of the Australian National University argued that the policy:
... has serious political implications for a number of Pacific states. It has also damaged the way Australia is seen in the region and has acted against the Australian Government's other foreign policy goals in the area (such as promoting responsible governance). 
Aid should not be used as a bargaining tool in this way with Nauru and Papua New Guinea. This policy has damaged Australia's reputation in the Pacific, with the focus on the Pacific solution seen to be overshadowing key priorities in the region—not least of which is the significant number of internally displaced people and refugees in neighbouring Pacific countries, including the Solomon Islands, Bougainville and West Papua. An Oxfam report states:
... over $40 million has been spent to establish and run the camp on Manus Island for less than 400 refugees, while church and humanitarian agencies are using limited resources to support over 6,000 West Papuan refugees and border crossers living in official and unofficial camps along the border with Indonesian-controlled Papua. There are also some 17,000 internally displaced people within Papua.
My concern is that this legislation will create more offshore entry persons, continuing this misuse of justice and funds. This policy was developed in an ad hoc manner and has left the government with promises it cannot keep and people found to be refugees waiting an indeterminate time to be resettled. It makes no sense to create more offshore entry persons when the government already has a major problem on its hands with those who have been taken to a declared country over the past 14 months.
During the 2001 election campaign, in relation to asylum seekers who were to be detained in the Pacific, Prime Minister John Howard stated, `They are not coming to the Australian mainland; that is one choice that is not available.' Despite such pledges, a total of 281 of these refugees have so far arrived in Australia for permanent settlement under the Pacific solution. There have been 701 approvals for asylum seekers on both Manus Island and Nauru to date. It is taking the Australian government a considerable length of time to find resettlement places for the remaining refugees, with no solution to this problem in sight. Practically, the result of this is the continuing detention of people who have been found to be refugees. Clearly this is not a preferred outcome, by any means. If the majority of them, as seems set to happen, end up in Australia, the whole exercise will have been nothing but a waste of money—an expensive and politically expedient diversion.
There are also pressing concerns as to what will happen to those whose applications for asylum have been rejected and who cannot be returned. Nauru and PNG do not want them to stay indefinitely, and it is not clear whether they can be forcibly repatriated. These people are stuck in limbo because the government did not consider the results of this policy beyond the 2001 election date. As Oxfam-Community Aid Abroad found in their report of August this year into the Pacific solution:
The Australian government has not been transparent with the Australian or Nauruan public about the length of time to be taken for the processing of applications.
A lack of transparency can be a feature of bad policy and also a corollary to it. There is very little information in the public sphere about conditions of detention on Nauru and PNG, and certainly there is not enough public scrutiny. This has led to problems in detention conditions and visa processing that would have raised much more alarm had they occurred in Australia.
Labor's plan to maintain Christmas Island as an excised place is, unlike the government's policy, well considered. Conditions of detention on Christmas Island will not be inferior to those on the mainland. There will also be transparency in relation to the conditions of detention and the asylum claims processing regime, with an expert committee, the Asylum Seeker Claims Processing Review Committee, overseeing the development and functioning of the processing regime. Unlike the Liberal government, Labor will not need to hide its actions. Processing on Christmas Island will be fast, fair and transparent, and there will be no long waits for resettlement, because Labor will take its responsibilities seriously and resettle in Australia all those found to be refugees.
The delays in processing applications on Nauru have seriously disadvantaged hundreds of Afghan applicants because of the regime change in Afghanistan. These delays, and the lack of clarity as to the future of the policy, have created major difficulties for the Nauruan government. This legislation, in an attempt to deter asylum seekers by excising islands close to the Australian mainland, is just another example of this government's misplaced priorities and open hypocrisy in its stated attempts to deal with the international refugee crisis. Detaining asylum seekers on Pacific Islands was supposed to be a short-term fix. It was not a measured or considered policy, and now we are seeing its results. These results include political instability in Nauru and PNG, regional ill-will towards Australia, delays in visa processing, a lack of resettlement options for those assessed to be refugees and an absolute blow-out in the costs. It would have been more efficient, cheaper and more humane to have processed these asylum seekers in Australia. 
The Oxfam report, in relation to children detained on Nauru and Manus Island, states:
A particular concern is the status and welfare of these children, who don't have access to the kinds of educational and welfare facilities available to children in Australian detention centres—
which are of themselves inadequate. There are currently 157 minors on Nauru and 34 on Manus Island—that is 191 children in total. More children are held under the Pacific solution than in onshore immigration detention centres. These children have all been detained for between 12 and 14 months. During committee hearings, a DFAT representative admitted that Australia had not raised with Nauru or PNG the relevant international obligations such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Mr John Hodges, the Chairman of the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, which reports to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, said:
Nauru is by far the worst of the detention centres ...
He admitted:
... the facilities are just not as good as they are in Australia.
I am concerned that the results of this legislation would be to detain more children in conditions that are worse than those in the mainland detention centres. There is less transparency and there are fewer procedures for determining the situation of children in these detention centres than there are on the mainland, and conditions for children in mainland centres are in themselves causing widespread concern. When questioned by the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident about educational facilities on Nauru and Manus Island, Mr Hodges mentioned only one detainee who spoke fairly good English and was teaching classes. Mr Hodges said:
Education facilities I believe are lacking a little.
Clearly, as Mr Hodges pointed out, there are difficulties in educating children in a detention centre environment, but this is not a reasonable excuse to ignore the question altogether. When asked by the committee whether there had been any sort of qualified assessment of the education needs of the camp populations, the head of the minister's immigration detention watchdog said that he did not know. Education is a basic right for children; it is so in Australian domestic law and in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The UNHCR also raised concerns about the nature of the visas that offshore entry persons are able to apply for. The granting of a temporary protection visa, they argue, should not be defined as resettlement, as it is not a durable solution for a refugee. TPV holders at the moment have no access to family reunion or travel papers and are given little support to settle into the community. This legislation has serious adverse implications for the rights of refugees to family reunion. Members of a family who arrive separately are assessed individually, which allows for family members to be taken separately to a declared country, even if a member of the family is residing in Australia on a TPV. As the UNHCR put it:
This right includes maintaining family unity for members arriving in Australian territory together, as well as assuring family reunion for members arriving separately. When coupled with the use of Temporary Protection Visas by Australia, which do not provide for family reunion as a basic individual right, the impact of such State action may result in a breach of Australia's formal obligations under various human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as ignoring standards that Australia has helped to create and promote. 
Labor recognises that the current system of TPVs is not working. The lack of access to settlement services and family reunions creates an underclass of visa holders who have little means of building a life for themselves in Australia and are welfare dependent. Under Labor, the TPV will be of a shorter term, after which an asylum seeker's claim will be reassessed. If circumstances in their country have not changed, they will be granted a permanent protection visa with rights to family reunion. The change that will have the most significant impact on current TPV holders is that, under Labor, they will have access to settlement services, including English language training and the full range of Job Network services.
Despite its stated aim of deterrence and border control, this bill has clear potential for unintended consequences. Obviously, these had not been thought out in the implementation of the original raft of legislation, as can be seen by the subsequent return to Australia of refugees from Nauru and Manus Island, and clearly they have not been thought through here. A high proportion of those who try to come to Australia via people smugglers are women and children trying to join family members. I for one am not willing to risk more children being detained on Nauru or Manus Island for extended and indefinite periods of time.
This bill is a diversion. It is part of a strategy of focusing attention away from important questions and drawing the eyes of the nation, using the language of fear, to a phantom threat. I would like to quote from Minister Ruddock's second reading speech on this bill. He said:
The choice for the opposition is now clear. They can either support strong and effective border controls or they can contribute to the weakening of Australia's borders and the perils arising from this action.
What is this if it is not the language of fear? This legislation does nothing to strengthen Australia's borders. It is not effective border control. It is a line in the sand, and if we were under some kind of peril it would not be enough to protect us. The government seem to think that there are only two choices. They think that because they have not made the effort to consider other options and because they feel there is no political mandate in innovative solutions. All they can think of doing is adding an ineffectual extra to an already failing system. It does not convince me and it will not convince the Australian people either.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-12-09,"—I rise to place on the record the fact that One Nation will be supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002. In commencing my contribution to this debate, I would like to put it very clearly on the record that when the government brought the last set of legislation into this chamber One Nation also supported it. This is totally contrary to the reports in the media that the opposition and all of the minor parties and independents opposed the government's legislation. We did not; we supported it totally.
One Nation believes the government's present bill adds substantially to the program that the government have set in place over a series of years. The government has taken initiatives to curb illegal entry. We do not hear the word `illegal' in the contributions from the Labor Party or some of the other crossbenchers. The people in question are illegal immigrants. I do not believe that, under our Australian Constitution, they have the right to access our judicial processes in the same manner as an Australian resident or citizen.
If we look at what the government have done over past years we will see that they introduced border protection legislation in 1999, enhanced that legislation in 2001 and made changes to the Migration Act in order to increase the maximum period of imprisonment for people-smuggling to 20 years, with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for those found to be organising people-smuggling. The government have increased the number of special compliance officers in key overseas posts. They will work with local police and immigration officials to clearly identify overseas nationals trying to enter Australia illegally. 
The government have placed departmental officers in key overseas ports to assist overseas countries in training their staff to identify bogus documents. The Australian government have posted specialist liaison officers to key overseas posts for bilateral and multilateral liaison on readmission and resettlement. They have organised ongoing short-term visits to key countries by departmental document examiners to provide specialist training and technical support to overseas immigration services and to airlines and airline staff. They have maintained multifunction task forces both in Australia and overseas which coordinate investigations, collect intelligence and maintain close liaison with law enforcement agencies investigating immigration fraud. The government also frequently updates Australia's movement alert list, which is a key tool governing the entry of non-citizens who are of security and character concern.
Who has this message been sent to? It is very clear that the government has sent a message to two groups of people: firstly, it has sent a very clear message to the people who would wish to flout our immigration laws—the illegal entry people; and, secondly and more importantly, it has sent a message to the people smugglers and cut off the ability of these people to continue their business. If we look back to last year and the year before, there were times when we had anything up to 3,500 people illegally arriving on our shores. But the moment that the government brought in its first bill on border protection, that stopped overnight. If you are in the business of people-smuggling and all of a sudden you find that Australia is not a soft touch and you have accepted between $A6,000 to $A10,000 from a person to get them illegally into Australia, they are going to be most upset with you. If 3,000-odd people were to come from Indonesia, for example, that would be an injection of approximately $A18 million per month into the black market in that country. Therein lies some of the reluctance of overseas countries to stop this trafficking. The minister in his second reading speech said:
On average, it costs the government $50,000 for every unauthorised arrival by boat from the time of arrival to the time of their departure from Australia.
Do the arithmetic: if 3,000 people arrived in Australia in any one month it would cost us, the taxpayers, $150 million just to process them for that one month, and people talk about the costs of the Pacific solution! I think the Pacific solution is one of the most economical actions of the government, because it stopped absolutely overnight the proliferation of people entering this country.
When Senator Brown spoke before he made a comment about how this fits with our Christian ethos. It fits very comfortably. If you go to the Old Testament, there is a section that speaks about the entry into the walled city of Jerusalem. If you know a little history about that period, you will know the gates in that walled city were closed each evening. There were windows in the walls of the city so that people could have some access to fresh air where their homes were built into the walls. So our Old Testament clearly says: `He who enters the city through the gates enters that city and has passage. But he who enters by the window is despised.'
So our own Christian belief sets out very clearly that we accept the person who enters our country legally—that is, the person who fills out their application and has it assessed to see if they are a genuine refugee. But the person who comes as an illegal immigrant is the equivalent of the person in the dark, entering that city through a window, and they are to be despised because they are keeping out genuine people who have spent time going through all of the refugee centres, doing the right thing and making an application to come to Australia. They are the ones who are doing the correct thing; they are the ones who as a Christian nation we will open our arms to and accept if it is proven that they are genuine refugees. So there is no problem whatsoever in reconciling ourselves as a Christian society to rejecting those who wish to break the laws of this country and enter like thieves in the night. On top of that, they have the audacity to expect the Australian people to fund court challenges that will keep them here for three or four years. The government does have it right; it has done the right thing. 
If you live in North Queensland and speak to the people who live on Cape York—they are predominantly pastoralists; lovely people who are doing it hard—on numerous occasions you would hear them voice concern about the vehicles that tend to go up the Cape empty and come back full. You do not have to think too hard to work out what is actually going on. We have even had instances in places like Dirranbandi, in the southern corner of the state, where people in vehicles have been apprehended. One lot were apprehended because the vehicle broke down; it was a group of illegal immigrants heading for Melbourne. If they had arrived in Melbourne they would have had a safe haven. We probably would not even have known they were in the country. Another group that called in at a service station to refuel their vehicle were apprehended when an astute attendant realised that, because of their language difficulties, they most certainly should not even have been driving the vehicle, let alone be in Australia.
So the government does have it right. The government is protecting the sovereignty of this nation in such a way that the people of Australia decide who will make up the matrix of our community in the future. If we had continued to allow thousands of people to illegally enter this country on a monthly basis, it would not be us as Australians controlling the development of our country but the illegal boat people and the smugglers who are sitting offshore, smugly putting their money in their hip pockets and, I might add, probably not contributing to their own country's economy.
If Labor's proposal were to be accepted, we would be opening the front door. We would be opening the gates to Jerusalem in the daytime for people to walk in. I do not believe that that is in the interests of the Australian people. People who arrive in Australia with the correct documentation have had that documentation—their entry visas—subjected to scrutiny by our officials overseas. That is the correct way to enter this country. If you want to get the real story on people who enter this country illegally through our airports, stop and talk to a Qantas airline pilot or a crew member who has had to go through the degrading task of sifting through the refuse on an aircraft because someone who had identification papers at their overseas port of exit has cut that documentation up and flushed it down the toilet on the aircraft, arriving here with no ID so as to claim refugee status. If you talk to the airline people and ask them what they think of those sorts of people, you will get a totally different picture. 
Yes, it is extremely concerning that children are held for a long period of time in detention centres in Australia. However, it is a conscious decision of the parents of those children to flout the laws of this country. They know what they are doing when they pay their $A6,000 to $A10,000 to the people smugglers. They know where they are going to end up—in a detention centre. They consciously made that decision before they left their country.
On the issue of forum shopping, have a look at Europe. The European Economic Union have passed legislation to ban forum shopping. I would like anyone in this chamber to tell me of any person—other than our close neighbours East Timor and West Papua who have no other option but to enter Australia—who has travelled to Australia as an illegal immigrant and not passed another safe haven before they entered our waters. I believe that the government, with this legislation and with its previous attempt at the regulation, has actually stopped forum shopping—and that is exactly what should happen. Even the United Nations human rights commission does not support a refugee who passes a safe haven to continue on to a selected destination. 
In conclusion, One Nation support the government's initiative to further extend the exclusion areas. We support their definition of an excised offshore place and we most certainly support the time frame from 2 p.m. on 19 June 2002 as the time when any person who enters these excised areas is unable to apply for a visa in Australia. One Nation commend the government for the bill and support the government's position. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-12-09,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 is very important for all Australians. The Australian public has a clear expectation that the Australian government should be strong on border protection, tough on people smugglers and act in accordance with the national interest. Those are the issues that underpin this bill. The bill expands the definition of an excised offshore place and sends a strong deterrent message to people smugglers. The bill ensures that persons who travel unlawfully to Australia and who enter Australia at an excised offshore place will not obtain a favourable migration outcome. 
The bill does not disadvantage Australians in any way, nor does it cause detriment to those people with lawful authority to be in Australia under the Migration Act. These people will be able to move about freely in any of the excised offshore places just as they would in any other part of Australia. These places remain integral parts of Australia. In fact, there has been much debate about this bill entailing the giving up of sovereignty, that we are giving up pieces of Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. When similar provisions were before the parliament last year, the Labor opposition found no problem at all in excising Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We are applying the same principle today, yet the opposition baulks at what we are suggesting. 
It is worth while looking at those people who live in the areas which would be most affected. I went to the Torres Strait Islands in July this year, and the feedback I got was that the people there are in favour of this excision. We had a comment by Senator Scullion, who represents people who could be affected by this. He stood here in the Senate today as a representative of those people in the Northern Territory and said they were supportive of these excisions. We have just heard from Senator Harris, who represents the state of Queensland, that there is no opposition from people in Cape York. When you look at those Australians who live either in the areas we are talking about or in close proximity to those areas, you find no opposition to the government's proposal. They want the government to be strong on border protection.
This bill is an important part of the government's comprehensive strategy to combat people-smuggling. I remind senators opposite that people-smuggling is criminal. Earlier this year, the Australian and Indonesian governments cohosted a conference on people-smuggling in Bali. People from many countries attended that conference. I heard first-hand accounts of what people smugglers do. The head of Interpol indicated that people smugglers are often tied up with illicit dealing in guns, drugs and other contraband. It is also not uncommon to find them tied up in the sexual trade of women and children. People smugglers are not generous, altruistic people who are trying to help others find a better life. They are organised criminals who trade in human beings as they would in drugs or guns. We are providing a deterrent to these organised criminal syndicates.
We have even seen tragedy at the hands of such people smugglers. People who criticise this deterrent underestimate the evil trade of people smugglers. People smugglers do not care about their human cargo. As long as they have the money in their hands they do not care whether their customers reach their destination or not. That is the blunt truth. These provisions are part of a suite of provisions implemented by this government to deter people smugglers from their unlawful operations. There is a clear indication that this strategy is working. It has been about 12 months—I think it is in excess of 12 months—since any substantive attempt has been made to enter Australian waters. The results of our strategy speak for themselves: people smugglers have been deterred from their illegal activities.
We cannot afford to be complacent. We cannot afford to sit back and say, `We've done enough.' Credible intelligence reports indicate that people smugglers are looking for ways and means to get their clients to other parts of Australia and to other destinations in the Pacific. This bill will not force asylum seekers onto the mainland, as the opposition and minor parties suggest. Rather, failing to pass this bill will give people smugglers the green light to continue their trade to either Australia or other destinations in the Pacific. This is totally unacceptable to the Australian government and, more importantly, to the people of Australia. 
The government has carefully considered the report and recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. We note that only two of the recommendations relate to the bill itself, and the other recommendations concern elements of the Pacific strategy. The government does not accept recommendations 1 to 7. All of these involve issues which were before the Senate last year when the opposition supported the original excision bill. It is incomprehensible that the opposition is seeking to raise these objections now, when it had ample opportunity to do so when the legislation was passed last year—with its support.
In relation to recommendations 8 and 9, the government recognises the significant role that Indigenous communities already play. We will continue to ensure that Indigenous communities are involved in border protection as appropriate. I speak with first-hand knowledge of Indigenous communities that I have visited which have assisted Customs in looking out for Australia's borders. As the Minister for Justice and Customs, I have acknowledged the great assistance we have had from Indigenous communities in the north in that regard.
This bill is an integral and vital part of the government's legislative and administrative measures to combat people-smuggling and to protect Australia's borders. It is irresponsible not to support this bill. It shows a complete lack of regard for Australia's border security, deterring the illegal activities of criminals such as people smugglers and acting in the national interest. I commend this bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I rise to indicate the opposition's support for this package of bills in respect of medical indemnity insurance.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Senator Evans, before you go on, could you wait a moment while a few senators finish their conversations.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am sure there is a great deal of interest in my speech from the government benches. I understood that is why we had such a good attendance. While Labor support these bills, we do so noting that there are many steps the government should have taken and still must take before medical indemnity in Australia is sustainable in the long term. In this light, Labor believe it is important to emphasise that medical indemnity is not just an issue for doctors but one that impacts directly on the availability and affordability of medical services for all Australians. Inadequate measures to address medical indemnity in the long term will result in a reduced availability of medical services and patients paying higher prices.
These bills represent the government's package of measures to address rising medical indemnity insurance premiums, announced on 23 October this year. The core plank of this package was the extension of a guarantee to United Medical Protection and Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, UMP-AMIL, to 31 December 2003. On 23 October, the government also announced partial subsidies for insurance premiums for obstetricians, neurosurgeons and GPs performing procedures; a scheme to meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims payments greater than $2 million; funding of the incurred but unreported liabilities for medical defence organisations, or MDOs, that have not set aside money to cover their liabilities; and a levy to recoup the cost of the funding for unreported liabilities for members of the MDOs over an extended period. 
The announcement of these measures followed the passage of the Medical Indemnity Agreement (Financial Assistance— Binding Commonwealth Obligations) Bill 2002. The purpose of that bill was to appropriate funds for payments in accordance with an indemnity agreement between the Commonwealth and UMP and its wholly owned subsidiary, AMIL, and to confirm the government's commitments relating to UMP-AMIL.
It is worth while to discuss in somewhat more detail the three main measures that these bills give effect to. The first measure is the unreported liability scheme. This will assist those medical defence organisations that had unfunded liabilities as at 30 June 2002 to pay the claims when they crystallise. In other words, the Commonwealth will help these MDOs to pay for claims which they have not made adequate provision for in the past. Part of this cost will be recouped by a levy payable by any person who on 30 June 2000 was a member of an MDO that was assessed as having unfunded, unreported liabilities at 30 June 2002. For practitioners who are liable to pay the levy, the levy will be set as a proportion—a maximum of 50 per cent—of their medical indemnity premium paid for the 2000-01 financial year.
The second key measure that the package of bills gives effect to is the High Cost Claims Scheme. The High Cost Claims Scheme aims to lower premiums by reducing the potential cost of large claims to insurers. Under this scheme, the Commonwealth will meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims payments greater than $2 million. This scheme will apply to claims notified on or after 1 January 2003 but will not apply to claims relating to the provision of public hospital services.
The third main measure that this package of bills gives effect to is subsidies. A subsidy will be provided to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs who undertake Medicare billable procedures. It will be the equivalent of 50 per cent of the difference between the cost of their premiums plus the unfunded, unreported levy, and a corresponding cost for gynaecologists, general surgeons and non-procedural GPs respectively, in their relevant state or territory. In light of the particularly high premium costs faced by some neurosurgeons, the subsidy rate will increase to 80 per cent on the portion of their premium plus the levy, if applicable, that exceeds $50,000. 
This package of bills provides for the implementation of these key measures of the government's package. Although positive and necessary measures, they are inadequate in the long term to address Australia's medical indemnity shortfalls. The bills provide an administrative framework for the policy response made by the government so far. For instance, the Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 establishes a mechanism to determine which MDOs have incurred but unreported liabilities. So far as financial implications of the bills are concerned, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook documents indicated that funding of $246.5 million over four years will be provided for the medical indemnity insurance assistance package. However, disappointingly, the MYEFO documents do not disclose the amount budgeted for the UMP-AMIL guarantee or the amount expected to be raised from the unreported liabilities levy to fund the guarantee.
As I have indicated, the opposition supports these measures. However, it is important to get on record again Labor's view that the government's handling of medical indemnity problems in Australia has been far from satisfactory. The government was slow in recognising that there was a problem at all, and it has not been prepared to make its eventual response comprehensive or far-reaching enough to address the range of medical indemnity problems that exist. It is also worth remembering that, whilst the crisis in medical indemnity insurance was publicly brought to a head by the financial difficulties experienced by UMP and by the appointment of a provisional liquidator, problems with medical indemnity insurance are not of recent origin. For example, as far back as 1991 the then Labor federal government established a review of professional indemnity arrangements for health care professionals. This review was chaired by Fiona Tito. It was responsible for examining the arrangements relating to professional indemnity and the experience with compensation for medical misadventure.
Fiona Tito's report was completed at the end of 1995. Amongst other things, that report identified the need to develop evidence based medicine and define best practice; called on health care institutions to develop a system for error identification and analysis to deal with errors in a positive manner; discussed the need to ensure that people with severe disabilities obtained early access to rehabilitation services; recommended the wider use of structured settlements; recommended that medical defence organisations, using common accounting and reporting standards, ensure that members and policyholders be able to assess their relative financial strength; and recommended the establishment of an MDO fund to cover the costs of claims incurred but not reported, which is of course one of the major problems that this bill attempts to deal with, albeit seven years after the Tito report identified it.
The Tito report was largely ignored by the Howard government. That is in contrast to the Labor Party, which in the run-up to the last federal election identified what areas of medical indemnity insurance remained neglected and in need of reform. Labor's medical indemnity reform package was accordingly announced in July 2001. It drew attention to the following requirements: the need to reduce the frequency of medical injuries by setting national benchmarks and guidelines and by promoting the use of information technologies to help doctors decide on the best treatment and avoid misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment, the need to promote structured settlements by changing the tax treatment of periodic payments to ensure injured patients have adequate regular payments to cover their health care costs for the rest of their lives and the need to establish a national database on health care litigation to target the problem areas and ensure that adequate support mechanisms are in place. 
The Labor package responded to these health system needs in a range of specific, targeted ways. In particular, the ALP sought state and territory law reforms encompassing court procedures, calculation of damages and the regulation of medical indemnity organisations. Labor sought to tighten the prudential regulation of medical indemnity insurance, in order that all funds operate soundly and have transparent accounts; to require all doctors to hold the appropriate insurance for the work they undertake; to reduce red tape by harmonising requirements, from doctor registration to improving risk management by medical indemnity funds; and to refer the current problems with indemnity insurance for midwives to the then Senate inquiry into nursing, in order to develop options for keeping homebirth as an option for expectant mothers.
The Howard government has proved reluctant to address any of these problems with medical indemnity insurance, taking only preliminary steps after the last federal election. In December 2001, the Prime Minister announced a national medical indemnity insurance summit, which was ultimately convened in late April 2002. The summit's communique, which was issued following the summit, simply announced that work would begin on a range of issues that had been identified much earlier.
Problems surrounding medical indemnity insurance are complex and there is no single solution. As a consequence, action is required by all governments and change is required of medical defence organisations, the medical profession and lawyers. However, any comprehensive plan for solving the medical indemnity insurance problem must be coordinated at the Commonwealth level. Given this, the government's response to medical indemnity problems has been inadequate in the following ways.
Firstly, almost all of the efforts for reform have focused on tort law and not on the need to improve clinical outcomes and reduce clinical risk. Comparatively little attention has been given to reducing the number of adverse events through the encouragement of safer medical practice. Improvements in the quality and safety of medical care would lead to better health outcomes for patients and reduce the likelihood that doctors would be sued for inappropriate treatments. Whilst it is certainly the case that Australia performs well internationally, we can always do better. As a consequence, the Howard government should make the reduction of clinical risk a much greater priority.
Secondly, more work needs to be done to consider the viability of setting up a national scheme for the long-term care of the most catastrophically injured. Labor has consistently advocated that a special national scheme is necessary to address high-cost cases in which catastrophic injury has resulted from medical procedures. It is clearly the case, both anecdotally and statistically, that the majority of these cases involve brain and spinal injuries and obstetrics. Complex cases involving catastrophically injured people take years to resolve through the courts and waste millions of dollars in legal fees. These cases place a disproportionate burden on the cost of medical indemnity insurance. Putting in place a catastrophic injury scheme would be a significant contribution to stemming the exponential increase in premiums for the cost of medical indemnity insurance.
The Commonwealth also has a significant role to play in assisting medical defence organisations to secure reasonably priced reinsurance. Australia has a multiplicity of state based organisations that provide medical indemnity insurance. With a more united front, Australian MDOs would be much more likely to succeed in obtaining affordable reinsurance and helping to stop medical indemnity insurance costs from increasing exponentially. Changing the way in which medical indemnity insurance is regulated would also be a helpful advance. Medical indemnity insurance has historically been provided by MDOs that have offered doctors membership rather than insurance. It is important that the Commonwealth ensure that APRA has sufficient resources to fulfil this greater regulatory role. 
The Commonwealth should also ensure the prevention of price exploitation resulting from premium increases, by way of an increased role for the ACCC. It is now well known that very many patients are being asked by their specialist to make large up-front payments before surgical procedures are carried out, with the explicit justification that these up-front fees are necessary to defray the increased costs of medical indemnity insurance. We have also seen, in more recent times, indications from the Australian Private Hospitals Association that, in the course of next year, up-front fees in the order of $150 will be imposed to cover the difficulties that Australian private hospitals now find in gaining medical indemnity insurance. 
While it is expected that medical service providers will not be able to absorb the increased costs of medical indemnity insurance premiums and will pass those costs on to patients, Labor believes that consumers should not be required to pay amounts that bear no relation to the increased premium costs. The Howard government envisages the ACCC playing a role so far as monitoring the increase in medical indemnity insurance premiums is concerned. However, the ACCC should be tasked to ensure that, whatever changes occur, no unfair or unreasonable costs flow on to patients for the cost of their individual health care.",SENATE,<title>MEDICAL INDEMNITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-12-09,"—I rise tonight to acknowledge the government's belated implementation of Labor's drought policy, evidenced by the drought assistance measures announced by the Prime Minister today.
—Kerry! Come on!
—I am glad to hear the acknowledgment of that by senators opposite. Some time ago—and months before the Prime Minister did it—Simon Crean and I visited drought affected communities in Bourke, Brewarrina and Condobolin to gain a first-hand appreciation of the drought's devastating impact on those regional communities. As a result of that visit, we renewed our call for the Howard government to speed up its assessment process for exceptional circumstances drought relief and get funding flowing to families in need. This call, and the call of farm families in drought affected Australia, at that time fell on deaf ears. It took the Howard government a full 64 days to assess the Bourke-Brewarrina exceptional circumstances application— what an insult to those farmers who had to wait for the government to get its act together, and in this time had to feed their herds, feed their families, and field the inevitable calls from the local bank manager.
Labor and farming representatives have criticised the inability of the Howard government, and particularly the minister—Warren Truss—to deal with this drought and deliver relief to farming families in a timely manner. But Labor have done much more than criticise. We have released a six-point plan to deal with the current crisis. I can advise the Senate that the government has, in the absence of its own policy, started to implement ours. The first point of our plan is the minimisation of red tape. Labor have proposed a target of a seven-day turnaround for the prima facie assessment of exceptional circumstances applications, and a 28-day turnaround for full exceptional circumstances assessments so that funds flow to farm families in need more quickly and provide certainty to farmers about the EC process. Unfortunately, the government has not set itself these targets. Who can blame it? Mr Truss has failed for two years to reform the exceptional circumstances process, so it would be an act of extreme political optimism to set fixed deadlines for this minister to conclude assessments. He is simply not up to the task.
The second point of our plan is the reform of the Farm Management Deposits scheme. Again, it is pleasing to note that the government has picked up our policy to allow farmers in exceptional circumstances declared areas to withdraw deposits within 12 months, without penalty, in this financial year. But this occurred only after it was revealed that the farm management deposit legislation is flawed, exposing farmers to unexpected and potentially crippling tax bills. Mr Truss has known since July last year of this legislative flaw. Rather than fix it in a timely fashion, Mr Truss allowed the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to wander through speaking engagements, lunches and dinners spruiking this scheme and, in effect, selling farmers a giant tax problem when what they need is effective drought assistance. 
The third point of our plan is the provision of help to farmers to protect core breeding stock through interest rate subsidies. Although the government has pinched our policy, unfortunately for drought affected farmers, the tight-fisted Treasurer will only allow a subsidy of either five percentage points or 50 per cent of the prevailing rate—whichever is the lower. Compare this with Labor's policy. A full 100 per cent interest rate subsidy is what Labor proposed for those suffering the impact of this drought. Labor is also aware of the broader impacts of the drought beyond the broadacre farm gate. That is why we have proposed measures to address feed grain shortages and their concerns, including an immediate national audit to assess current and future national grain needs and supplies. This would enable intensive industries, such as the pork and poultry industries, to plan possible import needs to manage potential feed shortages in 2003.
Mr Truss has finally convened a feed grain meeting, but has taken no action to investigate the impact of import protocols for feed grain to ensure current quarantine standards can be protected without unnecessarily impeding imports. The minister's lack of action is risking the future of Australia's intensive industries and their hard-won export markets. It is a very important point. Industries such as our pork industry have been the recipients of millions of dollars in private and public investment and have worked extremely hard to earn international success.
The minister claims that a grain audit would expose commercial-in-confidence information. This argument was discredited by ABARE when they told me at a recent estimates hearing that they had been handling and collating this type of data since the 1940s, without any release of confidential information. It is not commercial-in-confidence information that is holding up the audit and risking the future of our intensive industries and the thousands of jobs they support; it is that Mr Truss lacks the will or the competence to take on vested interests and order an audit. Labor called for a grain audit by the end of the year, but I do not hold out much hope that the minister will realise his responsibilities in the near future.
Unlike Mr Truss, Labor wants the buck-passing and squabbling with the states to stop. A federal Labor government would work with the states to streamline the exceptional circumstances application process. Labor knows it can be done, because we have done it before. It must be remembered that when Simon Crean, as minister for primary industries, developed the national drought policy, seven of the states and territories were in conservative hands. But they signed up to the plan because it was the right policy for the nation, and Simon Crean negotiated in good faith. He did not do what Mr Truss has done, which is attempt to ram a package down the states' throats, only to sit back and blame them for choking on it. Additionally, Labor will use the COAG process to ensure a whole-of-government approach to drought policy. Finally, Labor proposes the coordination of existing rural and regional programs to assist communities to manage drought. Under this plan, regional programs would be adopted for drought affected communities and application processes would be fast tracked.
There is one area in which the government has taken a lead on drought assistance, and it might have made an excellent seventh point of our plan. Mr Howard's key policy initiative on drought has been the removal of Mr Truss from the policy process. Once removed, the minister has effectively been kept on the sidelines. Anyone who saw today's announcement by the Prime Minister, and the following question and answer session, can be in no doubt that Mr Truss is minister in name only. After the announcement, Mr Howard continually pulled Mr Anderson to the podium to answer questions, and kept the man theoretically responsible for the portfolio standing stoic and stony-faced in the background.
Some might object to the elimination, effectively, of a federal minister, but in this case it serves the national interest and Labor does not demur. With Mr Truss now safely on the sidelines, it is time for Mr Howard and Mr Anderson to do the right thing and implement the rest of Labor's drought policies. Government senators should not hesitate to wander over and collect a copy of Labor's six-point plan from me here in the chamber. But if you miss me tonight, give the Prime Minister's office a call and ask for it by name. ",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
