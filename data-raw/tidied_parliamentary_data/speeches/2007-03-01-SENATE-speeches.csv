"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-03-01,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move:
That the Veterans’ Entitlements (Special Disability Trust Beneficiary Requirements) Nomination of Agreement 2006, made under subsection 52ZZZWA(3) of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
[Legislative Instruments Act 2003 provisions apply to the instrument: must be resolved within 15 sitting days after today or the instrument will be deemed to have been disallowed.]
FRLI Number – F2006L03097
Veterans’ Entitlements (Special Disability Trust Beneficiary Requirements) Nomination of Agreement 2006
This instrument nominates, for the purposes of section 52ZZZWA(3) of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, each of the agreements entered into by the Commonwealth and a State or Territory, collectively known as the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement.  The instrument does not indicate the date of this Agreement.  Indeed, on the face of it, the instrument appears to apply to any agreement so described whenever it is made.  This would raise the prospect of breaching subsection 14(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, by which a legislative instrument may not apply any matter contained in a non-legislative instrument as in force from time to time.  The Minister advises that the Agreement is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and that it has been nominated rather than incorporated.  The Committee is seeking further advice from the Minister on these matters.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-03-01,"—Following the receipt of a satisfactory response, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for three sitting days after today, for the disallowance of determination No. HIB 29/2006 made under paragraph 1(bj) of schedule 1 to the National Health Act 1953. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee’s correspondence concerning the determination.

Determination No. HIB 29/2006 made under paragraph 1(bj) of Schedule 1 to the National Health Act 1953
19 October 2006

CANBERRA  ACT  2600
Dear Minister
I refer to Determination No. HIB 29/2006 made under paragraph (bj) of Schedule 1 to the National Health Act 1953. 
The Committee notes that this instrument amends the principal Determination which was made on 19 September 2006 and which was registered and commenced operation on 20 September 2006.  The only amendment made is to specify that the default benefit that is payable per night for nursing home type patients in a private hospital is $73.80.  In the principal Determination, the benefit was stated to be $74.80.  The Explanatory Statement indicates that this amendment is necessary because the figure of $74.80 was “an administrative oversight” that requires correction.  This amending instrument was registered on 28 September 2006, but has retrospective effect, commencing on 20 September 2006. 
The Committee makes the following comments about this present instrument, both of which suggest that this instrument has no effect.
First, the retrospective effect reduces the amount of benefit that is payable for patients and thus apparently works to the disadvantage of persons to whom that benefit is payable.  Subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 states that a legislative instrument has no effect if it takes effect before the date it is registered and as a result the rights of a person other than the Commonwealth would be affected so as to disadvantage that person. 
The Committee notes that the Explanatory Statement argues that there is no disadvantageous effect because the instrument reduces the liability of registered health benefits organisations while leaving patient contribution rates unchanged.  On the other hand, a letter from the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing addressed to the Secretary of the Committee states that the retrospective operation of the instrument is detrimental and thus, under subsection 12(2) the instrument has no effect (copy attached).  With respect, the Committee has difficulty with the argument presented in the Explanatory Statement, and agrees with the conclusion reached by the Office of Legislative Drafting.
Secondly, the present instrument appears to contravene section 46 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.  That section provides that where a legislative instrument (in this case, the principal Determination) has been registered, then no legislative instrument the same in substance as that original instrument is to be made in the period commencing on the registration date of the original instrument (in this case, 20 September 2006) and ending 7 days after the date on which the original instrument is tabled.  The original instrument was tabled on 9 October 2006 and so no similar instrument can be made until 16 October 2006.  This present instrument was made in contravention of this section and thus appears to contravene section 46 with the result that, again, it has no effect.
The Committee draws these matters to your attention and, in particular, seeks advice as to why subsection 12(2) and section 46 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 should not apply.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 24 November 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination.  Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson
Thank you for your letter of 19 October 2006 about Determination No. HIB 29/2006 made under Schedule 1, paragraph (1)(bj) of the National Health Act 1953.
I note the Committee’s comments that HIB 29/2006 may have a detrimental effect to patients. The sole purpose of creating HIB 29/2006 was to correct an administrative oversight in HIB 20/2006. Having considered the Committee’s comments, I believe there is a possibility that the retrospective operation of HIB 29/2006 may have a detrimental effect on someone other than the Commonwealth Government. I note that the amount of the detriment would be $0.90 per night and that HIB 29/2006 was made nine days after the principal Determination. My Department advises that no complaint has been received to date in relation to HIB 29/2006.
Whilst I acknowledge that there is a potential detriment, it may assist the Committee’s deliberations to consider the sequence of events as set out below:
HIB 20/2006 was registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments (FRLI) on 19 September 2006 effective 20 September 2006;
the Nursing Home Type Patient (NHTP) contribution increased to $37.30 per day;
the Commonwealth determined basic default benefit paid by health funds to hospitals for NHTP was specified as $74.70 per day;
the default benefit should have been reduced from $74.70 to $73.80, as the combined default benefit and patient contribution is capped at $111.10 per day; and
this mistake meant the basic default benefit was not changed and is therefore 90 cents more than it should have been.
To correct this error my Department took the following steps:
HIB 29/2006 was registered with FRLI on 4 October 2006;
my Department asked for it to be retrospective i.e, to take effect from 20 September 2006;
the patient contribution was unchanged at $37.30; and
the health insurance fund default benefit was amended to the correct rate of $73.80.
A legislative instrument under Schedule 1, paragraph (1)(bj) of the National Health Act 1953 was made on 26 October 2006 in order to insert new Schedules 1, 3, 4 and 6 (HIB 31/2006). This Instrument was registered on the FRLI on 30 October 2006, and on 31 October 2006 the default benefit payable by health funds to private hospitals in relation to NHTPs was reduced from $74.70 to $73.80.
In regard to the second issue raised by the Committee, where the instrument appears to contravene section 46 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, I note that HIB 29/2006 is an amending determination. Its sole purpose is to change a figure appearing in the original determination (HIB 20/2006). I believe that an amending determination involving a minor mechanical amendment of this nature does not amount to a determination that is “the same in substance” as HIB 20/2006. As such it is my view, HIB 29/2006 may be made within the seven day time period without infringing section 46 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
I trust the information I have provided has addressed the concerns raised by the Committee.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 14 December 2006 responding to the Committee’s concerns with Determination No. HIB 29/2006 made under paragraph (bj) of Schedule 1 to the National Health Act 1953.
In your response you acknowledge that there is ‘a possibility’ that the retrospective operation of this Determination may disadvantage the rights of persons other than the Commonwealth, or that there may be a ‘potential detriment’ – albeit relatively minor ($0.90 per night).  The Committee is of the opinion that, regardless of the fact that the amount of detriment is small and no complaint has been received to date, the effect of subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 applies if the retrospective operation ‘would’ be affected.  It does not depend on evidence of actual disadvantage nor the extent to which it may impact on a person or persons.  It is the view of the Committee that subsection 12(2) does apply in this case and that, as a matter of law, the instrument is thus rendered ineffective. The Committee would appreciate guidance on whether the Department has sought independent legal advice on this issue, and on the related issue of whether the uncertainties surrounding the validity of this instrument could be resolved through the making of primary legislation.
Notwithstanding the comments above, the Committee would also like to take the opportunity to address the second matter raised by this Determination, namely whether it was the same in substance as a previously tabled Determination.  The case law is sparse on this subject but in Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers v The Commonwealth (CLR 67, p.389), McTiernan J considered a regulation to be the same in substance ‘if, irrespective of its form or expression it was so much like the disallowed regulation in its general legal operation that it could be fairly said to be the same law as the disallowed regulation’.  In your response you consider that HIB 29/2006 was not the same in substance as HIB 20/2006 as it is an amending Determination involving a minor mechanical amendment.  However, the Committee notes that HIB 29/2006 included identical Schedules to those found in HIB 20/2006 with only a minor variation to one fee in one schedule.  Given McTiernan J’s test, HIB 29/2006 would seem to be the same in substance as HIB 20/2006 and therefore in breach of section 46 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.  The Committee would appreciate guidance on whether the Department has sought independent legal advice on this issue and its effect on the validity of the instrument.
The Committee acknowledges that ultimately the legal standing of this Determination will be a matter for the courts.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 26 February 2007, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination.  Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson
Thank you for your letter of 8 February 2007 in response to my letter of 14 December 2006 about Determination HIB 29/2006 made under Schedule 1, paragraph (1)(bj) of the National Health Act 1953.
As indicated in my letter of 14 December 2006, HIB 29/2006 potentially had a detrimental effect. Therefore, my Department has taken the view that, under subsection 12(2) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (the LIA), this instrument had no effect. Another legislative instrument was made on 26 October 2006 (HIB 31/2006) which made further amendments to HIB 20/2006, including amendments to Schedule 4. As HIB 29/2006 had no effect, there does not appear to be a need to resolve the issue through making primary legislation.
In relation to the second issue raised by the Committee, the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) has provided advice to my Department on the meaning of `same in substance'. I have enclosed that advice for your reference.
While the advice deals with whether an instrument can be made while HIB 29/2006 is subject to a motion to disallow (section 47 of the LIA), it also provides guidance on how the words `same in substance' should be interpreted for the purposes of the LIA.
My Department made instrument HIB 0l /2007 pursuant to that advice. The AGS’s advice indicates that regard needs to be given to the substantive effect of HIB 29/2006, which was to only amend Schedule 4, “the fact that‑all the Schedules to HIB 20/2006 have been physically attached to HIB 29/2006 and registered, does not change this substantive effect of HIB 2912006.”
I trust that the information I have provided has addressed the concerns raised by the Committee.
Yours sincerely
Tony Abbott
Minister for Health and Ageing
Encl:  Attachment: Advice from AGS
Farhana
I refer to your e‑mail below and to our discussions about this matter.
As foreshadowed, our advice is brief, given the urgency of the matter. We would be happy to expand on the matters in it, as necessary.
As discussed, generally, in the context of s 47, a legislative instrument would be the ‘same in substance’ with an instrument subject to a motion to disallow if it produced ‘substantially the same result ...even though they might be different in detail’ (see Pearce and Argument Delegated Legislation in Australia 3rd Edition at [13.38] when discussing Victorian Chambers of Manufactures v Commonwealth (Women’s
Employment Regulations) (1943) 67 CLR 347.
We think Schedule 5 of HIB20/2006 could be amended while HIB29/2006 is subject to a motion to disallow. In this context, we think that a legislative instrument amending Schedule 5 would not be the same in substance as HIB29/2006. The only substantive effect that HIB29/2006 had was to amend Schedule 4 which deals with Nursing Home Type Patient Accommodation. (The fact that, apparently through some error, all the Schedules to HIB20/2006 have been physically attached to HIB29/2006 and registered, does not change this substantive effect of HIB29/2006 in the context of s 47.) However, the proposed amending legislative instrument would deal with amendments to Schedule 5 which deals with Second Tier Default Benefit for Overnight and Day Only Treatment. Schedules 4 and 5 appear to us to deal with different episodes of hospital treatment. Therefore, a legislative instrument amending Schedule 5 would not be the ‘same in substance’ as HIB29/2006.
We also think the Department may revoke and remake HIB20/2006 under the current circumstances. Given the substantive effect of HIB29/2006 discussed above, we do not think that a legislative instrument revoking and remaking HIB20/2006 would be the ‘same in substance’ as it.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-03-01,"—At the request of the Leader of the Australian Greens, pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Bob Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate , namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 735.
I understand there will now be a debate for 30 minutes with five minutes allotted per speaker. I would like to say how shocked I am that a member of the government does not understand the current Australian legislation, especially since Senator Minchin, Senator Abetz—any number of government ministers—yesterday went to great lengths to reassure Australians that there was a ban on nuclear power stations and that there would need to be a change of the law. They tried to hose down the fact that all over the country people are worried that there is going to be a nuclear power station in their backyard.
Yesterday I indicated—and it is in the newspapers today—that the Greens will release a report today stating that the homes of all Australians are at risk because of what this government is doing. The Prime Minister is quite happy to allow people such as Hugh Morgan, Ron Walker and Robert de Crespigny to have insurance for their nuclear power facility, but all Australian homeowners have an exclusion clause in their home insurance stating, ‘Your house is not insured against damage from any accident or any explosion or any other thing at a nuclear power station.’ That means the homes of everyone around Lucas Heights are not insured at the moment. Now we find the government wants to run out with a report saying, ‘There will be 25 nuclear power stations around Australia.’ The Australia Institute has put out a list which considers the criteria. It includes Port Augusta, Townsville, Portland and the area all around Port Phillip Bay. What we do know from the Ziggy Switkowski report is that these power stations need to be sited within 100 kilometres of a built-up area and they will probably need to be on the coast because of water restrictions; nuclear power stations require a huge amount of water.
I thank Senator Watson for giving me this opportunity to stand up in the Senate and tell all Australians that their homes are not insured, and that they are not going to be insured under this government unless the government supports a private member’s bill, which the Greens are going to introduce, which makes it very clear that nuclear power facility operators will take absolute liability. That is what they have done everywhere else in the world where there are nuclear facilities. The US, Britain, Japan, Germany and the UK have all signed the Vienna Convention on Civilian Liability for Nuclear Damage because they recognise that nuclear damage will be nothing like the results of normal pollution and so on.
This government has not signed on to the Vienna Convention for Civilian Liability for Nuclear Damage. I ask every Australian to get out their house insurance policy today and check out the exclusion clause. They will find that the Prime Minister has put them in the situation where, if there is a nuclear accident, a nuclear explosion or whatever, they have no option but to take legal action. They will have to prove negligence against the operator. The Nuclear Energy Agency has said that it is inappropriate for civilians to have to do that. That is why other countries have signed on to the Vienna convention, the Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the joint protocol—so that this does not occur in their countries.
The government is very happy to run out its lines on nuclear power stations, but it is not happy to explain to Australians that they are totally vulnerable. Unlike Ron Walker and Hugh Morgan, for ordinary Australians the biggest asset they have is their home. They are going to find that their homes are not insured. This is an absolutely unacceptable situation. It is all very well to talk about interest rates. People out in the suburbs are going to be very focused not just on interest rates but also on the fact that the Prime Minister is happy to insure the rich against damage to their facility yet not happy to allow ordinary Australians to be insured against damage from his nuclear folly.
That is what this is—the Prime Minister’s nuclear folly, which does nothing about climate change. I am glad that those sceptics were here in Parliament House yesterday. Running along to support the sceptics and rubbing shoulders with them, we saw none other than members of parliament. We had Martin Ferguson, Dick Adams, Craig Emerson and Senator Minchin—the whole lot of them—rubbing shoulders with the sceptics, on the one hand supporting nuclear—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,9,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2007-03-01,"—I understand that Senator Watson wanted clarification of the law as it stands in relation to nuclear power stations. The advice I have is that the current law does not allow the construction of nuclear power stations as such. The motion foreshadowed by Senator Milne is one which the government supports. It outlines the current position. I do not see a need to suspend standing orders, therefore, with the government supporting this motion. In the interests of conserving time, I suggest we dispose of this motion to suspend standing orders, move back to the agenda and vote on the substantive motion, which is motion No. 735, to be moved by Senator Milne. I foreshadow that the government will support that. But I understand Senator Watson wanted that clarification. He has received that clarification and on that basis would not deny formality.
—Let us clarify this. To enable Senator Watson to withdraw his objection, Senator Milne would have to withdraw her motion of suspension, by leave.
—No.
—She is not going to do that.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,9,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-03-01,"—Whatever happens in terms of the procedures, which I am sure will be worked out eventually, I think it is appropriate that the opposition has the opportunity to put its views in the Hansard in relation to both the motion and the rather extraordinary position that Senator Watson, and now the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, support. I make it clear that the Labor Party’s intention is to support Senator Milne’s motion. We do not support the establishment of nuclear power facilities in Australia. The government are yet again demonstrating how divided they are on the issue of nuclear power in Australia. We have had two question times now where Senator Abetz refused—
—It is a matter of clarification. You are pathetic.
—Senator Chapman, will you rule out, as a senator for South Australia, supporting a nuclear facility in South Australia? Senator Minchin has refused to do so. You are refusing to do so. Senator Abetz refuses to rule out a facility being established in Tasmania. Now we have Senator Watson—against his party’s position, apparently, if Senator Ellison’s contribution is correct—saying, ‘We deny leave’—for a motion to be moved which simply endorses the existing law in Australia. The government is all over the place when it comes to nuclear power.
—Senator Watson was seeking a clarification, and you know it. Tell the truth.
—Senator Chapman, you can heckle all you like, but in this election year people will understand that one of the major parties is completely equivocal on nuclear power and has said, ‘We will not allow the establishment of nuclear power facilities in Australia.’
—You just dissemble. You don’t tell the truth. You tell lies.
—Order! Senator Chapman!
—I will take that interjection, Senator Chapman, which I think is probably unparliamentary.
—Senator Chapman, withdraw that remark.
—I withdraw, Mr President.
—I invite Senator Chapman to indicate whether he is willing, as a South Australian senator, to rule out supporting the establishment of a nuclear power facility in his home state and I ask Senator Watson in which of the seats of Bass, Braddon, Denison, Franklin and Lyons he is happy to see a nuclear power facility established. Let us be clear. We have a government that does not know which way is up, does not know what it is doing on nuclear power and is entirely equivocal about it. The government clearly has people within its ranks who are quite happy to establish nuclear power facilities in various places in Australia.
Do you know what is really bad? The government are not prepared to come clean with the Australian public. They are not prepared to be honest and say: ‘Yes, we want to do it—and this is how we are going to do it. This is the process for consultation and this is the process for establishment.’ They have a go at us because, they say, we are shutting down the debate, but what do they want? They want a debate on their terms. They want to be able to debate it theoretically—to support nuclear power—but not have to front up to the Australian people and say where it is going to be and what the process for putting it in place will be.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,9,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-01,"—The question before the chair is that this motion be given priority because it was denied formality. I appreciate that Senator Watson was seeking clarification. I do not think any of us know every single detail of every piece of legislation and law that has been passed by this parliament, but I do think it is important to emphasise for the record that nuclear power stations are clearly illegal under current law. Indeed, for the benefit of those who are interested, I specifically refer them to sections 37J and 140A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, sections that were put in the legislation specifically as a result of the Democrats’ actions. Those sections quite clearly state:
The Minister must not approve an action consisting of or involving the construction or operation of ...
a nuclear fuel fabrication plant;
a nuclear power plant;
an enrichment plant;
a reprocessing facility.
That is the law as things stand. It is an important and urgent matter to absolutely clarify this by way of a vote of the Senate precisely because of the confusion, particularly in government ranks, about what exactly the government’s position is on nuclear power stations. Are they just thinking about it? Are they just putting a review forward? Will they allow it down the track, potentially, if all these things stack up? Are they determined to do it and that is their policy? Or is it somewhere in between all those things? Or will it be that a nuclear power plant, reprocessing facility or enrichment plant is only okay if it is in someone else’s place or if we stick it in the Northern Territory like we did with the nuclear waste facility?
We do need to clarify the government’s position on these things beyond simply a reaffirmation of the current law which bans nuclear power stations. It is pleasing the government are at least affirming—or, according to Senator Ellison, endorsing—existing Australian law. It would be a bit of a problem if they did not endorse existing law. They can always put forward a proposal to change the law, and that is the key question mark. That will not be resolved by any vote here today from the government members, because it is quite clear that there is a lot of confusion and uncertainty in government ranks.
There is no confusion or uncertainty on the part of the Democrats, who have opposed this since our inception 30 years ago and have opposed uranium mining as well for 30 years. It has caused no confusion amongst the Labor Party or the Greens party. But this does also highlight an absolutely critical issue for the upcoming federal election, because the federal election is not just about whether Mr Rudd or Mr Howard will become Prime Minister after the election. It is quite clear that Mr Howard is hell-bent on advancing the nuclear industry in Australia and is hell-bent on enabling the construction of nuclear power stations. But the key point which this motion reaffirms and makes clear is that that would require a change in the law. It does not matter if Mr Howard gets back in as Prime Minister. He will still need to change the law to enable that to happen. There is all this talk of overriding the states. That could only happen if the existing law was changed, and the only way the existing law could be changed is if it is passed not just by Mr Howard’s echo chamber in the House of Representatives but by this Senate.
We need a clear indication from the government that they will not try to use their numbers to railroad through a change in the law on this matter before the election. We need the message to get out clearly to the Australian people, even those people in the community who may want to return a Howard government for a range of other reasons, that if they are against a nuclear power station being built in their backyard they have to ensure the Senate is taken off—
—The old NIMBY principle is alive and well!
—Are you willing to support it being built in South Australia then?
—We should have the debate.
—Are you willing to support it?
—We should have the debate and look at the evidence.
—You will not even make a clear-cut affirmation. It is a simple thing. Frankly, I do not want a nuclear power station built in anyone’s backyard. I do not want nuclear power stations built in Australia. I do not want nuclear processing facilities built in Australia. I do not want an enrichment plant built in Australia. Those are all illegal under current law. If people want the law to be protected from being changed, they need to get the Senate away from the control of the government at this coming election. That is a simple fact. Whoever they end up wanting to have as the party of government, their only hope of preventing a nuclear power station being built in Australia under a future Liberal government is if they remove the Senate from the control of the coalition, otherwise they are putting us at grave risk of the potential advance of the nuclear industry. That is why this debate is important, and that is why it is appropriate to suspend standing orders to ensure that this motion is put on the record, but it is also important to emphasise that this is a key reason why the Senate vote at the next election is just as important as who ends up being Prime Minister.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,9,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-03-01,"—What a shambles by the government. What a total shambles and meltdown we have got here today from a government that is supposed to be in control of this place. Senator Milne brings in a motion—
—That is your typical dissembling attitude.
—Embarrassed they might be, braying on the benches opposite. This is an extraordinary muck-up of business, but there is much more to be said about it. Senator Milne brings in a motion to back up the law which bans nuclear power stations in this country, and perhaps the most senior senator on the government benches, Senator Watson, says he wants clarification as to whether such a law exists.
When you get to the facts on this, it is a very big debating point. The Prime Minister has led the nation into a debate on nuclear power stations in the last six months, and friends of his have flagged to him a proposal to build the first nuclear power station. They have not yet said where, but it sounds like Port Augusta is head of the list. Geelong might be on it, Portland might be on it, and goodness knows where else. Senator Watson says, ‘Where is the law that bans nuclear power stations?’ It is in the Australian radiation protection act and in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, both of which were put forward and passed by this government. Senator Watson supported them here six years ago. Prime Minister Howard supported them six years ago. The debate was in here. And now we have the same government members who supported the ban on nuclear power stations just a few years ago saying, ‘Is there a ban on nuclear power stations?’
What goes on over there? Who has lost the plot? Prime Minister Howard apparently does not know that his government put a ban on nuclear power stations. Certainly Senator Minchin had to have it drawn to his attention by the Greens a month ago because he did not know. Here we have this debate led by the Prime Minister to do something which is illegal. Isn’t that incredible? The Prime Minister himself has put tens of thousands of dollars into the Switkowski report proposing to do something which is illegal in this country.
What are they going to do next? The proposal from the Prime Minister is that up to 25 nuclear power stations be built around Australia, totally contrary to his own laws. He is proposing something that is illegal, to be foisted on the Australian people. Why? Because the same Prime Minister for 10 years has been totally derelict in his duty to this nation and to its future in not addressing global heating and climate change. In fact, he has been making the scenario for the future much worse, much more economically damaging, much more environmentally disastrous, much more socially disruptive through his own negligence, through this government’s negligence.
This morning we have a complete shambles. I say to Senator Watson and other government members opposite: yes, nuclear power stations are illegal because you voted for it. It was your legislation that made it illegal, not once but twice. Do your homework. Come in here prepared. This topic has been put to the top of the national agenda by the Prime Minister, and members of his government do not understand it. They do not know their own history and they do not know that what the Prime Minister is proposing is, in effect, illegal in this country.
Having established that, the extraordinary thing is that we are about to have a vote in which the government endorses the ban on nuclear power stations, contrary to the Prime Minister wanting to have nuclear power stations. Let us see the absurdity of this.
To bring this farce to an end, I seek leave of the Senate so that Senator Watson can withdraw his opposition to formality for the motion and we can get on with the motion being put.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2007-03-01,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Senator Mason, I present the report of the committee Transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Today the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee has presented a unanimous report on its inquiry into the transparency and accountability of Commonwealth funding and expenditure.


The issue at the heart of this report is nothing less than the accountability of the executive government to the legislature and through the legislature to the people.


In recent years in Australia, and especially since the High Court’s judgement in the 
Combet
 case in 2005, there has been a growing perception that the Parliament may have lost some measure of its historical and constitutional responsibility to control the finances of the executive government.


The Senate was sufficiently concerned about this perception that in June 2006 it referred the matter of the transparency and accountability of the Commonwealth’s public funding and expenditure to a committee for inquiry and report.


Historical perspective


Since Federation there have been many changes to the way in which the Commonwealth Government has accounted for its funding and expenditure. The extended responsibilities of government, the massive increase in the size of the national economy, and changes in the disciplines of accounting and management have all played a part in this.


Historically, governments have operated on an annual cash basis. There was good reason for this. Parliaments were able easily to safeguard their constitutional rights and responsibilities on that basis.


In the past twenty years, however, there have been significant changes in the way that the executive government has presented its budget to the Parliament for approval. These changes have led inevitably to changes to the Parliament’s processes for appropriating money for the purposes of the executive. There have also been significant changes in the ways in which governments account for past expenditure.


In the 1980s the government adopted a system of program budgeting. Then, in 1997, the Commonwealth Government introduced accrual accounting. In 1999-2000 the Commonwealth Budget was produced for the first time based on accrual accounting principles in. In that budget the Government also introduced the outcomes and outputs reporting framework.


In some respects the changes that were made then and have since been refined appear to have been positive, and have for example provided the opportunity for public sector managers to manage better. They have also provided, through the medium of accrual accounting, information about the real state of the Commonwealth’s finances. The changes have also resulted in increased transparency for expenditure after the event.


However, it has become apparent that these positive outcomes have been accompanied by some negative outcomes, in particular in the appropriation processes.


In the time I have today I shall focus on only some of the main matters covered in the Committee’s report.


Multiple sources of funding


Among the particular matters of concern to the Senate, as expressed in its reference to the Committee, were the impact on the fiscal responsibilities of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of:


Outcome budget appropriations and reporting;


Multiple sources of funding; and


The use of ordinary annual services to fund activities including non-annual services.


As I have mentioned, historically Parliaments have appropriated funds for the annual services of the government. Currently, however, some 80 percent of the Commonwealth Government’s funds are supplied by way of Special Appropriations. These appropriations are typically used to pay for continuing expenses, for example, for pensions, where the recipient’s entitlement lasts for longer than a year. Very few Special Appropriations lapse at the end of a financial year. Most are open-ended.


An issue of concern to the Committee is that Parliament in reality has little control over these Special Appropriations. Funding and expenditure under Special Appropriations are usually scrutinised only when an enabling or amendment bill comes before us. Admittedly, expenditure is reported in many different budget documents, but there is no consolidated report that would assist the Parliament and the Senate in particular, through the estimates processes, to scrutinise expenditure.


The Committee has recommended therefore that the government should produce a separate document that sets out the past and expected expenditure from all Special Appropriations and table that document with the annual budget documents.


The ability of government agencies to carry over funds from year to year is also a matter of some concern to the Committee. Prior to the implementation of accrual budgeting, agencies were not able to carry over funds. Now, however, agencies are funded for future liabilities, for example, for employees’ entitlements and for depreciation, and may carry over those funds that are not spent during the year.


The Committee has recommended that agencies report the amounts of unspent appropriations and the reasons for not spending the appropriations to the Department of Finance and Administration at the end of each financial year, and that the government should table a consolidated report of the amounts and reasons within six months of the end of the financial year.


The Committee has also recommended that unless the government can propose another mechanism that would overcome the transparency and accountability issues raised by the carry overs it should discontinue the appropriation of funds to agencies for the purpose of depreciation.


The outcomes/outputs framework


A number of witnesses and, indeed, members of the High Court have remarked on the high level of specification of outcomes in the budget documents. At times outcomes appear as little more than aspirations. Outcomes expressed in such terms are obviously of little use in defining the purposes of an appropriation.


The Committee has recommended therefore that outcomes be expressed in clear, simple and measurable terms.


The Committee has also recommended that expenditure should be reported at the program level in the budget documents, including in the Appropriation Acts.


Portfolio Budget Statements


The former Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee produced three separate reports on the format of the Portfolio Budget Statements in 1997, 1999 and 2000. It is worth recalling that in its report of November 2000 the Committee stated that:


… the PBS are … well-crafted documents which contain a wealth of useful information, once the reader has grasped the underlying concepts of accrual accounting, budgeting processes, the reporting framework and reporting requirements. The PBS are not for the uninitiated.


They are evolving, however, and may eventually reach a point where they can more closely merge the government’s aspirations for them as budgeting statements and senators’ hopes for a simple, straightforward, user-friendly, yet detailed guide to the estimates.


It was timely therefore for the Committee to consider again, under the second of its terms of reference, options for improving the transparency and specificity of the budget papers. The Committee has made recommendations for improvements to the PBS, including one for a common approach to the documents and for the inclusion of estimates for three forward years for departmental and administered items.


 
Other Measures to improve Parliament’s oversight


The Committee was required by the third of its terms of reference to nominate other measures to improve the Parliament’s oversight of proposed and actual Commonwealth funding and expenditure.


The Committee has recommended, among other things, the Appropriation Acts should be drafted so as to make it clear that appropriations for departmental expenses must be expended against a specified outcome or purpose.


Conclusion


To conclude, the challenges to the appropriations processes do not arise directly from accrual accounting or budgeting. Indeed, the Committee supports those measures.


However, as the Committee has found, there are quite significant shortcomings in the application of the measures for the Commonwealth’s funding and expenditure.


The Committee considers that its recommendations, if implemented, should go some way to restoring the Parliament’s historical and constitutional responsibilities with regard to public funding and expenditure.


I commend the report to the Senate.
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-01,"—The remarks I make will be brief. This report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is entitled Transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure. The title will probably make those who are more interested in the lively side of public policy move on. Yet, in my opinion, this is an extremely important report by the committee. It is one which has engaged serious thinkers in this area across the community and one which has engaged the members of the committee to a level and degree of participation, interaction and involvement which is unusual, even by the high standards of the Senate. When the draft report came out, no fewer than four members of the committee made very substantial and detailed additional contributions. I note that the unanimous report that has been produced as a consequence has 19 far-reaching recommendations which are in the interests of any government because they go right to the heart of introducing measures which will improve the nature, function and efficacy of our system.
The transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure is right at the heart of parliamentary life. Those who understand the history of parliaments know that this is the battlefield on which hundreds and thousands of people have lost their lives. It is about the right of people to determine how they are to be taxed and how that taxation is to be spent by those who govern them. The fact that the history of striving for good government goes back centuries and is steeped in blood should remind us that, as dull as this may seem to those who seek other pastures of interest, this is material which goes right to the very heart of our parliamentary function. I therefore commend the report to those members of the fourth estate and of the community who are serious minded. I want to express particular thanks to the chair, the acting chair and the deputy chair of the committee for being able to contribute to what is a genuine cross-party effort, which, if adopted by the government, I think will result in markedly improved systems and standards in Commonwealth funding and expenditure.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-03-01,"—I rise to speak on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration report, Transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure. Although I am only a participating member of this committee, I note that this report deals with a number of issues in relation to the financial and reporting framework of government that Labor has spoken about previously. I want to place on record a number of issues that I think are confirmed by or arise out of the report. It is clear, from the terms of this report, that there are some real problems with and holes in the existing system, which is intended to provide transparency and accountability. Senator Murray has gone through a number of these. I have also spoken previously in this place on Australian National Audit Office reports which have identified deficiencies in the current reporting framework.
I want to talk particularly about three recommendations in the report. The first is recommendation 3, which relates to transfers of amounts between different forms of appropriations. The committee has recommended that such transfers be highlighted in reporting documents. It is a concern that a great many transfers are not disclosed until substantially after the event, and, in the interests of transparency in Commonwealth financial reports and in the reporting framework, it seems quite appropriate that there be mechanisms by which such transfers can be highlighted at the appropriate time. The committee has noted that the reporting of such transfers may not occur until well after the event. This does create difficulties for members of the public and also for senators, particularly in the context of Senate estimates in determining when such transfers have in fact occurred. I look forward to the government dealing with this issue.
Recommendation 5 deals with unspent appropriations. The committee has recommended that the agencies report the amounts of their unspent appropriations and the reasons for the underspends to Finance at the end of each financial year. It seems quite odd with this issue that there is not an easily accessible record of underspends by government. As a senator who has done estimates committees in a number of areas, I say that in some portfolios the extent to which there has been an underspend is quite extraordinary. An obvious example over the last four years has been in the Environment portfolio. I recall that a number of programs administered by the Australian Greenhouse Office over time were regularly—as I think the term was—‘rephased’, which means they could not spend as much money as the government had theoretically allocated, the programs were not up and running sufficiently and the money kept being pushed forward to an outer year. That happened throughout a number of estimates processes that I was involved in. It is difficult to know the extent to which the government is in fact spending what it says it will spend across portfolios without a more transparent mechanism for identifying that across government.
We also know that it is often difficult to determine overspends—that is, departments running operating deficits. I recall in relation to the CSIRO that it took Labor senators an estimates process of asking questions before the actual extent of the deficit which the CSIRO were running in that financial year was disclosed. It was significantly more than had been agreed with them by Finance. The actual amount of the overspend, or the deficit, was not disclosed until the estimates process. My recollection of the most recent estimates, a couple of weeks ago, is that we had the department of immigration disclosing, in the context of an estimates hearing, a $50 million or $60 million overspend, significantly more than what had been agreed with Finance. So we have unders and overs, and the government really needs to get its house in order and be clearer and more transparent about what has occurred in relation to appropriated expenditure.
I agree with the recommendation of the committee that there should be some mechanism whereby underspent appropriations are reported to the parliament with the reasons for the underspends. It might be politically embarrassing for the government, but one would have thought, given that the appropriation bills go through both this and the other chamber, that if government departments are not spending the amount that they have requested from the parliament they ought, in the interests of accountability, in fact disclose that and the reasons why. There may be reasons which are reasonable and there may not be reasons which are reasonable—and that would be a matter for political debate—but surely accountability requires that they in fact report those.
We have spoken a number of times in this place over the last couple of days—and I note my colleagues Senator Conroy, yesterday, and Senator Sherry did talk about this—about the general decline in the financial accountability standards of the Howard government, particularly over the last two or three years. There have been some reasonably high-profile examples of that. Perhaps the most notorious in recent times was the $10 billion water package, which we have spoken about on a number of occasions. Putting the media aspects aside, there is a more serious issue here. I would suggest to the chamber, and it is entirely consistent with the Auditor-General’s reports in relation to the outputs framework and the other reporting mechanisms which have been described, that, arguably, budget papers are now less transparent and less understandable for users than they have been previously.

Senator Murray interjecting—

—Senator Murray suggests that was intended, I think.
—No, ‘and than was intended’.
—That may well be the case. Certainly the rhetoric when this reporting framework was introduced was that it was supposedly going to make things much more understandable and much more accountable—and the fact is it has not. I think senators understand that because we do the estimates process. One would have thought it would not be a particularly difficult ask to get program level amounts, to understand what is allocated within a line item of an output to particular programs, but the reality is many departments refuse to provide that information and the information is aggregated at such a high level it is actually very difficult at times to get clear advice about how much the government is spending under particular programs. The government may want to hide that. It may want to have outputs aggregated at very high levels so it can hide a whole range of its programs and not tell us what is being underspent, what is being overspent and what it is actually doing or not doing. But it is not particularly accountable to announce packages and then not be clear with the parliament and the Australian people, through your financial reporting framework, as to precisely what is being spent and where.
There have been a number of reports by the Auditor-General which have pointed this out. I suggest that this committee report also points this out. We also have independent commentators such as Dr Fels and Mr Brenchley, who recently observed in the Australian Financial Review that the government’s financial discipline and management is in decay and its approach to the financial framework appears to be alarmingly weak. This is an issue of accountability. This is about ensuring that you do with the money what you say you will do. It is about ensuring the parliament is clear about what moneys are being appropriated for. But it is also about performance. We can talk about accountability, which is an extremely important principle, but it is also about performance, because the logic behind a financial reporting framework is to enable users of it, including the public, members of parliament and senators, to be able to make some sort of judgement on the information presented as to whether the purpose for which the money has been appropriated has been achieved and whether there has been performance. If the government were confident about their ability to justify their performance then clearly they would be far more open about disclosing the state of government finances. The government should listen to this report, just as they should take on board the Auditor-General’s report. I look forward to their response on this issue, but I have a feeling it will be a very long time coming. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

In the past twenty years, however, there have been significant changes in the way that the executive government has presented its budget to the Parliament for approval. These changes have led inevitably to changes to the Parliament’s processes for appropriating money for the purposes of the executive. There have also been significant changes in the ways in which governments account for past expenditure.


In the 1980s the government adopted a system of program budgeting. Then, in 1997, the Commonwealth Government introduced accrual accounting. In 1999-2000 the Commonwealth Budget was produced for the first time based on accrual accounting principles in. In that budget the Government also introduced the outcomes and outputs reporting framework.


In some respects the changes that were made then and have since been refined appear to have been positive, and have for example provided the opportunity for public sector managers to manage better. They have also provided, through the medium of accrual accounting, information about the real state of the Commonwealth’s finances. The changes have also resulted in increased transparency for expenditure after the event.


However, it has become apparent that these positive outcomes have been accompanied by some negative outcomes, in particular in the appropriation processes.


In the time I have today I shall focus on only some of the main matters covered in the Committee’s report.


Multiple sources of funding


Among the particular matters of concern to the Senate, as expressed in its reference to the Committee, were the impact on the fiscal responsibilities of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of:


Outcome budget appropriations and reporting;


Multiple sources of funding; and


The use of ordinary annual services to fund activities including non-annual services.


As I have mentioned, historically Parliaments have appropriated funds for the annual services of the government. Currently, however, some 80 percent of the Commonwealth Government’s funds are supplied by way of Special Appropriations. These appropriations are typically used to pay for continuing expenses, for example, for pensions, where the recipient’s entitlement lasts for longer than a year. Very few Special Appropriations lapse at the end of a financial year. Most are open-ended.


An issue of concern to the Committee is that Parliament in reality has little control over these Special Appropriations. Funding and expenditure under Special Appropriations are usually scrutinised only when an enabling or amendment bill comes before us. Admittedly, expenditure is reported in many different budget documents, but there is no consolidated report that would assist the Parliament and the Senate in particular, through the estimates processes, to scrutinise expenditure.


The Committee has recommended therefore that the government should produce a separate document that sets out the past and expected expenditure from all Special Appropriations and table that document with the annual budget documents.


The ability of government agencies to carry over funds from year to year is also a matter of some concern to the Committee. Prior to the implementation of accrual budgeting, agencies were not able to carry over funds. Now, however, agencies are funded for future liabilities, for example, for employees’ entitlements and for depreciation, and may carry over those funds that are not spent during the year.


The Committee has recommended that agencies report the amounts of unspent appropriations and the reasons for not spending the appropriations to the Department of Finance and Administration at the end of each financial year, and that the government should table a consolidated report of the amounts and reasons within six months of the end of the financial year.


The Committee has also recommended that unless the government can propose another mechanism that would overcome the transparency and accountability issues raised by the carry overs it should discontinue the appropriation of funds to agencies for the purpose of depreciation.


The outcomes/outputs framework


A number of witnesses and, indeed, members of the High Court have remarked on the high level of specification of outcomes in the budget documents. At times outcomes appear as little more than aspirations. Outcomes expressed in such terms are obviously of little use in defining the purposes of an appropriation.


The Committee has recommended therefore that outcomes be expressed in clear, simple and measurable terms.


The Committee has also recommended that expenditure should be reported at the program level in the budget documents, including in the Appropriation Acts.


Portfolio Budget Statements


The former Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee produced three separate reports on the format of the Portfolio Budget Statements in 1997, 1999 and 2000. It is worth recalling that in its report of November 2000 the Committee stated that:


… the PBS are … well-crafted documents which contain a wealth of useful information, once the reader has grasped the underlying concepts of accrual accounting, budgeting processes, the reporting framework and reporting requirements. The PBS are not for the uninitiated.


They are evolving, however, and may eventually reach a point where they can more closely merge the government’s aspirations for them as budgeting statements and senators’ hopes for a simple, straightforward, user-friendly, yet detailed guide to the estimates.


It was timely therefore for the Committee to consider again, under the second of its terms of reference, options for improving the transparency and specificity of the budget papers. The Committee has made recommendations for improvements to the PBS, including one for a common approach to the documents and for the inclusion of estimates for three forward years for departmental and administered items.


 
Other Measures to improve Parliament’s oversight


The Committee was required by the third of its terms of reference to nominate other measures to improve the Parliament’s oversight of proposed and actual Commonwealth funding and expenditure.


The Committee has recommended, among other things, the Appropriation Acts should be drafted so as to make it clear that appropriations for departmental expenses must be expended against a specified outcome or purpose.


Conclusion


To conclude, the challenges to the appropriations processes do not arise directly from accrual accounting or budgeting. Indeed, the Committee supports those measures.


However, as the Committee has found, there are quite significant shortcomings in the application of the measures for the Commonwealth’s funding and expenditure.


The Committee considers that its recommendations, if implemented, should go some way to restoring the Parliament’s historical and constitutional responsibilities with regard to public funding and expenditure.


I commend the report to the Senate.
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-01,"—The remarks I make will be brief. This report from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is entitled Transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure. The title will probably make those who are more interested in the lively side of public policy move on. Yet, in my opinion, this is an extremely important report by the committee. It is one which has engaged serious thinkers in this area across the community and one which has engaged the members of the committee to a level and degree of participation, interaction and involvement which is unusual, even by the high standards of the Senate. When the draft report came out, no fewer than four members of the committee made very substantial and detailed additional contributions. I note that the unanimous report that has been produced as a consequence has 19 far-reaching recommendations which are in the interests of any government because they go right to the heart of introducing measures which will improve the nature, function and efficacy of our system.
The transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure is right at the heart of parliamentary life. Those who understand the history of parliaments know that this is the battlefield on which hundreds and thousands of people have lost their lives. It is about the right of people to determine how they are to be taxed and how that taxation is to be spent by those who govern them. The fact that the history of striving for good government goes back centuries and is steeped in blood should remind us that, as dull as this may seem to those who seek other pastures of interest, this is material which goes right to the very heart of our parliamentary function. I therefore commend the report to those members of the fourth estate and of the community who are serious minded. I want to express particular thanks to the chair, the acting chair and the deputy chair of the committee for being able to contribute to what is a genuine cross-party effort, which, if adopted by the government, I think will result in markedly improved systems and standards in Commonwealth funding and expenditure.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-03-01,"—I rise to speak on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration report, Transparency and accountability of Commonwealth public funding and expenditure. Although I am only a participating member of this committee, I note that this report deals with a number of issues in relation to the financial and reporting framework of government that Labor has spoken about previously. I want to place on record a number of issues that I think are confirmed by or arise out of the report. It is clear, from the terms of this report, that there are some real problems with and holes in the existing system, which is intended to provide transparency and accountability. Senator Murray has gone through a number of these. I have also spoken previously in this place on Australian National Audit Office reports which have identified deficiencies in the current reporting framework.
I want to talk particularly about three recommendations in the report. The first is recommendation 3, which relates to transfers of amounts between different forms of appropriations. The committee has recommended that such transfers be highlighted in reporting documents. It is a concern that a great many transfers are not disclosed until substantially after the event, and, in the interests of transparency in Commonwealth financial reports and in the reporting framework, it seems quite appropriate that there be mechanisms by which such transfers can be highlighted at the appropriate time. The committee has noted that the reporting of such transfers may not occur until well after the event. This does create difficulties for members of the public and also for senators, particularly in the context of Senate estimates in determining when such transfers have in fact occurred. I look forward to the government dealing with this issue.
Recommendation 5 deals with unspent appropriations. The committee has recommended that the agencies report the amounts of their unspent appropriations and the reasons for the underspends to Finance at the end of each financial year. It seems quite odd with this issue that there is not an easily accessible record of underspends by government. As a senator who has done estimates committees in a number of areas, I say that in some portfolios the extent to which there has been an underspend is quite extraordinary. An obvious example over the last four years has been in the Environment portfolio. I recall that a number of programs administered by the Australian Greenhouse Office over time were regularly—as I think the term was—‘rephased’, which means they could not spend as much money as the government had theoretically allocated, the programs were not up and running sufficiently and the money kept being pushed forward to an outer year. That happened throughout a number of estimates processes that I was involved in. It is difficult to know the extent to which the government is in fact spending what it says it will spend across portfolios without a more transparent mechanism for identifying that across government.
We also know that it is often difficult to determine overspends—that is, departments running operating deficits. I recall in relation to the CSIRO that it took Labor senators an estimates process of asking questions before the actual extent of the deficit which the CSIRO were running in that financial year was disclosed. It was significantly more than had been agreed with them by Finance. The actual amount of the overspend, or the deficit, was not disclosed until the estimates process. My recollection of the most recent estimates, a couple of weeks ago, is that we had the department of immigration disclosing, in the context of an estimates hearing, a $50 million or $60 million overspend, significantly more than what had been agreed with Finance. So we have unders and overs, and the government really needs to get its house in order and be clearer and more transparent about what has occurred in relation to appropriated expenditure.
I agree with the recommendation of the committee that there should be some mechanism whereby underspent appropriations are reported to the parliament with the reasons for the underspends. It might be politically embarrassing for the government, but one would have thought, given that the appropriation bills go through both this and the other chamber, that if government departments are not spending the amount that they have requested from the parliament they ought, in the interests of accountability, in fact disclose that and the reasons why. There may be reasons which are reasonable and there may not be reasons which are reasonable—and that would be a matter for political debate—but surely accountability requires that they in fact report those.
We have spoken a number of times in this place over the last couple of days—and I note my colleagues Senator Conroy, yesterday, and Senator Sherry did talk about this—about the general decline in the financial accountability standards of the Howard government, particularly over the last two or three years. There have been some reasonably high-profile examples of that. Perhaps the most notorious in recent times was the $10 billion water package, which we have spoken about on a number of occasions. Putting the media aspects aside, there is a more serious issue here. I would suggest to the chamber, and it is entirely consistent with the Auditor-General’s reports in relation to the outputs framework and the other reporting mechanisms which have been described, that, arguably, budget papers are now less transparent and less understandable for users than they have been previously.

Senator Murray interjecting—

—Senator Murray suggests that was intended, I think.
—No, ‘and than was intended’.
—That may well be the case. Certainly the rhetoric when this reporting framework was introduced was that it was supposedly going to make things much more understandable and much more accountable—and the fact is it has not. I think senators understand that because we do the estimates process. One would have thought it would not be a particularly difficult ask to get program level amounts, to understand what is allocated within a line item of an output to particular programs, but the reality is many departments refuse to provide that information and the information is aggregated at such a high level it is actually very difficult at times to get clear advice about how much the government is spending under particular programs. The government may want to hide that. It may want to have outputs aggregated at very high levels so it can hide a whole range of its programs and not tell us what is being underspent, what is being overspent and what it is actually doing or not doing. But it is not particularly accountable to announce packages and then not be clear with the parliament and the Australian people, through your financial reporting framework, as to precisely what is being spent and where.
There have been a number of reports by the Auditor-General which have pointed this out. I suggest that this committee report also points this out. We also have independent commentators such as Dr Fels and Mr Brenchley, who recently observed in the Australian Financial Review that the government’s financial discipline and management is in decay and its approach to the financial framework appears to be alarmingly weak. This is an issue of accountability. This is about ensuring that you do with the money what you say you will do. It is about ensuring the parliament is clear about what moneys are being appropriated for. But it is also about performance. We can talk about accountability, which is an extremely important principle, but it is also about performance, because the logic behind a financial reporting framework is to enable users of it, including the public, members of parliament and senators, to be able to make some sort of judgement on the information presented as to whether the purpose for which the money has been appropriated has been achieved and whether there has been performance. If the government were confident about their ability to justify their performance then clearly they would be far more open about disclosing the state of government finances. The government should listen to this report, just as they should take on board the Auditor-General’s report. I look forward to their response on this issue, but I have a feeling it will be a very long time coming. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2007-03-01,"—As I was saying yesterday in the debate on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006, recruitment difficulties were most prominent in the construction and manufacturing industries, with the lack of necessary training and skills being the main reason why applicants were unsuitable and the positions remained unfilled. What a debacle! Burnie is a city that is trying to move forward, with employers desperate for workers to fill positions, yet it still experiences a higher unemployment rate than that for the rest of the state because applicants lack the skills and necessary training to fill the positions. The Australian technical college campus located in the city is unlikely to make any difference to the current situation in the short term, with fewer than 100 enrolments for the current year. The technical college program has so far failed to combat the severe skills shortage in north-west Tasmania, a situation that is not likely to improve in the near future.
The government’s decision to opt for this short-term, bandaid solution to the problem is not only failing to overcome the skills shortage; it is preventing regional cities such as Burnie from finding their feet and making the most of their increased investment opportunities. This situation is not confined to Burnie. It is one relative to the whole state, with the Tasmanian Survey of Business Expectations for the March quarter 2007 noting:
... the availability of suitable qualified employees continues to be the number one constraint on business.
This crisis is unlikely to be alleviated in the near future and is the direct result of the Howard government’s 10 years of neglect of training and vocational education in this country. This neglect has resulted in situations like that in Burnie, where employers are desperate for workers and people are desperate for work but employers are unable to fill the positions available because of a lack of training and education.
It all appears to be a case of too little far too late for the government. The government were happy in 1996 to cut $240 million from the education budget, which has resulted in over 325,000 people being turned away from TAFE since 1996. Now, because of the government’s unwillingness to invest in vocational education and training, the Australian Industry Group has estimated that we will require 270,000 more trained people to fill the current skills shortage. The immediate solution to such a skills shortage is not going to be found in the Australian technical colleges program, with enrolments not even coming close to reflecting the demand for skilled labour. Three years on, we are in a federal election year and the government are yet to fulfil their 2004 election promise of 25 Australian technical colleges. Only five are so far up and running. The establishment of these colleges appears to be a rushed, token attempt by the government to fulfil their 2004 election promise rather than a measure aimed at genuinely combating the severe skills shortage in this country.
The government, by establishing this program, has failed to use the state based TAFE programs and has done nothing more than complicate the skills shortage issue and stretch valuable resources across two fronts instead of pulling them together and tackling the issue head-on. The duplication of secondary vocational training has not resulted in an effective solution to the skills shortage; it has resulted in a costly, ineffective program that works against, rather than with, the existing state structures. What does this tell us about the technical college program? It tells us that, in every element, it was motivated by the political ambitions of the current government rather than by the practical needs of the Australian workplace. The program was created independently of existing state structures so as to sidestep the involvement of the states. The colleges were established in marginal federal electorates such as Bass and Braddon in Tasmania as a token gesture to lure votes rather than to genuinely combat the severe skills shortage—not the best public policy solution and not good planning.
—That’s not right.
—It is exactly right. This government only acknowledged the skills shortage because of political pressure. Labor, through the shadow minister, Mr Smith, has stated:
… the only effective approach to take to enhancing vocational education and training is by the Commonwealth taking a leadership role and acting in cooperation with the states and territories and with industry. That is the most effective way of ensuring that we cater for our long-term skills needs and requirements.
…         …         …
The best way of ensuring that we meet our skills and training needs into the future is by the Commonwealth working cooperatively, through the government of the day, with the states and territories and working cooperatively with industry. This is the best way of ensuring that the Commonwealth’s priorities, the Commonwealth’s needs—those areas which the Commonwealth regards as priorities—are the focus of our vocational and educational skills and training.
That is the complete opposite of what this mob has been doing, and that is why we have a skills shortage. The government has essentially embarked on duplicating the existing vocational education and training infrastructure and setting up an expensive stand-alone system. We have a shortage of skilled and trained workers for two reasons: firstly, because the government has actually cut public spending on vocational education and training; and, secondly, because of this government’s neglect over 10 long years.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-03-01,"—I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 demonstrates the continued success of the Australian technical colleges program and reflects the progress that has been achieved to date in implementing the initiative. Twenty Australian technical colleges are currently operating, with one more to open in the next few months in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Some 2,000 students across Australia are attending the colleges this year. Four more colleges will commence in 2008. Once the colleges are fully operational, some 7,500 students will be trained by them each year.
Given that the legislation appropriating funds for this initiative only became available in late October 2005, this is a fantastic achievement by the government, with the initiative implemented well ahead of schedule. It normally takes an average of about three years to establish a new school. This government has established 20 Australian technical colleges in less than 18 months. Credit must be given to the local communities that have embraced the Australian technical college concept and ensured their swift implementation. Business and industry have shown great support for the colleges and are taking a leading role in the management of the colleges to ensure that they reflect local industry needs.
In a number of cases, existing education and training providers, including TAFEs, are working closely with the colleges. Those opposite appear not to realise this. To suggest that the Australian technical colleges are competing with or duplicating TAFEs is simply wrong. How many TAFEs are providing year 11 and 12 students with a senior secondary certificate and a year or more of full trade apprenticeship? None. The additional funding provided under this bill will ensure that the colleges are resourced to provide the highest levels of support to both students and the employers who engage students as school based apprentices.
A number of Australian technical colleges are operating sooner than anticipated. Several will now operate from multiple campuses to better service their region, and students at all colleges will be trained using the latest machinery and equipment. The impact of the Australian technical colleges initiative goes beyond just the direct benefits that the thousands of enrolled students and their employers will receive. Australian technical colleges will spearhead a change in culture whereby trade qualifications will become a highly valued alternative to a university degree. The colleges will develop a reputation that will show students and parents that vocational education and training provide access to careers that are secure, lucrative and rewarding.
The leadership shown by the Australian government through the initiative has resulted in all state and territory governments removing barriers to students undertaking full trade apprenticeships while still at school. In fact, it is encouraging to see that some states are now endeavouring to follow the Australian government’s lead and have announced their own initiatives to improve trade training in schools. We hope that these initiatives will be properly resourced and implemented.
The Australian technical colleges initiative is just one of a range of vocational and technical education initiatives that the Australian government is delivering during 2006-09. In fact, this government’s investment over that period will total more than $11.3 billion, the biggest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia’s history. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Carr’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-03-01,"—I will speak briefly to what seems both a non-controversial and technical bill. I am glad that we have a minister in the chamber who is from Western Australia because that is the part of this country that this legislation particularly affects. The purpose of the Family Law (Divorce Fees Validation) Bill 2007 is to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to validate retrospectively fee increases for divorce proceedings in the Family Court of Western Australia. Just for your information, in 1976 Western Australia established the only state family court in Australia, the Family Court of Western Australia.
Since July 2005 we have seen the filing fee for divorce applications under the Family Law Act increase from $288 to $405. However—and this is the crux of the legislation—due to an oversight this increase was not legally enforced in Western Australia. The Family Court of Western Australia thought that the increase had been approved, that the necessary amendment to the Family Law Regulations had been enforced, and so understandably they began to charge the increased amount for the filing fee but without legal authority. The proposed bill therefore aims to validate—and, again, I emphasise retrospectively—the charging fees that were in fact charged for divorce applications in the Family Court of Western Australia for the period 1 July 2005 to 9 October 2006.
I have tried to discuss this bill with people in the chamber because it seems a pretty quirky, albeit little, bill to me. I do not think this is such a small issue. Firstly, when we are talking about the increase, we are not talking incredibly small bickies. Secondly, we are talking about retrospectivity, which at the best of times gets some of us a little hot under the collar. Thirdly, if the banks had stuffed up in this way or an individual taxpayer had made a mistake, of course the government would be very keen to get back the money owing.
I understand the numbers in this place; I know that this bill will go through. And I understand why it has to be corrected—of course it has to be corrected—but does it need to be done retrospectively? I leave that question with the chamber. I put it to the minister: would it be such a bad thing if those Australians who have paid the additional amount were reimbursed? It is the same amount that their counterparts in other states would pay if they were filing for divorce, yes, but they have paid that amount without it being legally enforced. I actually think that those people in Western Australia who have in that time frame applied for or filed for divorce and paid the increased amount are owed some money.
I do not think that is going to happen today; I can see the legislation is going to go through. But, again, I make the point that if Australian taxpayers or the government had been short-changed by a taxpayer we would get that money back. We would not let it ride and, presumably, we would not pass retrospective legislation to let them get away with it. If the banks had done it, people would be demanding either the difference or some form of compensation. I think there are possibly some people who have filed for divorce in WA who might like a little reimbursement.
It is a technical point. It may seem small to some people; it may not seem a lot of money to some people. But when governments, administrators, bureaucrats or courts stuff up then maybe we should pay the price for that error instead of walking into this place and retrospectively changing something so that it suits our purposes, not necessarily those of the taxpayers.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-03-01,"—The Australian Democrats support the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 [2007]. It implements the new requirements of the amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, agreed in July 2005. It regulates, with respect to nuclear safeguards, the decommissioning of a nuclear facility to ensure Australia is able to meet its international obligations to the IAEA under the additional protocol, and it makes penalties for the most serious offences consistent with penalties under comparable Commonwealth non-proliferation legislation and provides a significant deterrent to the commission of such offences.
I want to talk briefly about what it does not do. It does not salvage the nuclear non-proliferation treaty negotiations, which failed in New York more than a year ago, particularly on disarmament. It is not likely to stop uranium sales to India, currently prohibited by the NPT. It is not likely to deliver a nuclear-free zone in the Southern Hemisphere, nor is it likely to stop the government going down the nuclear power plant path.
I will be moving some amendments on that latter point. We think this would make this bill worth debating, were it supported by the ALP, and I understand that is unlikely. The amendments are twofold in nature. Before a nuclear facility could be established anywhere in the country, consultation would need to take place between the Commonwealth and state and local governments. A plebiscite would follow if there were majority support and consent for a nuclear facility by those agencies. We define the facilities that would require this action to be: a mill for the production of uranium, lithium or concentrates; a facility for conversion or enrichment of any nuclear material; a facility for the fabrication of fuels for use in nuclear reactors; a nuclear reactor or a nuclear power reactor; a facility for reprocessing spent fuel; or a facility for the storage or disposal of any nuclear material, including any nuclear waste material.
We live in uncertain times when it comes to nuclear power. We have, as has been demonstrated in the chamber today, a lack of understanding on the part of the government as to what is and what is not prohibited in this country by Commonwealth and state laws with regard to nuclear power. We have a government keen to encourage it. The Prime Minister has on numerous occasions said that nuclear power is the answer, and in the last few days we have had the disclosure that the objective of the Prime Minister may have been discussed with mining giants and others with close connections to the Liberal Party before the Prime Minister announced that this was the way forward. So it is a very topical issue.
I expect that the Labor Party will say that this is all covered by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which makes a nuclear facility illegal, and that to put in another process would undermine that legislation in some way. But we would argue that, having a government which so freely ignores its own laws and can—because it has the numbers in this place—freely pass changes to those laws, it is worth having a discussion at this point in time about what ought to be in place before we make such a decision. The government is strong on choice and supposedly strong on democracy. It would be interesting to ask the people of Australia, in a plebiscite, to help us make a decision on such a matter. It should not be up to Mr Ron Walker, Sir Arvi Parbo and others who see the future in nuclear energy as opposed to other—cleaner and safer—forms of energy in this country.
This bill does in fact talk about safeguarding nuclear facilities, including the decommissioning of those nuclear facilities, so it is relevant to what the Democrats are hoping the Senate will agree to by way of process before such decisions are made. It is my guess, based on polling that has been done so far, that you would not get majority support for nuclear facilities. It might just be useful to put this to the test, even without a proposal to go ahead with a nuclear power station, so that we could, for once and for all, drop this idea instead of going through the agonising business of costing something we know to be terribly expensive and proceeding down this path when we need to take action now, not in 10, 15 or 20 years time, and look at what is going on in the rest of the world. Perhaps a few reactors are being established in Asia, but if you look to Europe there are no major proposals for building new power stations in the UK, or even in the United States. The decommissioning of those reactors is, in fact, the biggest problem that those countries have—when to start doing it, how to do it and who will pay the cost of it, which is very substantial. I will move those amendments when we proceed to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2007-03-01,"—I rise today to make some comments on the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 [2007]. I begin by saying that there seems to be an incredible amount of hypocrisy in both government and opposition ranks in relation to nuclear. First of all, we have a government introducing this bill to strengthen Australia’s efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons and to support international measures ensuring the physical security of nuclear material and facilities, and that is an excellent aim. However, at the very same time that it says it wants to support non-proliferation, we know that the government is not going to use the power it has in the Nuclear Suppliers Group to block the US-India nuclear technology deal.
The non-proliferation treaty has already been weakened and undermined by the activities of various governments around the world. The United States has now actively undermined that treaty by having signed a nuclear deal with India, which is not a signatory to the NPT. There is no way you can justify that deal; it is outside the non-proliferation treaty, and Australia says it upholds that treaty. The Nuclear Suppliers Group makes all its decisions by consensus and one country can block. Why did Australia refuse to block that deal? The only assumption I can make is that Australia fully intends to get on the coat-tails of President Bush and his push into India by agreeing to sell uranium to India. That will be stage 2 of the process. Australia might say something, although that is highly unlikely since there have been news reports already that the US is relying on Australia’s support at the Nuclear Suppliers Group meeting to support the deal and the only opposition it expects will be from the Scandinavian countries.
Let us put on the record first of all that we have a government saying that it wants to strengthen Australia’s efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons but which is prepared to support the United States in doing precisely that. The government is prepared to stand by and do nothing; in fact, it rubs its little hands together waiting for profits to roll in from expanded uranium mining at Olympic Dam.
The same can be said for the Labor opposition. It says it supports the non-proliferation treaty yet it has made very clear that, while it would oppose the India-US technology deal, it would not block that deal. So ‘opposing’ is just taking a principled stand while not using the power to block that deal. Ultimately we will see whether in fact both parties in Australia will support expanded uranium exports going not only to China but also to India.
The second thing I noticed is that the bill amends the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to extend the geographical jurisdiction for offences related to proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons by an Australian citizen or resident anywhere. I wonder whether the government can see that in fact that might end up referring to it or its own members, because you cannot build a nuclear power station without running the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation down the track. You cannot go to enrichment without giving a very strong signal to all the countries around you that you are nuclear-ready—that you are able, at any time, to say you will withdraw your facilities from IAEA inspection and become a nuclear weapons state. Would Australia ever do that? There would be people who would say, ‘No, never,’ but we have a history, as we have found after years of it being hidden, that Australia in fact was exploring the nuclear weapons path some years ago.
I am rather concerned that at one level Australia is saying, ‘We do not support the proliferation of nuclear weapons,’ and at another level Australia is moving to expand uranium mining, the construction of nuclear power facilities and the development of a nuclear waste dump. The government have already changed the law to say that ANSTO can manage all these waste dumps and that ANSTO has control of the material. Secondly, they have changed the law to say that they can override objections from the Northern Territory and, as a result of other test cases, no doubt other states, forcing them to have waste facilities. Thirdly, they have changed the law to say that they can now nominate a site for a nuclear waste dump without having to take into consideration the views of traditional owners about the nomination of the site, and they have now changed the law to say that, having nominated a site, they can approve the site by taking away procedural fairness, saying: ‘We don’t believe Indigenous people should have procedural fairness. We legislate to say we won’t give them procedural fairness in terms of these waste dump sites.’
Australia is now saying that we want to go the whole hog here. The Prime Minister is talking to the US about getting Australia involved in George Bush’s global nuclear energy partnership. President Bush has said he wants a group of nuclear suppliers around the world which will lease enriched uranium and fuel rods and then take back the high-level waste not only from where it came but from elsewhere. This, of course, would facilitate President Bush, who is having an awful lot of trouble getting up a waste facility in the US because Yucca Mountain is turning into a disaster for him and his presidency, and there is nothing he would like more. What a surprise that, coincidentally, we have Mr Hugh Morgan this week backing a nuclear power station when last year he said on the record that the best use of land in outback South Australia would be for a global nuclear waste dump. He also said it would improve Australia’s international standing to building a high-level nuclear waste dump to take the world’s nuclear waste.
I am concerned about the number of backroom discussions occurring around this country. The Prime Minister is also talking to Mr Ron Walker, Mr Hugh Morgan and Mr Robert de Crespigny about their plans for a nuclear power station. Then we read in the paper today that Mr John White—who was on the government’s Uranium Industry Framework—has also set up his own company. To me that sort of thing smacks of insider trading: somebody already involved in a global push for leasing of nuclear fuel and building waste dumps has been appointed to a government appointed committee, the Uranium Industry Framework, which has insight into what the government is doing. At the same time he is setting up a company with a view—in his case, I am not sure whether it is for a reactor or a waste dump—to establishing facilities associated with expanding Australia’s role in the nuclear fuel cycle. Mr John White has been a long-time supporter of building waste dumps in Australia and of enrichment and taking back high-level waste. I find it somewhat amazing that on the one hand the government is bringing forward the Non-Proliferation Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 [2007] and on the other hand it is removing safeguards left, right and centre—and the rights of Australian people left, right and centre to have any kind of input in the discussion about nuclear facilities in Australia.
We know that Mr Ziggy Switkowski’s report says that we could have up to 25 reactors by 2050. We know that reactors use huge amounts of water. We know that to maximise their effectiveness they have to be within 100 kilometres of major built-up areas—that means coastal Australia, close to large cities. Then we come to decommissioning. Who will be paying the full cost? I notice that this bill talks about permits for decommissioning. Interestingly, there is never any reference to who pays for decommissioning. Businessmen of the kind we have just spoken about would never talk of nuclear power being a cheaper option if they had to pay the full costs of decommissioning a plant. The decommissioning of Lucas Heights is estimated to be around $50 million.
Who will have to take on not only the full cost of decommissioning but also the full cost of insuring the plant? It would be interesting to know whether the government had already given these men an indication that it would underwrite the plant against any damages claims. Undoubtedly they would get private insurance, but that private insurance will be given in part on the basis that government underwrite it. So I would be very interested to know whether the Prime Minister in his encouragement of his associates to go down the track of a nuclear reactor has also given them an undertaking that the government would underwrite it and that the full cost of decommissioning would be passed on to somebody else, not to them. If those costs were incorporated you would never, ever have anyone in the private sector considering nuclear. Everywhere that it exists in the world it is backed by governments because it is not economical. Look at the situation at the moment of the Dounreay plant, which is being decommissioned. Multiple millions of British pounds are going into considerations about what to do about decommissioning in the future.
I note that, to reassure Australians, we are going to do something about increasing the penalties for people who try to get access to and provide nuclear materials illegally, and I agree that is a good thing. I share the concerns of some of the citizens groups in Australia, such as the Medical Association for Prevention of War and Friends of the Earth, that some provisions could apply to citizens groups who are trying to protest against the construction of new nuclear facilities in Australia. The government says that is not the intent, but over the past 10 years we have seen the Howard government’s erosion of the community’s right to protest, attacks on freedom of speech for whistleblowers—and certainly no protection of whistleblowers—suppression of reports, threats to scientists’ research grants and so on. So I am concerned that this is yet another way of hindering genuine protest activity and the communication of legitimate protest information. I note that the government says it will take that into account, but I would like to hear from Senator Ian Campbell an absolute and unequivocal statement in relation to the legitimate right to protest about new nuclear facilities in Australia. It is of considerable concern to me that, increasingly, there is a culture of fear and intimidation in Australia which is permeating the public sector. Even in today’s papers I noted a number of op ed pieces pointing to just that: that democracy is in a fairly weak state in Australia because citizens are being increasingly denied their civil rights.
I think the intent of the bill is laudable, but I think it comes before this parliament at a time when we are seeing people speak in a very duplicitous way about the intentions of the government down the track in relation to nuclear matters. Whilst the government may have laudable intentions, the fact is that once you start down this path you are facilitating proliferation around the world, because the more nuclear facilities you provide the greater the risk of terrorist activity and attacks, especially if we go down the enrichment path. That has been of grave concern because of the Khan network—nobody disputes that. From his position in Pakistan he illegally distributed nuclear material around the world, and we are still suffering the consequences of the Khan network.
The hands on the doomsday clock were moved forward recently, suggesting that since the height of the Cold War we have never been closer to a nuclear incident, or even an attack. The current situation in Iran is not something to be smiled at. I am surprised that the government finds it amusing that I should mention the hands on the doomsday clock, because I do not welcome reading in the paper every day the heightened concern about Iran. I certainly do not like the talk of increased threats to Iran from the US in particular, the talking up of the hawks’ view of the world, and I would like to see a diplomatic solution. The Iranians are saying that they want to develop a civilian nuclear power plan and strategy. We are saying that we do not believe them and we do not trust them. But on the other hand we are saying that we can go down this path because the safeguards agreements make certain that there can be no illegal or secret activity. If we can be certain that there is no illegal or secret activity here, why can’t we be certain of that in Iran? My view is that you cannot be certain because when you have nuclear power generation and the movement of nuclear fuel and nuclear waste around the world you open yourself to increased risks of nuclear proliferation.
That is why we would be much better off leaving the uranium in the ground rather than driving the proliferation of weapons around the world, which ultimately we are doing when we load up the world market with more uranium. As the Chinese ambassador to Australia said a couple of years ago, China does not have enough uranium for both its weapons program and its civilian power program, and that is why it wants Australian uranium. So it does not matter whether you put it straight into the nuclear power program so that they can displace their own uranium into their weapons program or whether you put it straight into their weapons program, Australian exports of uranium into China will facilitate China’s weapons program. There is no other way of looking at it.
We are also facilitating the export of nuclear material into Taiwan. Australia is also having discussions with Russia—the last meeting was in December—about selling uranium to them. So it seems to me that, whilst we may have a non-proliferation legislation amendment bill in the house, we have a very different agenda and a much more careless approach by our actions: it is a case of saying one thing and doing another.",SENATE,<title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2007-03-01,"—At the risk of possibly incurring the wrath of the Acting Deputy President, Senator Milne asked me to make one response in relation to the right to protest. That is an incredibly important right in a democracy like ours. It is not a right that they enjoy in Iran, I might mention. It is not a right that is encouraged in Iran, which is an administration that Senator Milne seems to be sticking up for. We will defend that here. Perhaps Senator Milne could say to some of her comrades—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The minister seeks to deliberately misrepresent me. I have never said that I support the Iranian regime.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Senator Milne, that is not a point of order.
—Very quickly, could I just say that it is not a right that the citizens of Iran enjoy. It is a right that all freedom-loving people would love to see them enjoy and it is a right that we would like to see the people of Iraq enjoy.
Can I suggest that, if Senator Milne wants to do something to encourage demonstration and protest in Australia, she should talk to the protesters who protested against the meeting of the G20 finance ministers in Melbourne. They brought the great city of Melbourne into disrepute and will discourage future governments of both political persuasions from hosting major international meetings in the city of Melbourne. The disgraceful behaviour of those protesters went way beyond the bounds of peaceful political protest, which is to be encouraged in this democracy, and brought violence and physical harm to the police force of Victoria. I thought all of us would want to encourage political protest as a form of expression in this great democracy of ours, but the behaviour of those protesters in Melbourne was a disgrace. Senator Milne could do a great service for Australia’s democracy by telling her friends and comrades amongst those protesters to cease and desist from their violent actions.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NON-PROLIFERATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006 [2007]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-03-01,"—The opposition will be supporting the ACIS Administration Amendment (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 2007, which is designed to uphold the original intent of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, known as ACIS. The bill is designed to ensure that only activity that is eligible for support under the scheme actually receives support. It is a pretty basic premise of government programs that people have to meet the funding criteria, so of course Labor supports making it crystal clear in legislation. It is also important that programs are able to be administered as simply as possible and with minimum delay to business.
The bill will enable the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to continue to make payments at the end of each quarter without having to wade through an audit process for each firm each time. Unearned credit liabilities will be able to be issued once the audit has been done and it is found that a company has been claiming credits for ineligible activities. It is a straightforward proposition which Labor supports; however, it is important in the context of this bill to say a few things about the different attitudes to industry policy adopted by the government and the opposition, especially with regard to the plight of the car industry in this country at this time.
The opposition has put to the government that it is prepared to discuss with the government a bipartisan approach for the reform of ACIS. This has come about as a result of the fact that the car industry is facing a crisis in this country. The ACIS program, established as it was in 2002, has seen significant investment from the public purse in support of what is a strategically vital industry to Australia, not just in economic terms but also in social terms. This industry employs over 60,000 Australians and provides a skills base of great significance to a range of ancillary industries. It is a major exporter for Australia and of course it is very important, particularly to the south-east corner of Australia and especially to my state of South Australia.
It is important to acknowledge that 7,000 jobs in the industry have been lost since the ACIS program was established. I will go through them: General Motors Holden, 1,400 jobs; Mitsubishi, 1,397 jobs; and Ford, 850 jobs—that is, 3,647 jobs lost directly from vehicle manufacturers. I will go through the component manufacturers: Aunde Trim, 80 jobs; Calsonic, in Victoria, 195 jobs; PBR, in Victoria, 184 jobs; GUD, 60 jobs; Johnson Controls, 75 jobs; Tristar, 40 jobs; Air International, 250 jobs—and another 120 jobs, because the losses are from two different branches; Ion, in South Australia, some 600 jobs and, in New South Wales, some 800 jobs; Silcraft, in Victoria, 280 jobs; Trico, 350 jobs; Autoliv, 302 jobs; VOA Webco, 65 jobs; Dana, 79 jobs; Australian Arrow, six jobs; Pilkington, 20 jobs; Spicer Axle, 200 jobs; Kemalex, in Victoria, 85 jobs and a further 80 jobs in South Australia; TI Automotives, 70 jobs; Cooper Standard, 40 jobs; Tenneco, 156 jobs; Exacto, 60 jobs; Bridgestone, 40 jobs, Irons Engineering, 41 jobs; and Hendersons, 25 jobs. That is a further 3,488 jobs lost, bringing the total to 7,135 jobs lost.
We know that the CEOs of the major manufacturers have now met the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources on three occasions and have put their views to him about the need for significant reform of the ACIS program. We know that requests have been made in terms of future investment in ACIS and for a position to be taken on the tariff issue. Under this government, ACIS arrangements require tariff reviews to be undertaken and plans have already been made for the further phase-down of tariffs in 2010.
We had the extraordinary situation of Senator Minchin being reported in the Age on 19 February under the headline ‘Brakes may go on car tariff cuts’. The article says:
Finance Minister Nick Minchin has signalled he will fight for the car industry, if a review before a planned tariff cut in 2010 finds the sector cannot cope with a loss of protection in tough trading conditions.
We know that the government’s industry statement is finished and ready to be launched, so it is appropriate for the government to come forward and explain what it is prepared to do with regard to the future of the car industry and to address the legitimate concerns that are being expressed by tens of thousands of Australians about the future of their families with regard to this industry, particularly given its significance to our economy and to our society.
What is quite apparent is that major pressures are bearing down and moving at a much greater rate than anyone could have anticipated in recent years as a result of changes to the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the pressures that have been brought on by other factors in the industry. It is time for the government to come forward and explain its position with regard to the car industry. It is time for the minister to come forward and explain what exactly the government is prepared to do in the face of widespread representations that are being made about the need for significant reform of industry assistance.
It is also appropriate for this government to be clear as to where it stands more generally on support for aspects of industry policy. Senator Cory Bernardi recently made a speech on the government’s approach to industry policy which demonstrated just how little bipartisan support there is on these questions. I would have thought, given the serious problems facing the automotive industry in South Australia—it contributes some 2½ per cent of GDP and employs some 13,500 people—that this government would be more serious about its commitments to this industry. I would have thought that the government would be prepared to talk to the opposition about what steps could be taken to secure the future of this industry.
It is unfortunate that, from time to time, one’s illusions are shattered—shattered by a government that is quite clearly uncaring and that has no sense of its responsibilities. It was recently brought to my attention that a speech was delivered by Senator Cory Bernardi of South Australia to a Liberal Party meeting in his state. In this rather schizophrenic diatribe, Senator Bernardi claimed that a Rudd Labor government, with me as industry minister, would mean:
... no car (manufacturing) for South Australia.
He further suggested that this demise would come about as the result of policies which he claimed involved advocating for Australia’s interests internationally. He said that addressing market failures which prevent businesses from being able to operate efficiently and maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment would be to blame. It is an extraordinary proposition. Senator Bernardi thinks that the government has no role to play in maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment. Perhaps he should knock on the Prime Minister’s door next time the government claims credit for supposedly low interest rates. Perhaps he should put that view to the minister for industry, in light of the position we have now when interest rates are the second highest in the developed world, and explain this theory that he is advancing.
Senator Bernardi also thinks that the government has no role in establishing policies to address market failure. So he is advocating the abolition of all government support for tertiary education and skills training, which are critical to the automotive industry because they provide skilled workers. After all, if the government has no role in addressing market failure, why should we worry about the positive externalities arising from education and training—the fact that society benefits as well as the individual? We should not worry about the fact that young people will not be able to borrow money in an open market to fund their studies because we have outlawed indentured servitude. This is the proposition that is being advanced in the claims that are being made about the opposition’s statement.
Senator Bernardi particularly objects to comments that I made about thumping the tables in the boardrooms of foreign companies. I confess that I have been known to use colourful language from time to time.
—Really!
—It is an extraordinary proposition, but I acknowledge that it is a claim that has been made. However, it is arguably a claim that other industry ministers might have made from time to time. It might be argued that one of our better industry ministers, Senator John Button, made the claim; that is who I was quoting. I was quoting Senator Button, who said that it is one of the jobs of the industry minister to advocate for Australia’s interests in discussions with the head offices of Australia’s vehicle manufacturers, for example. If Senator Bernardi objects to this concept, perhaps the focus of his dismay should be the Howard government’s own industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, who took the very sensible step of accompanying South Australia’s Labor Deputy Premier to Tokyo last December following persistent rumours about Mitsubishi.
What Senator Bernardi fails to explain in his vitriolic outburst is exactly how he thinks his flat-earth economic policies would actually help the South Australian car industry. If he is against the government maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, addressing market failures and advocating for and in defence of Australia’s interests, why should he be in favour of retaining specific industry programs, no matter how vital the sector is?
—I am against your 1950s socialist—
—I am glad the senator has come down to the chamber. We did advise him that I was going to make a few remarks about his incredible incompetence and failure to defend his own constituents. One would have thought he would be up here defending the ACIS program.
—I am protecting them from you and your 1950s socialist—
—What he proposed in the speech he gave to the Liberal Party in South Australia is that he is opposed to this sort of support. I would have thought he would have explained that position to the Prime Minister and the minister for industry. There is no other logical conclusion to draw from his remarks to his Liberal Party colleagues in South Australia. If he thinks that the policies which are designed to protect jobs are just matters for the defence of socialists, he should try to explain that at the next election. He will have plenty of opportunity. If he thinks that the protection of manufacturing workers’ jobs is just a socialist policy, let him get up and explain that. The auto and manufacturing sectors in this country are extraordinarily important, not just to South Australia but also to Australia as a whole. This is not just a matter for socialists. It is a matter for every single Australian to be concerned about. In terms of South Australia—
—Kevin Rudd denies being a socialist!
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator Bernardi, you will have an opportunity to respond in due course. Please keep your remarks contained until then.
—What Senator Bernardi should appreciate is that the auto sector contributes 2.4 per cent to the GDP of South Australia. It contributes one per cent to Australia’s total GDP. It is not an insignificant issue. This parliament should take up these concerns and take up the protection of this industry insofar as it has such strategic importance to our economy and to our society.
However, for Senator Bernardi to denigrate, before his Liberal Party colleagues, the work of auto workers and the work of the auto industry in the manner in which he has defies any rational assessment. Automotive vehicles and components are Australia’s sixth largest export. They represent a larger export than even the exports of our agricultural sector. You would think the Liberal Party would at least know that. You would think that would be at the forefront of Senator Bernardi’s thinking, coming as he does from South Australia, a manufacturing state—but no.
The Labor Party would like to draw to everyone’s attention the fact that innovation and R&D are the keys to competitiveness for manufacturing industry. Manufacturing is one of the most innovative sectors of our economy, with the ABS finding that in 2004-05 over 43.1 per cent of businesses were innovative active compared with 34.9 per cent across all industries, and that within manufacturing the automotive industry contributes 23 per cent of R&D. Indeed, the automotive industry contributes 10 per cent of Australia’s total business R&D. Unfortunately, Australia’s performance in business R&D is nowhere near the standard of performance of our international competitors; it is nowhere near the benchmark being set by others. Business R&D in Australia is 0.89 per cent of GDP compared with the OECD average of 1.5 per cent. Among OECD countries, Australia ranks 15th in the world.
The Commonwealth refused to participate in the National Manufacturing Forum. Every state, every territory and all major industry players participated in this vehicle by which the fundamental issues facing Australian manufacturing could be discussed, but not the Commonwealth. When it comes to manufacturing, the Commonwealth essentially sits on its hands. It takes the view that it is someone else’s problem. It takes the view that, essentially, Australia can be a beach or a quarry. It has no understanding of the significance of manufacturing. Essentially, the government has turned away from its obligations in this regard.
Over the period 1986-87 to 1995-96, we have seen the average annual growth rate of real business investment in the research component of R&D plummet from 11.4 per cent to only 5.1 per cent. In manufacturing the story is particularly grim, with the average annual growth rate slipping from 10.6 per cent to only 1.9 per cent. Looking at gross R&D spending, we can see that China has committed to lifting its expenditure as a proportion of GDP from only 0.6 per cent in 1995 and 1.2 per cent in 2002 to 2.5 per cent by 2050. China is doubling its R&D spend every couple of years. Compare that with our performance and we can see that our performance is grossly inadequate.
We are in the situation where our manufacturing output has fallen by some $860 million. Our manufacturing output has shrunk by 1.1 per cent in 2004-05 and by 0.4 per cent in 2005-06. Since the last federal election, in 1996, we have seen a loss of over 110,000 manufacturing jobs. That equates to 204 manufacturing jobs disappearing each and every week of the Howard government. It is time to act and there is a requirement by this government to face up to its responsibilities. We have laid down the challenge and we now seek a response from the government.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-03-01,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration. I refer to reports of incorrect costing or the lack of costing of major government promises, including the mature age worker tax offset, which blew out by $380 million; the child care tax rebate, which was underspent by $450 million; and the Prime Minister’s water package, which was not costed at all. Can the minister explain why these billion-dollar promises either are varying in cost by hundreds of millions of dollars—some even before they begin—or are not being submitted for costing approval in the first place? Can the minister also indicate why the government has covered up the public release of updated costs for some programs—isn’t the government failing to adhere to its own Charter of Budget Honesty?—and why the finance minister is failing to ensure proper oversight of the costing and process for billions of dollars in programs?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Economic Management</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,question
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-03-01,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The question was not based on the article by Mr Megalogenis; it was actually based on the recent observations of the Audit Office and respected independent commentators, such as Allan Fels, Fred Brenchley and others, who have been openly critical of the declining fiscal discipline of this government, with Professor Fels and Mr Brenchley saying that it ‘appears alarmingly weak’. What does this say about the finance minister’s competence, given that he is failing to ensure billions of dollars of spending programs are properly costed and reported and undergo due process? Isn’t this yet another example of a decaying, tired, arrogant and lazy government?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Economic Management</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-03-01,"—It is typical of the Labor Party to complain about underfunding when they lost complete control of the budget during their period in office. The budget blew out enormously. We inherited a budget that was running at $10 billion a year in deficit, and they had racked up some $70 billion extra in debt over the last five years of their budget.
I gather Senator Sherry is referring to an article by George Megalogenis in the Australian referring to underspending in particular programs. I draw to Senator Sherry’s attention the fact that there have been no cuts whatsoever in any of these programs. The programs are fully costed and continue to be fully funded. With respect to the Australian Water Fund, the implementation of that program is heavily reliant on the states delivering well-developed proposals before funding can flow, and it would obviously be irresponsible of us to provide funding for any proposal brought forward unless we were convinced that the funding could be well spent. That is the difference between us and Labor. Mr Rudd has been running around the country and going into every premier’s office saying, ‘What would you like me to give you?’ and then rushing out and doing a doorstop saying, ‘I will give Western Australia this and I will give South Australia that.’ He would simply be a doormat for the state Labor premiers and all their promises. He would not apply the rigour that we apply to the states when they come running to us for money. We are applying rigour in relation to the Australian Water Fund to make sure that the states’ proposals can be properly funded and do meet the criteria.
The schools infrastructure program has been so successful that in the current year this program is overspending, with funding being brought forward from 2008. In light of the strong demand for the program, the government on 19 February announced an increase in funding of $181 million, bringing the total expenditure on that program to $1.181 billion by the end of 2008. So, where the states are failing again to invest in their own schools, the Commonwealth is required, as a result of our sound budget management and our capacity to produce surpluses, to fill the gap left by the states, which are so hopeless on the subject.
In relation to the 30 per cent child care tax rebate and the tax break for entrepreneurs, the child care tax rebate and that entrepreneurs tax offset are uncapped, demand driven programs which rely on taxpayers to access the programs. Families using a tax agent have until May 2007 to lodge their tax returns. For families that have already lodged a tax return without claiming that entitlement, the Australian Taxation Office is already amending their tax assessments to ensure they receive their CCTR.
The government’s record on this is admirable. We are the ones who have restored the health of the government’s finances. We are the ones who are now in a position to provide these sorts of programs, which were impossible under the maladministration of the Labor Party, but we will exercise rigour and scrutiny in the application of these funding programs. We will not just let money roll out the door. We will make sure that the bids, for example under the Australian Water Fund, properly meet the criteria and we will not simply let the money go, as Mr Rudd would to the state Labor premiers when they come knocking on his door.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Economic Management</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,answer

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-03-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today relating to a range of defence matters.
I say at the outset that there are probably not two more important matters in the role of government than the sound administration of defence policy in all aspects and the sound administration and proper use of public funds. Throughout this continuing debate as to the proper administration and management of a range of procurement projects over the last 10 years, it is fair to say, in the most generous way, that government policy, administration and practice have been at best haphazard. If we look at a range of projects that are still some two, three and four years overdate, one is being extraordinarily generous to use the word ‘haphazard’ when the appropriate description is that there has been a litany of disasters in the administration by this government of a range of procurement projects.
When one looks for the common theme that runs through the government mismanagement of defence procurement projects one sees a number of items—significant cost overruns, time blowouts and ongoing changes to contracts and contract specifications which have ongoing consequences for time and delivery. The net result has been, in a range of platform procurement items, whether in the air, on the ground or at sea, continuing delay in delivery of those platforms and those projects to the Australian Defence Force and, as a consequence, the ongoing inability of the government to match reality with desire in terms of capability.
We only have to look at a range of helicopter projects for it to be understood that, if projects are delayed by two, three or more years and are not delivered consistent with the contract terms, we do not have capability and that capability has to be supplemented at cost from other areas, which eats into the available funds for budget. This has been a direct consequence of government decision making by a range of ministers for defence over the last eight to 10 years in a range of capital acquisition projects.
One only has to look at the list of projects which are on the public record. Firstly, the AWACs, the early warning and control aircraft, are two years late and you can bet your bottom dollar that the systems integration issues there are going to be much more serious and will blow out to four or five years. After four years we still do not have one M113 personnel carrier. At the public hearing today we were advised by representatives of Defence Materiel Organisation that they are still facing at best a two-year delay with the Tiger helicopters. We know that another helicopter platform, the Seasprites, has been grounded. They are under review by government, and a general of the Army has been tasked with doing a review as to whether they are suitable going into the future or whether they need to be replaced. That review currently sits on Minister Nelson’s desk and no public decision has been made, although leaks have been strategically made to the media. We know that the Seasprites are never going to fly in this country.
Fiascos such as this litany of ships, helicopters and personnel carriers have contributed in a significant way to the inability of the government to reconcile defence accounts over the last few years and, in particular, the inability of the Secretary and Chief of the Defence Force to sign off on those same accounts at the end of each financial year. It is disgraceful that, in a department with a budget of $20 billion outlaid per annum, the senior officers are unable to sign off on the accounts because of lack of governmental and ministerial attention to their portfolio responsibilities. It is time in this whole area of defence spending— (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2007-03-01,"—I listen with interest to Senator Bishop when he questions the financial management of this government on defence acquisitions and a lot of other matters. No other government has been more transparent and open with opposition members when it comes to questioning the acquisitions and the work of the Australian defence forces, which I might add have been working now at maximum effort for over seven years. At no time in our history have our defence forces had to put such an effort into their operations over such a long period of time.
I was interested to hear Senator Bishop criticise government administration and financial management, and he talked about a ‘litany’ of disasters and cost overruns. I know he was not in this place when we last had the misfortune of having a Labor government. We now happen to have what are probably the best conventional submarines in the world, but can he not remember the cost overruns and delays that we had with the submarines that were put into place by the then defence minister in the Labor government, particularly during Senator Ray’s time? We have finished up with very good conventional submarines. When you talk about cost overruns and budget overruns and time delays, just think back to what Labor did when it was in government with the Collins class submarines, to name one example.
It is a well-known fact that the best laid plans of defence acquisition do not always materialise because they are beyond the control of any government or defence force. If you are making overseas acquisitions and relying on suppliers in another country who are providing the equipment that we in Australia are purchasing for our defence forces, then sometimes it is outside the control of either the defence force or the government to change those cost overruns or the delays in timing which we all wish did not take place. Not one of us wants to see the plans of our defence forces delayed because of cost overruns and time delays.
When Labor start criticising this government’s financial management, I think they ought to take a long hard look at themselves. Over the past 11 years, this government has put this country in a position that could have only been dreamt of when it took office in 1996. I always welcome a debate on financial management from the Labor Party because they try to run away from their past record in government and the fact that when we took over the financial management of this country there was a horrible deficit, which we no longer have. Any independent assessment would suggest that this government’s financial management has been far in excess of any of its predecessors.
We are proud of our financial management. That does not mean that in some individual areas there are not occasions where there are cost overruns. We know that can happen, but, because of the financial management of this government, we can absorb those cost overruns and still run a budget that is in surplus.
—And a strong defence force.
—We can still run a strong defence force, as my colleague Senator Ian Campbell says, which is, to use the colloquial term, punching above its weight in areas throughout the whole of the world. That is something that it has not had to do for a very long time, certainly not for the period of time that we have been expecting our defence forces to operate at such a high tempo. I am very proud. I know that senators on this side of the chamber have nothing but admiration for the way that our defence forces manage to cope with the difficulties of being in so many different places in the world. They are carrying out their activities on behalf of Australia in a variety of operations overseas at a level that makes us on this side very proud. (Time expired)

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-03-01,"—Whilst Senator Ferguson says he listens to contributions with interest, so do I. It is a very interesting contribution from those opposite when they say, ‘We have a very good conventional submarine fleet.’ Indeed, we do, but we would have to have the only very good conventional submarine fleet in the world that cannot go underwater. It cannot be allowed to submerge because this government has not got around to sorting out what is happening with the rescue vessel.
The rescue vessel sank off the coast of my home state of Western Australia and, until we work out whether we are going to replace it or go and salvage and fix it, the submarines are not going anywhere. I do not blame the Navy for making that decision. Until this government works out what it is going to do with the rescue vessel, we have a whole bunch of very good conventional submarines that cannot be submerged. It is a bit like the helicopters that this government decided to purchase—they could not fly over water or at night. This is ridiculous. They call themselves good financial managers and yet they buy a whole bunch of things we cannot use, such as helicopters that cannot fly over water or at night, they do not provide the capacity to utilise these things properly and they are more than happy to spend up to billions of dollars on these things.

Senator Ferris interjecting—

—The Seasprites! A billion dollars worth and we still do not know whether we are going to see the project through or not. And the best Defence can say is if we decide to scrap the Seasprite project then we might be able to recoup a little of the money selling off spare parts. That counts for good financial management, does it—a billion dollars for a project that you do not know you are going to see through? If that is good financial management, heaven help this country if this government continues. They are squandering money all over the place. It is a bit like the $10 billion water plan that does not have to be checked off by Finance or go to cabinet. It is $10 billion and you just do a quick run-your-eye-over, back-of-the-envelope calculation and that is good enough.
We have submarines that cannot go underwater, helicopters that cannot fly, a whole organisation that cannot keep its eye on its other assets and rocket launchers that get stolen. This is a complete financial shambles and incompetence. You do not know how to manage the system. This is completely stupid. When Senator Hutchins asked the minister for finance what was happening under the Financial Management and Accountability Act—something that you would think the minister for finance would know about, in terms of penalties—he said, ‘That’s a matter for Defence.’ That is not good enough when it comes to billions of dollars worth of taxpayers’ money. Meanwhile, the priority for Defence seems to be to go up to Papua New Guinea and try to salvage something that has been underwater since 1914, but they cannot actually deal with the priority of working out what they are going to do with the rescue vessel so we can actually use our submarine fleet. Talk about bad planning. Talk about poor financial management. It is absolutely ridiculous.
Then we come to the Minister for Defence. Isn’t he good? He has no idea where the money is going, he has no idea about the financial controls within his own department, but he has the audacity to compare what is happening in Iraq with the Australians who fought at Kokoda. You should be ashamed of yourselves. You really should. Instead of good financial management, instead of providing the infrastructure and support that our ADF personnel badly need and absolutely deserve, all we get is jingoism and misrepresentation from that minister. It is a complete outrage. He should pay attention to his duty to the taxpayers and to how the money is being spent and what is happening with the Seasprites. He should be actually making sure that we do have the capacity to use the Defence assets that we have rather than getting out there and sprouting jingoistic nonsense.
In the meantime, where is the minister when it comes to looking after the people who have been superannuated out of the ADF on the grounds of ill health? You can find a billion dollars for the Seasprites when you are not quite sure whether you are going to use them or not—and we all think that you are not going to use them but you cannot quite get around to making that decision—but you cannot consult with the people who have been superannuated out on the grounds of ill health and look after their future long-term needs. They put themselves in harm’s way on this government’s instruction and there is absolutely no intention by this government to take into account their special considerations. Do not come in here and lecture us. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-03-01,"—Today’s taking note of answers again establishes the great fact that is emanating from across the chamber, and that is that there is no-one in the federal opposition who has any real understanding of defence, and they have even less understanding of capability acquisition. Senator Bishop underlines that. He talks about AWACS. The AWACS is a light, command and control, carrier launched aircraft used by the US Navy. The project that he is referring to, which he wants to say is so important, is called AEW&C—airborne early warning and control. The project name is Air 5077. It has a value of $3.7 billion. I would have thought that a person coming in here to talk about projects would understand or have some vague knowledge of the correct identification of projects. There is nobody in the opposition, sadly, that has any real knowledge of defence or capability acquisition. Indeed, I think it was on Tuesday night that Senator Faulkner said in this place:
The government may say that the DMO annual report 2005-2006 identifies some project performance improvements. I acknowledge and believe that these can be attributed to better management inside the DMO and reflect well on the work being done by the DMO management team.
The question must be asked: better than what? Who could fail to remember the litany of cutbacks and slashings—15,000 defence personnel just taken off the books—by the Labor Party when they were last in power?
Let us just go through the good work that the minister and the Howard government have been doing in defence. We came to power and made a commitment to increase defence funding by an average of three per cent per annum over a decade, and we have done that. We gave a long-term funding commitment to a defence capability plan to give industry the certainty it needs. We did that. We established the Defence Materiel Organisation to provide a single point of accountability for defence acquisitions. May I pause to say that it is working magnificently, with almost $60 billion worth of projects on the go. We established the Kinnaird review into defence procurement.
We developed an acquisition reform plan to further improve the way government buys new defence equipment and capability, including changes to DMO to improve financial transparency and accountability. We did that. The Defence white paper Defence 2000: our future Defence Force, established a benchmark for the ongoing future development of the Australian Defence Force. Around 100 major projects worth some $17 billion have been approved from the white paper recommendations. We established the Defence Industry Advisory Council. They are things that the opposition know nothing about and never talk about because they are not interested in the subject. We carried out the Defence Reform Program, which identified savings in excess of $900 million a year to be redirected to combat capabilities such as additional Army personnel, modifications to amphibious ships and combat equipment, and ammunition.
We developed a strategic defence industry policy identifying six key strategies to shape Defence’s future relationship with industry. We established the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, which gives the opposition every opportunity to hone their skills to try and understand something of defence, but, sadly, the messages are not getting through. And since taking office we have fixed Labor’s blunders. Who could forget them? They were fantastic. There were the minehunters—an absolute shocker—$138 million worth of vessels that never even went into the water. We lost the intellectual property with the Collins class submarine—the welding was wrong—because the Labor minister at the time failed to administer the contract properly. Kockums never properly transferred the intellectual property—a classic ministerial mistake that the previous Minister for Defence, Minister Hill, fixed and repaired. These are just the tip of a very black iceberg. If Labor were ever to come to power, the defence of Australia would be in jeopardy. (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-03-01,"—Having lived for some 11 or 12 years in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, a stone’s throw from Edinburgh Air Base, I have had contact with many serving defence personnel and their families. I know how loyal, dedicated and proud those service men and women, and also their wider families, are of their service to their country. Their whole families share in that commitment to the defence forces. Over the last few years we have seen more and more demanded of those Defence Force personnel. What happens with this government? Is this backed up by the same dedication and commitment by this administration? I think we had the answer when Senator Chris Ellison was asked about the critical rescue ship for submarines. He dismissed it, saying ‘it is a work in progress’. He could not give us an update or any detailed description of what is going to happen with getting the Remora off the ocean floor.
Can you imagine the feelings of Australian defence personnel and their families if a submarine actually went down while we were still waiting for that rescue ship to get off the ocean floor? Can you imagine how it would be for those families if they were told by the government: ‘We’ve made this arrangement with these overseas forces and, once they’ve got here, it’ll be all right’? It could be days before they arrive to rescue the service personnel out of that submarine stuck on the bottom of the ocean floor because they did not get around to it—it is just ‘a work in progress’; they did not get around to fixing the rescue ship that is languishing on the floor of the ocean. That is the kind of dedication and commitment we have from this administration to our defence personnel and their families. This is the kind of inaction and lack of activity that we have seen from the government in the past decade. There has been a series of failures in accountability and procurement. This is a very sad reflection on the government. It is a sad reflection of the value that they place on our defence service personnel and their families.
—Why are you reflecting on the naval officers who are trying to get the Remora off the sea floor?
—The work in progress? The Minister representing the Minister for Defence in this chamber was not even aware of it. It was not high enough on his list of priorities.
—It’s a work in progress by the Navy, so why are you reflecting on the Navy?
—Senator Ian Campbell, stop interjecting. Senator Hurley, address your comments through the chair.
—That is the kind of government response we get to the dedication that is shown by our defence forces. The other kind of response we get was illustrated today by harking back to previous Labor governments—over 10 years ago, to the Collins class submarine. The government were able to dredge up one project to illustrate that perhaps a Labor government might not have been as good either.
Let me read what the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said about the Collins class submarine in their review of it. The review stated: ‘The Commonwealth’s $5 billion investment has not only provided Australia with a key strategic asset but also greatly boosted the skill base of our naval construction industry.’ That is precisely the point. There might have been cost overruns, although $5 billion looks pretty small now, I must say, compared with the blunders and overruns of the current government. The Labor government put this in place, built up our skills in Australia, created Australian jobs, Australian assets and Australian skills that have provided ongoing work for Australian workers. Senators stand up and try to defend cost overruns, saying: ‘We can’t control what they do in other countries. We can’t guarantee that other countries will deliver on time.’ What a pathetic response to a defence industry that is even more critical in today’s troubled times. I call on the government to put more effort into backing up the critical work that our defence personnel do in Australia.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2007-03-01,"—I present three government responses to committee reports. I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—

Government Response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade report 
Australia’s Defence Relations with the United States


The ANZUS alliance


Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that the ANZUS Alliance be maintained in its current form and that the treaty be viewed not just as a specific set of requirements, rather as a statement of shared values capable of being acted upon in the face of evolving contemporary threats.


Response


Agreed
.
 
 The ANZUS Treaty, underpinned by shared values, remains vital to Australian security.
 
 The alliance has proven to be adaptable and relevant, and has provided the foundation of our defence and security relationship since 1951.
 
 The continued utility of ANZUS was demonstrated by its invocation in the days following the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001.
 
 The capacity of Australia and the United States to respond to evolving contemporary threats is underscored by Australia’s ongoing cooperation in military operations in our immediate region and beyond.
 
 The breadth of the relationship was demonstrated when US and Australian militaries united to respond to humanitarian disasters, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and severe earthquakes in Pakistan in 2005.
 
 The high levels of trust and common purpose manifest in all of these endeavours are firmly based in the shared values which underpin the alliance.


Australian force structure, interoperability and intelligence


Recommendation 2


The Committee acknowledges that the free passage of information on the internet is likely to ensure that threat techniques faced by western forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are transmitted to disaffected groups in our region, meaning future regional conflicts may become increasingly violent and lethal. The Committee recommends that force structure decisions must therefore be based on the provision of the best possible protection for Australian Defence personnel.


Response greed.


The Australian Government agrees that Australian Defence personnel should be provided with the best possible protection, based on the principle that force protection should be optimised in accordance with operational requirements, without compromising other functions or elements of capability.
 
 This will often involve, inter alia, preparedness, doctrine, tactics and rules of engagement in addition to force structure decisions on major platforms or systems.
 
 These decisions will assess the current and future risk posed by a full range of conventional and non-conventional threats, rather than focusing solely on specific techniques used presently by threat groups in Iraq and Afghanistan.


Recommendation 3


The Committee supports the continuing enhancement of cooperation between Australian and US intelligence agencies; however, sufficient investment must be made in Australian analytical capabilities to ensure Australian analysis of US raw intelligence material is always undertaken.


Response


Agreed
. The Australian Government supports the Committee recommendation. The Intelligence and Security Group in Defence, and its component agencies, continue to develop strong relationships with their US counterpart agencies and with the wider intelligence community. The Australian Government applies analytical resources to meet Australian intelligence priorities and conduct independent analysis of US intelligence material in accordance with those priorities.


Combined defence exercises


Recommendation 4


The Committee supports the continuation of joint training between the Australian and US Defence Forces and recommends that the Joint Combined Training Centre (JCTC) concept be codified in a Memorandum of Understanding before Exercise Talisman Sabre 2007.


Response


Agreed
. A Memorandum of Understanding on the Joint Combined Training Centre was signed by US Secretary of Defense and Australian Minister for Defence on 18 November 2005.


Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that the Australian Defence Force continues to apply the most appropriate rules of engagement consistent with the Australian assessment of application of force.


Response


Agreed
. The Australian Defence Force continues to apply the most appropriate rules of engagement consistent with the Australian assessment of application of force.


Australian defence industry development


Recommendation 6


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government make every effort to obtain exemption from ITAR from the United States Government in respect of defence goods and services purchased from the United States for Australian Defence Force purposes.


Response:


Not Agreed. The Australian ITAR exemption agreement has been stalled in the US Congress since early 2003.
 
 As an alternative to the ITAR exemption, The Australian Government is working with the US Administration to develop more extensive capability arrangements that might better deliver the interoperability outcomes both nations want.


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND EXTERNAL TERRITORIES


Antarctica:
 
 Australia’s Pristine Frontier


A report on the adequacy of funding for Australia’s Antarctic Program by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories


THE HON MALCOLM TURNBULL MP


MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT


AND WATER RESOURCES


Foreword


The Howard Government remains strongly committed to Australia’s Antarctic programme. It recognises the significance to Australia of the Antarctic Treaty system and the importance of our contribution to it. The Government values Australia’s leadership in Antarctic science and in Antarctic environmental protection initiatives.


Consistent with this commitment, the Government welcomed the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories into the adequacy of funding for the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources.


The Government notes that the Joint Standing Committee reviewed the Department’s annual reports, obtained briefings from the Australian Antarctic Division and conducted public hearings between March and June 2004.
  


The Government thanks the Joint Standing Committee for its report Antarctica:
 
 Australia’s Pristine Frontier:
 
 Report on the adequacy of funding for Australia’s Antarctic Program. The Government appreciates the considerable efforts of the Committee members and all others who assisted in development of the report’s recommendations.
 


The Government recognises the heavy resources demands placed on the Australian Antarctic Division’s logistical, research and environmental activities because of the remoteness of those activities and the difficult climate. In addition, there are increasing costs associated with compliance with environmental standards and with occupational health and safety management in an inherently hostile and sensitive environment.
 


The Government remains committed to an effective and collaborative Antarctic Science programme, and encourages thorough examination of opportunities for international cooperation in Antarctic research and logistic support. Consistent with this commitment, in May 2005 the Government made a four-year $46.3 million funding boost to make possible an inter-continental Airlink between Hobart and Casey Station. This is the largest single increase in spending for the Antarctic programme for over two decades.
 


Direct access to Antarctica by a fast and safe Airlink is no longer a dream.
 
 This initiative will significantly modernise the Australian Antarctic Division’s capacity to support activities in Antarctica. In addition, it will give Australia an Antarctic presence consistent with our national interest and with the Government’s long term commitment to our continuing leadership in the region.


The Government is confident that the provision of these additional resources will enable the Australian Antarctic Division to:

ensure that Australia continues to play an active and leading role in Antarctic science research;
build on its collaborative partnerships with other Antarctic nations, and to significantly enhance the public profile of Australia’s Antarctic science programme; and.
fulfil its legislative environmental and cultural heritage obligations.

The Government’s response to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories (JSCNCET) Report Recommendations


Operations and logistical support


Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government makes funding available in the 2005-06 financial year to enable a scoping study to be conducted to determine the need for a new dedicated marine research vessel to advance marine science in general and, the Australian Government’s goals for Australia’s Antarctic programme.


Support in principle


The Government accepts the importance of undertaking marine research in the Southern Ocean in support of the Australian Government’s goals for Antarctica. It also understands the less-than-ideal situation inherent in the multi-purpose nature of Australia’s existing Antarctic research voyages.


The Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources will be commencing a new tender process for the provision of shipping services for the 2007/08 financial year. As part of the budget process tied to this tender the Australian Antarctic Division will review its operational requirements in light of the impending introduction of the intercontinental airlink between Hobart and Casey Station and the impact that this will have on the type of shipping service required to meet the needs of the Australian Antarctic programme. The Government recognises the importance of maintaining a viable and world class capability to undertake marine science in the Southern Ocean and this will be addressed as part of this process.


The Australian Antarctic Division is currently fully committed to the implementation of the Antarctic Airlink. This project will provide a flexible transportation system and dramatically change the way that Australia supports its Antarctic programme. The introduction of intercontinental air transport will also allow for a change in the way that shipping is used.
 


The Government agrees with the Joint Standing Committee that the Australian Antarctic Division must continue to seek partnerships which will enhance the marine research component of the science programme and that the Australian Antarctic Division should continue to utilise its current shipping arrangements to cater for logistical and marine science needs.


Australia’s obligations under the Antarctic Treaty System


Recommendation 2


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government makes an appreciable investment commensurate with Australia’s significant involvement in polar activities to support Australian programs planned for the International Polar Year 2007-2008 and ensures that Australia plays a leading role in International Polar Year activities. In addition, the Committee notes the need for additional funds to be made available immediately for this purpose.


Support in principle


As leader of the Australian Antarctic programme, the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources is already making a significant contribution to International Polar Year activities within its current science programme.


The Government agrees that the International Polar Year 2007-08 represents a significant opportunity to build on Australia’s extensive collaborative partnerships with other Antarctic nations, to enhance the public profile of Australia’s Antarctic science programme and to realise the benefits of access to both shared logistics and to major new collaborative data sources.


Australian scientists are closely involved in the development and implementation of the International Polar Year, and in coordinating key projects. This includes taking lead roles in the Census of Antarctic Marine Life, an oceanographic study investigating the climate of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, and a geophysical and glaciological survey of the extensive Gamburtsev sub-glacial mountains in the Australian Antarctic Territory.


The Australian Antarctic Division is active in sourcing funding support for International Polar Year projects from external agencies. As an example, in mid-2005 the United States based Sloan Foundation agreed to provide funding support for the Census of Antarctic Marine Life.


The Australian Antarctic Division has received many research project proposals as part of the Australian Antarctic Science Grants scheme for International Polar Year related activities. These will all be assessed for funding suitability and support as part of the 2006/07 appraisal process.


The Government’s commitment to fund the Australian Antarctic Airlink will also provide Australian scientists with better access to Antarctica during the International Polar Year.
 
 The Australian Antarctic Division is also considering ways to reschedule logistic support for Antarctic science so that activities are maximised during the International Polar Year period.


Conservation and protection of the Antarctic environment


Recommendation 3


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government allocate an additional $50 million to the budget of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources over a ten-year period, to be administered under Australia’s Antarctic Program, specifically for the remediation of past work sites in the Australian Antarctic Territory.


Support in principle


The Government is firmly committed to meeting Australia’s obligations under the Madrid Protocol. The Government also clearly understands that site remediation in Antarctica is difficult due to the harsh climatic conditions and remoteness. These factors make clean-up activities extremely costly and difficult to complete in the short term.


The total cost for the remediation of past activities in Antarctica has not yet been fully determined and any budget implications can only be considered when all requirements are known. In the meantime, scientific research will continue to be undertaken as part of Australia’s Antarctic science program to develop strategies and techniques to safely clean-up the sites of past activities without damaging the fragile environment of Antarctica. This will also assist in providing an indication of the success of past remediation efforts.


Cultural heritage management:
 
 Mawson’s Huts


Recommendation 4


The Committee recommends that additional funding be provided to enable the Australian Antarctic Division to comply with its responsibilities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) for its work with the cultural heritage management of Mawson’s Huts. The Committee also encourages the continuation of partnership links with community sponsors to continue the restoration work of Mawson’s Huts.


 
Support in principle


The Government recognises the heritage significance of Mawson’s Huts, Australia’s most important cultural heritage site in Antarctica, and the importance of conserving the site. The Government applauds the efforts already undertaken by various community groups supported by the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources to protect this valuable part of Australia’s heritage.


The Australian Antarctic Division, in collaboration with a number of community groups, has been actively involved in the conservation of the Mawson’s Huts site since 1997, and continues to provide support to bodies interested in conserving the site. This includes providing logistic support, expert advice and in-kind support (such as the loan of equipment) and facilitating access to the site so that conservation work can be undertaken. The Australian Antarctic Division continues to investigate ways to enable future joint public/private initiatives to play active roles in preserving historic Antarctic sites.
 
 The Australian Antarctic Division is also working with other divisions within the Department of the Environment and Water Resources on the development of a comprehensive Antarctic and subantarctic heritage plan.


The Australian Antarctic Division will continue to support conservation of Antarctic heritage sites, taking into account the urgency of action, professional assessment of conservation actions and the relative priority accorded to other environmental and research commitments.
 
 The Australian Antarctic Division will also pursue options of public and private partnerships to assist in this work.


 
Australia’s Antarctic science program


Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that the current appropriation for the Australian Antarctic Science grants scheme administered by the Australian Antarctic Division be doubled from the current level of approximately $700,000 per annum for the remainder of the Science Strategy 2004/05-2008/09 and be reassessed after that period.


 
Disagree


The Government is committed to an effective and collaborative Australian Antarctic Science programme.


The total value of the grants received by research agencies under the Australian Antarctic Grants Scheme comprises the cash provided to the research agency supplemented by the logistical, field, station or shipboard support provided by the Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources. The in-kind support provided by the Australian Antarctic Division is in the order of $250,000 to $400,000 per project depending on the individual requirements of each research project.


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT BY THE PARLIAMENTARY JOINT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE TITLE AND THE ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LAND ACCOUNT ON THE OPERATION OF NATIVE TITLE REPRESENTATIVE BODIES (MARCH 2006).


Recommendation 1


The Committee recommends that the OIPC develop comparative data, based on a range of key performance indicators, to assess the relative effectiveness of NTRBs in meeting their statutory obligations and that this data be published annually.

Response 
Accepted, with publication options to be considered at a later date.  The Government acknowledges the importance of assessing the relative effectiveness of NTRBs in meeting their statutory obligations and is working on developing and improving a range of comparative assessment data.  There are, however, significant complexities associated with establishing key performance indicators on which to base relevant data.  NTRBs’ operating environments differ widely, for example, with respect to: the extent to which native title may have been extinguished or connection maintained in the NTRB’s area; levels of future act activity within the NTRB’s area; the degree of intra-indigenous disputation within the NTRB’s area; and the policies of State and Territory governments towards resolving native title matters.  Comparative assessments based solely on uniform key performance indicators - such as claims or future act matters finalised - would therefore be of limited assistance in determining an NTRB’s relative effectiveness. 
As part of the existing funding and reporting framework, OIPC has therefore concentrated on developing mechanisms for comparing NTRBs’ success in completing activities nominated in their operational plans.  To make these comparisons more meaningful, OIPC will encourage NTRBs to adopt more uniform activity descriptors where appropriate, while remaining sensitive to the need for NTRBs to plan their workloads in response to local circumstances.  This process will be assisted by performance enhancement activities which target common NTRB needs and will lead to more uniform ways of working.  These activities are discussed in more detail in the response to Recommendation 8. The Government will also consider other ways in which more objective comparisons between NTRBs might be facilitated.
Given the complexities outlined above, the Government would be hesitant to publish annual comparative data on the relative effectiveness of NTRBs at this stage. It will however give further consideration to this possibility as funding and reporting frameworks are refined. 

Recommendation 2


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth establish an independent advisory panel to advise the Minister on the re-recognition of NTRBs once their recognition period has expired.

Response
Not accepted.  The Minister is not presently required to consider independent advice in making decisions about NTRB recognition.  Under the proposed reforms, the Minister would make decisions about recognition more frequently than at present but would not be required to consider additional criteria in doing so.  The introduction of re-recognition requirements would not affect the substance of the advice on the relevant criteria provided to the Minister by OIPC.  As at present, the Minister will be required to consider whether an NTRB has satisfactorily performed and would be capable of satisfactorily performing NTRB functions.  OIPC holds substantial amounts of information relevant to these criteria and its staff have practical experience in gauging whether they have been met.
NTRBs would be able to make submissions to the Minister on re-recognition decisions.  Further, as is presently the case for recognition decisions, NTRBs could seek review of a decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.  The proposed reforms will therefore retain existing procedural safeguards for NTRBs.  At the same time, the re-recognition process will bring more accountability to the native title system as a whole compared with current indefinite recognition arrangements.
The current reforms are also designed to improve efficiency in the native title system and the Committee’s recommendation is not compatible with this objective.

Recommendation 3


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth provide further details of the proposed transitional arrangements that will apply when the recognition period for NTRBs expires in order to avoid uncertainty for claimants.

Response
Accepted.  When the Bill is introduced, updated and more detailed information will be posted on the OIPC website (www.oipc.gov.au).  It is planned that all existing NTRBs will be re-recognised on 1 July 2007.  Therefore the earliest these transitional arrangements would be needed is 2008 (and it may actually be some years after that) and there would be ample time to inform claimants about the new system.  In relation to re-recognition processes after the initial transition period, it is envisaged that where an NTRB’s recognition is not to be renewed, a replacement will have been identified and transfer arrangements made well ahead of recognition expiring, so there should be no uncertainty for claimants.

Recommendation 4


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth address the issue of native title claims that overlap the boundaries of different representative bodies to avoid uncertainty for claimants.

Response
Accepted.  The Native Title Act 1993 (Native Title Act) already provides for written agreements about representation between NTRBs where a claim overlaps NTRB boundaries.  To date, this has not been a problem area, with representation usually being readily agreed on the basis of where the largest geographic part of the claim falls, or where the greatest number of claimants live.  Nevertheless, OIPC will pay particular attention to such cases to determine whether there are issues adversely affecting claimants.  Should there be instances where NTRBs fail to come to a suitable arrangement, OIPC will act as a broker in discussions to resolve the impasse.  This could include, for example, agreeing to vary existing funding agreements so that funding for a matter is re-allocated between NTRBs, or assisting NTRBs to explore whether a variation to NTRB boundaries is warranted.

Recommendation 5


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth immediately review the adequacy of the level of funding provided by the OIPC to NTRBs for capacity building activities including management and staff development, and information technology.

Response
Accepted in part.  There is significant capacity building activity being undertaken within current funding levels.  Activities include training in administrative law and corporate governance, and human resources development and support.  OIPC has to date been able to meet all requests for these services from within existing funding.  There is therefore no requirement for an immediate funding review.  On completion, the current projects will be evaluated, and at that stage, OIPC will review the adequacy of funding.

Recommendation 6


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, in conjunction with industry groups, consider providing additional pooled funding for emergency and unforeseen situations, such as future act matters, litigation or court proceedings; and that the OIPC develop guidelines and procedures that will enable funding to be available in these situations in a timely fashion.

Response
Accepted in part.  OIPC already provides funding for major litigation under its Contested Native Title Litigation Scheme.  In 2005-06, save for one application which is under consideration, all applications for funding under this Scheme were approved (although some applicants received less than the amount originally requested).  Guidelines for funding under the Scheme came into effect on 1 January 2006.  The Guidelines make it clear that OIPC will process applications for funding within 10 working days of receiving all relevant information from NTRBs.
NTRBs are also free to apply at any time for additional funding for unforeseen activities  which can be made available in a short space of time.  OIPC does its utmost to process applications for such funding as quickly as possible.  However, processing time-frames may be affected where the relevant NTRB does not provide all relevant information to OIPC at the time of making the application.  
The Government notes that future act proponents and some State and Territory governments contribute funding for future act matters, including by funding NTRB future act officers in some instances. The Government is not aware of any evidence to support the need for additional pooled funding for future acts and is not aware of any evidence of emergencies arising. The Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources has consulted with the Minerals Councils of Australia regarding this aspect of the recommendation.

Recommendation 7


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth ensures that the level of funding available to the Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations provides NTRBs with adequate training and support to meet the requirements of the introduction of the new corporate governance regime under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Bill 2005.

Response
Accepted.  The Office of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations (ORAC), FACSIA received additional funds in the 2006-07 Budget to implement enhanced capacity building for Indigenous corporations including accredited and non-accredited training in corporate governance. In addition ORAC already has a training and information program in place to assist participants understand the new Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Bill 2005.  There will be time for corporations to transition into the new legislative framework in the lead up to its commencement and also after its commencement and ORAC is working with funding bodies to maximise opportunities for corporations to understand the new requirements.

Recommendation 8


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth immediately review the level of operational funding provided to NTRBs to ensure that they are adequately resourced and reasonably able to meet their performance standards and fulfil their statutory functions.

Response
Not accepted at this stage.  Approximately half of the total funding allocated to the native title system annually is directed to NTRBs.  Funding for individual NTRBs is reviewed annually and allocated in light of the operational plans they submit.  The Australian Government considers that any deficiencies in performance result primarily from a lack of NTRB capacity, rather than a lack of funding.  NTRB capacity is being specifically addressed through the Performance Enhancement Program (PEP) and by the current legislative reform proposals, which aim to achieve greater levels of NTRB accountability, responsiveness and efficiency.
In the 2005-06 Budget the Government agreed to extend additional funding provided to the native title system in 2001-02, committing an additional $72.9 million to the native title system over the four years to 2008-09. 
Of the additional funding provided in 2005-06, $15.6 million was allocated for NTRB capacity building and strategic litigation initiatives. Expenditure under the PEP for 2005-06 was approximately $2.9 million.  Spending in 2006-07 is likely to increase to $4.8 million with the full year effect of key initiatives implemented in 2005-06.
In 2005-06, the PEP provided for implementation of a new Common Services Project (CSP).  The CSP will focus on delivering a range of human resource development and support services for NTRBs.  This is consistent with recommendations made in a recent report commissioned by OIPC which considered NTRB needs in relation to recruiting and retaining legal staff.  The CSP builds on the report’s recommendations by encompassing NTRB needs in relation to anthropologists and other staff where feasible, and seeks to address training and development needs of all NTRB staff.
Monash University, through the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law (Castan Centre), has been engaged to deliver services under the project.  The Castan Centre’s mandate includes promoting human rights through teaching, publications and public education. 
The Castan Centre will engage a Strategic Development Manager to advise NTRBs on human services issues.  Other services to be delivered under the project include: a student placement program; promotional activities regarding opportunities in NTRBs; a locum program; encouraging development of a mentoring service; preparing an induction manual and providing associated training for professional officers; conducting training needs assessments for NTRB staff and providing training in key needs areas; and developing and implementing an NTRB staff performance evaluation and learning needs assessment tool.
The CSP will also explore levels of interest amongst NTRBs in common services arrangements for professional indemnity and other insurance cover.  Experience in these trial areas will provide guidance on the potential for other common services arrangements to be implemented for NTRBs.
In addition to the CSP, the PEP provides for a range of initiatives designed to improve NTRB capacity and performance, including:
communication forums and workshops for NTRB management and key staff groups;
additional dedicated funding for NTRB staff development, training and support;
specialist training workshops on governance, administrative law and contract management for NTRB staff and governing committees;
support for improvements in NTRB IT infrastructure;
services commissioned through the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Native Title Research Unit, including: the annual national native title conference; web based services and native title focused research and publications; maintenance of resource and professional development networks; access by NTRBs to AIATSIS collections; and development of training and resource materials on conflict management in native title;
research and investigations into significant issues affecting NTRB efficiency and effectiveness;
web resource development; and
change management and assistance with compliance obligations.
These activities aim to improve NTRBs’ capacity to perform their functions cost-effectively, and hence improve outcomes for Indigenous people from the native title system.
Funding for the native title system will be reviewed in the budget context at the end of the current funding cycle.

Recommendation 9


The Committee recommends that the OIPC, in close consultation with NTRBs, develop standardised criteria for use in the recruitment of representative body staff; and that these criteria be used nationally to provide consistency in standards of recruitment.

Response
Accepted.  While OIPC seeks to avoid being overly prescriptive about NTRBs’ day-to-day operations, some consistency in this area is desirable in the interests of attracting and retaining quality staff across the system.  The new CSP (see response to Recommendation 8) will assist NTRBs with advice on human resources development and practice generally, including by providing advice on key issues such as recruitment.

Recommendation 10


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth investigate the feasibility of:

the secondment of expert government staff to NTRBs;
the establishment of a centre of excellence to develop the legal capacity of NTRB lawyers and from which NTRBs could draw expertise as required; and
the provision of scholarships for post-graduate study to further enhance skills in areas of relevance to the work of NTRBs.
Response
Accepted. 
the Government acknowledges the benefits of staff exchanges and has recently arranged initial secondments to and from NTRBs. Further secondments may be arranged as opportunities arise.
the Castan Centre will be promoting career opportunities in NTRBs to public sector personnel, and opportunities for seconding lawyers and public sector personnel to NTRBs;
under the CSP, the Castan Centre will also be providing many of the services which the recommendation envisages being provided by a Centre of Excellence.  There will be targeted courses provided to lawyers on aspects of native title law and practice, the development and promotion of a mentoring framework for NTRB professional staff, a register of Counsel and other professionals with experience in native title matters, and a source of professional advice for NTRBs on human resource issues; and
there is already a postgraduate scholarship program for lawyers in the native title system or for interested new graduates.  NTRBs may also support such activities using dedicated additional funding provided for staff training, development and support. 

Recommendation 11


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth implement a national recruitment strategy to address the professional staffing needs of NTRBs and that this strategy:

promote the status and positive image of work in NTRBs;
focus on promotion of careers in NTRBs to the professions;
introduce an ongoing NTRB student placement program; and
promote the employment of Indigenous people to positions in NTRBs.
Response
Accepted. 
under the CSP, the Castan Centre has been engaged to promote careers in NTRBs; 
these promotions will target major law firms and relevant university faculties.  Secondments will be coordinated, and a register of experienced Counsel developed and maintained;
the  Castan Centre currently coordinates the placement of law students in NTRBs, and it is planned that this be extended to anthropology students; and
there are already a significant number of indigenous employees in NTRBs, and more will be attracted as career prospects improve through enhanced human resource practices.

Recommendation 12


The Committee recommends that representative bodies focus on the professional development needs of NTRB professionals and enhance the support structures and programs available to them, including:

developing a formal induction training program for new recruits;
establishing ongoing training programs to further enhance skills in particular areas;
creating a mentoring system; and
implementing performance evaluation systems to assist in the identification of professional development needs.
Response
Accepted.  Under the CSP, the Castan Centre has been engaged to:
develop an induction program, including providing training and an induction manual;
deliver and coordinate general and targeted training programs in areas of need identified by NTRBs, including for senior management;
develop, establish and maintain a mentoring framework for professional staff and an alumni network of former staff to support the mentoring process; and
develop, implement and support a model NTRB performance evaluation and learning needs assessment tool for professional staff.

Recommendation 13


The Committee recommends that the OIPC continue to monitor the salary differentials provided to senior professional staff of NTRBs; and introduce a scale of salaries to provide consistency across the system if significant differentials continue to apply.

Response
Accepted in part.  It is agreed that consistent salary scales are desirable, and OIPC will continue to monitor the differentials revealed in the survey which it commissioned, and which it has provided to NTRBs for their guidance.  OIPC has provided a model remuneration framework to NTRBs for use as a guide in the recruitment process with the objective of achieving greater consistency across NTRBs over time.  However, NTRBs have not supported a compulsory salary framework, and OIPC, while encouraging consistency, does not consider it appropriate to enforce one against NTRBs’ wishes.

Recommendation 14


The Committee recommends that representative bodies investigate the feasibility of implementing a system of ‘pooling’ of professional staff in situations where an NTRB may lack a full complement of particular professional staff.

Response
Accepted.  Under the CSP, the Castan Centre has been engaged to develop and implement a locum service to place short term appointments in critical NTRB need areas pending recruitment.  NTRBs already collaborate extensively and share resources and expertise where possible, and this will be further encouraged. The Government acknowledges that this recommendation could create considerable efficiencies and will consider how it might be more fully implemented.

Recommendation 15


The Committee recommends that the OIPC continue to support NTRBs in improving the quality of their strategic planning processes and especially in integrating strategic plans, operational plans and performance based budgeting and reporting.

Response 
Accepted.  OIPC is committed to working closely with NTRBs to improve native title outcomes, including through integration of planning, budgeting and reporting processes.   However, consistent with Recommendation 16, the proposed reforms will remove requirements for NTRBs to prepare strategic plans and table annual reports in Parliament
(see further below).  

Recommendation 16


The Committee recommends that the OIPC, in consultation with representative bodies, review the current compliance and accountability requirements placed on NTRBs with a view to reducing unnecessary duplication of reporting and streamlining reporting procedures.

Response
Accepted in part. 
As noted above, the proposed reforms will remove requirements for NTRBs to prepare strategic plans and table annual reports in Parliament.  Given their generality, strategic plans have proved to be of limited use as planning tools.  They have therefore created unnecessary work both for NTRBs and OIPC. Requiring NTRBs to table their annual reports in Parliament has also proved to be unnecessarily onerous. These measures will substantially streamline planning and reporting procedures.
NTRBs’ reporting requirements under the PFA are consistent with Australian Government requirements for all Indigenous program funding.  However, OIPC continually attempts to identify ways to reduce unnecessary reporting requirements and red-tape for NTRBs.  For example:
The PFA is periodically reviewed and re-drafted to improve clarity and remove unnecessary requirements.  NTRB Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers and senior professional officers have been consulted in this regard and their views taken into account.  PFAs were recently amended to allow NTRBs to engage consultants who are members of a relevant professional association without going to tender, and to raise the value of work that can be procured without tendering.  PFAs were also amended to remove the automatic requirement that OIPC obtain an independent assessment before agreeing to fund contested litigation which had caused unnecessary delays in processing funding applications.  
OIPC recently issued Guidelines for Contested Native Title Litigation Funding which clearly state the criteria that NTRBs must address in applying for such funding.
As noted in the response to Recommendation 1, for 2005-06, financial reports were required every three months and operational reports were required every six months.  For 2006-07, financial and operational reports will be required every four months.  The revised reporting frequency was broadly supported by NTRBs’ Chief Financial Officers and will ensure that reporting is more outcomes-focused and thus more useful.  The new requirements should also be simpler to comply with. 
OIPC will continue to streamline compliance processes wherever possible.  However, this imperative must be balanced against the need to ensure that public monies are adequately accounted for and appropriately targeted towards progressing native title matters for which NTRBs are funded. 

Recommendation 17


The Committee recommends that the amended Guidelines on the Provision of Financial Assistance by the Attorney-General under the Native Title Act 1993 due to come into effect in June 2006 provide:

provisions to encourage agreement-making rather than litigation to resolve native title disputes; and
that eligibility for assistance be subject to means testing along similar lines to those applying for grants of legal aid.
Response
Provisions to encourage agreement making
Accepted.  The Australian Government announced a package of complementary reforms to the native title system in 2005, including a review of the Respondents’ Funding Scheme Guidelines.  One of the Government’s objectives is to promote the resolution of native title matters through agreement making, rather than litigation, wherever appropriate.  The consultation draft Guidelines incorporate features that will further encourage agreement making, including the following measures:
authorising assistance in stages of 6 to 12 months, or shorter timeframes, to facilitate improved and more transparent planning by funded parties focused on achieving outcomes;
varying or terminating assistance if a grant recipient fails to act reasonably by not endeavouring to reach a reasonable agreement with a claimant;
limiting financial assistance in court proceedings to situations where the matter raises a new and significant question of law, or the court requires the respondent’s participation in proceedings, or the claim will affect the respondent in a real and significant way and the claimant unreasonably fails to negotiate.
strengthening reporting requirements imposed on grant recipients to include strategies to resolve issues in dispute.
The proposed draft Guidelines were released for consultation in November 2005.  Responses are being assessed.  Subject to approval, it is proposed the revised Guidelines will be implemented by 1 January 2007.
Eligibility for assistance to be subject to means testing
Not accepted. At present an applicant’s financial circumstances are assessed when determining the reasonableness of making a grant of financial assistance.
Under the consultation draft guidelines, evaluation of financial circumstances would continue to apply where an individual applies for assistance and is not represented by a peak body. As a condition of a grant of financial assistance an applicant may also be required to make a contribution to the total matter costs.
Where the applicant is not a natural person consideration will be given to what other financial resources are available to the applicant from owners, members and beneficiaries. A publicly listed company would be regarded as having sufficient financial resources not to receive assistance.

Recommendation 18


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth examine appropriate means for resourcing the core responsibilities of Prescribed Bodies Corporate.

Response
Accepted.  As the Committee notes, the native title system reforms include an examination of the current structures and processes of Prescribed Bodies Corporate (PBCs).  This task is overseen by a Steering Committee comprised of officers from the Attorney-General’s Department, OIPC and ORAC.  The Steering Committee has undertaken targeted consultations with a range of stakeholders including NTRBs, PBCs, State and Territory Governments and industry bodies.
The Steering Committee has considered appropriate means for resourcing of PBCs’ core responsibilities in the context of the examination, including consideration of existing funding sources and resourcing needs beyond funding (eg, capacity building and professional assistance).  Consideration has also been given to whether existing structures and processes could be made more manageable and less resource intensive.
NTRBs are a key existing source of assistance for PBCs in meeting their core responsibilities.  The Committee’s Report suggests that NTRBs must cease being involved with PBCs when PBCs hold their first annual general meeting.  In fact, under their funding agreements with OIPC, NTRBs can perform their statutory functions in relation to PBCs at any time.  These functions are significant and include assisting PBCs to negotiate ILUAs and other future act agreements.  It is however currently the case that NTRBs cannot use their Australian Government funding to contribute to a PBC’s day-to-day administrative costs beyond the PBC’s first annual general meeting.

Recommendation 19


The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments widely publicise the availability to Prescribed Bodies Corporate of different funding sources, particularly in relation to the PBCs’ land management functions.

Response
Accepted.  As noted above, the current examination of PBCs includes consideration of existing resources available to PBCs, including in relation to their land management functions.  The Government agrees that there would be merit in working with State and Territory governments to publicise the availability of any such resources to PBCs.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,33,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-01,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
I want to note that one of the government’s responses tabled today is to a report from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that was tabled on 22 May last year. Going by the standards of the current government, a nine-month turnaround is actually quite prompt, but I should point out that it is well and truly outside the requirements of the standing orders for responses to committee reports from the government. Particularly given that there were only six recommendations contained in that report, I think a nine-month turnaround is unacceptable.
Nonetheless, it is appropriate to take the opportunity to note the government’s response and the fact that five of the six recommendations were agreed to or supported by the government. This flows on from some of the issues in the debate we had while taking note of questions about the nature of our Defence Force activities. The core recommendation from the committee was that:
… the ANZUS Alliance be maintained in its current form and that the treaty be viewed not just as a specific set of requirements, rather as a statement of shared values capable of being acted upon in the face of evolving contemporary threats.
Whilst I was not part of the subcommittee that drew up this particular report, even though I am a member of the broader joint standing committee, that is a recommendation I support. Indeed, I have published material, along with other Democrat colleagues, expressing support for the ANZUS alliance. Nonetheless, there are clearly significant concerns among a wide range of the Australian community about how the defence alliance and defence relationship with the United States are revolving. It is true that the ANZUS alliance is valuable and that it should be able to evolve in various directions. So, in criticising the way it is evolving, I am not criticising the ANZUS alliance or specifically the alliance with the United States but rather expressing concerns about the direction in which it is being taken or, perhaps more specifically, the direction we are allowing it to be taken by virtue of being led by the current United States administration.
Once again, under the new political correctness regime we have from this government, anybody who voices any sort of concern about specific details of our defence arrangements with the United States immediately gets slammed as being anti-American. There is an attempt to close down debate via sloganeering such as that rather than actually dealing with the substance of the concerns. Judging by the comments he made, it seems it is okay for the Australian Prime Minister to quite seriously slander the United States Democratic Party presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama, but if anybody else expresses concerns about defence issues with the United States they are called anti-American. The simple fact is that we have seen not only growing security threats but a growing lack of safety for Australia and Australians as a direct result of some of the decisions of this government, which have been driven by their uncritical application of the alliance with the current US administration.
This particular report and the government response to it draw attention to the continuing joint training between Australian and US defence forces and recommends that the joint training centre concept be codified in an MOU before the next exercise, Talisman Sabre, this year. That is coming up in a few months in my own state of Queensland. It raises one of those concerns that often manifests in the general community. I believe there is very strong support in the Australian community for an alliance with the United States, but there is also very strong disquiet about the way that alliance is manifesting itself with regard to some of the defence relationships. We have seen the bizarre situation of the huge amount of money that is being put forward for the next fighter plane and some of the very strange decision making and commentary relating to that from the government side. It is not just a matter of billions and billions of dollars being misused or misapplied; it is a matter of locking our defence forces in the long term into structures and equipment that do not maximise our flexibility and not focusing our demands and our needs where they should be.
Similarly, we had community concern about the recent announcement of the plan for a new US base in Western Australia—something that obviously, in being only recently announced, came about after this committee tabled its report. But the same question is raised. It is a question not of whether we should have an alliance with the United States but of how we are allowing that alliance to be manifested, particularly at a time when United States foreign policy is clearly so flawed, so dangerous and apparently still determined to go down a very dangerous path. It is precisely at that time that we should have enough flexibility in our alliance and our defence arrangements to be able to say, ‘We are not going with you on this one.’ The lack of ability to do that and the lack even of recognition of the need to be able to do that are core problems with the government’s policies in this area and, indeed, the government response tabled here.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,33,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-01,"—I rise to speak to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission—Report for 2005-06. We have heard a lot in this place and in the wider community about the future of water management for the Murray-Darling Basin. Of course, we have had some contributions from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission people themselves on the Prime Minister’s proposal. One of the concerns amongst the many that the Democrats have about what is being proposed at the moment for the Murray-Darling Basin is that some of the people with expertise in the field—whether that expertise is in management, water policy, the environment or farming—have not been properly involved so far in the development of the Prime Minister’s plan.
I should emphasise—as I try to do each time, to make sure that I am not misrepresented—that the Democrats have been calling for the Prime Minister to do something along the lines of what he announced at the end of January he would do, which was to ensure clear, overarching national management of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Whatever criticisms you would make of the federal government in this area, quite clearly the state governments have failed in their duties, by and large, to manage water resources in the basin properly. Clearly it is at a stage where something extra needs to be done. But that something needs to be done does not mean that doing anything is okay; we need to make sure, now more than ever, that what is done is correct and will actually work—not least because there is a large amount of money being put forward, or at least promised, in this area.
With such a major step as the referral of at least some powers from some of the states to the federal government being proposed, if that step fails then it really will make it difficult for the future. That is why the Democrats have called a number of times for a Senate inquiry into this whole proposal. That would get more of the detail out into the public arena so that it would not just be a backroom deal between the federal government and various state governments looking at their short-term political agendas. Even the Murray-Darling Basin Commission people themselves need to be much more in the loop with regard to what is being proposed. As an example of that, you only need to look at the difference between the Murray-Darling Basin Commission’s understanding of how things were going to be progressing in the National Water Initiative and the like at the time that this report was put together and the Murray-Darling Basin amendment legislation, on which we had a report tabled yesterday.
Then we had the Prime Minister’s statement at the end of January, which took another direction again. Now, as I said before, we need a new direction, so there is potential there. But it has to be the right direction, not just any direction. There were some quite good statements in the Prime Minister’s announcement at the end of January. He clearly indicated, amongst other things, that we needed to look at, as a last resort, the need to buy back water allocations. We all know overallocation is one of the significant problems. Yet in the communique released on the agreement between the Prime Minister and some of the premiers some weeks later, a lot more equivocation had crept in. That may be as much the influence of the premiers as of the Prime Minister; I do not know. Then earlier this week in question time in the House of Representatives the leader of the National Party made a statement that the last resort would be buying back water from people who wanted to sell it. Well, we still need to recognise that there may well be a time when we have to buy back water from people who do not want to sell it because that is the problem with overallocation. And just putting forward another big package with another lot of big promises and a lot of extra money is no good if we are not going to take the hard decisions at the end. That would risk not solving the problem, and we cannot afford that any longer.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Murray-Darling Basin Commission</title>,Documents,37,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-03-01,"—I also rise to speak to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission—Report for 2005-06 and to my motion of 8 February to take note of the document. The report sets out the work the commission has done over the period 2005-06. The commission has done a good job over many years—since Federation, I think. It has been constrained many times because each of the relevant states and the Commonwealth has always had an interest in this, and anything that was done had to be done in conjunction with all of the states. Trying to get all of the states to agree when they had very differing interests has always been a great difficulty. I attended a number of Murray-Darling Basin ministerial meetings when I was the relevant minister and they always struck me as a group of people who were more interested in their own outcomes than in the outcomes of the nation and in the outcomes for the Murray-Darling Basin itself.
Because of that, I am delighted with the Prime Minister’s initiative to try and get the Commonwealth to have some form of control over the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin system. I have not been closely enough involved in that and have not followed it closely enough to understand exactly what this means in practice and how it is going to be implemented. If the states do not agree to allow the Commonwealth to do what is right for Australia—and, as I understand it, one of the states is still being a bit reticent—then I hope that a referendum might be held to constitutionally provide that, where rivers cross state boundaries, they become the responsibility of the national government rather than of individual state governments. If all the states agree to the Prime Minister’s proposal, that will not be necessary and we will have a national government making decisions that are in the national interest.
I can well understand why New South Wales were so keen to come on board, because New South Wales particularly had grossly overallocated water in that state from the Murray-Darling Basin system for many years. They were almost criminal in the way they allocated water without any real care for where the water was going to come from when it had been allocated. That is fine in wet times but, when it does not rain, when there is no water flowing, what do you do? Quite clearly, the New South Wales government would have been left with a huge bill to buy back water that they had overallocated. I always thought, in many of the meetings I attended, that it was a bit rich of New South Wales—having given out all that water, having been paid for it, in many instances, and having got a lot of political kudos from allocating water licences to landowners—to turn around and say, ‘We’ve done the wrong thing in the past but we want everyone else to pay for it.’ Under the Prime Minister’s proposal, as I understand it, the Commonwealth taxpayer will end up buying back water as a result of New South Wales’s folly over many years. As I say, for that reason I can understand why Mr Iemma was the first one out of the blocks to say, ‘Great idea!’
I hope that by the Commonwealth taking ‘control’ of the Murray they will have a much closer interest in what happens in that very special part of Australia. If it turns out that, for domestic political reasons, the Victorian government decides not to come along with this proposal, then I hope that the Commonwealth government will seriously consider some sort of referendum to constitutionally allow the government to do what I think should have been done at the time of Federation. As I understand it, in a lot of the discussions that were held leading up to Federation there was consideration of whether the Murray-Darling Basin system should be a national responsibility. As it turned out, it was not made one, but perhaps, 100 years on, it is time to look at that. (Time expired)

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-03-01,"—With regard to item No. 3 on page 8 of the Notice Paper, there is an amendment of the motion to take note of the second report of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on the operation of the Senate order on departmental and agency contracts. That amendment is agreed by all parties; it is a procedural amendment. However, until such time as the document is considered and has been taken note of, of course the document will stay on the Notice Paper and therefore the amendment cannot come into play. So it is important from a technical perspective to separate the two out. I seek leave therefore to move a motion now in relation to that report on the Senate order on agency contracts so that that motion can be dealt with and the report can remain on the Notice Paper.
Leave granted.

That recommendations 11 and 13 of the second report of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on the operation of the Senate order for the production of lists of departmental and agency contracts be adopted.
—Senator Murray, I am not sure in my capacity here that I have been advised of our position on this motion. I accept your indication that that is the case.
—Perhaps I could explain briefly. The matter was cleared with the chair and deputy chair of the committee, and with the whip. Unfortunately, the whips have changed, so the same whip is not in place.
—Sorry, could you repeat that?

That the Senate take note of the report.
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services conducted an inquiry on the Corporations Amendment (Takeovers) Bill and tabled this out of session last week. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 14 February 2007. The purpose of the bill is to clarify the powers of the Takeovers Panel. The Takeovers Panel plays an important role in corporate Australia as the main forum for resolving disputes between corporate rivals during a takeover bid. It is a peer review body whose processes are informal and expeditious. In most circumstances, resolution of takeovers disputes through this mechanism avoids costly and time-consuming legal action.
Importantly, the Takeovers Panel has the support of the market. The bill is designed to clarify the jurisdiction of the Takeovers Panel, which has been called into question by two recent Federal Court decisions: the Glencore cases. The Glencore decisions involved a takeover bid of Austral Coal by Centennial Coal in early 2005. During the takeover bid, Glencore used a novel financial instrument called a cash settled equity swap, a form of equity derivative, to effectively hide from the market a potential future interest in the takeover target’s shares.
The legitimacy of this transaction was ultimately challenged in the Federal Court, which found that as Glencore did not have an interest in the shares it did not amount to a substantial interest as required under the Corporations Act. This decision has the potential to limit the ability of the Takeovers Panel to make decisions in relation to these evolving financial instruments in the future. The bill seeks to remedy this situation.
Our committee received nine submissions from a range of legal professionals, regulatory bodies and associations of the corporate and financial services sectors. The committee also held a public hearing in Canberra on 1 December 2006. Concerns were expressed to the committee regarding the breadth and effectiveness of the proposed definition of a ‘substantial interest’. Reaching a suitable definition is inherently problematic due to the difficulties involved in regulating a rapidly evolving aspect of the financial services market: equity derivatives.
The committee was of the view that the panel should have the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and the development of new instruments in the financial services sector, particularly in the rapidly evolving area of equity derivatives. The committee is pleased that the government has provided clarification in the explanatory memorandum and has also provided for regulations to provide further certainty in this area. As a result, the committee considers that the changes that have been made should satisfy the concerns raised by witnesses. The committee will certainly maintain a close interest in developments in this area.
Another aspect of the bill is the broadening of the effect test, which would essentially provide the Takeovers Panel with new jurisdictional powers. In this regard the committee supports the Law Council’s proposed amendment, which would more closely link the panel’s powers to the policy objectives contained in chapter 6 of the Corporations Act. This would provide greater certainty to the panel and its stakeholders. The committee recommends that the Law Council’s more specific formulation be adopted in the bill by way of an amendment.
Finally, the committee considered the broader policy question of the disclosure of equity derivatives during a corporate takeover. The committee concluded that this is an area where further work is required and recommended that, as a high priority, the government develop a robust framework for the disclosure of equity derivatives relating to corporate takeovers. Subject to these recommendations, the committee recommends that the Senate pass the bill. These were the main elements of our report, and I commend the report to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2007-03-01,"—I seek leave to first of all go back to the discussion on the committee’s report on the Australian Crime Commission and then to incorporate my speech, which I prepared to deliver when I spoke to the initial report. Unfortunately, through bad timing on my behalf, I did not really get to the end of it. I tried to edit it on my feet, which is always dangerous. So, just for the record, I want to incorporate the total speech.
Leave granted.
The incorporated speech read as follows—
At the outset of tabling this report, I want to congratulate the Howard Government and indeed the Parliament, (as I understand Drugs Policy is relatively bipartisan), on the work the Australian Government has done to stop the importation and use of illicit drugs, particularly amphetamines and other synthetic drugs. The Tough on Drugs Policy is a strategy which has been vigorously pursued and it demonstrates not only the Government’s but the community’s aversion to illicit drugs.
I want to particularly place on record the great work that the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Crime Commission do in protecting Australians from the scourge of illicit drugs. I would ask that the Minister for Justice and Customs pass onto these agencies my congratulations and I’m confident in doing this I speak on behalf of all members of the Committee.
As well, recognition should be made of the work the State & Territory Police Forces do (at many times in difficult circumstances because of the stupidity of state boundaries and different laws in different states —but more about that in the report). Across the board we were considerably assisted by the evidence, experience and plans of the State Law Enforcement Agencies and I thank them for their contribution, not only to the report, but to the part they play in helping to protect Australians from organised crime and illicit drugs.
So many other Commonwealth and State Government Agencies do mighty work in trying to address the problem arising from drug consumption in Australia and as well I thank them for what they do and for the assistance they gave to the Committee.
But whilst Governments do everything in their power to reduce supply and demand, it is a very sad but unfortunately true fact that we are losing the fight against the consumption of illicit drugs.
Australia has the highest consumption per head of population in the world of ecstasy—3.4% according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.
Just last weekend—and indeed every weekend—according to evidence given to us by the Victorian Police, some 100,000 pills of synthetic drugs are consumed by Australians.
AOSD users cut cross all sectors of society and come from a variety of backgrounds. Users may range from well-educated professionals who, for example, use ecstasy and methamphetamine at dance parties, through to marginalised injecting drug users who inject methamphetamine and/or cocaine.
In many cases illicit drug consumption leads to downstream impacts that destroy lives and personal relationships and become a huge burden on the health systems of the nation. Mental disease and disorders, long term and sustained illnesses and even death are results of the taking of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs.
The rise in methamphetamine use – particularly regular use of its purer forms, base and ice – has been linked with an increase in mental illness in users. Common problems include increased aggression, agitation, depression and symptoms of psychosis.
The FFDLR submission quoted work by McKetin et al. that estimates ‘the prevalence of psychosis among regular methamphetamine users was 11 times higher than that seen in the general population’.
While the majority of AOSD in Australia is imported, recent seizures of precursor chemicals and detentions of clandestine laboratories (clam labs) show that domestic manufacture of AOSD is increasing in Australia.
Detections of clandestine laboratories by law enforcement agencies have increased significantly, rising from 58 in 1996-97 to 381 in 2004-05.
The Committee heard evidence of significant organised crime involvement in the importation, domestic manufacture and distribution of AOSD, particularly methamphetamine and MDMA, in Australia. Production of AOSD appears to be presently concentrated in NSW, Victoria and Queensland.
The Manufacture and distribution of AOSD by organised criminal groups and opportunistic producers were business ventures motivated by significant financial gains.
The Committee acknowledges that tension exists around the harm-reduction and demand-reduction potential of pill testing programs. There are concerns that such schemes equate to condoning drug taking, could expose pill-testing authorities or practitioners to civil or criminal liability, and could endanger users of such services.
While the Committee acknowledges that pill-testing proponents are well-intentioned, a majority of the Committee considers that such programs have yet to overcome these legitimate and serious concerns:
As I mentioned the Committee had differing views about the benefits of harm minimisation, and accordingly the Report contains no deliberative recommendation in relation to harm minimisation apart from: Recommendation 7 in which
71 The Committee recommends that the Victorian feasibility study for an illicit tablet monitoring and information service be monitored and, as appropriate, the outcomes independently evaluated by the appropriate Commonwealth Government Agency.

Recommendation 6 The Committee recommends
50 that, in the execution of the National Drug Strategy, harm-reduction strategies and programs receive more attention and resources.
The Committee believes it is critical that adequate funds be made available to research the long-term effects of these drugs and to provide adequate treatment and assistance for mental and physical health problems that arise from AOSD use. The Committee also considers that such funding should also be available for support for the families of users.
An enormous amount of work is being done by Government Agencies and I know that the Minister for Justice and Customs will continue to do all that is humanly possible to prevent illicit drug consumption by Australians.
Strategies to address precursor drugs not only in Australia but overseas are innovative and very useful. Any number of private agencies including the Pharmacy Guild and the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia have programs in place that do substantially contribute to the detection and reduction of supply of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs.

Recommendation 12 The Committee recommends
35 that the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with state and territory governments and pharmacists, continue to implement Project STOP nationally.
The effectiveness of drug education programs is dependent on how information is presented. The Department of Health and Ageing, in a supplementary submission, argued that its national drug prevention campaigns and messages to young people are based upon a thorough, evidence-based social marketing approach, which includes extensive research conducted with young people themselves.
However, the Committee notes that some of the evidence given to this inquiry questions the effectiveness of some campaigns to modify the behaviour of current drug users. The current NDC aims to highlight the negative and terrifying effects of AOSD use, and it is reported that the Commonwealth Government intends to use a scare campaign in future advertising on AOSD use. As part of the second phase of the NDC, this campaign is likely to be based upon the AIDS Grim Reaper advertisements of the mid-1800s.
Some submitters were critical of the role the media played, accusing the media of scaremongering and thereby undermining the goal of responsible and effective drug education.
Concerns were also raised over the media’s use of the term ‘party drug’ and the name ‘ecstasy’ for MDMA. The use of such terms reinforces particular positive social expectations or impressions and thereby undermines, to a degree, the efforts of health, education and law enforcement sectors.

Recommendation 5 The Committee recommends
22 that public education and demand-reduction campaigns for illicit drugs be factual, informative and appropriately targeted. The Committee also recommends that such campaigns seek input from young people, and take account of user experiences of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).
After hearing all the evidence, it is my belief, that young people at the coalface are not closely enough involved in strategies to address the impacts and consequences of illicit drug taking.
I want to place on record my appreciation to those young people who did, directly and indirectly and often anonymously provide information to the Committee. I particularly want to thank the then Triple J Drive time producer and announcer Steve Cannane for the help he gave in arranging a three-quarter hour Triple J talkback session on drugs which I and the Committee found very useful in trying to understand views of consumers and young people.
A further recommendation related to the need for the ACC to be well funded to discharge its responsibilities

Recommendation 4 The Committee recommends
88 that the Australian Crime Commission continue to be funded commensurate with the anticipated increase in organised criminal activity in relation to amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).
A number of recommendation dealt with the difficulty in Australia for law enforcement and other agencies dealing with 9 different legislative and governments jurisdictions.

Recommendation 9 The Committee recommends
86 that the state and territories consider adopting drug offence regimes based on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug and Other Offences) Act 2005 with the aim, as far as is practically possible, of establishing greater national consistency in the offences and penalties that apply to crimes related to amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).

Recommendation 10 The Committee recommends
99 that the Commonwealth Government undertake regular reviews of the effectiveness and interaction of Commonwealth and state drug legislation.

Recommendation 11 The Committee recommends
100that the Commonwealth Government continue to work with the state and territory governments to encourage national consistency of offences relating to amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD) and precursor chemicals.
The Committee also made certain recommendations in relation to coordination of state and federal information sharing.

Recommendation 17 The Committee recommends
92 that the Australian Crime Commission work with the state and territory law enforcement agencies to increase their participation in data provision to the Australian Crime Commission’s databases.

Recommendation 18 The Committee recommends
93 that the Australian Crime Commission work to include the data provided by the state and territory law enforcement agencies to further develop the illicit Drug Data Report.
The internet and new technologies are being used by some criminals as the preferred method of communication. The Committee is concerned that organised criminal groups are exploiting new technologies and that, at the present time, law enforcement agencies do not have the capacity to address these weaknesses.

Recommendation 2 The Committee recommends
60 that the Australian Crime Commission develop a nationally coordinated response to new and emerging communications trechnologies used by organised criminal networks to undertake serious criminal activities.
I would urge the Government and particularly the Attorney General’s Department, Health Agencies, Law Enforcement and
Border Protection Agencies to consider and adopt the recommendations made in the Report.
I thank the Australian Crime Commission and its Executive Director, Mr Milroy for the assistance they gave to the Committee during its inquiry and I want to particularly place on record the indebtedness of the Committee and indeed all Australians to the work done by the Committee Secretariat in particular our Research Advisors Anne O’Connell and Ivan Powell and Committee Secretary, Dr Jacquie Dewar and Admin Officer Jill Manning.
The compilation of this Report and the investigations that went into it do involve Committee Members and the Secretariat in a lot of travel and a lot of work and I acknowledge that Members of the Committee have made an outstanding effort in attending hearings and contribution to the final Report —many of them have other electoral and parliamentary commitments which they were able to juggle to contribute to the outcome. I want to particularly place on record my thanks to my colleagues on the Committee and in particular to the Deputy Chairman, the Hon Duncan Kerr SC MP and the members Senators Ferris, Polly and Ludwig and Ms Gash and two policemen Kim Richardson and Jason Wood and Chris Hayes who was involved with the Police Federation of Australia and New Zealand.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (TAKEOVERS) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Report</title>,Miscellaneous,41,2,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-03-01,"—I will make some brief remarks about Breaking the silence: a national voice for gynaecological cancers, as unfortunately time did not permit me to comment when the government’s response to this committee report was tabled earlier in the week.
I firstly want to congratulate the government for responding to this committee report. There has been some discussion here of late about when governments respond to committee reports. I am one of the newer, although by no means the newest, members of this place and in my experience this has been a remarkably rapid and very timely response. Those of us who were involved in this inquiry know that the main reason for that was the tenacity of Senator Ferris. As members of the committee said at the time the report was tabled: that Senator Ferris was prepared to share such a difficult and painful personal journey, and expose it in the public domain in order to try to achieve some public policy changes and outcomes for other women, is something that cannot be commented on too often or too highly. I am sure it has been an incredibly painful journey for her and that it continues to pose challenges.
It is only through Senator Ferris and others coming forward that the rest of the community can have a debate about the need to break the silence on the treatment of these terrible cancers. They affect many women in Australia and they are the silent killer for many women. We need to have the discussion, the education and the research, and we do need to expand treatment. That is what the committee sought to do when it handed down its unanimous report and I must say the government in its initial comments has gone a long way towards helping us achieve that. I note that it has agreed to the committee’s recommendation of $1 million in seed capital for a centre to coordinate research, education and treatment relating to gynaecological cancers and that it will go to Cancer Australia.
I think it is important to note, however, that the government is placing a lot of faith in Cancer Australia and a lot of pressure on what is a very new body. It is important for all of us here to maintain our focus and maintain our interest in how that body is operating to ensure that it gets the support it needs to do all the things that the government has said—not just in responding to the ‘Peter Cook report’, for want of a better title, but also in responding to this report. The bar is very high for them. There are very high expectations. They have some brilliant people working with them, but they are going to need our constant vigilance and constant support.
It is also important that we note in this place the important role that not just Senator Ferris but other people such as Senator Conroy’s partner have chosen to play after overcoming a very confronting personal illness and using it to raise the awareness of other women and other decision makers in this community. It is a very painful and very personal experience. To be prepared to share that with anyone in Australia who will listen and to be so committed to ensuring other women do not suffer similar pain is something that cannot be spoken of too highly. It is important that we acknowledge their significant contribution and that we maintain our vigilance over Cancer Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2007-03-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Having been a long-term spectator on the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it is very pleasing indeed to speak on this Audit Office report, because the Audit Office gives a very positive report, in fact a glowing report, of Defence’s first charter and then purchase and modification of an existing vessel, which was known as the Delos and has become the HMAS Sirius, our new fleet oiler.
That is good, indeed, because the DMO have struggled for sometime, as have Defence—DMO being part of Defence—with a large number of acquisition projects, many of which have not gone the right way. They have either been delayed or have had major cost overruns. But this project not only came in on time but also came in on budget. That was very pleasing indeed. It is good to see the report speak so highly of the processes undertaken by the Defence Materiel Organisation and Defence in the transition of this regular merchant ship into an Australian naval vessel.
I want to quote from part of the Defence response to the ANAO report because it really encapsulates the changes that are taking place within DMO. The executive summary states:
Project SEA1654 Phase 2A (HMAS WESTRALIA Replacement) has provided Defence with an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate the successful application of Kinnaird Review principles. The DMO has applied innovative techniques to the solution of a complex problem and met, or exceeded, all capability, safety, budget and schedule requirements.
Innovation in this Project has included the use of commercial standards (classification society rules) where appropriate ...
It states further:
The Project has also been an excellent example of achieving results in partnership with industry.
I think that that really attests to the change that is taking place within the DMO. I think it is a very welcome change, as a spectator of matters that happen in Defence.
Having read that report, I now have to express some concern at an answer to a question during question time this afternoon about the Remora, which sank off Rottnest Island off the Western Australian coast three months ago and has remained on the sea floor for that period of time. This was reported, as far as I know, in the Courier Mail on 13 December 2006, and would have been in other syndicated publications as well. It referred to the loss of the only rescue vessel for our submarine fleet at that time. In the three months that have elapsed, that rescue vessel has not been replaced. I believe that vessel must have been integral to the full operational capacity of our submarine fleet. The minister’s response was concerning; though, to give him credit, he did come back at the end of question time and added to his response. In question time, he stated:
I understand that Navy is working on this and it is a work in progress.
To me, that statement is of major concern. Contrast the glowing report, and rightfully so, that Defence and the DMO received on the new fleet oiler with the minister’s response on the Remora question that ‘it is a work in progress’, and one has to express grave concerns. It is clear from the press article of 13 December in the Courier Mail that the six Collins class submarines are still operational or have an operational capacity that has not been withdrawn as a result of the loss of this emergency vessel. In their statement to the press on that occasion, Defence said that there were other options for rescues to be undertaken in different circumstances other than the use of the emergency vessel upon which they had solely relied. Whilst that might be the case, it is not convincing. One can only come to the conclusion that our submarines, whilst operational, must have a limited operational capacity. Of course, three months have elapsed since this event happened. It must be of concern to those involved in the limited operations, both the submarine crews and their families onshore, that if an incident were to happen then, even with the best time frame, one would expect a prolonged period of time from when the incident occurred until a rescue might be effected. Of course, time is of the utmost importance when dealing with vessels such as submarines that may have experienced an incident below the sea.
What contingency plans do Defence have in place? How long will it be before the Remora is retrieved? Whilst we are told it is a work in progress, that is unsatisfactory. If there is an incident, how long will it take for a rescue vessel to be on-site to cope with any difficulties that may be faced by the crew in such a circumstance? I think that this really contrasts with the fine report that Defence received on the new fleet oiler. Defence are to be commended for that, but there needs to be instant action on this matter. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-03-01,"—It is good to touch base again with something I touched on in my maiden speech and to continue to pursue that issue. So I rise to speak on behalf of small businesses and consumers, who are being stymied by the market power of the big players in the retail market, and of the inherent unfairness that small business has to deal with by reason of only one thing: the ever-growing dominance of big business, especially big oil companies, big retailers and big retail space conglomerates.
One of the fundamental freedoms in a free society is the ability to go into business, to be your own boss, to have the closest possible connection between your exertions and your reward and to be independent of the threat that your opinions could affect your promotion, which is always part of working for someone else. The stronger the small business sector, the more vibrant, diverse and resilient the economy. The stronger the small business sector, the higher the potential freedom for all. The economy must have new seedbeds of entrepreneurship provided by small business or it will stagnate with the status quo. Centralisation of the economy brings centralisation of opinion, opportunity and wealth. The great inhibitors of small business are government overregulation and mismanagement, a militant industrial relations environment and the aggressive actions of participants with excessive market share.
It is this final issue of excessive market share which I wish to address in this speech, as it appears to be ignored in the political debate. If you are a big business with excessive market share, you are able to sustain a campaign that puts your smaller competitors at risk by reason of your control of the supply lines of vital inputs such as rent, produce or labour. Big business imposes concessions which the market must recoup from smaller competitors through their lower returns. When businesses, by their size alone, are an implicit threat to competitors then the market is imperfect, and evidence of this is emphatic.
All markets have regulation, whether it is occupational health and safety standards, zoning or tax laws. Inherently, these laws favour one player over another. Typically, it is the bigger player who gets favoured. A workplace health and safety officer in a workforce of two is impossible to pay for; in a workforce of 1,000 it is unnoticeable to the bottom line. Because a truly free market is an anomaly and does not exist, there should be no issue about having regulations to ensure small businesses get a fair go when it is obvious that they are being discriminated against. The United States leads the way on this and has strong trade practices laws that include the Sherman act, the Clayton act and the Robinson-Patman act. The current proposed sale of Coles and its likely purchase in part by Woolworths would exacerbate the excessive market powers that Woolworths currently has, and this should not be allowed to occur.
Let us look at some practical examples of what is happening and why the Trade Practices Act needs urgent strengthening to provide better checks and balances on market power. Take, for instance, the meat price comparison survey conducted on 16 December 2006 in south-west Sydney by the Southern Sydney Retailers Association. Their research dispels the myth that bigger is cheaper and just being cheaper is enough to survive if your competition is massive.
Coles and Woolworths’ prices on a selection of meats were, on average, an astronomical 29 per cent higher than those of the independent retailers at Lansvale. I will give a couple of examples to give muscle to the argument. Blade steak was selling at $7.99 per kilogram whereas at Woolworths consumers were being charged $12.99 per kilogram. The independent was selling the family favourite, beef stir-fry, at $12.99, while Woolworths had it at $18.99. Playing devil’s advocate, one might say that the independent was a boutique, high-quality butcher. Well, let’s look at the onion and the granny smith apple. The local independent at Casula sold the brown onion at $2.99 a kilogram, while Woolworths was selling it at $3.67 a kilogram—47 per cent more. The granny smith apple sold for 50 per cent more.
These are clear examples of why overcentralisation of the retail market is exploitation of competition. Ultimately, it leads to exploitation of what is left after small business goes—the consumer. Since 1990, food prices in the ‘big two’ dominated supermarket sector have risen more than 70 per cent. In the UK, where there are more players in the retail grocery sector, prices at the supermarket rose just over 30 per cent in the same period. The true scandal of this situation is that in the last 10 to 15 years in all other developed countries food price inflation at the supermarket has been less than general inflation. In Australia, supermarket food prices have risen around 18 per cent more than inflation. In contrast, in the UK, food price rises are well under inflation.
Let us take another essential grocery item: milk. Since 1991, the farm gate price of milk in Australia has moved in line with all other major international milk producers. Our farmers are obviously efficient. So why have our retail prices increased by 90 per cent since 1990? In comparison, Canada’s retail milk prices have risen just 51 per cent and the UK’s 60 per cent.
Another common beverage that finds its way into shopping trolleys is Coca Cola—despite what you may think of it. The American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association cost of living index survey in Oklahoma in the US found that, for the first quarter of 2005, the average price for a two-litre bottle of Coke in supermarkets in downtown Ardmore was US94c. That equates to $1.30 in Australian terms, including GST. The Southern Sydney Retailers Association compared Coke prices in Australia to those in Canada, where it found that the supermarket chain Shoppers Drug Mart were selling a two-litre bottle of Coke for $Can0.88. This equates to $A1.15 including GST. Woolworths occasionally reduces the price of Coke as a ‘special’. A supermarket price here of $2.96 for a two litre bottle of Coke is not special—it is extortionate. And they can get away with it because they have no competition. Something is wrong.
No wonder private equity firms think Coles is a good buy. They must think they have stumbled across a real gem. We need laws strong enough to encourage competition against the large players and to protect small business. The ‘big two’ retailers further increase their profits through the sweetheart deals on their rents that they enjoy in large shopping complexes—another overcentralised market—handicapping their smaller competitors. You will see from the graph I have here, Mr President, the difference between the rent of the majors and of their competitors.
Here are some examples of these sweet rental deals. At Westfield Liverpool, Coles pays just $245 per square metre per year while Bush’s Meats in the same complex pays a whopping $1,338 per square metre. This is not an isolated example. At Westfield Parramatta, Woolworths pays $218 per square metre versus $1,529 per square metre paid by Prime Quality Meats. At Castle Towers, in Sydney’s north-west, Coles pays $187 per square metre while Farm Fresh meats pays $1,932. How can other meat retailers bring competitive pressure to bear when they are paying up to 10 times more rent per square metre?
Today retail rents for small retailers are an unbelievable 125 per cent higher in Australian shopping malls than they are in US malls. In 51 major regional shopping centres throughout Europe, the average rent for small retailers is $454 per square metre when converted to Australian dollars. This compares extremely unfavourably with the average of $1,167 charged to small retailers by Westfield in Australia—a massive 157 per cent difference.
Let us turn to Chinese-made clothing and footwear. Australians pay between 33 per cent and 115 per cent more for popular sports shoe brands such as Arvee, Kallin, Ascendor, Nike and Adidas. Australians wanting to buy Calvin Klein underwear will pay 58 per cent more at Myer in Toowoomba than at Macy’s in New York. Maybe this says a lot for Myer in Toowoomba—I will have to go there; I expect to see gold door handles. I think it has a lot to do with lack of competition. If they do have competition, they tie their supply lines up.
While Australian tariff protection has been reduced, supposedly to lower prices, we have found in many cases the opposite has occurred. Since 1990, clothing and footwear prices in Australia have jumped 10 per cent while in the UK they have fallen 15 per cent and in the US they have dropped 12 per cent. They have done this without the tariff reductions we have seen in Australia. Surely our smaller domestic market does not account for price anomalies as drastic as these? Maybe this can be accounted for by the tyranny of distance. Not so. Shipping costs from China are lower to Australia than they are to the US.
I could give many more examples, but this is a snapshot of how corrupted our retail market has become and how inadequate the Trade Practices Act is to deal with the market power of the big players. My fears are further exacerbated by the private equity takeover of Qantas by a consortium that includes Macquarie Bank. Australia’s inadequate trade practices laws mean there is nothing to stop the Macquarie owned Sydney airport from offering price discrimination to Qantas at the expense of other players.
The sort of unethical and anticompetitive behaviour identified through the hard work of the Southern Sydney Retailers Association needs to be addressed. I am sure the evidence they have unearthed applies across Australia. Australians are being exploited by the bigger players in the food and retail sector. I am renewing the calls that I and others in the National Party have been making for a strengthening of section 46 and section 51AC—(Time expired)
