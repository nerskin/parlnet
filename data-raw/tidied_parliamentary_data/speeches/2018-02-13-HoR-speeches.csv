Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Attorney-General) (12:02):  I thank all of the honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Investigation and Prosecution Measures Bill 2017. The Investigation and Prosecution Measures Bill 2017 makes two sets of amendments. Firstly, it amends the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to ensure that legislation supports a restructure of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. Secondly, it extends the functions, powers and duties of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the laws of Norfolk Island.


With respect to the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the commission plays a critical role in investigating, exposing and preventing corruption in the public sector. In November 2016, the New South Wales parliament passed the Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment Act 2016. That act restructured the commission by replacing the former arrangement, of a single commissioner and assistant commissioner, with a full-time chief commissioner and two part-time commissioners. Assistant commissioners may also be appointed as required.


The measures in the bill will make a minor amendment to both the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to ensure that the restructured commission is referenced appropriately in those acts. The act will then retain the commission's substantive powers under those acts. With respect to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, it provides the legal framework for specified intelligence and law enforcement agencies to access communications and data for the investigation of criminal offences and other activities that threaten safety and security. It permits eligible law enforcement and security agencies, including the commission, to obtain warrants, intercept communications, obtain warrants to access stored communications and to access telecommunications data subject to stringent legal tests and independent oversight.


The Interception Act vests certain positions within the commission's specific authority when undertaking functions. The chief commissioner, for example, will be able to authorise members of the commission to receive information gathered under warrants and communicate intercepted information obtained by the commission to other agencies in limited circumstances. 


The amendments will allow the chief commissioner, a commissioner or an assistant commissioner to be certifying officers under the act. Certifying officers can, for example, be delegated the power to revoke interception and stored communication warrants, certify true copies of warrants and issue evidentiary certificates. 


With respect to the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, that act governs the use of optical surveillance devices, listening devices, data surveillance devices and tracking devices by law enforcement agencies. The act complements the relevant surveillance devices laws of the states and territories by allowing law enforcement agencies, such as the commission, to obtain surveillance device warrants to help investigate federal offences and state offences with a federal aspect. 


The Surveillance Devices Act vests certain positions within the commission's specific authority when undertaking functions under the act, and these provisions ensure that authorisations are valid and that persons authorised under the act to undertake those functions can exercise their prescribed functions legally. 


The chief commissioner will, for example, have the power to revoke surveillance device warrants and authorise executive level officers to be authorised officers. Commissioners and assistant commissioners will also be designated as authorising officers under the bill. Authorising officers may, for example, issue emergency authorisations for the use of a surveillance device, authorise the use and retrieval of tracking devices without warrant in certain circumstances and issue evidentiary certificates. 


This bill will ensure that the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption is able to continue its work and can access the investigative tools it needs to support its functions. 


With respect to the Norfolk Island Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983, on 1 July 2015 the Australian government took over the responsibility for delivering local, state and Commonwealth services on Norfolk Island, which are proportionally equivalent to services which benefit mainland Australians. As part of this process, it was important to review prosecution arrangements in order to align those services with those available on mainland Australia and other external territories. The measures in this bill will allow the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to take over prosecutorial and related functions in relation to the laws of Norfolk Island. This will ensure that prosecutions against the laws of Norfolk Island are dealt with by a professional independent prosecution service with, evidently, significant expertise. 


The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has considered the bill. The committee recommended that further information be included in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. As such, I present a short addendum to the explanatory memorandum to the Clerk. I thank the committee for their consideration of the bill, and I commend the bill to the House.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (13:30):  On Friday the 16th we will celebrate entering a new year—the lunar new year. We will leave the year of the rooster and enter the year of the dog. This is pretty good, because I was born in the year of the dog, so this should be a great year for me.


Lunar new year is celebrated by many Asian countries—Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and China—and, of course, now in Australia. To my Vietnamese community: happy Tet! To the Koreans: happy Gujeong! In my electorate, to the over 28,000 who share Chinese ancestry: happy Chun Jie! For the Chinese, this day is the most auspicious and important in their calendar. It is described as the world's busiest mass migration, with billions of people travelling. People traverse thousands of kilometres in order to reunite with their loved ones, relatives and friends, just for this occasion. On the way back from the trade fairs in January each year, prior to being in this position, I got stuck in Singapore and Malaysia, quite happily, every year.


To the Chinese, the most fortuitous colour is red and the number is eight, so I'll be expecting lovely shades of red on the streets of Parramatta on Friday, and many groups of eight. On New Year's Day, I'll be visiting Nan Tien Temple in the morning before joining my staff for a Chinese lunch and then visiting Parramatta Park to immerse myself in the celebrations. I'm looking forward to celebrating with events, and expect me in red. Add me on Weixin to follow my celebrations in the new year. To others: expect posts on Facebook. Xin nian kuai le!

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:01):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yanggu gulanyin ngalawiri, dhunayi, Ngunawal dhawra. Wanggarralijinyin mariny bulan bugarabang. Today we meet on Ngunnawal land and we acknowledge and pay our respects to their elders, past, present and emerging. We pay respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the chamber today and across Australia, including the Hon. Ken Wyatt, the first Aboriginal man to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to be appointed a Commonwealth Minister, and Linda Burney, the first Aboriginal woman to be elected to the House of Representatives, and of course we acknowledge, in the Senate, Senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy.


Acknowledgement requires the humility of acceptance of the truth, and acknowledgement is the seed from which hope and healing grow. Today we remember a period of our history when loss and grief almost consumed whole peoples, our first peoples. We stand in awe of the strength of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who, despite all the injustices, have survived. 


Today marks a decade since former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised to Australia's first peoples. Ten years ago the gallery in this place was a sea of proud but heartbroken Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, their eyes telling the story of the trauma they'd lived with for their whole lives. They came to hear the leader of the nation finally acknowledge that their pain, suffering and hurt, and the pain, suffering and hurt of their parents and grandparents, was a deep and irreparable wrong. Hundreds gathered in the Great Hall, and thousands more spilled all the way out onto the lawns in front of the parliament and down Federation Mall. Many watched from afar as Mr Rudd apologised for the laws and policies of successive governments across successive generations, and I reaffirm his apology today. 


As I said in this House, when Mr Rudd retired in 2013, that apology to the stolen generation will never be forgotten. It is not just one of those marks in the sand of history to be blown or washed away by time but it is carved into the granite, into the bedrock, of our history. 


Most of us will never know—have never known—the heartache of being torn from the arms of your mother, of never knowing your brother and sisters, of being denied the right to have a name and being known only as a number, and, after all that, then having to wait for so long for that simple acknowledgement and apology. 


When past governments took children away from their families and denied them their cultures and languages, the policies were brutal and based on ignorance. What Australia failed to understand was that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were proud peoples with an intimate knowledge of these lands, who'd cared for this country for 65,000 years, whose songs and culture date back to time out of mind, who had an intricate knowledge of the seasons and the waters, and who had complex social and kinship structures that guided their lives. We did not see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and peoples as the gift they are—a gift which should have been honoured but which was cast aside, disparaged and ridiculed.


Today, on the 10th anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generations, I extend my respect, I'm sure on behalf of all honourable members, to all the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who, despite immeasurable pain, have survived. We are grateful that you accepted our apology with such generosity of spirit. But our research tells us there is still much more we can do. On the 20th anniversary of Sorry Day last year, the Healing Foundation provided me with a copy of Bringing Them Home 20 years on: an action plan for healing. The report recognises that the needs of members of the stolen generations are changing and evolving, and their descendants' needs are changing too. The biggest change, of course, is that many are getting older and face new health and social challenges, including the fear of being reinstitutionalised when they go into aged care. It's important we understand those changes better so we can continue to support them. We're supporting, as I noted yesterday, the Healing Foundation to undertake a needs and demography analysis so we can get a clearer picture of what the stolen generations and their descendants require into the future.


The Closing the gap report I presented to parliament yesterday is a practical embodiment of the original apology and its promise for a better future. Great challenges remain. A person's right to shape their own identity and for that identity to be respected is absolutely central to the wellbeing of all people. The national apology recognised that indigeneity and skin colour had been used to control the lives of Indigenous people and diminish their value in society. But, as I said yesterday, we have the chance to write a new chapter of history where indigeneity is embraced, not divided; where diversity of cultures and language embodies strength; where individuals, families, governments and institutions operate in a relationship based on high expectations. Together we can build a relationship based on mutual respect and, in doing so, we'll honour the resilience and the survival of the stolen generations, who wanted nothing more than what was their right—to be cared for by their own families, brought up in their own culture and respected by their nation as equal citizens in their own country.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:07):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words. This morning in the Great Hall we paid tribute to the survivors of the stolen generation. This morning in the Great Hall we paid tribute to former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for his courage and his leadership, and he's most welcome here with Therese.


This morning in the Great Hall I shared Paul's story. In 1964, when Paul was 5½ months old, he and his mother both fell ill. His mum took him to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. Paul recovered more quickly than his mother and the authorities recommended to her that she place him at St Gabriel's Babies' Home in Balwyn until she recovered. Soon after, Paul was made a ward of the state and transferred to another institution, so when his mum came to visit him she only found an empty cot. At the age of three, Paul was placed with a family for adoption. Just after seven months, his adoptive mother complained to officials that this boy, barely three years old, was dull, unresponsive and an embarrassment at coffee parties. Paul was then sent to The Gables orphanage in Kew. He remembers being paraded in line-ups when prospective foster parents would view the children. The staff at the orphanage told foster parents not to worry about Paul's dark complexion, explaining that he could easily be mistaken for being southern European.


When he turned six, Paul was taken in by another foster family. He lived with them until he was 18. He was shunned by older siblings as not being their real brother and was bullied at school for his skin colour. Then one day soon after his 18th birthday, Paul was called to the Sunshine welfare offices to be discharged from his wardship. In the space of one 20-minute conversation he was told the following: that he was of Aboriginal descent, and that he had a mother, a father, three brothers and a sister. He was given a file full of letters, photos, and 18 birthday cards from his mother. Paul found his mother working at a hostel for Aboriginal children. She was looking after 20 kids. They had six years together before she died, aged 45. This is just two pages from the Bringing Them Home report.


At Redfern, Prime Minister Keating said that the greatest failing of non-Aboriginal Australians was that we did not stop to ask, 'How would I feel if this was done to me?' Honestly, I don't know I could answer that question. I don't know if any of the members of parliament here could. I do not know if we could imagine ourselves as boys or girls growing up adrift, isolated, bullied, ridiculed, not knowing if anyone loved me, not knowing if anyone cared and not knowing where I came from. And indeed, as a parent, I cannot imagine the horror of visiting my baby only to find an empty cot. I do not know if we would have the strength of Paul's mother to live with years of unanswered letters of desperate pleas for information to break down the faceless rock of bureaucracy. If that had all happened to me, if I'd been a parent or a child subject to these injustices, this shocking cruelty, I do not know if I could have found it in myself to accept the apology. But the survivors did, 10 years ago. They showed us a generosity and a kindness and a humanity that we never showed them. What I do know, what we know today is that saying sorry was the right thing to do, and it was the least we could do. Ten years after saying sorry, we need to know that we mean it with belated compensation for survivors, with support for the healing of their descendants, with national action to tackle the crisis of Aboriginal kids growing up in out-of-home care. We need to show that we mean it by removing the shadow and anxiety from Aboriginal parents and grandparents now that their kids could still just be taken from them. We need to show it by adopting in our hearts the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We need to show that we mean it by not turning a blind eye to those who criticise the black armband view of history, or the paternalism, or the indifference, or who use words like 'Aboriginal industry'. We need to show it by closing the gap so the next generation of Aboriginal children do not get the deal that their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents have had. This is the challenge for the whole parliament. Not just this day, every day of the year.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:13):  My question is to the Prime Minister. In 2015, the Prime Minister and I tasked the Referendum Council with consulting Indigenous Australia on their preferred form of constitutional recognition. Twelve regional dialogues and a national summit later, the Referendum Council unanimously recommended a constitutionally entrenched voice to parliament. As this is now Indigenous Australia's preferred model for constitutional change, will the Prime Minister reconsider his initial opposition to this proposal and join Labor in advancing the design of this proposal?

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:14):  We honour and respect the work of the delegates to the Uluru conference and the authors of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We honour them by speaking the truth. The honourable member opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, sat with me at a meeting of the referendum advisory council, as did other members in this House, and heard me say to them that I did not believe a national elected representative body available only to Indigenous Australians was a good idea because it was inconsistent with a fundamental principle of our democracy, which is that all of our national representative institutions are open to every Australian. That's the fundamental principle. I won't go into everything else that was said at that meeting, but honourable members here who were with me will remember there was some strong discussion about that. I also said, being frank and honest, that I thought the prospects of such an amendment to the Constitution being successful were absolutely zero. So that was the advice that I gave, and that is the view that I and the government hold today.


If the honourable member wants to campaign at the next election for there to be a constitutionally entrenched national elected representative assembly able to be voted for and occupied by only Indigenous Australians, he is free to do so. But it is not something that this side of the House will respect. We believe that all of our national institutions should be open to every single Australian, regardless of their background.


As to the cry from the heart, we feel it, we respect it and we hear it. We hear that. What we need to do is ensure, as Chris Sarra advised me several years ago, that we work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and not do things to them.



Opposition members interjecting—

Why? Whitefellas can drink and blackfellas can't. No blue card, so no job. Indigenous house builders are only 12 per cent blackfellas. Aboriginal lands are 21 per cent of Australia—no title deeds, so can't own land, so can't borrow money and so can't have an economy.

The gap that we need to close is a very, very substantial one. We know that. We had a Closing the gap report yesterday that shows that three of the targets are on track, but it says something about the challenges we face that having three out of seven on track is the best result we've had since 2011.


We are absolutely committed to ensuring that we work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. In every aspect of our policy we are doing so, I believe, more and more effectively than ever. I thank the honourable member for his observations, and we'll continue our work. I know we have a common commitment, whatever our difference may be on constitutional matters, in respect of the substantive objectives and targets covered by Closing the Gap and the additional targets that will develop out of the Closing the Gap Refresh.

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (15:14):  There is no better example of this government's unfair priorities than their defence of big business tax cuts and big insurer profits at the same time as they're making health care more expensive and less accessible for every Australian. Everywhere you turn, this government is making it harder for Australians to get the healthcare that they need: when they visit a GP, when they need to see a specialist, when they pay for private health insurance or when they need to visit an emergency department of a public hospital. In the choice between protecting the profits of big business and protecting the health of Australians, this government always puts Australians last.


And they cannot be trusted when it comes to Medicare. Who could forget the Prime Minister, the day before the last election, promising that no Australian would pay more to see a GP due to their Medicare freeze? I can't say in this place the word that I would like to say about that, but, suffice it to say, it was a gross untruth. In every state and territory, out-of-pocket costs to visit a GP have gone up and up since the election. Since the Liberals were elected in 2013, they have managed to implement their GP tax by stealth. In my home state of Victoria, patients are now paying $7.70 more out of their own pockets to see a GP than in December 2013.


The worst part is that this Prime Minister has yet to lift a single part of his Medicare freeze. The rebates for GPs, for specialists and for allied health services all remain frozen. As of today, every single part of this government's freeze on patient rebates remains—every single part of it—and we know that the freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020. After the election, the Prime Minister pretended to have listened to the people, pretended that he'd learnt his lesson. But Australians will go to the next election with parts of this government's Medicare freeze, which they rejected in 2016, still in place—proof that this government has not learnt a single thing.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Ms CATHERINE KING:
  I hear Mr Medi-no-care at the table here. Mr Medi-no-care likes to pretend that he's actually got something to say about policy. He's all politics and no substance, this Minister for Health over here, trying to pretend that he's actually done something about it.


The government has cut $2.2 billion out of Medicare. That is what this government has done. That is on top of the savings and the cuts they had already made. This $2.2 billion cut from Medicare comes out of the pockets of patients every time one of them goes to the GP, every time they visit a specialist and every time they receive Medicare allied health services. This makes health care more expensive and less accessible for all Australians. It creates additional barriers for those who rely on our healthcare system the most and it stretches our hardworking GPs to do more and more with less and less. This is this government's legacy when it comes to health care.


Of course, for many families, the big part of healthcare affordability is the impact of private health insurance. But when we have a government that cares more about protecting the profits of insurers than they do about protecting consumers then family budgets will always lose. Premiums have increased by 27 per cent since the Liberals were elected in 2013, including the rise we're about to see in April. These increases have added an average $1,000 to the annual premium health bill of Australian families and older Australians. What does the health minister do? He wants us to congratulate him for that rise! He tries to get stories up in the local newspapers about what a great job he's done increasing private health insurance premiums yet again.


We know that so many Australians are questioning the value of their private health insurance. That's why, in 2017, private hospital coverage dropped to the lowest level since 2011. At the same time as ordinary families are struggling to make ends meet, the private health insurance industry is raking in $1.8 billion in pre-tax profits. That's what the industry is getting. But, while this government won't stand up to their private health insurance mates, while they continue to put profits before patients, the status quo will not change. As an example, the government gave the insurers more than $1 billion in savings, and they have still hit the Australian public with an increase that is twice CPI—and you think that is good enough.


Labor knows that the status quo is not acceptable. Something must be done to shift the balance back to consumers. That's why we're acting to make private health insurance fairer and more affordable. The minister says, 'We've really got them with us.' We don't want the private health insurers with us on this. We're actually on the side of the consumers. You're making it clear. You're backing the insurers; we're backing the Australian people every single day. That's why we're acting to make private health insurance fairer. 


We will deliver cost-of-living relief to 13 million Australians through capping private health insurance premiums to two per cent a year for the first two years after we're elected and task the Productivity Commission with the biggest review of the industry in 20 years. Labor will deliver, to 1.7 million Australian families, an average saving of $340 to the family budget. 


For years and years, Australians have seen their private health insurance premiums soar and the value of their private health insurance plummet. Private health insurance is no good if you can't use it when you need it most. However, under this government, we have seen people hit with increased out-of-pocket costs and gap payments. Ten years ago only 8.6 per cent of health insurance policies contained exclusions; today it's 40 per cent. Australians are paying a lot more for their health insurance policies and getting a lot less.


The best examples of the need for action on this come from our constituents, who we know are battling with pressures around the family budget and seeing firsthand the impact of this crisis. Alison, a mum from Mackay, wrote to me saying she'd cancelled her private health insurance, a family policy with Medibank Private, because she no longer sees the value in having private health insurance. She says, 'It's time the Australian government got together with insurance providers to review the whole private health insurance industry and come up with a system that provides more value to Australians.' 


We are not apologising at all for our policies, because we have put consumers at the heart of our policies. You have put the private health insurance profits at the heart of yours. Of course, this government's approach of putting health and patients last wouldn't be complete without their appalling treatment of our public hospitals. Last week, we saw the government's secret plan to lock in seven years of public hospital cuts. It is an insult to Australian patients and more proof that this government cares more about defending a big-business tax cut than properly funding this nation's health system. 


Elective surgery waiting times under this Prime Minister are the worst since records have been kept. Patients presenting to emergency departments requiring urgent medical attention are being left for longer, with only 66 per cent of urgent emergency department patients in 2016-17 seen within the recommended 30 minutes—another consecutive decline under this government. More than 50 per cent of public hospital doctors are working unsafe hours that put them at significant risk of fatigue, including 75 per cent of intensive care specialists, with the AMA saying the strain and the pressure on our public hospitals is having a detrimental impact on the health of their doctors. 


The government is so out of touch that it claims that, by keeping the status quo when it comes to hospital funding and doing the minimal that they have to do in order to skate their way through what is a very, very significant policy area—the funding of our public hospitals—is a very generous offer. Whether it is cutting Medicare, cutting funding to public hospitals or failing to stand up to the big-profit health insurers, wherever you turn, this government cannot be trusted on health. They cannot be trusted. 


Out-of-pocket costs to see a GP have never been higher. The Prime Minister has not dropped a single part of their freeze. The fact is that this government does not think that investing in the health of Australians is more important than investing in big business and giving them a tax handout. This government and this minister care nothing about Medicare. (Time expired)

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (15:24):  This government has delivered the lowest premium rise in 17 years in private health, lower than every single year under Labor. Labor's average rise is 40 per cent higher than has occurred this year. They know—look at them. They see six per cent, 5.8 per cent, 5.6 per cent, 5.1 per cent, 5.6 per cent and 6.2 per cent as opposed to the 3.95 per cent that we've just delivered. Those are the actual rises, the actual premiums; the realities that consumers faced.


In the last year, we have embarked upon the biggest reform in private health insurance in a decade and it delivers the lowest changes in 17 years. But let us understand this: what they said last time they went into government was that they weren't going to touch private health insurance. They were not going to go near it. The then shadow minister, the member for Gellibrand, said on many occasions, for many months: 'Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we're committed to retaining all of the private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate.' Then they axed it. Then they cut $4 billion from private health. They lied. They deceived. They told untruths. They misled the Australian public. What did the member for Sydney, the current Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, say after they left government? 'How did I pay for it? I paid for it by targeting private health insurance.' You won't hear a clearer example of (a) hypocrisy, (b) dishonesty and (c) sheer hatred for private health insurance. They slashed the rebate and this time they will slash the rebate again.


All of this came about because the Leader of the Opposition, trying to be very smart, made a disastrous speech to the Press Club. In that speech, he sort of hinted that the private health insurance rebate might go. He had to walk back from that by breakfast the next morning, appearing on breakfast TV to say, 'We won't abolish it,' but he left open the potential and the plan to slash it. But, more than that, irrespective of what they do to the rebate, as they did last time, they also want to rip away the lowest cost premiums from those who are least capable of affording private health. They would take away what the rest of the industry calls 'basic'. If you've just reconfirmed that you want to get rid of basic policies, you've committed to a 16 per cent increase—




Ms Catherine King interjecting
—





Mr HUNT:
  He just did. And, no, it's not. It's a 16 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums. Let us understand this: Labor have a plan, a proposal, an intention, a commitment to a 16 per cent increase in private health insurance premiums. That's what they did last time: they took an axe to the rebate. That's what they will do next time: take an axe to the rebate and put in place a 16 per cent rise in private health insurance. You may value private health insurance. Labor have never had a belief in it. They don't support it. They haven't supported it. The member for Sydney made it absolutely clear that she was proud of 'targeting' private health insurance.


There is the current policy—the disaster; the thought bubble. I didn't use those words myself. There is somebody called Mark Fitzgibbon, well known to the member for Hunter as his brother and also the head of NIB. What did he say? He described it as a 'thought bubble'. Most interestingly, the day before the private health insurers were informed of this, the member for Ballarat met with them and she told them there were no secret plans to cap private health. She told them—



Ms Catherine King interjecting—




Mr HUNT:
  Yes, I was, effectively—'There are no secret plans to cap private health.' Twenty-four hours later, she had to ring around and apologise, 'I'm sorry. It's not me. I know I said this yesterday.' This is one of the great humiliations for somebody who seeks to be the health minister of this country. Trust with that sector has been eroded. She knows and we know that this was a last-second attempt to fix up a disastrous Press Club speech. What has been the response? Forget us. Forget the major health insurers. This is what the CEO of the Teachers Union Health Fund, only last week, said:


To continue to make the products affordable and so the 2 per cent can be accommodated, insurers might reduce benefits for certain procedures or restrict them ...


Insurers would reduce benefits. In other words, gaps would go up, there would be a reduced number of procedures and choice would go down. Gaps up; choice down. What an assault on the health system in Australia—the very thing that they seek to support; the very thing that they pretend matters to them: lower out-of-pocket costs and better choice for consumers. They would take an axe to both of them.


This isn't just a bad policy; this is a disastrous policy, because it would drive people off private health insurance and therefore drive up public hospital waiting lists. It is very rare that you see the capacity to do damage to everybody with a policy but, on this occasion, the Leader of the Opposition's last-minute thought bubble and last-minute attempt to recover from a disastrous speech to the Press Club is dangerous policy that would have catastrophic impacts on public health, on private health and for patients. The people who would most suffer are the lowest income earners—the pensioners who are struggling to meet their payments. This is why we've embarked on the biggest reform in a decade, and we still have a lot more to do. They are the ones who will be most likely to need private health as they are older and they are the ones who therefore will be most likely to have higher out-of-pocket costs. This is an attack on the health and security of our pensioners and our seniors, and it is an extraordinary moment of policy failure on behalf of the Labor Party.


Then we go on to public hospitals. What we've seen is a $30 billion increase from $98 billion to $128 billion in what's being offered over the new five-year period as opposed to the current five-year period. What we see is an extraordinary increase already signed onto by Western Australian Labor. The Western Australian Labor government has signed onto this. The New South Wales government has signed onto it. After all the criticism, Queensland made it clear, Victoria also opened the door and we know that the ACT and the Northern Territory are on the way. This is what we see, despite those opposite calling around, trying to tell their Labor mates, 'Please, don't sign up.' What sort of parliamentarians are you when you try to stop a national deal by calling around state leaders? What sort of people are you when you do that? Despite that, we've seen that this has landed in an extraordinarily positive place and will deliver $30 billion of additional funding.


Labor, prior to the last election, liked to hint that they were going to add $57 billion. How much did they actually turn up with? They turned up with $2 billion. That represents four per cent of their pledged and promised initiatives—a 96 per cent failure rate. Anywhere else, that's a fail. But, I tell you what, these people don't even stack up in their wildest fantasies to our reality. Since the Prime Minister's agreement, there's been a $7.7 billion increase in public hospital funding under this government, and that's before you get to a $30 billion increase, from $98 billion to $128 billion. Those are the facts. They are the realities. Most significantly, when you go to what it means to patient care, we've also seen record bulk-billing numbers. Bulk-billing represents people being able to go to the doctor without having to pay, without having to put their hand in their pocket. We are up to 85.9 per cent. That is 3.2 per cent higher as a percentage of the population than it was when Labor left government.


What we see is increased hospital funding, record bulk-billing rates and the lowest private health insurance premium rate in 17 years. It is worth recalling Labor's private health insurance cost hikes of 5.8, 5.6, 5.1, 5.6 and 6.2 per cent. At the same time, they slashed the rebate. In the end, we believe in the public hospital system and we believe in Medicare. We've backed it with the reality of Medicare funding going from $23 billion to $24 billion to $26 billion to $28 billion. We've backed it with a $30 billion increase in public hospital funding. We've backed it with record bulk-billing rates, and we've backed it with the once-in-a-decade reforms that have delivered the lowest private health insurance changes in 17 years. We will protect private health from the acts and the price hikes on the other side. (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:34): I've just listened listen to the Minister for Health and I'm not surprised at all, after listening to his rebuttal of our MPI today, why people in my community—and, I suspect, across Australia—are simply not convinced by his rhetoric.


When I ask people what matters most to them come election time, inevitably, the first two issues that come front and centre of mind are health and education. On both matters, this government, the Turnbull government, has proven to be shifty time and time again, and voters can see through it. We saw that trickery again last Friday when the government tried to lock in seven years of hospital funding cuts to the states by pretending to offer them a few more dollars on top of the $50 billion that was cut in 2013 to make out that it's doing something. The smart premiers could see straight through it. I'm pleased that the Premier of South Australia is not prepared to accept less money for people in South Australia than was otherwise coming to South Australia had this government honoured the agreement and funding deal that we all expected.


The hospital funding cuts come at a time when hospitals across Australia are struggling to meet the service levels that are imposed upon them—service levels which come onto hospitals and, in particular, the outpatient service because people simply cannot afford to go to their GPs. In turn, because people can't afford to go to their GPs because the costs have increased as a result of this government's policies, they turn up at the outpatient's department and therefore there are waiting lists and queues there for people to get treatment.


I want to talk briefly about private health insurance, because the minister made a strong rebuttal of our claim that he has mismanaged that area of public health policy. Private health insurance has gone up 27 per cent during the time of this government, at a time when the CPI cost of living has been less than 10 per cent. It's almost three times more. The truth of the matter is that the private health insurance industry has been making good profits—$1.8 billion last year, with some of the companies making around 20 per cent on their money. As the member for Ballarat has quite rightly pointed out, when you look at the service that has been provided under those policies, 40 per cent of the policies today have exclusions compared to fewer than nine per cent only 10 years ago. So, consumers are not getting value for money because of this government's very policies.


I want to quote one example of a constituent who wrote to me in the last two weeks. She is a person who has been on a disability pension for 24 years and attends a private dialysis clinic every week. She does that in order to save the public health costs. She is a private health insurance patient on a pension writing to me because the pension increase is in no way keeping up with the increase in the cost of her private health insurance and she is now struggling. This is a person who doesn't have a lot of choice in life.


It goes a lot further than that. Today we acknowledge the 10th anniversary of the national apology. I say that because Indigenous life expectancy across Australia is some 10 years or more less than for most Australians. We know that people in the country, whether or not they're Indigenous, generally suffer from worse health than people in the cities. Given that some 500,000 Indigenous people live in the country, the situation is much more dire. The new president of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia said: 'The Medicare freeze has done some real damage to rural doctors'—this was said by the RDAA president only a couple of hours ago in this place. It highlights how out of touch this government is with respect to the hurt and pain it is inflicting on communities and the profession itself.


The reality is that out-of-pocket costs have gone up, and that in turn has pushed people into the public hospitals or caused people to simply not go to their doctor for themselves or their children when they should. That in turn means that, ultimately, the costs of the illness are going to increase because the illness will only get worse. 


This is a government that not only is out of touch because it's got its priorities wrong—giving money to big business when health and education are being pushed to one side—but truly doesn't get that health care in this country is more expensive and less accessible because of its policies.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:39):  It's always a pleasure to engage in this 4 pm frolic where Labor desperately tries to get the topic of discussion away from jobs and the economy and back onto health care in the desperate hope that the Medi-flop campaign can be extended into another election term.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr LAMING:
  For those who are barking over on the other side, the great frustration is that none of them have any economic training. When you don't have an understanding of health economics, home-spun wisdoms like capping insurance premiums seem like an awfully good idea. When you're sitting around a table at a Chinese restaurant table, capping insurance premiums at two per cent would be a fabulous idea—except that no-one has ever done it because they know it doesn't work. Of course, there's only one person over there with any economic training, but the Labor Party doesn't listen to the member for Fenner. They don't even listen to the one individual over there with some health experience. They don't listen to the member for Macarthur, who has had a genuine career in health. Actually walking down a hospital corridor is some basic prerequisite for knowing something about the health system—but you don't listen to him. His extension in the building is 2311. Just phone the guy and ask him: 'Is this a great idea?'


Maybe we should cap home insurance. Maybe we should cap car insurance. There is a very good reason that we don't do it—it has unintended second-round affects and it leads to insurers doing really bad things like not properly covering their customer base, cutting back on what they cover and ultimately damaging the people seeking insurance. When you live in the Labor world of insurance, where insurers are enemies, private health providers are enemies and we've got to slice into the premium and do it by capping, that's precisely what happens. What happens is what we have seen before when you allow the market to not be able to set that rate rise and you just pluck two per cent out of the air. Insurers game the system in a desperate way to survive and the poorest and most vulnerable miss out. On the other hand, health inflation—something those on the other side of the chamber do not understand—runs at 7.5 per cent. If you can get your increases down under that, that is in fact a victory. This government has done that—for the first time getting it well under that mark. When you get it down to 3.95 per cent, covering half of Australia's population, that's a victory.


Where does two per cent come from? It's not derived from the market; it's plucked out of thin air. When every insurer in the country tells you that that would be damn stupid, there must be something in it. They actually live in the health sector. They actually walk the corridors. They know how hospitals work. Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, the most the collective over there know about the health system is when the visiting hours are at the local public hospital. None of these guys over there have ever walked the corridors of a hospital or popped a stethoscope around their neck. They just invented a two per cent PHI increase and wonder why—



Ms Catherine King interjecting—




Mr LAMING:
  When you see that big fat attractive button and you're advised to maybe not do it, the Labor Party will just press that button and see what happens—because there's no understanding of community rating and no understanding of lifetime health cover. This is a party that simply doesn't understand exclusions. When they see an exclusion of a primary healthcare product, they go, 'This patient's not getting any value for money'. That's fine, put the cover back on the patients that don't want the cover, push up their premiums and see how they feel. Exclusions are there for a good reason, but those opposite don't understand choice and don't understand why exclusions are there. If you want to exclude an extra, every Australian deserves the right to do that.


The Labor Party is a party that doesn't understand insurance economics at all. You've got the member for Fenner who could explain it and you don't even promote the guy or pay him for his Harvard-level expertise. You have one person with health experience over there, and the phone doesn't ring at 2311. That could have saved you this mortal embarrassment, shadow spokesperson, between now and the next election. The people the Labor Party are trying to lure and seduce, the people they are trying to pick up with their ridiculous health non-economics and language of cuts—when in fact health funding is increasing—do not trust the Labor Party. If it comes to whipping up a union rally, trust those people; they are great at that. Those opposite have zero expertise in health, but they're great with a scare campaign. The very people that the Labor Party are trying to seduce and induce to follow them will not fall for it, because they understand that this is a party with no understanding of private health insurance.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (15:44):  Being lectured to by members from the Medi-no-care team opposite about a lack of understanding or empathy in the Australian healthcare system is extraordinary. It's a little bit rich. I see the member for Bowman is leaving the chamber now. Oh, no; we welcome his return—thank you very much. He had much to say, but his complete lack of understanding for cost-of-living pressures on the Australian people, his lack of understanding for the amount of work and competency levels on this side of the House, when it comes to the Australian healthcare system, is extraordinary. This is the party that created Medicare. It's the only party that protects Medicare in this House. It's the party that will defend Medicare until our dying days. So, thank you, Minister—sorry, you aren't a minister. 




Mr Laming:
  I'm a recovering minister.




Ms CLAYDON:
  Why aren't you a minister? That's possibly another question, but I'll come back to that! Members on this side of the House understand clearly why it is that this government can't be trusted with Australia's healthcare system—but so do the Australian people. They are totally onto you guys. 


As part of the Medicare task force, the member for Macarthur and I have travelled far and wide across Australia. We've heard from people in Braddon who cannot access affordable health care in their electorate. They can't find a specialist. Talking about out-of-pocket expenses, try being somebody living in Braddon, with no access to specialist care—the closest one is in Melbourne—and being told to fly yourself and your family up to Melbourne, to put yourselves up for the night, to take the family with you, to take days off from your job. These guys here think that's okay. They think that this is an acceptable state of affairs for health care in Australia. There is nothing acceptable about subjecting your citizens to second-rate health care. 


It's all right if you're living on the North Shore of Sydney. There are plenty of bulk-billing doctors there. Come over to my electorate in Newcastle. You don't get a bulk-billing doctor there. We have the member for Herbert and the member for Longman—plenty of people on this side of the House—who are fierce advocates for the retention of a universal healthcare system in this country. Their electorates are hurting badly because the guys opposite have not lifted a single component of that Medicare freeze to relieve the burden on Australian consumers. 




Ms Lamb:
  40,000 people at Caboolture Hospital!




Ms CLAYDON:
  Yes; 40,000 people at Caboolture Hospital. We also visited the electorate of Lindsay—and the member for Macarthur will remember this well—where the Nepean Hospital is crying out for support and assistance. You haven't even begun to assist with the forward planning for a hospital that is in a rapid growth corridor there. It is already stretched to the limit right now. It can barely cope with the ongoing demand now. It's in the middle of a growth corridor, yet there's absolutely no assistance there. 


Your lack of vision, your lack of planning, for public hospitals in Australia is astonishing. Nepean Hospital isn't exceptional. That's the sad story. What's going on at that hospital is being repeated across Australia. Our major public hospitals are stretched to the absolute brink. Elective surgery waiting times have skyrocketed. Emergency departments are struggling and, worst of all, patients are suffering. We know that because we are actually out there talking to people who use this healthcare system every day, and for members opposite to suggest otherwise is truly astonishing. What a hide! 


When it comes to private health insurance, we can only say that members opposite must live in some other, parallel, universe. If you are not getting the message that the Australian people do not see value for money in private health insurance these days, if you are not hearing the message that they are finding it very difficult to accommodate the almost $1,000 per annum increase in premium fees that has come in under the Abbott-Turnbull government's watch— if you are not getting that message—then you need to see your GP for an ear check, quite frankly. That's what you need. It is only Labor that will defend Medicare. It is only Labor that can be trusted to achieve an Australian healthcare system that is fair and accessible to all.

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (15:49):  Today's matter of public importance is yet another example of an attempt by those opposite to mislead the Australian public on health care. But the figures speak for themselves. The Turnbull government's policies are having a real and tangible impact on the cost and accessibility of health care for each and every Australian.


I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the Minister for Health for his incredible commitment and hard work in this area, which is making a positive difference for the residents of my electorate of Boothby and for all South Australians—for my home state of South Australia. Under the Turnbull government, we have achieved record bulk-billing rates by GPs of 85.9 per cent. This means that residents in my electorate of Boothby can visit their doctor without any out-of-pocket costs. This is thanks to the introduction of an additional 22,000 GP services in my electorate alone. In addition, the coalition government has added more than 1,500 new and amended medicines, worth $7.5 billion, to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which means greater access to medicines for those who need them most.


We are tackling serious and common health problems in our society. We recognise that one in five Australians experience mental health problems each year, and so we are increasing mental health funding to around $4.3 billion this year. We have also committed more than $685 million over four years to reduce the impact of drug and alcohol abuse, which, unfortunately, has reached epidemic levels in some areas of my home state of South Australia.


Federal funding for public hospital services under the coalition has increased from $13.8 billion in 2013-14, at the end of the failed Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, to a record $22.7 billion in the years 2020-21 under the Turnbull government. This is a 64 per cent increase in funding. This means more doctors, more nurses, more surgeries and less wait times in hospitals across Australia, but particularly in my electorate of Boothby, at Flinders Medical Centre, which is in Bedford Park in the heart of my electorate.


Just last week, the Minister for Health announced record funding for hospital services at COAG. The minister committed to providing an additional $30 billion for public hospitals, which will provide almost $128 billion over the five years from 2020. But apparently this wasn't enough for the Premier of South Australia. So I just want to touch on what the Weatherill state Labor government has done, in contrast to the Turnbull government.


The Weatherill Labor government in South Australia cut funding to the health budget. They cut funding in South Australia by $7.4 million for our hospitals between 2015-16 and 2016-17, and they cut $20 million of funding for hospitals between 2014 and 2016.


We know where some of these cuts came from—and I know all too well, because they shut down the repat hospital in my electorate. This iconic hospital, which was purpose-built for our returned service men and women, which has been a wonderful community hospital as well for so many of my residents and their families, has been shut down by the Weatherill Labor government. It is truly one of the most disgraceful decisions the Weatherill Labor government has made, and it has contributed to the loss of 160 hospital beds in southern Adelaide. This affects each and every one of my residents in Boothby and their families.


In contrast, the coalition government is not just funding bulk-billing and the PBS and hospitals and mental health services; we are also funding medical research and treatment. We're funding the Southern Hemisphere's first proton therapy research centre, with cutting-edge cancer treatment that has the ability to deliver precise radiation to destroy tumour targets and save organs. We're funding 17 separate grants and scholarships worth $21 million in my electorate of Boothby for medical research to address key national health priorities, such as the devastating eye disease glaucoma which affects more than 300,000 Australians.


I'm very proud to have worked with the Minister for Health and the member for Forrest, in Canberra, to recognise and respond to the challenges faced by the one in 10 women who suffer from endometriosis. It's a terrible disease that for too long women have suffered from in silence, and I'm so proud that we're developing a national action plan and funding research into this. It's policies like these that make a real difference to peoples' lives—policies that this government is funding and delivering. (Time expired)

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (15:54):  I thank the member on the other side for mentioning my name. I don't know why he's obsessed with me but it's probably just—




Mr Laundy:
  We like anyone from the Western suburbs! 




Dr FREELANDER:
  Me too. I thank the member for Ballarat for her matter of public importance and it is really something that's very important to me and it's been the basis of my career. The real problem is that the Liberal-National Party does not understand health care. It's a fundamental failing over decades. They have done some good things in health, I don't deny it, but their understanding of the system and what we should be doing in health care in Australia is sadly deficient. 


The growing issue of accessibility to care and to our healthcare system and the inability to change what appears, to me, to be a descent into a two-tiered American-style health system is something I see as a great tragedy in Australia and one of the main reasons I came into this place. For many years the gap in health care has been widening between those who can afford it and those who can't afford it. We're entering a system that Medicare was designed to avoid, and now it's really your credit card that determines the quality of health care you can get in Australia. This government doesn't seem to bat an eyelid at this. 


We're now seeing the continuation of the Medicare freeze with rebates for GPs, specialists and allied healthcare services all continuing to be frozen. Today we heard from the Rural Doctors Association of Australia that this is having a real effect on the health care that they can provide to rural Australians and their ability to attract doctors and allied health professionals to the bush. Rural doctors are struggling to maintain bulk-billing because of increasing costs, yet this government is doing very little. We're seeing waiting times for elective surgery in my electorate increase—waiting times for things like cataract surgery are now over one year. Someone who's going blind from cataracts has to wait over a year to get proper treatment. People who can afford it can get treatment within a week. It's a shame. This government does not understand that the more money you cut from preventive health care, the more you spend on repairing the long-term damage. 


The government is more than happy to allow private healthcare providers to consistently increase their fees without adequate reasons and without adequately understanding the lack of transparency and the poor services offered by private health insurance. Private health insurance costs have increased by 27 per cent in the last five years, and the government is set to increase the costs even further, while delivering tax cuts for big business. We now see people—and I've had personal experiences—put off visits to specialists and subspecialists. To see a cardiologist and get an ECG and a cardiac ultrasound, the gap can be up to $500 for some people, and for many pensioners this is beyond their means. We're now seeing that sickness and lack of healthcare insurance was the primary cause of non-business-related personal insolvency in 2016-17. It's an absolute shame. 


This government doesn't seem to worry about the stagnation in personal incomes, yet it allows continued increases in private health insurance. Not only has the wages share fallen to an all-time low, but the profit share of private health insurers has climbed to an all-time high. Yet that doesn't seem to be a problem. 


There are a couple of things I'd like to mention quickly. This government does not understand health care. At the beginning of this parliament they sold off Australia's central cancer registry. We know that data in health care is the new gold, and yet the government sold it off without any transparency and without adequately informing the parliament. 


I have letters from many people, including one of my colleagues. One colleague has written to me today, saying: 'There's a crisis in accessing allergy treatments in our public hospital system'—a crisis, and yet this government ignores it. The primary problem is that the National-Liberal government does not understand health care. It is a great shame. It is increasing the costs for all Australians. (Time expired)

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (15:59):  I sometimes think those opposite are living in a parallel universe. Yesterday I made some comments in this House that upset some people—that if a lie is repeated often enough people start to believe it. That's what is happening from that side of the chamber. It is a fact that the federal government is creating a new record for health spending every year—a new record every year! A new record is not a decrease in funding; it is an increase in funding. The member for Ballarat and the member for Macarthur, who's just leaving the chamber, rattled on about the Medicare freeze. I think it was called the government's Medicare freeze. Those of us who've been around a little while will well remember that it was the opposition's; it was the Labor Party's Medicare freeze. They say that we wouldn't have continued it, but they did not allow for it in their forward estimates in their budgets in 2013. No kind of alteration to the Medicare freeze was to be seen over the next four years. This government has moved to end the Medicare freeze. It'll end on 1 July.


I'll touch on bulk-billing here, because this is related to the Medicare freeze. I took some flak at the last election from some doctors within my electorate who were talking about how the Medicare freeze was affecting them. But the counterargument always is that the bulk-billing rate keeps rising—82.2 per cent when we came into government and 85.9 per cent now. In fact, in my electorate it's 86.4 per cent. So, 86.4 per cent of the consults that GPs are dealing with in my electorate are at no cost to the consumer, because they're bulk-billed. You can't just wash that away. Yes, the government has heard the doctors' calls, and we are lifting the freeze. I think a bit of credit should be given for the way this has been handled.


In South Australia, since this government came to power the coalition has increased hospital funding every year. In fact, in the last Labor budget—the last budget of the member for Lilley—it fell. Commonwealth support for hospitals in South Australia fell by 0.5 per cent. Since then, it has risen by 31.6 per cent through to this year, with another 8.6 per cent to come over the next two years. In total, there has been an increase of a little over 47 per cent since this government came to power. A 47 per cent increase is not a cut. It is not a devaluation. It is well in front of the CPI. It's in front of health CPI. This is a significant increase—a significant increase!—in funding. Strangely enough, it seems that our premier thinks he's awash with money, because he's knocked back another $1½ billion that was offered by the federal government.


We know why. Things get a little bit funny around here when there's a state election. We know why. It's because it has become Premier Weatherill's MO to blame the Commonwealth for everything he has mismanaged within the state, whether it be electricity or whether it be schools funding. We're reaching record levels there, and apparently the Commonwealth has somehow sinned. He goes on to blame the Commonwealth for things he has mismanaged. So he's spoiling for a fight with the Commonwealth right now. He's spoiling for a fight over hospital funding, but he's got no grounds on which to make that fight, because the minister has offered an extra $1½ billion. That's what he's knocking back. It should be exposed for what it is.


We know what they're doing to hospitals on my patch, in the electorate of Grey. I've been to a number of public crisis meetings in Quorn, Yorketown and Jamestown, where the state government is no longer investing in small rural hospitals. They say, 'No, we don't withdraw services,' but they will not invest in their operating theatres and they will not invest in their sterilising equipment. When it's no longer up to scratch, they say, 'Well, we can't continue that service in your hospital, because your equipment is not up to scratch.' It is the long-term plan to disinvest in these rural hospitals so that they can shunt the people out of them—close them down in the communities. They don't believe in rural South Australia. They should be exposed for it.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (16:05):  Like my fellow members who have spoken before me, I am proud to stand in this place as a member of the Labor Party to defend the Australian healthcare system from this Liberal-National government. We are the party of Medicare and we always will be. Unlike the rabble on the other side of the chamber, who attack Medicare and who fail to care for our public health system, you can rest assured that the Labor Party always will care for our public health system. Make no mistake, our healthcare system is under attack. Every day, more and more Australians are feeling the pain as they continue to take out their wallets again and again to cover the increasing costs of keeping themselves healthy, fit and active.


This government, despite the Prime Minister's insistence on using a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer, is smashing the institutions that have become the bedrock of the high living standards that we are fortunate enough to enjoy in this country. Let us go through some of the issues the Turnbull government has failed to address. The out-of-pocket costs to see a GP have never been higher. Since the Liberals came to power in 2013, and until last year, Australians have seen out-of-pocket costs soar from over $28 per visit in 2013 to over $35 in 2017. That's a lift of over $7, and that's still rising. In WA alone, costs have increased from nearly $31 in 2013 to nearly $38 in 2017. Some may scoff—'What's $7, anyway?' Tell that to some of the elderly residents in my electorate. They need constant care and check-ups, on a tiny pension that barely covers rent, electricity and all of their medical fees. Tell that to single parents on Newstart or disability support who are trying to care for their sick children at the same time as putting them through school. This government has no plan and it simply cannot be trusted on health and health care.


Australians needing elective surgery have had their waiting list times blown out. Emergency departments and hospitals around the country are bursting at the seams and health professionals are stretched to do more and more with less and less because of the Liberals cuts and their empty promises. If you need more proof, let's take a look at Medicare. The Prime Minister is still yet to remove a single part of his Medicare freeze. Rebates for GPs, specialists and allied health services all remain frozen. We are told that the freeze will be lifted in 2020—well, I certainly wouldn't hold my breath on that. As a result of the continued freeze, the Prime Minister is using a chainsaw to cut $2.2 billion out of Medicare on top of the savings he has already listed. This is a collective $2.2 billion out of the pockets of patients every time they visit a GP, visit a specialist or receive a Medicare allied health service. I, too, heard the rural doctors today tell members, many of us in the House from this side of parliament and from the other, how failing to lift the GP Medicare freeze has greatly affected access to basic healthcare in rural areas—and we have the Nationals here, who pretend to care for those in regional and remote areas.


Let's look at the Liberals' record on private health for a moment. Let's face it, everyone in this place and around the rest of the country knows that this government would rather protect the profits and corporate interests of the private health insurers rather than going in to bat for Australian consumers. They'd rather protect the $1.8 billion of pretax profit for private health insurers than help Australian consumers. The Public Health Association of Australia have said as much:


Scare tactics by the Private Health Insurance industry … should not be surprising. However, they should be rejected out-of-hand. The focus of this industry is on profits and return to shareholders rather than the health of all Australians …


I think that sums up this government's position. Premiums are on the rise. Since the end of 2013, when the Liberals were elected, premiums have risen a whopping 27 per cent, including the rise that's due this year, adding up to an average increase of $1,000 to the private health bill of Australian families.


Just as this government fails to do anything about housing affordability, they are making the same mistakes with private health. I will reflect on health for a moment. We all know that housing is critical to health. At a time when we reflect, all of this week and last week, on our collective failure at closing the gap between our first nation people, and also reflect on the health effects that the stolen generation have suffered, this government has cut funding to the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing.




Ms Keay:
  Shame!




Ms MADELEINE KING:
  It is a shame. This means that remote communities, Indigenous communities, across the remote parts of this country, in northern Australia, north-west Australia, northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, will be without adequate housing. How can people be healthy when they're homeless? Under Labor, we will keep Medicare and reverse the damage done to it by the government. We'll put money back into the hospital system and keep waiting times down. Labor is the only party you can trust on health care.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (16:10):  I'm pretty easy to get along with most of the time, but the talking points a couple of members on the other side have been given are quite deceptive. One spoke of the increases in doctors' fees, quoting the amounts but forgetting that the rebate is above the quoted fee. So, with bulk-billing, the people actually get their money back. Australians are the beneficiaries of huge investments by our government. How else is it that bulk-billing rates have increased so much, with the rate now at 85.9 per cent, compared with Labor's level of 82.2 per cent? There have been millions of dollars of bulk-billing for GP visits and specialist visits, especially in the regions.


We plan to invest an extra $2.8 billion in Medicare over the next four years. Labor say we're going to reduce the private healthcare costs by putting caps in place. I don't get it. That simply isn't going to happen. If the private healthcare people can't put their fees up, there will be fewer services. It's kind of logical. Labor say they'll save Australian families around $340 a year with such a cap, but most people seem to think that around a dollar a day is worth investing in their own health. They absolutely do. It's not the full amount, of course. It is the difference in the proposed increase to the one Labor suggest. It is really laughable. Labor never managed to keep the increases so low. Each and every year they were in government, the cost increased more than the 26 per cent in total that we're supposed to have had.


One of the incentives to be reviewed by Labor is the rebate, but we really need to get people to seriously consider hospital and extras cover. There is constant criticism of profit making. No matter what it relates to, it is seen as a problem for Labor. But while they whinge about private health insurance company profits, AHPRA has stated this is not a relevant factor. Higher claims costs are the driver of increased premiums, not profit levels. Do we really want longer waiting times in public hospitals while private beds are vacant? It's absolutely ridiculous. In addition, the private health insurers have come to the negotiating table and now there's encouragement for young Australians to take up insurance with a discount for 18- to 29-year-olds of up to 10 per cent on their premiums. That is better cover for mental health. There's provision for travel and accommodation. Comparing one fund against another will be much easier by having standardised definitions of gold, silver, bronze or basic. That will definitely help consumers. Small health insurers do not have massive profits, yet they are determined to provide as much assistance as possible.


The premise of today's question was related to making health care less affordable and accessible. We've increased hospital funding from $13.8 billion back in 2013-14 up to $22.7 billion proposed in the 2020-21 year. That's a huge increase. But, most importantly, ask any of the families who have a child with type 1 diabetes how their lives have changed because of this government's investment in constant glucose monitoring devices. Ask the families of those affected with multiple sclerosis now that Ocrevus is on script, saving them $35,000 a course. Ask those patients suffering multiple myeloma getting carfilzomib on script, saving $38,500. How about those families with leukaemia who can now get Imbruvica on script instead of $180,000 per course? There are 920 such families. Ask the cancer patients who have positive non-small-lung cancer and it metastasises or who have renal cell carcinoma. Each one of those are getting cancer treatments on script. I personally am proud of these financial allocations for these afflicted families.


Finally, some of the Labor representatives are calling out the lack of vision and planning for new hospitals. Last time I read the rules, the state and territory governments were responsible for that—the planning, the siting, the building, the staffing and the maintenance. The contribution of the federal government is determined by the hospital funding agreement reached at COAG, when they all sit around the table and do a bit of argy-bargy about who does what. But they build them; they look after them. 


This financial year alone we are increasing funding so much and making such a big difference. Over the next five years we'll be investing more than $103.1 billion. In anybody's book, even if you're not too sure about where billions are sitting amongst millions and trillions, billions are a huge amount of money. We're doing well.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:36):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: report 2 of 2018.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr GOODENOUGH:
  by leave—The role of the committee is to examine the bills and legislative instruments for compatibility with Australia's obligations under international human rights law. The committee's report provides parliament with credible technical examination of the human rights implications of legislation and other instruments, other than an assessment of the broader policy involved.


The committee members performing a scrutiny function are not bound by the contents or conclusions of scrutiny committee reports and may have different views in relation to the policy merits of the legislation. Of the new bills in the current report, nine were assessed as either promoting human rights, permissibly limiting human rights or not engaging human rights. The committee is seeking further information in relation to one bill, the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017, and has provided an advice-only comment in relation to one legislative instrument.


The report also contains the committee's concluded examination of six bills and instruments. In relation to the ASIC Credit (Flexible Credit Cost Arrangements) Instrument, the initial assessment identified concerns as to whether the civil penalty provisions in the instrument may be considered to be criminal in nature for the purposes of international human rights law. However, following the provision of further information from the assistant minister, it was established that the penalty applied in a specified regulatory context and not to the public in general. The committee has therefore been able to conclude that the penalty is unlikely to be considered criminal for the purposes of international human rights law.


Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome Senator Lucy Gichuhi as the new committee member, replacing Senator Linda Reynolds. I would also like to thank Senator Reynolds for her service to the committee in its key functions of undertaking non-partisan technical assessments of legislation under Australia's international human rights obligations. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of the proposed legislation.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (16:39):  I continue the remarks I was making earlier. The Great Barrier Reef is under pressure from every side: from the west, in terms of land clearing in Queensland and the impact of sediment and chemical run-off; from the east, in terms of the protections for the Coral Sea which have been removed; and from above, with respect to the treatment of the atmosphere, whether it be through the impacts of climate change—changing ocean temperatures, coral bleaching and the increased intensity of major weather events—or the mere content of the atmosphere itself, with the increase in carbon dioxide having the impact of acidification in the ocean, with an increase in carbonic acid, which then slows the growth rate of the various species of coral. This bill, though, deals principally with the management of the reef itself. About 33 per cent of the marine park is a marine national park, a highly protected area.


I'd like to pay tribute to some changes made by the Howard government with respect to the Great Barrier Reef. In doing so, I'd like to remind those opposite of the legacy of their own party and simply ask that they bear it in mind when considering where they go on the network of marine parks within Australia's EEZ that are currently under consideration. The marine parks were put in place under the Howard government in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Thirty-three per cent is highly protected—no take at all. In terms of impact on recreational fishing, you are much more likely to be a recreational fisher who goes to the Great Barrier Reef than a recreational fisher who goes to the Coral Sea, for the simple fact that if you take your tinnie out to the Great Barrier Reef you will probably be able to get home again; if you take your tinnie out to the Coral Sea you are probably never going to be able to see home again. You'd need a much more substantial vessel if you were going to go that far out. For recreational fishing, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is the place where you're more likely to want to fish, yet there are significant no-fishing zones—not just commercial but recreational as well—that were put in place by the Howard government. When they were put in place, some people argued that the Howard government shouldn't have been doing it, that it was better simply to have a carefully managed fishery in the Great Barrier Reef. But the Howard government, to its credit, decided: no, we'll have some areas where you can't fish at all.


What's happened in those areas? The scientific research has been in for years now, specifically measuring the difference in size of coral trout species found within those so-called green zones, or no-fishing zones, compared with immediately adjacent areas. The best evidence of the fact that they work is that the recreational fishers now try to get to the boundary because they know they'll get better fish in the areas near where there's no fishing at all. The outcome of having some areas that are completely preserved for nature, where there's no additional extraction, is that you don't just get the stock levels improving; you get the entire habitat improving. If those opposite believe that the Howard government did the right thing—and it's pretty hard to find an environmental argument that says it didn't on this issue—then may I say that, when we were in office, we did the right thing when we created the world's largest network of marine national parks as well. But the protections for those marine parks, including the Coral Sea—the cradle of the Great Barrier Reef—were suspended soon after there was a change of government, and to this day, while the boundaries still exist, no protections exist within them.


I urge the government, regardless of different pressures that might be around, to look carefully at the success of what the Howard government did. There is an opportunity for this government to do the right thing. If it goes down the path it's currently heading down—ignoring the Howard legacy and deciding that it is largely against marine protected areas—then within the next 12 months we will see Australia become the nation which will have engaged in the largest removal of area under conservation of any government in history. That's the gravity of what's before the government right now—a proposal which, if followed, will be the largest removal of area under conservation from any government ever. So, while I would love to urge those opposite to take account of my legacy as a former environment minister, I reckon I have a better chance simply asking for them to have a look at the Howard government legacy with respect to the Great Barrier Reef, because, at the moment, there is a proposal before them that would simply trash that sort of approach.


The zoning is designed to keep the reef healthy, but the reef is under increasing pressure. In 2016, the reef suffered a mass bleaching event, particularly in the northern areas of the reef, and it also suffered a bleaching event in 2017, particularly the area from Townsville to around Cooktown as well as parts of the reef near Princess Charlotte Bay. In 2017, Tropical Cyclone Debbie hit Queensland and added to the pressure to parts of the reef. To protect the reef we need to work on land to stop pollution and sediment entering the reef, take action on climate change and protect the Coral Sea to the east. To make sure that all of this work, if done, is properly measured and is properly accounted for, and the scientific work becomes a measure of steps forward in the reef rather than steps backward, we need to make sure that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is properly governed, well funded and well supported. What we have in front of us today is a step in the right direction to that end.


In supporting this bill, I simply say to those opposite: think about where this goes next. If this bill is as successful as we hope it will be, if it leads to better corporate governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area and if it leads to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority being a more effective agency, then we will also see, as a result of that, better management and better measurement of the health of the Great Barrier Reef. This means that the story is going to become clearer. The opportunity to hide government action in terms of its implications for the reef will become harder than ever. This legislation is good legislation because the more independent and the better this authority is the harder it will be for any government to hide if it's not looking after the Great Barrier Reef. I say to those opposite that the next stage is to make sure that the better managed authority has a good story to tell—and whether it does or not is largely in the hands of those opposite and their policies and of changing direction with respect to marine protection, with respect to climate change action and with respect to land clearing.

It will also strengthen the requirements for appointment and termination of members. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to clarify the relationship between the suite of legislation underpinning the functions of the authority. The bill will strengthen the strategic capability and capacity of the authority to respond to challenges facing the marine park.

For recreational fishing, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is the place where you're more likely to want to fish, yet there are significant no-fishing zones—not just commercial but recreational as well—that were put in place by the Howard government. When they were put in place, some people argued that the Howard government shouldn't have been doing it, that it was better simply to have a carefully managed fishery in the Great Barrier Reef. But the Howard government, to its credit, decided: no, we'll have some areas where you can't fish at all.


What's happened in those areas? The scientific research has been in for years now, specifically measuring the difference in size of coral trout species found within those so-called green zones, or no-fishing zones, compared with immediately adjacent areas. The best evidence of the fact that they work is that the recreational fishers now try to get to the boundary because they know they'll get better fish in the areas near where there's no fishing at all. The outcome of having some areas that are completely preserved for nature, where there's no additional extraction, is that you don't just get the stock levels improving; you get the entire habitat improving. If those opposite believe that the Howard government did the right thing—and it's pretty hard to find an environmental argument that says it didn't on this issue—then may I say that, when we were in office, we did the right thing when we created the world's largest network of marine national parks as well. But the protections for those marine parks, including the Coral Sea—the cradle of the Great Barrier Reef—were suspended soon after there was a change of government, and to this day, while the boundaries still exist, no protections exist within them.


I urge the government, regardless of different pressures that might be around, to look carefully at the success of what the Howard government did. There is an opportunity for this government to do the right thing. If it goes down the path it's currently heading down—ignoring the Howard legacy and deciding that it is largely against marine protected areas—then within the next 12 months we will see Australia become the nation which will have engaged in the largest removal of area under conservation of any government in history. That's the gravity of what's before the government right now—a proposal which, if followed, will be the largest removal of area under conservation from any government ever. So, while I would love to urge those opposite to take account of my legacy as a former environment minister, I reckon I have a better chance simply asking for them to have a look at the Howard government legacy with respect to the Great Barrier Reef, because, at the moment, there is a proposal before them that would simply trash that sort of approach.


The zoning is designed to keep the reef healthy, but the reef is under increasing pressure. In 2016, the reef suffered a mass bleaching event, particularly in the northern areas of the reef, and it also suffered a bleaching event in 2017, particularly the area from Townsville to around Cooktown as well as parts of the reef near Princess Charlotte Bay. In 2017, Tropical Cyclone Debbie hit Queensland and added to the pressure to parts of the reef. To protect the reef we need to work on land to stop pollution and sediment entering the reef, take action on climate change and protect the Coral Sea to the east. To make sure that all of this work, if done, is properly measured and is properly accounted for, and the scientific work becomes a measure of steps forward in the reef rather than steps backward, we need to make sure that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is properly governed, well funded and well supported. What we have in front of us today is a step in the right direction to that end.


In supporting this bill, I simply say to those opposite: think about where this goes next. If this bill is as successful as we hope it will be, if it leads to better corporate governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area and if it leads to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority being a more effective agency, then we will also see, as a result of that, better management and better measurement of the health of the Great Barrier Reef. This means that the story is going to become clearer. The opportunity to hide government action in terms of its implications for the reef will become harder than ever. This legislation is good legislation because the more independent and the better this authority is the harder it will be for any government to hide if it's not looking after the Great Barrier Reef. I say to those opposite that the next stage is to make sure that the better managed authority has a good story to tell—and whether it does or not is largely in the hands of those opposite and their policies and of changing direction with respect to marine protection, with respect to climate change action and with respect to land clearing.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (16:48):  The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017 implements a new governance model for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The bill replaces the full-time chairperson with a part-time chairperson and full-time chief executive officer and establishes one additional part-time member position. It will also strengthen the requirements for appointment and termination of members. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to clarify the relationship between the suite of legislation underpinning the functions of the authority. The bill will strengthen the strategic capability and capacity of the authority to respond to challenges facing the marine park.


The Australian government is committed to protecting the Great Barrier Reef, a World Heritage site, now and for future generations. Effective operation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is central to this commitment. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (17:11):  I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-2018 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2017-2018, which, as always, are required to ensure the ordinary functions of the government continue for, in this case, the remainder of the 2017-18 financial year and to facilitate a number of the measures from the 2017-18 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In this case, the package of bills appropriates something like $1.5 billion from consolidated revenue. This is in addition to the appropriation acts passed in June 2017 after the budget, and these amounts are already incorporated into the budget bottom line as presented in the 2017-18 MYEFO. I should say, at the outset, that obviously we're not in the business of standing in the way of supply, although I think there are some very troubling aspects of the government's broader economic management that the House should understand and note. 


These bills do go to those broader issues around what I consider to be the mismanagement of the nation's finances. I'd like to begin by quoting not somebody from this side or a well-known critic of the government but the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister, when he was opposition leader in 2009, described a gross debt of $200 billion as 'frightening'. He promised that the Liberals wouldn't 'run willy-nilly into debt'. He later described $300 billion in projected gross debt as 'gigantic' and an 'almost inconceivable level of debt'. He had an analogy that he would trot out from time to time—I remember it well—where he'd say: 'There should be no lead weights put in his pockets or heavy backpacks put on his back.' Yet that is what this government is delivering to us with these higher and higher levels of debt.


So he said a debt projected at $300 billion was 'frightening', 'gigantic', 'almost inconceivable'. It shouldn't surprise us, then, given that was his view in opposition, that he's been a bit quieter lately about the total amount of debt on his government's watch. That's because gross debt—remember, at $300 billion it was going to be gigantic and inconceivable—has crashed through half a trillion dollars for the first time in Australian history on the Prime Minister's watch. It's currently about $515 billion with no sign, really, of slowing down. In the government's own budget papers, which we're talking about as we debate these bills, gross debt doesn't even peak over a 10-year horizon. So, for the next 10 years, after all the lectures we got about debt and deficit disasters and gigantic levels of debt at $300 billion, we are talking about $515 billion which goes up and up and up for 10 years and doesn't even peak in the next decade in the government's own budget papers. That's a pretty extraordinary thing. For a government that likes to pretend that they are somehow superior managers of the budget, we've got this record, growing debt which doesn't even peak over the medium term in the government's own budget papers. It is not an opinion; it's a fact. That's in the government's budget.


Similarly, in the same budget papers, we have got a deficit for this year which is eight times higher than the Liberals predicted in their first 2014 budget. Joe Hockey stood at that dispatch box on a Tuesday evening in May and said that the deficit for this year was going to be $2.8 billion. Then the current Treasurer, Treasurer Morrison, stood up in December, the week before Christmas—obviously very proud of his mid-year budget update; he dropped that out a few days before Christmas—and had to admit that the deficit was $23.6 billion, eight times bigger than Joe Hockey predicted in 2014.


We might have a Prime Minister who is a little less keen to talk about gigantic levels of debt but, thankfully—and always thankfully—we've got the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the member for Deakin, who always helps us out on this side of the parliament. He's the gift that keeps on giving. He has described the debt under the Turnbull-Morrison's government's watch as, 'A truckload of debt' and 'An extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary, amount of debt.' I couldn't have said it better myself. But what's more extraordinary, and probably something that not a lot of people out there in the community appreciate—probably because of the message that the government and some of their cheerleaders in the media like to send—is that debt is actually increasing. Debt, gross debt and net debt, is increasing faster under this government in good global economic conditions than it was under the former Labor government, despite the fact that we had a global financial crisis.


Again, these are not opinions. I will give you the hard numbers and people can go and check them if they like. Take gross debt, for example. Under this government, gross debt is currently being racked up $1.2 billion a month faster than it was under Labor. It is being racked up $286 million a week quicker and $41 million a day quicker under this government compared to its predecessor. If you prefer to think about net debt: net debt is being racked up $710 million a month quicker—accumulated, $163 million a week quicker and $23 million a day quicker. So both measures are being accumulated much faster than they were under the Labor Party.


Until quite recently, the old excuse from the Treasurer—whether it was Treasurer Morrison or Treasurer Hockey—has been the global conditions. If you want to talk about difficult global conditions, obviously you'd be talking about the period that the former Labor government confronted the global financial crisis, the sharpest synchronised downturn in the global economy since the Great Depression. But there was a period when Joe Hockey or the current Treasurer would talk about global conditions being the reason that they had so substantially overpromised and under delivered on debt and deficit. That excuse has well and truly gone. This is the best global economy we have had for a decade.


If those opposite don't want to take my word for it, they can look at the Reserve Bank's Statement on monetary policy which they put out on Friday. Their statement was very, very up-beat about global conditions. In fact, at the start of the overview, they say:


Global economic conditions picked up further over the course of 2017.


They talk about the strength continuing into 2018. They are talking about the global economy. They talk about growth in a lot of those big economies being above 'estimates of potential'. They talk about favourable commodity prices, 'stronger than expected growth' in advanced economies and 'synchronised improvement in global growth' boosting commodity prices. There are all sorts of indications in the Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy that this global economy that we are in right now—leaving aside, of course, some of the actions and over-reactions to it in the stock market, but just in the real economy of growth and jobs and all of that—the global conditions are quite spectacularly positive. So, there's no excuse for the sorts of budget outcomes that we're getting at the moment. The IMF's most recent world economic outlook—last month, January 2018—says:


Global economic activity continues to firm up. Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and ½ percentage point higher than in 2016.


So the IMF is revising up its forecasts. All of this is a way of saying that when it comes to the deterioration in the budget we cannot point to global conditions as being at fault. The global economy is in pretty good nick, certainly the best nick it's been in for the last 10 years or so.


So, if it's not the global economy that's driving some of these horrific debt numbers—record and growing gross debt and record net debt—then we have to look somewhere else for an explanation. I think the explanation is pretty simple. Beyond that, I think the community understands that there's a pretty simple explanation for what's going on here, and that is that those opposite, particularly the Prime Minister, have this obsession with pandering to the top end of town. This is an approach that hurts the budget. It hurts the economy as well, and I'll get to the economy in a moment, beyond the fiscal settings. But it's also unfair, because it comes at the expense of middle Australia and people who work and struggle to provide for their families


I think the latest midyear update gave us a really a perfect window into the way those opposite approach the budget and the economy: higher taxes for 7 million working people, lower taxes for multinationals and millionaires and, as I said before in some detail, record and growing debt. I think it is worth noting, whenever we talk about the budget and certainly since that 2014 horror budget that I mentioned before, that what we see is a pattern of behaviour such that when they do want to repair the budget—or say they want to repair the budget—it's always at the expense of the most vulnerable people in society: students in universities in the midyear update; the $44 billion income tax hike on 7 million low- and middle-income Australians; ditching the energy supplement, leaving pensioners up to $366 a year worse off; or the thing that's still on the books every time, which is increasing the pension age to 70, which is the oldest in the developed world.


A real pattern has emerged. We're up for budget repair on this side, but it has to be fair on that side. They give these big tax cuts to multinationals and millionaires at the same time that they expect the most vulnerable people, the people on modest incomes, to carry the can for the fact we've got that record and growing debt. I think the best example of that, which has been in the news—and I think it's good that it's been in the news the last little while, certainly the last couple of months—are those company tax cuts that those opposite want to impose on the country: a $65 billion tax cut for big multinationals, and I think the big banks as well; I think they get something like $10 billion or $12 billion out of that $65 billion. It is a pretty extraordinary ramraid on the budget when you think about it. We've got this record and growing gross and net debt and we've got a $65 billion handout. It doesn't take a genius to work out that, when you give $65 billion to foreign multinationals and big banks and the like, that's $65 billion that you can't use on budget repair, that you can't use on investing in productivity and that you can't use on investing in human capital, education and health—all of those sorts of things that really matter if we are to grow the economy in this country.


If you look at the economics of the company tax cut it's pretty clear, even according to the Treasury department, that there's just not enough bang for 65 billion bucks. We've got Treasury modelling which shows a one per cent boost to GDP in 20 years time, which is an average of 0.05 per cent a year. If you compare that, for example, with the return on investment in infrastructure, that same Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy that I referred to that was released last week said that a $1 billion increase in public investment would boost GDP by $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The multipliers from investing in infrastructure and, I'd also suggest, from investing in people's skills, abilities, productivity and capacity—the multiplier for that kind of public investment is far greater than the return that, according to the Treasury, we get from these tax cuts for big business in this country.


If you don't want to take my word for it, the Grattan Institute warned that national income would be reduced for years by committing to this tax cut for big businesses before fixing the budget. They said that it risked reducing future living standards, which is a pretty important conclusion by the Grattan Institute. They're not associated with either side of politics—a terrific outfit. They've said, 'If we do this company tax cut before we fix the budget and do the other things that we need to do, we actually risk a reduction in future living standards.' Their quote was:


An unfunded company tax cut would add to already-large budget deficits … any cut to the company tax rate should only be implemented as part of a wider tax (and spending) reform package that does not increase budget deficits.


That's quite a stunning observation from the Grattan Institute and one that those opposite would do well to acknowledge, consider and reflect on.


Instead, we get this willingness, this hankering, this obsession with copying the Trump tax cuts in the US, as if you can make some kind of useful comparison between the headline rate over there, where they have state corporate taxes and all the rest of it, and the fact we have dividend imputation here—all of these reasons why you can't make a straight comparison between the headline rate in the US and the headline rate in Australia. But even leaving that aside for a moment, if you want to take the word of the International Monetary Fund, they looked at the Trump tax cuts just last month—after the passage, I believe, of those Trump tax cuts—and concluded:


Due to the temporary nature of some of its provisions, the tax policy package is projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards.


In America we have this sugar hit of company tax cuts associated with Trump and the Republicans in the Congress, and the IMF is saying even if you get some growth from those in the near term, it will detract from growth in the medium term. It will be like a sugar hit to the economy. The way that it's constructed, it will actually be a problem from 2022 onwards—so only four years of what former opposition leader from this dispatch box John Howard said about five minutes of economic sunshine. All of that outlay in the US, but it will only be four years before it starts to detract from growth.


Here on our own shores, those tax cuts—the company tax cuts proposed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—have become a symbol for a lot of ordinary people that this is a government that is out of touch with their daily lives. They don't get the sorts of needs and aspirations that people have in middle Australia. Their obsession is to shower largess on the top end of town. There is heaps of evidence of that. I'm not fond of quoting opinion polling in this place, but every piece of market research that has been published that I've seen shows very clearly that middle Australia does not want these tax cuts inflicted on them, particularly when it comes at the expense of their own living standard. That's an entirely reasonable position for them to adopt.


Unfortunately, that sort of pandering to the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia is not limited to that big business tax cut. It applies to a whole range of other areas as well in the budget and blocked in the midyear update as well. There are also the income tax cuts to those who need them least—$16,400 a year if you make a million dollars a year. So you have these weird, bizarre, out-of-whack priorities where you have a big tax cut for the people earning the most by removing the deficit levy and yet you have seven million workers on low and middle incomes who are being asked to pay more income tax at the same time as all this other stuff is going on with big business tax cuts and the like.


The other area which has received a lot of attention in the last couple of years, really—and I think it is a tribute to the opposition leader, the member for McMahon and the member for Fenner in particular when it comes to our tax reform proposals—is that we've still got this absurd situation where the biggest tax concessions are actually going to those who need them least. Think about things like negative gearing, trusts, capital gains and some of the concessions in super which do so much to advantage people in this country who are already wealthy at the expense of other people. In a perfect world, obviously a lot of people would prefer to pay less tax and they'd like to find ways of doing that. That's an entirely understandable human reaction. But when you've got a budget that is in the condition that it's in, you have priorities that you need to fund. In our case it's human capital, investing in people and making sure people are getting rewarded for their effort, earning, providing for their families, spending in the economy, creating demand with disposable income and all these sorts of things. You have to work out what your priorities are, and our priorities are very different from those opposite. We don't think we can continue to pay the biggest tax concessions to those who need them least.


I think Peter Martin from Fairfax summed it up really well in a recent piece about tax concessions when he said:


… the beneficiaries aren't always as deserving. The biggest superannuation and capital gains tax concessions are directed towards the highest earners, something we wouldn't tolerate if they were delivered as cheques, paid into accounts.


I think that's a really important point. If you explained to the Australian people what a lot of these tax concessions mean in dollar terms for an individual person and asked them, 'Would you support that being just handed to them as a cheque or in cash?' a lot of people would be appalled by it. But because it's in a tax system it's not as obvious to people what's going on and how our budget is so substantially out of whack. I think the members for Maribyrnong, McMahon, Fenner and others who have worked on our tax policy proposals have done the country a real service by making announcements about tax and defending them well in advance of elections and well in advance of people making a judgement on them, saying, 'We've got a problem in the budget: the biggest tax concessions go to those who need them least and we need to have the courage to address those issues.'


That's the fiscal part of the story. That's the budget part of the story in these appropriations bills and in the mid-year update. There's also, of course, the economic story. I've already touched on the global conditions which have disappeared as an excuse for the mismanagement of the budget and the fact that we've got record and growing debt. I think it's also important that we acknowledge that we have had some good headline figures in our economy, too. I think the national accounts showed GDP growth for the year to September was 2.8 per cent. That's not amazing. That's not outstanding. It's not the kind of economic triumph that Australia has become accustomed to, but 2.8 per cent is not terrible. The real issue, though, is underneath that headline. It doesn't really give you a sense of how we're slipping in the global context. We've gone from leader to laggard when it comes to our performance, even on GDP growth, which is the government's preferred measure. Let's think about some comparisons. Between 2008 and 2010, Australia had the fourth-highest GDP growth amongst OECD countries. We had the US, the UK, Japan and Germany all contracting. We had the fourth-highest GDP growth amongst those 30-plus OECD countries. Now in the same group we are 20th. We have slumped to 20th. We are behind Mexico, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and a whole range of countries. So we've gone from leader under the former government to laggard now when you look at the global league table. Again, that's not an opinion; it's a fact that you can easily look up and verify.


I think that headline rate, apart from the way that we are underperforming in good global economic conditions, also masks some enduring and concerning problems and trends in our economy which are disproportionately hurting some people more than others. To summarise the way a lot of people feel, with some justification, about how the economy really is—the economy that they actually experience rather than the economy they are lectured about from that dispatch box—it is that the rules of the economy are written to benefit others. That makes sense when you consider inequality is at a 75-year high or that the gender pay gap is widening—I know that that's something that is deeply concerning to our entire side of the parliament but especially to my friend, the member who's at the table. The gender pay gap should be a source of real shame in a country like ours. We are ranked 42nd out of 144 countries. We were in 12th position—a lot closer to the front of the pack—a decade ago. 


This economic disconnect that we talk about between outstanding global conditions, pretty good headline figures and the economy that people experience is most prevalent in the world of work and wages. It's fair to say that a lot of people feel that the link between their work and the reward they receive for that work has been severed. The best example of that is the fact that company profits have gone up 20 per cent in the last year at the same time over the same period that wages grew by two per cent. Whenever those opposite say, 'If only we can shovel some more money in the direction of the biggest companies in this country, they will jack up wages', we say, That's not been the experience.' Profits have gone up in this country in the last year—20 per cent; pretty extraordinary company profit growth. We want our companies to be profitable, but we want to make sure that the growth is inclusive and that people are rewarded for their work. Unfortunately—shamefully, really—in this country over the last year, we've had 20 per cent increase in company profits; two per cent increase in wages. That is a problem that would only be turbocharged if those opposite could implement their full agenda for tax cuts for big foreign multinationals and the big banks. 


There are a whole range of reasons: insecure work; the fact that people can't get the hours they want; the underemployment in this country is extraordinarily high—near historic highs; and wages growth of course is at record lows. All of these sorts of figures, when you combine them, paint a picture of the kind of economy that people are actually experiencing in middle Australia. 


One of the unfortunate things about the conversation we're having about wages in this country at the moment is that people assume or pretend that it's some sort of ideological thing. We're proud on our side of the parliament, of course, that we have always historically represented working people. However, beyond the usual fault lines of domestic politics, there's a substantial economic problem, objectively, when it comes to low wages in this country. It won't be fixed by company tax cuts for the reasons I've gone through in some detail. It certainly won't be fixed by cutting people's wages for working on the weekends. 


The problem can be summed up like this: when millions of working people in this country can't get the wages growth that they need to provide for their families and keep up with the cost of living, they don't have the money to spend in the shops, they don't have the money to invest in the future of their kids and they don't have the disposable income which creates demand—the demand that we need if we are to have enduring and inclusive growth in this country. 


If you look at the last national accounts, household consumption growth was very weak—0.1 per cent; the worst quarterly reading since the GFC. Household debt-to-income ratio is the highest it's been since the GFC, and what that shows is that people are feeling the strain. There is a disconnect between those headline growth figures and what people are experiencing. As I said, cutting wages, jacking up taxes on middle Australia—all of these sorts of things—would be a disaster for these trends that we've seen emerge that we should be dealing with. 


It was terrific to see Michael Blythe, the CBA economist, in one of his recent economics issues notes—terrific publication, a good piece of economic analysis—talk about a wages recession. He described that weakness in wage growth as 'a significant economic risk' because it impacts on households who defer their spending and focus on balance sheet repair, which is another way of saying: trying to pay off the credit cards. It focuses on businesses who react by cutting capital spending and slowing labour hiring. 


Stagnant wages growth in this country is not a problem that should only trouble one side of politics. It's not an ideological thing. It's an economic thing. It's a challenge. It's probably the most substantial threat to growth in this country at the moment that people do not have the income they need to make the economy whirr, and I think that this parliament needs to deal with that as a matter of urgency—at the very least, not by cutting wages, not by taking money out of the pockets of seven million Australian workers. 


So, whether it's the budget, whether it's our approach to the broader macroeconomy, I think there are substantial differences between that side of the House and this side. We both want growth, we both want fiscal repair, we both want our businesses to succeed, but we're going about it in very different ways. I think only our way will succeed. I don't think it will succeed with the strategy of hoping that by showering largesse on the top end of town—the strongest in our economy—it will somehow trickle down to everybody else. I don't think that will work; it hasn't worked historically. It hasn't worked here; it hasn't worked overseas. It's a flawed economic model. You don't grow the economy by favouring the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. 


This is a government that thinks big multinational corporations pay too much tax, that seven million working Australians pay too little tax and that people get paid too much to work on the weekends. That tells us everything we need to know about the approach of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and their colleagues in the cabinet. We in the Labor Party take a different approach. We know growth has to be inclusive if you're serious about growing the economy. You have to invest in people and their productivity; you have to make sure people are being rewarded for effort; you have to ensure people have money to spend in the economy and can provide for their families. That also underpins our approach to the budget.


So we will, of course, be supporting the appropriation bills. That's the convention in this place. But that doesn't prevent us from pointing out the facts that we've got record and growing debt, that we've got a government which is spectacularly out of touch with middle Australia. We see that in their big business tax cuts and their tax hikes for ordinary people.

Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (17:41):  I too would like to speak on the appropriation bills and, in particular, about spending in the electorate of La Trobe. For those who do not know, La Trobe covers from the Dandenong Ranges in the north with suburbs such as Ferny Creek and Olinda and then goes right across to places like Emerald and Cockatoo and further down south, where there is an incredible growth corridor with suburbs such as Narre Warren, Narre Warren South, Beaconsfield, Officer and, of course, Berwick. Up to 250 families are moving each week into the shires of Cardinia and Casey, so it's a very, very fast-growing corridor, even when compared with the rest of Australia. 


We've been very much focused on supporting community groups. Why do we do that under the Turnbull government? You find that if you make very strong communities and support—for example, the Men's Shed, woodworkers' clubs, the RSL, the Scouts and Guides and the sporting clubs—that's great for the community and keeps the community engaged. It's good for their health and wellbeing. 


In the south of the electorate, as I said, with its huge growth corridor, one of the big issues has been transportation. You can imagine that with so many people moving into this area it does put huge pressure on local roads. One of the biggest roads we have in the electorate—in fact the biggest—is the Monash Freeway. I was greatly concerned and I lobbied back in March 2006 that an extra lane was needed on the Freeway—it could in fact have two lanes. We had the announcement with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that $500 million—which, sadly, was left over from money not spent by the state Labor government on the East-West Link—but we got that for the Monash. The announcement was in March 2016 for an extra lane that went all the way from the Warrigal Road connection to Cardinia Road. I would specifically like to thank Minister Paul Fletcher, who was heavily involved in the concept of where the road would finish. As I said to him, the growth in Officer in the next 10 years will be quite incredible. I think it will be in the vicinity of 50,000 people. You always hear the complaint, 'Governments do not have a vision.' Well, we wanted to make sure we had a vision to ensure that the road would actually meet the growth in that local area. 


Also importantly, too, we wanted to improve the traffic movement of local residents. In particular, Clyde Road is a road which each morning is nearly clogged up for local residents. We have so many families in La Trobe. We have mums and dads dropping off kids at school and, when they get to Clyde Road, they try to sneak around to Soldiers Road if they are going to, say, Hillcrest college. It is just an absolute traffic jam, including people trying to get on to the Monash. I was approached by both Casey council and Cardinia council at the same time a number of years back to say: 'As part of this Monash proposal, we really need the Turnbull government to include the extension of O'Shea Road from Soldiers Road right to where we would see the Beaconsfield interchange. It currently has two on-off ramps. It needs to be completed with two more on-off ramps.' That would mean, for example, residents coming through from Pakenham would no longer need to go into Berwick and go down south on Clyde Road. They could go to the Beaconsfield interchange and go straight through O'Shea Road and go down to the southern parts of Victoria if need be—areas like Frankston—by missing Clyde Road. It's of great benefit to local residents.


Also, too, with the opening up of the Beaconsfield interchange and extension of O'Shea Road, there is Minta Farm, which is a large allotment of land. This has been zoned by councils to be used for innovation and advanced manufacturing jobs. It is not industrial but innovation and advanced manufacturing jobs. I speak to so many local businesses that are very keen to go into this area. This will create, once opened, an incredible 10,000 local jobs in that area. The whole purpose is to stop people travelling to the CBD. But there is a disappointing aspect to this. We made the announcement back in March 2016. Here we have an area where we could create 10,000 jobs at Beaconsfield interchange and make the lives of local residents so much better. Sadly, we saw in the May 2017 budget from the state Labor government that out of that $500 million, after spending $2.5 million on the business case, it has decided to spend money on only the sections between South Gippsland Highway and Clyde Road. I acknowledge that that is obviously very important, but it's not going right out to Warrigal Road and Cardinia Road. Most of that funding, I believe, is from Transurban, which means tolls for people in the south-east when they use the Monash Freeway. In particular, from the CBD down to Toorak Road will be hit with tolls for another 10 years. I have numerous times called on Premier Daniel Andrews to get on with the job, to relieve the stress and to get on with building with the money. It just seems quite ridiculous. We have had $500 million in federal funding for nearly two years, coming up in April, which has not been spent on one road, the Monash, which is so vital, especially when we talk about those 10,000 jobs.


We saw some good news with projects which opened recently. There was Bunjil Place. Again, I congratulate Casey council. For anyone in Victoria listening in, it's beside Fountain Gate. It's an incredible $125 million project which the Turnbull government committed $10 million for. I recently had the opening with the former mayor Sam Aziz and the councils down there. The Casey council had an incredible vision to open a performing arts centre. From memory, it's in the vicinity of 800 seats. The architecture of Bunjil Place is quite incredible. The wooden framing outside—and I do it no justice by calling it wooden framing—is a beautiful piece of art. It was constructed in Germany, and the builders who had to reconstruct it had to work within millimetres. It's got an amazing entrance. 


Bunjil Place is named after the Aboriginal mythical creature, Bunjil—an eagle. They designed it in the shape of an eagle, and it looks absolutely incredible. I took the Treasurer down there, and he was absolutely blown away by how good this facility was and how much it means to the families of La Trobe, especially those in the south-east. That's what happens when the Turnbull government invests money, in this case $10 million. I also should say that it is in the seat of Holt, and I acknowledge the member for Holt for his interest in and commitment to this project. It's a fantastic local facility.


I also had the great pleasure of going to the opening of the Belgrave South Community Sports Pavilion recently. They had their official opening in November 2017. I previously committed $250,000 as an election commitment, and the entire project was in the vicinity of $2 million. It will benefit 419 people from the local area. What they've done down there just looks great. I'd also like to thank Ian Bakens and his team down there and to say that they had probably the best sporting event I've ever been to: it was a Black Caviar event. It was an incredible event to kick off the project and to get it up and running. When I was a candidate in 2017, I was blown away by how good it was, and that's why we made the election commitment. I'd like to also acknowledge the others from the Belgrave South community and various groups who were involved. It was a very exciting project, and it's now open to the public. We also gave them funding towards their lights. 


We committed $250,000 to the Beaconsfield Football Club to upgrade, to seal, their car park. It's now a bitumen car park. The council is also working to get a skateboard centre for the local kids to give them something to do. We're also helping them get some funding for a storage shed. I would like to acknowledge the president of Beaconsfield Football Club, Troy Robinson, the senior coach, Leigh McQuillan, and the head of football operations, Darren Hamilton, for their efforts. Also, very shortly, the Upwey CRASH project will be opening, with the Upwey football and cricket clubs and all the sporting groups locating there. I'd like to thank Andrew Peterson for the work he's done. The old clubrooms were probably there for 40 or 50 years, especially the Upwey one. They've been demolished. It's just so great for the local area and for the community to get involved in those sorts of projects.


Also, up in Mount Dandenong, we committed $10 million at the last election for the Mount Dandenong tourist road upgrade. It's particular focus is on the cyclists. Cadel Evans—it was fantastic to see Evans win the Tour de France—is up there every weekend in the Dandenong Ranges. We have cyclists coming from absolutely everywhere, which is fantastic. The only thing is: it becomes very frustrating for the local residents. So, rather than complain—and we had some people saying we should ban the cyclists, which is something we would never do—we committed funding to look at improving its usage for cyclists and others. I thank VicRoads for the work and also the Shire of Yarra Ranges. We will need more money for it. I believe, after speaking to VicRoads, that the total project will be in the vicinity of over $30 million. We did approach the state Labor government, and they basically came back and said it wasn't a priority. I think it's a big priority and I think we need to work together and have the state Labor government put some funding into this project. 


The same goes for Ridge Walk, which is a walk from Montrose right across to Upwey. It is to connect all the townships from Sassafras to Olinda to Mount Dandenong to Kalorama, and actually to really focus on the famous landscape artists of the hills and have an arts focus, because I really want to focus on creating tourism jobs up in the Dandenong Ranges. I'm very excited about that because we have this amazing tradition of artists in the hills, with Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton and Arthur Boyd. Artists have created all these amazing works in the Dandenong Ranges, including Aboriginal artist Lin Onus. So we really want to focus on that, and we have committed $2.5 million to the project. We do need the state Labor government to commit.


This project is not only good for telling or capturing the history of the area but also good for local residents, to walk in and experience the area. The footpaths in the hills aren't that great, but this project should make it a lot easier to walk through the parks. Some of the parks, as we see now in Sherbrooke Forest, are fantastic to walk through. In winter, though, it is pretty boggy, so we will be looking at having boardwalks. I'm very excited about the work we are doing with the council on that.


We have committed $5.5 million for Puffing Billy, for the Emerald discovery centre. That is in the planning phase. We've also committed $1 million to restore an old red rattler train, and I thank all those involved in assisting with that restoration. It will be so amazing and exciting when we have the first restored train come out from the CBD to Belgrave, to connect to Puffing Billy.


Finally, I had another commitment for the 1,000 Steps walk, for drinking taps. I remember people—this is more the media—being critical about having $50,000 for drinking taps at the start of the steps and at the top. Well, can I say: while I've been giving my speech, I reckon there would've been probably 100 people using those drinking taps, so that was money well spent.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (17:57):  Australia's a great country, but we really do face some big challenges, and now more than ever Australia needs a Prime Minister with a vision for this country and a vision for its people. But instead we've got a Prime Minister and a government which have completely run out of ideas. Not only have they run out of ideas; they are distracted and divided, and completely bereft of any vision for this country. They say one thing and they do exactly the opposite.


Their plan for Australian workers is breathtaking. They are supporting pay cuts for Australian workers at the very same time as they are supporting tax cuts for their bosses and the big companies. Their plan for the future of our workforce is to cut funding for our TAFEs at the very same time as they are importing skilled workers from overseas to do the jobs that Australian companies need to be done. The government has cut more than $2.8 billion from our TAFEs, from skills and from training.


As to their plan for universities—now this is going to kill you—we've got a Prime Minister who runs around the country and will talk to anyone with two eyes and a pair of ears about the importance of innovation while at the very same time they've cut $617 million from the very institutions that are training Australians in how to innovate! From my own university, Wollongong University—and I'm a proud graduate of that place—$45 million is being cut. This government has lost the plot.


Their plan to close the gap on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inequality is to pretend that the $500 million that they have cut out of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs over the last four years and their five years of inaction just did not happen. Over the last 24 hours, we've seen the ridiculous thing where they're asking us to give them credit for reopening an antismoking program that they closed down only three years ago. They are going to have another conversation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, while the memory of the Prime Minister closing the door on the Uluru Statement from the Heart is still fresh in the minds of those very same people. He has dithered and dallied on reconciliation while making grand speeches about the need for urgent action. He talks about the importance and the need for Australia to respect women and girls, but we see so few of them on his own front bench. He nobbles regional universities with funding cuts and increased enrolment fees. He says, 'We need to unite as one Australia,' while presiding over ever-growing inequality.


In Australia today, wealth is more concentrated than at any time in the last 60 years. The richest 10 per cent of Australians own 45 per cent of all wealth, and the gap between city Australia and regional Australia is widening. If you're in the top 20 per cent, you probably live in one of our capital cities. If you're in the bottom 20 per cent, you probably live outside one of those capital cities. If you're in one of those regional areas and you're represented by a Labor MP, you'll find somebody coming to Canberra and, with every breath they take, they will fight against the pernicious attacks of the government on the very programs and the very institutions which are driving at reducing inequality in this country. But, if you are unfortunate enough in one of the regional areas to be represented by one of the Liberal-National Party MPs, you'll find an MP who fights like a lion in his own electorate and says the most outrageous things about what he or she will take on when they come to Canberra, but they file in here and vote, day after day, against the very interests of their own electorates.


Let's look at what's going on in some of the regional areas. It doesn't matter which indicator you look at: there is a growing gap. There is a health gap, whether you measure it in access to medical care, whether you measure it in access to the necessary pharmaceuticals or whether you measure it in the prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. Diabetes is 3.5 times more common in working adults from the poorer areas, the majority of whom are in regional Australia—a whopping 3.5 times more common. What's the answer from the geniuses opposite? To make it harder for a person in regional Australia to go and see a GP. This is a government bereft of ideas. But it's not just about health. If you look at life expectancy, there is a three-year gap. For the average white Australian—and I'll get to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians—living in regional Australia versus one living in one of the capitals or in one of the metropolitan areas of the country, there is an average three-year life expectancy gap. That blows out to 10 years if you go to rural and remote Australia. We all know, after reading the 10-year Closing the gap report yesterday, what the unacceptably high gap in life expectancy is between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and other Australians in those communities.


Education is the tool that we use to improve the life expectancies and the life opportunities available for people who come from a modest background versus those who are born with every opportunity in life. But, when you look at the data, the gap in the participation rate between the city and the country is also growing. The gap in secondary education between major cities and outer regional areas is a whopping 7.3 per cent. We've got to ask ourselves whether LNP representatives from regional electorates were aware of the 7.3 per cent participation gap in secondary education when they filed into this place and voted in favour of cuts to school education.


The Prime Minister and his government say that they care about rising electricity costs, while rejecting every single sensible plan, including the sensible plans that were commissioned by their own ministers. It takes a special kind of wisdom to get some of the smartest people in the country to prepare a report on how we can have a clean energy future with stable and reliable electricity prices and then send it off to some of the daftest people in your party room and accept the recommendations that come from those very same people. It takes a special kind of genius, a special kind of government, but that's exactly what this mob over here have done. Is it any wonder that electricity bills in the last quarter alone were up by up to 20 per cent? This is the result of their dithering and their do-nothing approach when it comes to energy policy.


Let's talk about housing and housing affordability. The federal government could do something. They could reach across the table and join in a bipartisan effort with the Labor proposals to remove the excessive subsidies that are currently going into the housing sector to support people who are buying their second, third, fourth or fifth house and take some heat out of the housing market at the same time as they do something more productive with that money, but they have rejected Labor's proposal. They are completely bereft of ideas when it comes to housing affordability and, worse than that, when it comes to supporting housing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—tearing up the national partnership agreement which made such tremendous progress in providing both housing and skills in those communities throughout Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and other places.


We had a Treasurer once who said that the answer to housing affordability is to go out and find some rich parents. Well, if that wasn't bad enough, you've got a Deputy Prime Minister who says the answer is to go and move to regional Australia because rent's pretty cheap there. Not everybody has the opportunity of having a rich mate who is going to provide an apartment for them rent free. Most Australians have to struggle hard to put a roof over their head. This government is doing nothing to support them in that. The Prime Minister likes to talk about infrastructure but he has fundamentally failed to fund infrastructure projects in Tasmania, in Victoria and in South Australia—the states which are crying out for massive injections of infrastructure spend. 


The great Gough Whitlam once said that Labor governments see election victories as instructions to perform, while Liberal governments see them as a right to preside. Since the last election, we have seen nothing more than the truth of this saying in the performance of this government. There are only two things that unite a divided coalition government: attacking industrial rights and the industrial relations system and providing big business tax cuts. Let's have a look at the decision to support wage reductions through penalty rate cuts throughout the economy. At the same time as you have a Treasurer who is saying the most urgent economic reform that we need in this country is a pay rise, they are cheering on the Fair Work Commission as it reduced and removed penalty rate rights for thousands and thousands of Australian workers. Over 700,000 workers are likely to be affected by that decision. Cutting penalty rates will see a pay cut for low-, middle- and working-class families of up to $77 a week. That's not a very good way to go about increasing wages—by putting them up to $77 a week behind. In my own electorate, there are over 7,000 workers in the retail sector who are affected by this and around 4,200 workers in the accommodation and food sector who are affected by this. But it's not just electorates like mine; it is the same right throughout regional Australia. I happen to have the figures for Capricornia. There are about 13,000 retail workers in the Rockhampton and Gladstone areas and around 8,700 food and accommodation workers. In fact, if you look at the data, around one in seven workers in the electorates of Capricornia and Flynn are affected by direct decisions of this government and their agencies: a pay cut for these workers, supported by members opposite, with not a plan to do anything about it. 


I want to say something about trickle-down economics because the Prime Minister is fond of lecturing us on what he calls the fundamental laws of economics, which he says have not changed. He says that if we give corporates and the wealthy more money, it will somehow trickle down in the form of pay rises. He's willing to take a $65 billion gamble on federal finances to give this old chestnut of trickle-down economics a go. He could legislate for it, of course. He could put in the legislation that he has before the Senate a requirement that to receive the tax cut you've got to pass it on to your workers, but he won't do that. He won't do that, because he doesn't even believe his own rhetoric and he knows that this tax cut is not going to lead to a pay rise for ordinary Australians. 


Ordinary Australians know that it's not the pay that is going to rise. It's not the pay and the money that are trickling down to households. It's the bills—increases for health insurance costs, increases for school fee costs, paying more money for energy, paying more money for everything. In fact, ordinary Australians know that, when the Prime Minister is talking about trickle-down, they have this vision of him standing on a balcony somewhere and he's pouring scorn down on them. It's certainly not the pay and the money trickling down to them; it's something else indeed. 


There is no credibility, and he can't point to a country on earth where massive tax cuts to the biggest and wealthiest corporations in this country are going to lead to a pay increase for workers. If the government want some ideas, they should look to what Labor's doing. We have a vision for this country. This government is bereft of ideas. They are divided. They have not got an idea for the future of the country.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:12):  I'm pleased to follow the member for Whitlam, channelling Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn at the dispatch box, ranting on about all those good, hard socialist policies. However, the one thing we see time and time again from Labor spokesmen on the economy and why they always get it wrong is: they think the size of the economy, the size of the economic pie, is fixed. They don't understand that the size of our economic pie, the total wealth created in the economy, can grow and shrink. The problem is, which they don't understand, every time that you step in and try and redistribute the wealth, you destroy the very incentives to create that wealth in the first place. This is why we see policy after policy from the Labor side fail. 


The member for Whitlam talks about wage increases from tax cuts. I think the member for Whitlam should actually go and read a few things about what's happening in the USA, because they have reduced their corporate rate of tax. What's happened? Millions upon millions of workers in the USA are receiving pay increases. Many of them are receiving $1,000 cash bonuses from their employees. That is what is happening. That is the evidence of what is happening when you reduce the corporate rate of tax. 


If we go back in our nation's history and we look at every single time we have reduced the percentage rate of corporate tax, do you know what's happened? Without fail, we have ended up with not only more tax revenue but more corporate tax as a percentage of GDP at a lower rate of tax. So we've not only grown the pie; we've ended up with a bigger slice of that bigger pie in taxation revenue. 


No-one knows and no-one can guarantee that that will be exactly what happens in the future, but we have seen it every time in our nation. We saw it recently in New Zealand, where their conservative government lowered the rate of corporate tax. What happened in New Zealand? Wages rose, revenue rose and the government ended up with more revenue, not less. Everything tells us that the same will happen here in Australia.


We've also heard the member for Whitlam rant on about electricity prices. It's so timely that the member for Port Adelaide is in the chamber at this time. You learn as a young child that if you put your hand in the fire you get burnt and then you don't put your hand in the fire again. The way we progress—whether it's in business, as a society or even as a species—is by a series of small-scale experiments where we try something a little bit different. If it fails, we stop immediately and go down another track. If it works, we duplicate it and we roll it out. There has been a thought that a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target—or should I correctly say a 50 per cent compulsory, forced government mandate for generation of intermittent and unreliable energy—would actually lower the price of electricity. That's what many theorists thought, and that's fair enough. If you're thinking about a new idea, it's good that people put their different views and opinions forward. 


We've had this experiment of a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target conducted before our very eyes in South Australia. It has ended in tears. It is probably one of the greatest policy failures in our nation's history at any level. It has delivered that state the most unreliable energy, forcing them to spend half a billion dollars in a state of 1.7 million people in a desperate attempt to keep the lights on by bringing in emergency diesel generators to have on stand-by. Not only that, on top of that it has delivered that state the highest electricity prices anywhere in the world.


Common sense would tell you that if you've tried that experiment and it has been an unmitigated disaster, you'd say, 'Yes, we failed,' you'd pull back and you'd go down another track. That's how we progress. As I said, if you put your hand in the fire and you get burnt, you learn as a young child that you don't do it. Yet we have seen the Labor Party look at South Australia and say, 'Let's copy the 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target and take it nationwide.' This is insane. This is completely nuts. And yet this is the Labor Party's policy on energy—to copy an unmitigated disaster, a failed experiment. It will see pensioners in this nation being unable to heat their homes in winter, it will turn air-conditioning into a luxury good; and businesses will be no longer viable so will be forced to move offshore because of the high cost of energy in this nation. That is what the Labor Party wants to copy.


I call on good members of the Labor Party to speak up in your party room—put aside trying to attract a handful of Greens inner-city votes. Think of the pensioners, the workers and the coalminers that the Labor Party used to stand up for. Ben Chifley would be rolling in his grave if he saw the plans of what they did—a Labor policy that pushed electricity prices up—and how they were selling out the pensioners and workers of this country just to attract a few inner-city Greens votes.


In the time left on this appropriation bill, I'd quickly like to raise the issue of electric cars. There's been quite a bit of debate about this recently in the media. In fact, even the Chief Scientist has chipped into the debate. He's taken the role of chief subsidy seeker in an article he wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald the other week. The Chief Scientist gets it wrong in many respects. The first place he gets it wrong is that the debate is not for or against electric cars. We're not arguing against electric cars. The debate is: should electric cars be subsidised in Australia? That's what the debate is about. Let's take a simple proposition. If electric cars are so great—and they certainly are; they have many wonderful benefits, and I'm the first to acknowledge that—why do they need a subsidy? Why do they need to be subsidised if they are so great?


Our job in government should be to level the playing field between technologies, to let them compete against each other as vigorously as they possibly can, to let them put the best offer they can to the consumer and to let the consumer decide. We shouldn't suppose that we know better down here in Canberra what car the consumer should buy. We should just level the playing field and let the consumer decide. But we already have a substantial range of subsidies for electric cars in this country. We have subsidised finance. We have the fact that electric cars make no contribution to the fuel excise. We have a luxury car tax break. We have subsidised registrations and stamp duty. There's subsidised charging, and we have a tax office ruling that allows very generous deductions.


The argument that's put forward for these subsidies and for more subsidies the electric car industry is asking for is that electric cars will lower emissions—that it's good for the environment. To take the words of the Chief Scientist, we should test this hypothesis with the evidence. And we can look at the evidence, because we can use the science and the maths to make a calculation of the grams of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometre travelled. That is something we can do. In fact, we do that with the Green Vehicle Guide that the government puts out. It is very handy; it does a good job. But it does, unfortunately, leave out a few things. I doesn't make any allowance for the losses for the transmission and distribution of electricity. That should add an extra 10 per cent onto the CO2 emissions of electric cars. It also makes no allowance for the fact that there are substantially higher manufacturing emissions for electric cars. And that's not just my supposition. That's from a study titled 'Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles' published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, where the authors estimate that emissions from electric vehicles produce between 87 and 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre, compared with 44 grams of CO2 associated with a standard petrol or diesel car engine.


The other thing it fails to look at is that when you charge your car from the grid you'll mostly charge it at night, and the carbon intensity of our grids, especially in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, is substantially higher at night. For example, over the last few nights in New South Wales 99 per cent of the electricity came from coal. We know that our hydro plants and our gas plants in New South Wales are used as peaking plants. And, of course, we have no solar at night. Also, it makes no allowance for the fact that when you turn the heater on in an electric car you use substantially more energy than you do in a petrol car. That is because in a petrol car the heat from your heater comes from the passenger engine, and in an electric car it is an almost purely electric heater. When you factor all those things in, there is simply no case for subsidies for electric cars in this nation.


The CO2 emissions, almost on a like-for-like basis, are higher in almost every circumstance. Even the good old Toyota Corolla, our most popular selling car, has lower emissions than a Tesla. I know the Chief Scientist says in his article, 'Oh, yes, but there's the Renault Zoe, which only emits 121 grams per kilometre.' But what he doesn't say is that Renault has another vehicle called the Megane, which is a petrol/diesel car that has lower CO2 emissions at 115 grams of CO2 per kilometre driven. We're often told that the future will be all electric. Earlier this week, we had the publication of the Annual Energy Outlook for 2018 from the US Energy Information Administration. It makes projections out to 2050, the middle of this century. They predict that plug-in electric vehicles in the US, by 2050, will only make up 14 per cent of the US passenger car fleet. Over 80 per cent of the vehicles—




Mr Butler:
  Who said that?




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I hear the member for Port Adelaide. Obviously he is uninformed in this case and I'm happy to send it to him. This is from none other than the US Energy Information Administration. That is their latest projections out to 2050. That is what they project. You may have other projections, you may have other information or you may be making it up, like you've previously done. I notice the member for Grayndler is another culprit in this. The two gentlemen sitting at the table have talked about how thermal coal is in rapid decline. I hope they've looked at the evidence over the last 12 months and seen we've had record exports of coal. Both of you sitting down there have stood up in the media and made ridiculous comments about the decline of exports of thermal coal, and yet we have had the largest increase in coal exports in our nation's history. Everywhere around the world—Japan is importing more thermal coal; China's coal consumption last year was up by 5.2 per cent. I will leave my remarks there. I'd be more than happy at any time to give the two gentlemen at the table a briefing so they don't make so many silly comments in the media and embarrass themselves.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:27):  Australians are a reasonable people. With only one exception in our history, Australian voters have given federal governments at least two terms in office. That's enough time to implement their policies and for evidence to emerge as to whether those policies have worked as promised. Voters listen to what we say as parliamentarians. They want proof that the government can actually deliver what it promises. They want a government with a sense of purpose, with a narrative for what it wants to do in office and where it wants to take the country. They want a government that not only anticipates the future but, by its actions, helps to create that future. What is very clear is that for this Prime Minister, in particular, his only objective has been to occupy the Lodge. You can see the lack of foresight and forward thinking when it comes to infrastructure investment, and that is what I want to concentrate on in my contribution to this appropriations debate in the parliament this evening. 


The fact is that this government has cut infrastructure investment and it will continue to cut infrastructure investment into the future. The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that, based upon the government's own figures, infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP will fall from 0.4 to 0.2 per cent over the next decade. It will halve.


If you look at the specific budget figures, you can see why that's occurring. The estimate of what the government would invest on infrastructure in the 2016-17 financial year, as announced on budget night, was $9.2 billion. If you look at the actual investment, it was $7.5 billion—or a $1.7 billion underspend—in circumstances when, because of the mining boom moving from the investment to the production phase, we should have been stepping up investment in infrastructure. But over the forward estimates it gets worse. Over the forward estimates, the amount of infrastructure investment will fall off a cliff to $4.2 billion.


We raised these questions this week in parliament with the hapless and helpless infrastructure minister, who happens to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. What we've learnt is that the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, does not have a clue about this portfolio, despite the fact that he was appointed to the position last year after a long period of stalking the former minister for infrastructure, the member for Gippsland. We asked the minister why, for example, Victoria, home to one in four Australians, receives only nine per cent of the Commonwealth infrastructure budget. Victoria is Australia's fastest-growing state. Melbourne is Australia's fastest-growing city. Yet this government chooses to allocate under 10 per cent of the budget.


In fact, in his answer he raised the $1.5 billion that was forwarded under the East West Link project, determined by the Abbott government in 2014, which the people of Victoria rejected when they elected the Daniel Andrews government. It's not surprising that they rejected it, given it had a benefit-to-cost ratio of just 45c return for every dollar that would have been invested in that project. But, of course, because of the incompetent way in which the government have dealt with infrastructure and their budgetary policies, they'd already forwarded $1.5 billion as an advance payment to Victoria for this project before it had its business case.


This is a government that says that it had a policy of only making milestone payments once something was actually being built. But that $1.5 billion was, of course, reallocated to a range of projects just last year when they realised that it was unsustainable to have that money simply sitting in the bank account of the Victorian government and not building anything, which is what had occurred over the previous couple of years. But the infrastructure minister didn't seem to know that that was the case—just like today, when, in answer to a question from his own side, he then went through and claimed rail projects such as the Regional Rail Link that were funded by the former Labor government and projects like the M80 as well.


We also asked him why he was cutting infrastructure investment in South Australia from $921.4 million in the current year to just $95 million in 2019-20. That represents South Australia receiving just two per cent of the national infrastructure budget in spite of the fact that the government have said they support the upgrading of the entire North-South Corridor road; in spite of the fact that the project between Torrens to Torrens and the South Road Superway is the next one ready to be progressed; in spite of the fact that the Prime Minister says he supports public transport, but the Gawler line electrification is ready to go and is waiting for funding; and in spite of the fact that the South Australian government has developed the AdeLINK light rail expansion to improve mobility and deal with urban congestion in that state. His response was to simply talk about the portfolio of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and defence spending rather than infrastructure and transport spending, which is what he's actually responsible for. We asked why the government allocated $100 million to the Northern Australia Roads Program last year but actually spent $12 million, so there was an underspend of 88 per cent in that program at a time when they say they care about northern Australia. I note that the member for Solomon, who is in the chamber, can certainly identify roads that could have been funded in his electorate around Darwin and Palmerston and could have benefitted from that program. What we heard from the infrastructure minister was quite revealing in that he talked about the Nullarbor Plain. He wasn't quite sure where the Northern Territory and northern Australia is. He talked about the Nullarbor, which says it all about his failure in this area.


Perhaps the worst response from the infrastructure minister, who showed that, frankly, he's out of his depth in that portfolio, was his response to a question we raised about infrastructure investment in Tasmania. Since the change of government in 2013, we've seen a funding cut for the Midland Highway upgrade and a funding cut for the rail revitalisation program. Remarkably, for Tasmania, not a single new major infrastructure project funded by the federal government has begun—nothing in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018. The infrastructure minister referred to the Inland Rail project. If you look at a map of Australia, between the north island, where we are now, and the south island of Tasmania is the Bass Strait. I've got news for the minister for infrastructure: inland rail does not cross the Bass Strait. He should know that because, in fact, inland rail goes nowhere near water at all. It doesn't go to the Port of Melbourne and it stops 38 kilometres short of the Port of Brisbane, at Acacia Ridge. It's quite remarkable.


Today we asked why the government had spent $1 billion less than promised in Queensland in the past four years. Again, there was no response. There was no understanding that what we were talking about wasn't what Labor thought should happen in Queensland. What we were talking about were their own budget papers in their first four budgets and what they said they would spend, and matching that up with actual investment. That cut is due to a failure to invest in programs in Queensland and right around the country. Money was allocated for things such as the Mobile Black Spot Program and the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. At a time when, after decades of a declining road toll, we've had the road toll increase, we have an underspend of half the funds that were allocated for heavy vehicle rest stops. That is a remarkable indictment of the incompetence of this government. That is this government's record on infrastructure.


The total underspend between the 2014-15 budget—its first budget—and 2017-18 has now hit $4.8 billion. Now, occasionally, it may well be that a road project or a rail project has to be deferred slightly because of weather events or because of circumstances beyond the government's control. I accept that that can happen. But this is happening across every state and territory every year, for road and rail projects large and small. That comes down to a simple case of incompetence. The difference between the budget that they announced in May 2017 and the MYEFO that they put out at the end of last year showed a reduction of $914 million—and we're not even there yet. That's what they cut from when they made the big announcements in May, and now we see what's actually happening. On major road projects alone, the underspend is $2.8 billion. That is why Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said, 'The budget confirms the cut to real budgeted capital funding to its lowest level in more than a decade—using a mix of underspend, reprofiling and narrative to cover this substantial drop in real capital expenditure.' There are two ways you can grow an economy: invest in infrastructure or invest in people through education and training. This government is doing neither, which is why it's not creating the conditions for growth in the future economy and for future employment and opportunity for Australians.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (18:42):  I'm very pleased to talk about a very important economic development initiative in my electorate, the Myalup-Wellington project. This is a significant economic development project. It is an industry-led initiative and it will do a number of things in the irrigation space. It is about substantially increasing production capacity. It will create jobs. It will provide economic uplift in what is the underdeveloped Collie River Irrigation District and the Myalup Irrigated Agricultural Precinct.


The project is a major opportunity to help diversify Western Australia's regional economy through irrigated agriculture. Anyone who understands irrigation understands the capabilities of irrigated agriculture. Currently, just 6,557 hectares of the available 34,600 hectares of the Collie River, Harvey and Waroona districts are actually irrigated. The Myalup-Wellington project is an industry-led initiative. It will see saline water that's currently flowing into the Wellington Dam diverted from the Collie River east branch to a mine void, with that water then treated in a new desalination plant. A new, smaller Burekup weir will be built upstream to enable water delivery to be powered by gravity—what a great way to go; environmentally sustainable because it is powered by gravity. The irrigation channels will be replaced with a new, pressurised pipe network. So it is a simple concept. It's about desalination. It's about piping. It's about a delivery network. It will boost horticultural, agricultural and forestry opportunities—what a great combination! It will create jobs and an economic uplift. It will attract even further investment in the region and it will diversify the south-west regional economy.


The old Wellington Dam was built back in 1933 with Commonwealth funding. The salinity in that amazing dam has risen significantly. The Collie River east branch contributes up to 14 per cent of the annual flow and up to 55 per cent of the annual salt load into the Wellington Dam. When you put that in other terms, this means that each year this east branch is delivering between 60,000 and 110,000 tonnes of salt into the Wellington Dam. That's what part of this project is about—the increase in the salinity over the years and how we manage that. There are districts that are choosing, because of this salinity below the Wellington Dam, not to actually irrigate their properties or irrigate as much of them. The productivity isn't there in the same way. That is because of that possibility and risk of soil degradation. So it's important that we deal with the salinity issue as well as the piping process for the delivery of the water ahead.


Existing open channels created in 1960 will be replaced with a closed pipe network. This will save at least 15 gigalitres of water a year currently lost through seepage, leakage or evaporation. The pipe network will replace the open channel system and allow expansion of the amount of land that's currently under irrigation. This will see a piped system from the Collie River Irrigation District to the Myalup Irrigated Agricultural Precinct which will re-inject water from the Wellington Dam into aquifers in the Myalup area to address the issues around volume and salinity concerns in that area.


There's also an idea to re-inject stormwater collected in the Harvey diversion drain. That's also part of the proposal. This is a very sound proposal. It will bring incredible opportunities to the south-west. Around 10 gigalitres a year of potable water from the desal plant will be sold into Water Corp's Great Southern Towns Water Supply Scheme and stored in the Harris dam. There will be ongoing opportunities. It is a fantastic irrigation system, a series of dams in the hills, with water delivered in a gravity-fed pipe-and-channel system. It's simple, it's effective and it delivers. There have been many innovative solutions as part of the sustainable techniques in this multi-awarded delivery system.


I also want to talk about the Bunbury outer ring road. A major development is needed to finish the whole of the Bunbury outer ring road. At the moment, it's like a stranded T-junction. The federal government recently committed $10 million to complete the planning and the project development of the unbuilt sections—the northern and southern sections. This is currently underway. There are new developments in the area proposed. The planning and project development for the bypass will help to reduce congestion, improve safety and—this is the key issue—provide an efficient freight route. It is a major economic driver in the south-west as well.


Of course, we need to deliver on issues around the Forrest Highway, Robertson Drive and Bussell Highway, which are experiencing congestion and safety challenges, mainly with access to the Bunbury Port for road freight. It's currently inefficient, with trucks having to negotiate over and over again several low-speed roundabouts. They compete constantly with local commuter traffic. We need really to reduce the congestion on the existing roads, reduce that dangerous mix of heavy freight and local traffic, and encourage sustainable, economic growth in residential and industrial development so they can get on with what they do around Bunbury and support planning. This is part of the proposal for pedestrian, cycling, public transport and passenger rail and freight solutions and that safe and reliable freight route to the port of Bunbury. We need to seriously improve the efficiencies in the supply chain. 


We have a growing population in the south-west. We have the highest population in the state outside of Perth, and we need to make sure that we keep developing in this region. Those freight accesses are really critical. There are around 300 truck movements a day into the port. That tells you about the mix between local and freight traffic. The port traffic needs to get on with what it does, and local people need a safe way of getting to and from where they're going. 


The port is of such huge, often underestimated, economic importance to Bunbury, the whole of the south-west and the state of Western Australia. It's existed since the 1800s, and we are now seeing the amazing—I think it's amazing—export of alumina. It is the biggest alumina export port in Australia—in Bunbury, in my electorate. I'm very proud of that. I'm proud of the people who produce it, deliver it and ship it out of the port of Bunbury. There are also woodchips, mineral sands, spodumene, silica sands, grain and bauxite, a new export, out of Bunbury, and I'm hoping we'll see lithium as well. 


There are over 10 million tonnes of alumina going out of Bunbury. Every time I see a shipload going out, I think how great it is for our regional economy and the jobs that we are so focused on as a government. Of course, added to that, there are all of the services around the port: the transport services, the maritime services. When the tugs go out, you see how well those men do their job, and the precision of what they do with the vessels that come in is extraordinary to watch. 


Of course, part of this is some of the volunteer groups that operate in and around the port. I want to mention the Bunbury Sea Rescue group. They do a fantastic job. They have 35 volunteers and do so many callouts on a regular basis. They are absolutely vital to ensuring the local marine environment is safe. All those people who choose to go out and enjoy themselves need the Bunbury Sea Rescue group of volunteers. The group are very, very proud—and they should be—of their 11-metre Elite Marine aluminium cat. It has twin—which is the bit I like—740 horsepower Volvo Penta diesel engines and, when that vessel starts up, she's got all the power she needs to do the job that sea rescue need her to do. 


All of these volunteers dedicate an enormous amount of time and effort to their sea rescue efforts. They work very closely with the Western Australia Police in search-and-rescue operations. They are totally volunteer. We often see these people, but we don't think about the amount of time that goes into their training and their efforts. They also educate people on safe boating and survival at sea. They train volunteers as skippers, crews and radio operators. I want to thank all of those at the Bunbury Sea Rescue group for what they do. It's an incredible commitment you make to the safety not only of people who live in our community but also of those who visit. I saw recently where some of the skippers, particularly Michael Cooper and Brett Ladhams, had been doing some work. Michael received an award recently for the amount of time he's spent as a volunteer and, each time one of these members receive a long service recognition, I cannot believe how much time they've spent volunteering. 


The Busselton Volunteer Marine Rescue Group also does a fantastic job. They run out of a state-of-the-art control room, housed in the Busselton Volunteer Marine Rescue Group's headquarters. It is very well located. It has the latest radar, marine radios and weather station and it is also equipped with an AIS—an automatic identifying system tracking device. There is a fabulous group of volunteers. They don't even expect to be thanked for what they do; they're just there. They're absolutely dedicated to safety at sea. It's a simple ambition for these people, but what a wonderful thing to deliver. Their core function is rescuing people. That's what they do: they rescue people; they save lives. And they also help with yachting regattas, outrigger races, the Busselton Jetty swim, the IRONMAN of Western Australia and whale rescues. They are a great group of people. Busselton has 85 volunteers. Of course, there are very active members and others who are not so active. They are such a welcoming group of people that so many others want to be part of this organisation. That's because of the sense of family and the purpose they have in rescuing people and providing what is an invaluable service. They answer approximately 300 callouts a year. These are all volunteers. 


I spoke a couple of days ago about our surf lifesavers and the extraordinary service and the thousands and thousands of hours of their own that they give to make sure they are trained and ready to provide these extraordinary emergency services. For all of those who are involved in emergency services, but particularly the Bunbury Sea Rescue Group and the Busselton Volunteer Marine Rescue Group, I want to say a special thankyou to each one of them. You give up your time, and it costs you money to be a volunteer. What you're doing is rescuing good people, but you're saving lives, and it's one of the most important contributions that you can make—whether it is St John Ambulance, with its extraordinary number of volunteers, or whether it is our volunteer Fire and Rescue people. Our volunteers were amazing with the fire at Augusta. They were on the job straightaway and they saved so many homes and so many people. That fire could have been well out of control but for the work of our volunteers. As always, I'm very supportive of the volunteers who do an extraordinary job right around Australia, but particularly in my electorate. Thank you.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:57):  I too would like to participate in this debate, but I would like to draw some attention to what I see as shortcomings within this government. One thing I've learnt since viewing the activities of the Turnbull government is that we should pay attention not to what they say but to what they do. And I think there's a clear measure of that when you look at what this government has done. Bear in mind, this is the government of Work Choices—that was their origin; that was their commitment. They wanted to reduce the workers' ability in respect to wage rises; they wanted employers to pay people below award rates of pay. It's in their DNA. 


None of this has changed. Work Choices moved to lower the standard of living, and this government continues to do that. They certainly have made a move to cut the standard of living of pensioners, those on disability support, the unemployed, young people. And now they want us to believe that they've changed; that they've turned over a new leaf, as it were. It wasn't that long ago that this mob opposite were banging on about how what we need is budget repair. That's putting it mildly. They talked about a budget emergency or a deficit disaster. They pounded on about that before the last election. But what do we see now? Under this government's watch, the deficit is blowing out and the debt has now crashed through the half-trillion dollar mark.


This is a government of misplaced priorities, with a signature policy of handing out $65 billion to multinationals and big business. This policy is all inspired by the government's misconceived views about trickle-down economics. I'll tell you what: that wasn't one of the terms in any of the economics books I had to read when I was studying. But they have placed all their faith in that—that the more we give the top end of town, the more they'll pass it on. As I said last week, pigs might fly. Yet this is their signature policy with which they want to take the Australian community under their wing, saying, 'Trust us; this'll be all okay.'


Well, as I say, don't listen to what they say; look at what they do. At this time we have unemployment and casualisation at an all-time high. We have stagnant living standards. We have a diminished number of apprenticeships. We have a housing affordability crisis. And the only plan the government has is, quite frankly, to make it hard for families who are battling already. Just a piece of advice for those opposite: if you can't afford to give, straight out, business $65 billion, simply don't do it. But don't do it at the expense of the most vulnerable Australians. That's not what government is about. This is not Robin Hood taking from the rich and giving to the poor. From what they're doing, they misread that book; they're taking from the poor to reward the rich. The government's approach is unfair and ill considered. The type of growth they are targeting is not the right type of growth that this country needs. And it is unaffordable, particularly at a time when this government has the budget in a big mess.


Since this government's economic plan was first introduced, we have talked about the extremely minimal impact that these proposed tax cuts for big business will have. We are talking about giving $65 billion to the top end of town—the top corporates and the multinationals. But the economists have reminded us that it will have negligible economic benefit. As a matter of fact, they have modelled this. It has a benefit of one per cent over the next 20 years—that's to say, in terms of wages, a $2 a day increase in the wages per person in 20 years time. That's what they're basing all this on. No wonder they want to move to cut pensions or make it more difficult for pensions and why they want to move on family tax benefits, and why they are moving on universities and on schools. This is all to pay for this unfunded $65 billion tax cut to big business.


The Treasurer's economic modelling certainly is a one-trick pony. He expects that, if he can give away this money, we are going to see miraculous results within the community. As I say, he believes—as I presume those opposite, if they are shaking their heads, do too—that the more we give the top end of town, the more they're going to feel obliged to expend that in higher wages for their employees. I just don't think the world works that way. This is the same trickle-down approach that has dominated, quite frankly, the last three budgets delivered by the Treasurer.


I've found a comment by a person who I know is friends of people on both sides of this parliament, and I am referring to Father Frank Brennan. He is the CEO of Catholic Social Services. He succinctly summarised this position that the government's wedded to, about their tax cuts. He said:


Our tax and transfer system is critical to ensuring a fairer Australia … Placing the burden of budget repair on those who can least afford it, while providing tax cuts to the wealthy and businesses, is wrong morally and economically.


We agree with that. If Father Frank is making comments like that, he is sure as hell talking to those on the other side and making sure that they understand that.


I am not sure how rusted on those opposite are to this. We would like to think that they will take this to the next election, because those of us who spent a bit of time in our electorates over Christmas know that this is totally unpopular. People get what's occurring here. People get that the government are making cuts that affect families and hardworking people all to further their tax cuts for business. At the same time, the government want to take $17 billion from our schools, $2.2 billion from our universities and almost $650 million from vocational education through our TAFE system—and all of this when we are moving from crisis to crisis in health. In that environment, is it worth giving the top end of town $65 billion? By the way, in the last 12 months, the top end of town has averaged a 20 per cent profit. Does that trickle down anywhere? Wages growth has flatlined, so it hasn't trickled down too far.


I will just highlight some of the ramifications of these cuts. I have spoken a number of times about our schools. I would expect that all members here would, from time to time, visit their schools and their principals to get an idea of how they are going and get an understanding of the practical ramifications of the cuts that the government is now making. In my electorate, under the cuts that the government proposes, our schools will lose $24.8 million in funding. In my discussions with the Western Sydney University last week, they told me that the government's proposed cuts, which they are instituting through the freeze on Commonwealth funding grants, in this year alone will amount to $5.7 million. The university told me that they are going to have to take a lot of their focus away from business and, for example, their start-up incubator.


All the things that the Prime Minister once said were essential for growth in Western Sydney are going to be ratcheted back because of these cuts. These cuts are unfair and are painful for communities such as Western Sydney. This just goes to prove that the government can't be trusted when it comes to the most important investments for our nation. An investment in education is an investment in our future. We need to have the best and brightest if we are going to compete in the world. But that is lost on this government. You don't make cuts to institutions that are responsible for developing skills and training and all those things that we are going to need in an advanced economy to be able compete with the rest of the world—but the government is slashing those institutions.


We see this same sentiment reflected in the government's health policy, where the government failed to reverse their unfair 2020 Medicare freeze. They are effectively asking Australians to pay more for their health care than they should be paying. Over the next four years this amounts to a cut of about $2.2 billion from Medicare, and that is in addition to the savings already banked by the government. The Turnbull government has been cutting Medicare and threatening bulk-billing. I would just remind the House that this is the same bunch that, when they had half a chance, wanted to move to privatise parts of Medicare—and now they want us to believe that they've changed their position. The fact is that the Prime Minister cares only about his own political health, not about the health of those in our community.


The government claim that we have an NDIS emergency and, in a rather cynical way, they are now pretending that there is only one way to address this—through a good old-fashioned tax hike for low-income earners. They want to tax the seven million Australians earning less than $87,000. They say, 'This is the only way we can do it, yet we still want to hand out $65 billion to the top end of town.' What does it mean for the real workers out there? The average household income in my electorate is just a tad over $65,000. For a worker on $55,000, it means that they will be paying an extra $270 a year, and someone on $80,000 a year will be paying around $400 extra tax a year. This is all happening when we know that the corporate profit level is running at around 20 per cent—average profits at 20 per cent over the last 12 months. Yet they still want to think that the only way ahead for our economy is to give big business a bigger slice of the pie, a bigger tax cut, in the belief that it will trickle down to everybody else. While they're doing that, as I said earlier, wages growth has largely flatlined. It's at a record low. Currently it's at 1.9 per cent. That's not the environment in which you want to go out and reward big business that's already making big profits. They're not distributing that to their workers; otherwise it wouldn't be running at 1.9 per cent, as it is now.


Our families are facing rising electricity costs and significant unemployment; 1.1 million Australians are experiencing underemployment. And this government has nothing better to offer than a $65 billion corporate tax cut. When you've got stagnant wage growth and rising inequity, on a background that's already felt the wrath of antiworker legislation passed by this government, no wonder this is a government that did not lift a finger to stop the slashing of penalty rates that now affects 700,000 Australian workers. By the way, these are some of the most low-paid Australian workers, and it's going to cost them up to $77 per week.


We need a government that actually understands community and puts community first. Clearly that's not what this government's doing. This government fails to see the real value of people's pay packets going down and electricity and private health care skyrocketing. We are in a housing affordability crisis, with household debt at record levels. We have high unemployment and job insecurity and a government that is wagering our futures on trickle-down economics.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:12):  Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-2018 is an appropriation bill, and, while Labor has said that it will not block supply, this debate gives us a chance to talk more broadly about the government's agenda and the impact that the government's agenda is having in regional communities, particularly my own community of Bendigo.


A couple of surprises were in the MYEFO this year that hit regional communities tough. One that I particularly wish to highlight is the way in which funding has been ripped away from universities—the freezing of university places. At the Bendigo campus of La Trobe University, in my electorate, they were very concerned about the impact that this cut in support for students would have on all of their regional campuses. In Bendigo, in Shepparton, in Wodonga they feared that with a freezing of university places people would chose to go to the city first, and once the city was full there'd be no places left for the regions. It is typical of this government: they randomly put out these policies, these blunt instruments, without really consulting with the sector, without really asking what impact this would have. The Bendigo campus was hoping that because they have some flagship courses, like dentistry, and because their rural school of health is world-class then that would help attract people to Bendigo as their first choice. 


We also know that freezing university places would make it harder for regional students, people who are re-entering the work force and seeking to upgrade their skills, and mature-aged students—who are a large proportion of our regional campuses—to go to university. The fact is that if you live outside of metro Melbourne you can knock points off your ATAR score; you can knock points off your university entry level score. In Queensland, if you go to school in some regional areas, like on the Sunshine Coast or in Gympie, they say that you knock two points off your OP. If you go to an average school—a state school, not an elite school—you can knock points off of your OP because of the way in which the system has been designed. Kids that are equally as bright, but disadvantaged because of their school marking, could miss out on university places because of this government's freeze—a random arbitrary freeze with no proper consultation with the sector about how it would happen.


The MYEFO also confirmed this government's addiction to their $65 billion in handouts and tax cuts to multinationals. This is at a time when they keep talking about budget repair. Rather than getting the companies that are making the profits—that are making the most money—to actually contribute towards our common wealth, they're making working people on low to middle incomes pay more in the way of tax. The rhetoric of this government—they twist themselves up. Regarding the $65 billion in tax cuts, they actually believe, or they're trying to mislead the Australian people by saying, that, if you give the companies more profits, they'll give it to workers. That is nonsense. It has never happened. The only times that workers actually get a pay rise is when they bargain for it or when it's awarded to them by the Fair Work Commission. It is so rare for a company to say, 'Here is a wage increase just because we like you.'


Talk to the mining workers in Queensland. We found out last week that many of these multinationals who will get a handout under the government's plan have had a massive increase in revenue in the last 12 months. The returns are in and their net export value is up. In coal, it's up 35 per cent. Across all of the mining sectors, including gold from my electorate, it is up 52 per cent. These companies are making mega profits, yet we haven't seen the wages for their workers go up at all. In fact, we've seen the reverse. More and more workers are being told: 'You've lost your job. You have to re-apply for labour hire. It's less money.' I've met coalminers in Central Queensland who've lost 80 per cent of their entitlements—the extra bonuses that they get. They've gone back to the basic-wage structure. I've met people who have been told: 'You no longer work directly for BHP'—or Glencore or Anglo American—'You now work for a labour hire company. It is full-time equivalent, with similar responsibilities, similar expectations of you and the same uniform, but you're getting paid $30,000 to $50,000 a year less.' This is what's happening in Australian workplaces, yet the government wants us to believe that if we give companies money they'll give it to workers. Bring in the instrument. Bring in the legislation to make companies do it, because they won't. We know that they won't, because they never have without us having robust enterprise bargaining rules.


What is also contained in the MYEFO is the government's plan to increase tax on low- and middle-income earners. This comes back to priorities. Rather than asking the companies that are making all of the profits to help contribute towards our common wealth, they're increasing the Medicare levy, which is basically increasing the taxes for low- and middle-income earners, the same group of people that has not had a decent pay rise. Australians need a pay rise. These are the same people that may have had their penalty rates cut. Again, this government—I nearly said 'company', because it acts a bit like a company—did nothing to stop the Fair Work Commission cutting penalty rates. It is this place that sets the rules for the Fair Work Commission. When they make a decision that is not in the best interests of working people, when they make a decision that sees 700,000 Australian workers cop a pay cut, this place should reset the rules to make sure that those workers do keep their penalty rates. These are some of the lowest-paid workers that we have in our community, yet this government did nothing. They stood back, let their penalty rates be cut and then doubled down and said, 'For those of you working full time and earning more than $20,000 a year, we're actually going to hit you with an increased tax by increasing the Medicare levy.'


We also saw in the MYEFO an attack on our pensioners. I guess we shouldn't be surprised, because we had the minister responsible for this area stand up in question time and say, 'The solution to the deeming rates for pensioners, because they're so low, is for them to go out and get a job.' They're now saying to people over the age of 70, over the age of 65, 'The reason why we're not going to look at your pension is we think you should go out there and get a job, and that's the role of government.' They've worked hard enough. It's time that they get a chance to enjoy their retirement. It's already hard for people to keep working to the age of 70, particularly in industries which are labour intensive, whether it be carpentry or nursing. Any job that involves physical movement is very hard to do to the age of 70. It's not like being a politician or working at a desk.


Not to mention it's an equity issue. They've worked hard. They deserve respect in retirement. But what we've seen from this government is not only are they not doing anything about deeming rates but they've also continued their pursuit to ditch the energy supplement. At a time when gas and energy prices are spiralling high and continue to go high, this government wants to ditch the energy supplement, which will leave pensioners $366 a year worse off. They also still want to increase the pension age to 70. It demonstrates again how out of touch they are with older Australians. Despite all of the guarantees of the government, all they've guaranteed are high energy prices. That's all this government has guaranteed.


I met with some pensioners in my electorate during winter. They brought their winter bills in to talk about how they'd gone up. Let's remember the rhetoric of this government when they were in opposition. All their ranting about debt and deficit, all their ranting about the carbon tax, all their promises of '$550 back in your back pocket', all their promises to get debt under control—they've failed on two of their key election campaigns. The pensioners that I met with didn't have an extra $550 in their back pocket because of this government. No. Many of them were saying, 'We're actually paying more than we ever have for our energy bills, and they continue to go up.' I've mentioned the push of the pension age to 70. This again demonstrates that they have very little understanding of what kind of jobs people can do until they're 70. If people want to work until they're 70, we should encourage them, but we shouldn't make it mandatory. It's hard to be a plumber, a carpenter, a nurse or a cleaner until you're 70. We should show older Australians respect and support them.


This government is also failing spectacularly at helping connect jobseekers with the jobs that are available. I was in Tasmania last week talking to some of our berry, apple and fruit industry. Some of their jobs are seasonal. They are concerned about what's going to happen in the peak picking season for them. They need about 2,000 workers in this part of Tasmania. In the north-west, they need about 6,000 workers for harvest, which is eight weeks. But what I did learn by being there is that a lot of their work—their pruning work, their packing work—is ongoing. It is almost full time—11 months, 12 months of continuous work. Yet the job agencies in those areas—jobactive, whatever name you want to give it—had failed to match people looking for work with the jobs that are available.


Another example in my own electorate is a meatworks in Kyneton that is keen to employ locals looking for a job. All the job agencies, the job networks, had failed to connect the jobseekers. The people that they kept bringing out were vegans, vegetarians and the long-term unemployed. It took Bendigo Community Health Services resettlement officers and myself meeting with the company, doing the walkthrough and basically being the matchmaking service to get recently arrived migrants of Karen and Afghani descent working there—and now they are working!


It's a great news story, but it should be something that happens automatically because of the priorities of a government that invests properly in supporting people to work. The job agency, jobactive—whatever fancy name this government gives—aren't working. 


The other area where this government is failing is on jobs. They say all these new jobs have been created under their watch, but what jobs? How many insecure jobs are there? How many casual jobs are there? How many jobs are full-time but working for labour hire so people can be sacked at any minute? We have a real crisis going on in our economy when it comes to jobs. Young people can't get entry-level jobs. Companies are now looking overseas, because they can get experienced overseas workers to come here, before investing and training in our own workers.


Just yesterday we had this government push through a bill in this House that stripped labour market testing out of our 457 visa system. Why would you do that? Why would you give companies the opportunity to bring in whoever they want and not do labour market testing? They've taken it out of the legislation and said, 'Don't worry, we'll do it. We're going to create an instrument. Don't worry, trust us.' Not that that instrument is disallowable; we just have to trust them. Australians do not trust this government, and they do not trust them to stand up for jobs, health and education, and to make sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax and are accountable. 


This government is failing on education. We've just gone back to school in central Victoria, and a number of schools wanted to run programs this year that won't run because of this government's funding cuts to schools. I'm talking about senior secondary, which is $1.2 million worse off because this government did not honour the original Gonski funding model. A school like Weeroona College—$800,000 a year worse off. Just imagine the programs they could have had. Just imagine the support and the opportunities they could have given to those students. Meanwhile, Girton Grammar, just up the road, is a very good school. The parents do pay a lot in fees. That school actually got an increase in funding, close to a million dollars extra from this government. Yet the school that has the disadvantaged students, the kids most at risk and the most diverse student population gets a funding cut. 


It always comes back to priorities in budgets and budgeting, and all I can say is that this government's priorities are wrong. They're not prioritising our schools. They're not prioritising our hospitals. They're not prioritising Victorian roads and rail. They are not prioritising young jobseekers. They are not prioritising TAFE and university. Instead, what they are prioritising is big tax cuts for multinationals and making sure millionaires pay as little tax as possible.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (19:28):  In the time permitting, this could be the final in my series on the by-election of Bennelong. I have previously spoken about the tenor of the debate and some of the volunteers who stood out. However, there are many more people to thank, and I would like to try to name some more of them today. 


As with all campaigns, we would never have been successful without volunteers. Over 700 people came out to help us in this by-election—from making phone calls, handing out leaflets at train stations and standing in the baking heat of the West Ryde pre-poll or the combustible footpath of the Epping pre-poll and, of course, on polling day itself. Our hundreds of volunteers made the difference. 


Some of these people have been with us for every election. Some have just joined the Bennelong family, but every one of them raised the bar of this campaign, giving their all and making the difference at the end of the day. I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to every one of you. 


It's always dangerous to identify individuals as I will most certainly forget some people who deserve special praise. I have already called out Helen Russell, Bob Lawrence and Daryl Maguire MP, for they turned up every single day at the pre-poll and every night to make phone calls rain, hail or shine. Elizabeth Frias was a constant smiling presence at prepoll too, while local stalwart Kevin Pagadinimath was at every station and bus stop every morning. As with every year, the local Young Liberals were the difference. One silver lining of the national spotlight on this campaign was that Young Liberals came from all over the country and I was able to see that our young volunteers—

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (17:11):  I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-2018 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2017-2018, which, as always, are required to ensure the ordinary functions of the government continue for, in this case, the remainder of the 2017-18 financial year and to facilitate a number of the measures from the 2017-18 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In this case, the package of bills appropriates something like $1.5 billion from consolidated revenue. This is in addition to the appropriation acts passed in June 2017 after the budget, and these amounts are already incorporated into the budget bottom line as presented in the 2017-18 MYEFO. I should say, at the outset, that obviously we're not in the business of standing in the way of supply, although I think there are some very troubling aspects of the government's broader economic management that the House should understand and note. 


These bills do go to those broader issues around what I consider to be the mismanagement of the nation's finances. I'd like to begin by quoting not somebody from this side or a well-known critic of the government but the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister, when he was opposition leader in 2009, described a gross debt of $200 billion as 'frightening'. He promised that the Liberals wouldn't 'run willy-nilly into debt'. He later described $300 billion in projected gross debt as 'gigantic' and an 'almost inconceivable level of debt'. He had an analogy that he would trot out from time to time—I remember it well—where he'd say: 'There should be no lead weights put in his pockets or heavy backpacks put on his back.' Yet that is what this government is delivering to us with these higher and higher levels of debt.


So he said a debt projected at $300 billion was 'frightening', 'gigantic', 'almost inconceivable'. It shouldn't surprise us, then, given that was his view in opposition, that he's been a bit quieter lately about the total amount of debt on his government's watch. That's because gross debt—remember, at $300 billion it was going to be gigantic and inconceivable—has crashed through half a trillion dollars for the first time in Australian history on the Prime Minister's watch. It's currently about $515 billion with no sign, really, of slowing down. In the government's own budget papers, which we're talking about as we debate these bills, gross debt doesn't even peak over a 10-year horizon. So, for the next 10 years, after all the lectures we got about debt and deficit disasters and gigantic levels of debt at $300 billion, we are talking about $515 billion which goes up and up and up for 10 years and doesn't even peak in the next decade in the government's own budget papers. That's a pretty extraordinary thing. For a government that likes to pretend that they are somehow superior managers of the budget, we've got this record, growing debt which doesn't even peak over the medium term in the government's own budget papers. It is not an opinion; it's a fact. That's in the government's budget.


Similarly, in the same budget papers, we have got a deficit for this year which is eight times higher than the Liberals predicted in their first 2014 budget. Joe Hockey stood at that dispatch box on a Tuesday evening in May and said that the deficit for this year was going to be $2.8 billion. Then the current Treasurer, Treasurer Morrison, stood up in December, the week before Christmas—obviously very proud of his mid-year budget update; he dropped that out a few days before Christmas—and had to admit that the deficit was $23.6 billion, eight times bigger than Joe Hockey predicted in 2014.


We might have a Prime Minister who is a little less keen to talk about gigantic levels of debt but, thankfully—and always thankfully—we've got the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the member for Deakin, who always helps us out on this side of the parliament. He's the gift that keeps on giving. He has described the debt under the Turnbull-Morrison's government's watch as, 'A truckload of debt' and 'An extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary, amount of debt.' I couldn't have said it better myself. But what's more extraordinary, and probably something that not a lot of people out there in the community appreciate—probably because of the message that the government and some of their cheerleaders in the media like to send—is that debt is actually increasing. Debt, gross debt and net debt, is increasing faster under this government in good global economic conditions than it was under the former Labor government, despite the fact that we had a global financial crisis.


Again, these are not opinions. I will give you the hard numbers and people can go and check them if they like. Take gross debt, for example. Under this government, gross debt is currently being racked up $1.2 billion a month faster than it was under Labor. It is being racked up $286 million a week quicker and $41 million a day quicker under this government compared to its predecessor. If you prefer to think about net debt: net debt is being racked up $710 million a month quicker—accumulated, $163 million a week quicker and $23 million a day quicker. So both measures are being accumulated much faster than they were under the Labor Party.


Until quite recently, the old excuse from the Treasurer—whether it was Treasurer Morrison or Treasurer Hockey—has been the global conditions. If you want to talk about difficult global conditions, obviously you'd be talking about the period that the former Labor government confronted the global financial crisis, the sharpest synchronised downturn in the global economy since the Great Depression. But there was a period when Joe Hockey or the current Treasurer would talk about global conditions being the reason that they had so substantially overpromised and under delivered on debt and deficit. That excuse has well and truly gone. This is the best global economy we have had for a decade.


If those opposite don't want to take my word for it, they can look at the Reserve Bank's Statement on monetary policy which they put out on Friday. Their statement was very, very up-beat about global conditions. In fact, at the start of the overview, they say:


Global economic conditions picked up further over the course of 2017.


They talk about the strength continuing into 2018. They are talking about the global economy. They talk about growth in a lot of those big economies being above 'estimates of potential'. They talk about favourable commodity prices, 'stronger than expected growth' in advanced economies and 'synchronised improvement in global growth' boosting commodity prices. There are all sorts of indications in the Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy that this global economy that we are in right now—leaving aside, of course, some of the actions and over-reactions to it in the stock market, but just in the real economy of growth and jobs and all of that—the global conditions are quite spectacularly positive. So, there's no excuse for the sorts of budget outcomes that we're getting at the moment. The IMF's most recent world economic outlook—last month, January 2018—says:


Global economic activity continues to firm up. Global output is estimated to have grown by 3.7 percent in 2017, which is 0.1 percentage point faster than projected in the fall and ½ percentage point higher than in 2016.


So the IMF is revising up its forecasts. All of this is a way of saying that when it comes to the deterioration in the budget we cannot point to global conditions as being at fault. The global economy is in pretty good nick, certainly the best nick it's been in for the last 10 years or so.


So, if it's not the global economy that's driving some of these horrific debt numbers—record and growing gross debt and record net debt—then we have to look somewhere else for an explanation. I think the explanation is pretty simple. Beyond that, I think the community understands that there's a pretty simple explanation for what's going on here, and that is that those opposite, particularly the Prime Minister, have this obsession with pandering to the top end of town. This is an approach that hurts the budget. It hurts the economy as well, and I'll get to the economy in a moment, beyond the fiscal settings. But it's also unfair, because it comes at the expense of middle Australia and people who work and struggle to provide for their families


I think the latest midyear update gave us a really a perfect window into the way those opposite approach the budget and the economy: higher taxes for 7 million working people, lower taxes for multinationals and millionaires and, as I said before in some detail, record and growing debt. I think it is worth noting, whenever we talk about the budget and certainly since that 2014 horror budget that I mentioned before, that what we see is a pattern of behaviour such that when they do want to repair the budget—or say they want to repair the budget—it's always at the expense of the most vulnerable people in society: students in universities in the midyear update; the $44 billion income tax hike on 7 million low- and middle-income Australians; ditching the energy supplement, leaving pensioners up to $366 a year worse off; or the thing that's still on the books every time, which is increasing the pension age to 70, which is the oldest in the developed world.


A real pattern has emerged. We're up for budget repair on this side, but it has to be fair on that side. They give these big tax cuts to multinationals and millionaires at the same time that they expect the most vulnerable people, the people on modest incomes, to carry the can for the fact we've got that record and growing debt. I think the best example of that, which has been in the news—and I think it's good that it's been in the news the last little while, certainly the last couple of months—are those company tax cuts that those opposite want to impose on the country: a $65 billion tax cut for big multinationals, and I think the big banks as well; I think they get something like $10 billion or $12 billion out of that $65 billion. It is a pretty extraordinary ramraid on the budget when you think about it. We've got this record and growing gross and net debt and we've got a $65 billion handout. It doesn't take a genius to work out that, when you give $65 billion to foreign multinationals and big banks and the like, that's $65 billion that you can't use on budget repair, that you can't use on investing in productivity and that you can't use on investing in human capital, education and health—all of those sorts of things that really matter if we are to grow the economy in this country.


If you look at the economics of the company tax cut it's pretty clear, even according to the Treasury department, that there's just not enough bang for 65 billion bucks. We've got Treasury modelling which shows a one per cent boost to GDP in 20 years time, which is an average of 0.05 per cent a year. If you compare that, for example, with the return on investment in infrastructure, that same Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy that I referred to that was released last week said that a $1 billion increase in public investment would boost GDP by $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The multipliers from investing in infrastructure and, I'd also suggest, from investing in people's skills, abilities, productivity and capacity—the multiplier for that kind of public investment is far greater than the return that, according to the Treasury, we get from these tax cuts for big business in this country.


If you don't want to take my word for it, the Grattan Institute warned that national income would be reduced for years by committing to this tax cut for big businesses before fixing the budget. They said that it risked reducing future living standards, which is a pretty important conclusion by the Grattan Institute. They're not associated with either side of politics—a terrific outfit. They've said, 'If we do this company tax cut before we fix the budget and do the other things that we need to do, we actually risk a reduction in future living standards.' Their quote was:


An unfunded company tax cut would add to already-large budget deficits … any cut to the company tax rate should only be implemented as part of a wider tax (and spending) reform package that does not increase budget deficits.


That's quite a stunning observation from the Grattan Institute and one that those opposite would do well to acknowledge, consider and reflect on.


Instead, we get this willingness, this hankering, this obsession with copying the Trump tax cuts in the US, as if you can make some kind of useful comparison between the headline rate over there, where they have state corporate taxes and all the rest of it, and the fact we have dividend imputation here—all of these reasons why you can't make a straight comparison between the headline rate in the US and the headline rate in Australia. But even leaving that aside for a moment, if you want to take the word of the International Monetary Fund, they looked at the Trump tax cuts just last month—after the passage, I believe, of those Trump tax cuts—and concluded:


Due to the temporary nature of some of its provisions, the tax policy package is projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards.


In America we have this sugar hit of company tax cuts associated with Trump and the Republicans in the Congress, and the IMF is saying even if you get some growth from those in the near term, it will detract from growth in the medium term. It will be like a sugar hit to the economy. The way that it's constructed, it will actually be a problem from 2022 onwards—so only four years of what former opposition leader from this dispatch box John Howard said about five minutes of economic sunshine. All of that outlay in the US, but it will only be four years before it starts to detract from growth.


Here on our own shores, those tax cuts—the company tax cuts proposed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—have become a symbol for a lot of ordinary people that this is a government that is out of touch with their daily lives. They don't get the sorts of needs and aspirations that people have in middle Australia. Their obsession is to shower largess on the top end of town. There is heaps of evidence of that. I'm not fond of quoting opinion polling in this place, but every piece of market research that has been published that I've seen shows very clearly that middle Australia does not want these tax cuts inflicted on them, particularly when it comes at the expense of their own living standard. That's an entirely reasonable position for them to adopt.


Unfortunately, that sort of pandering to the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia is not limited to that big business tax cut. It applies to a whole range of other areas as well in the budget and blocked in the midyear update as well. There are also the income tax cuts to those who need them least—$16,400 a year if you make a million dollars a year. So you have these weird, bizarre, out-of-whack priorities where you have a big tax cut for the people earning the most by removing the deficit levy and yet you have seven million workers on low and middle incomes who are being asked to pay more income tax at the same time as all this other stuff is going on with big business tax cuts and the like.


The other area which has received a lot of attention in the last couple of years, really—and I think it is a tribute to the opposition leader, the member for McMahon and the member for Fenner in particular when it comes to our tax reform proposals—is that we've still got this absurd situation where the biggest tax concessions are actually going to those who need them least. Think about things like negative gearing, trusts, capital gains and some of the concessions in super which do so much to advantage people in this country who are already wealthy at the expense of other people. In a perfect world, obviously a lot of people would prefer to pay less tax and they'd like to find ways of doing that. That's an entirely understandable human reaction. But when you've got a budget that is in the condition that it's in, you have priorities that you need to fund. In our case it's human capital, investing in people and making sure people are getting rewarded for their effort, earning, providing for their families, spending in the economy, creating demand with disposable income and all these sorts of things. You have to work out what your priorities are, and our priorities are very different from those opposite. We don't think we can continue to pay the biggest tax concessions to those who need them least.


I think Peter Martin from Fairfax summed it up really well in a recent piece about tax concessions when he said:


… the beneficiaries aren't always as deserving. The biggest superannuation and capital gains tax concessions are directed towards the highest earners, something we wouldn't tolerate if they were delivered as cheques, paid into accounts.


I think that's a really important point. If you explained to the Australian people what a lot of these tax concessions mean in dollar terms for an individual person and asked them, 'Would you support that being just handed to them as a cheque or in cash?' a lot of people would be appalled by it. But because it's in a tax system it's not as obvious to people what's going on and how our budget is so substantially out of whack. I think the members for Maribyrnong, McMahon, Fenner and others who have worked on our tax policy proposals have done the country a real service by making announcements about tax and defending them well in advance of elections and well in advance of people making a judgement on them, saying, 'We've got a problem in the budget: the biggest tax concessions go to those who need them least and we need to have the courage to address those issues.'


That's the fiscal part of the story. That's the budget part of the story in these appropriations bills and in the mid-year update. There's also, of course, the economic story. I've already touched on the global conditions which have disappeared as an excuse for the mismanagement of the budget and the fact that we've got record and growing debt. I think it's also important that we acknowledge that we have had some good headline figures in our economy, too. I think the national accounts showed GDP growth for the year to September was 2.8 per cent. That's not amazing. That's not outstanding. It's not the kind of economic triumph that Australia has become accustomed to, but 2.8 per cent is not terrible. The real issue, though, is underneath that headline. It doesn't really give you a sense of how we're slipping in the global context. We've gone from leader to laggard when it comes to our performance, even on GDP growth, which is the government's preferred measure. Let's think about some comparisons. Between 2008 and 2010, Australia had the fourth-highest GDP growth amongst OECD countries. We had the US, the UK, Japan and Germany all contracting. We had the fourth-highest GDP growth amongst those 30-plus OECD countries. Now in the same group we are 20th. We have slumped to 20th. We are behind Mexico, Estonia, Finland, Latvia and a whole range of countries. So we've gone from leader under the former government to laggard now when you look at the global league table. Again, that's not an opinion; it's a fact that you can easily look up and verify.


I think that headline rate, apart from the way that we are underperforming in good global economic conditions, also masks some enduring and concerning problems and trends in our economy which are disproportionately hurting some people more than others. To summarise the way a lot of people feel, with some justification, about how the economy really is—the economy that they actually experience rather than the economy they are lectured about from that dispatch box—it is that the rules of the economy are written to benefit others. That makes sense when you consider inequality is at a 75-year high or that the gender pay gap is widening—I know that that's something that is deeply concerning to our entire side of the parliament but especially to my friend, the member who's at the table. The gender pay gap should be a source of real shame in a country like ours. We are ranked 42nd out of 144 countries. We were in 12th position—a lot closer to the front of the pack—a decade ago. 


This economic disconnect that we talk about between outstanding global conditions, pretty good headline figures and the economy that people experience is most prevalent in the world of work and wages. It's fair to say that a lot of people feel that the link between their work and the reward they receive for that work has been severed. The best example of that is the fact that company profits have gone up 20 per cent in the last year at the same time over the same period that wages grew by two per cent. Whenever those opposite say, 'If only we can shovel some more money in the direction of the biggest companies in this country, they will jack up wages', we say, That's not been the experience.' Profits have gone up in this country in the last year—20 per cent; pretty extraordinary company profit growth. We want our companies to be profitable, but we want to make sure that the growth is inclusive and that people are rewarded for their work. Unfortunately—shamefully, really—in this country over the last year, we've had 20 per cent increase in company profits; two per cent increase in wages. That is a problem that would only be turbocharged if those opposite could implement their full agenda for tax cuts for big foreign multinationals and the big banks. 


There are a whole range of reasons: insecure work; the fact that people can't get the hours they want; the underemployment in this country is extraordinarily high—near historic highs; and wages growth of course is at record lows. All of these sorts of figures, when you combine them, paint a picture of the kind of economy that people are actually experiencing in middle Australia. 


One of the unfortunate things about the conversation we're having about wages in this country at the moment is that people assume or pretend that it's some sort of ideological thing. We're proud on our side of the parliament, of course, that we have always historically represented working people. However, beyond the usual fault lines of domestic politics, there's a substantial economic problem, objectively, when it comes to low wages in this country. It won't be fixed by company tax cuts for the reasons I've gone through in some detail. It certainly won't be fixed by cutting people's wages for working on the weekends. 


The problem can be summed up like this: when millions of working people in this country can't get the wages growth that they need to provide for their families and keep up with the cost of living, they don't have the money to spend in the shops, they don't have the money to invest in the future of their kids and they don't have the disposable income which creates demand—the demand that we need if we are to have enduring and inclusive growth in this country. 


If you look at the last national accounts, household consumption growth was very weak—0.1 per cent; the worst quarterly reading since the GFC. Household debt-to-income ratio is the highest it's been since the GFC, and what that shows is that people are feeling the strain. There is a disconnect between those headline growth figures and what people are experiencing. As I said, cutting wages, jacking up taxes on middle Australia—all of these sorts of things—would be a disaster for these trends that we've seen emerge that we should be dealing with. 


It was terrific to see Michael Blythe, the CBA economist, in one of his recent economics issues notes—terrific publication, a good piece of economic analysis—talk about a wages recession. He described that weakness in wage growth as 'a significant economic risk' because it impacts on households who defer their spending and focus on balance sheet repair, which is another way of saying: trying to pay off the credit cards. It focuses on businesses who react by cutting capital spending and slowing labour hiring. 


Stagnant wages growth in this country is not a problem that should only trouble one side of politics. It's not an ideological thing. It's an economic thing. It's a challenge. It's probably the most substantial threat to growth in this country at the moment that people do not have the income they need to make the economy whirr, and I think that this parliament needs to deal with that as a matter of urgency—at the very least, not by cutting wages, not by taking money out of the pockets of seven million Australian workers. 


So, whether it's the budget, whether it's our approach to the broader macroeconomy, I think there are substantial differences between that side of the House and this side. We both want growth, we both want fiscal repair, we both want our businesses to succeed, but we're going about it in very different ways. I think only our way will succeed. I don't think it will succeed with the strategy of hoping that by showering largesse on the top end of town—the strongest in our economy—it will somehow trickle down to everybody else. I don't think that will work; it hasn't worked historically. It hasn't worked here; it hasn't worked overseas. It's a flawed economic model. You don't grow the economy by favouring the top end of town at the expense of middle Australia. 


This is a government that thinks big multinational corporations pay too much tax, that seven million working Australians pay too little tax and that people get paid too much to work on the weekends. That tells us everything we need to know about the approach of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and their colleagues in the cabinet. We in the Labor Party take a different approach. We know growth has to be inclusive if you're serious about growing the economy. You have to invest in people and their productivity; you have to make sure people are being rewarded for effort; you have to ensure people have money to spend in the economy and can provide for their families. That also underpins our approach to the budget.


So we will, of course, be supporting the appropriation bills. That's the convention in this place. But that doesn't prevent us from pointing out the facts that we've got record and growing debt, that we've got a government which is spectacularly out of touch with middle Australia. We see that in their big business tax cuts and their tax hikes for ordinary people.

"Wood, Jason, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr WOOD
 (La Trobe) (17:41):  I too would like to speak on the appropriation bills and, in particular, about spending in the electorate of La Trobe. For those who do not know, La Trobe covers from the Dandenong Ranges in the north with suburbs such as Ferny Creek and Olinda and then goes right across to places like Emerald and Cockatoo and further down south, where there is an incredible growth corridor with suburbs such as Narre Warren, Narre Warren South, Beaconsfield, Officer and, of course, Berwick. Up to 250 families are moving each week into the shires of Cardinia and Casey, so it's a very, very fast-growing corridor, even when compared with the rest of Australia. 


We've been very much focused on supporting community groups. Why do we do that under the Turnbull government? You find that if you make very strong communities and support—for example, the Men's Shed, woodworkers' clubs, the RSL, the Scouts and Guides and the sporting clubs—that's great for the community and keeps the community engaged. It's good for their health and wellbeing. 


In the south of the electorate, as I said, with its huge growth corridor, one of the big issues has been transportation. You can imagine that with so many people moving into this area it does put huge pressure on local roads. One of the biggest roads we have in the electorate—in fact the biggest—is the Monash Freeway. I was greatly concerned and I lobbied back in March 2006 that an extra lane was needed on the Freeway—it could in fact have two lanes. We had the announcement with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that $500 million—which, sadly, was left over from money not spent by the state Labor government on the East-West Link—but we got that for the Monash. The announcement was in March 2016 for an extra lane that went all the way from the Warrigal Road connection to Cardinia Road. I would specifically like to thank Minister Paul Fletcher, who was heavily involved in the concept of where the road would finish. As I said to him, the growth in Officer in the next 10 years will be quite incredible. I think it will be in the vicinity of 50,000 people. You always hear the complaint, 'Governments do not have a vision.' Well, we wanted to make sure we had a vision to ensure that the road would actually meet the growth in that local area. 


Also importantly, too, we wanted to improve the traffic movement of local residents. In particular, Clyde Road is a road which each morning is nearly clogged up for local residents. We have so many families in La Trobe. We have mums and dads dropping off kids at school and, when they get to Clyde Road, they try to sneak around to Soldiers Road if they are going to, say, Hillcrest college. It is just an absolute traffic jam, including people trying to get on to the Monash. I was approached by both Casey council and Cardinia council at the same time a number of years back to say: 'As part of this Monash proposal, we really need the Turnbull government to include the extension of O'Shea Road from Soldiers Road right to where we would see the Beaconsfield interchange. It currently has two on-off ramps. It needs to be completed with two more on-off ramps.' That would mean, for example, residents coming through from Pakenham would no longer need to go into Berwick and go down south on Clyde Road. They could go to the Beaconsfield interchange and go straight through O'Shea Road and go down to the southern parts of Victoria if need be—areas like Frankston—by missing Clyde Road. It's of great benefit to local residents.


Also, too, with the opening up of the Beaconsfield interchange and extension of O'Shea Road, there is Minta Farm, which is a large allotment of land. This has been zoned by councils to be used for innovation and advanced manufacturing jobs. It is not industrial but innovation and advanced manufacturing jobs. I speak to so many local businesses that are very keen to go into this area. This will create, once opened, an incredible 10,000 local jobs in that area. The whole purpose is to stop people travelling to the CBD. But there is a disappointing aspect to this. We made the announcement back in March 2016. Here we have an area where we could create 10,000 jobs at Beaconsfield interchange and make the lives of local residents so much better. Sadly, we saw in the May 2017 budget from the state Labor government that out of that $500 million, after spending $2.5 million on the business case, it has decided to spend money on only the sections between South Gippsland Highway and Clyde Road. I acknowledge that that is obviously very important, but it's not going right out to Warrigal Road and Cardinia Road. Most of that funding, I believe, is from Transurban, which means tolls for people in the south-east when they use the Monash Freeway. In particular, from the CBD down to Toorak Road will be hit with tolls for another 10 years. I have numerous times called on Premier Daniel Andrews to get on with the job, to relieve the stress and to get on with building with the money. It just seems quite ridiculous. We have had $500 million in federal funding for nearly two years, coming up in April, which has not been spent on one road, the Monash, which is so vital, especially when we talk about those 10,000 jobs.


We saw some good news with projects which opened recently. There was Bunjil Place. Again, I congratulate Casey council. For anyone in Victoria listening in, it's beside Fountain Gate. It's an incredible $125 million project which the Turnbull government committed $10 million for. I recently had the opening with the former mayor Sam Aziz and the councils down there. The Casey council had an incredible vision to open a performing arts centre. From memory, it's in the vicinity of 800 seats. The architecture of Bunjil Place is quite incredible. The wooden framing outside—and I do it no justice by calling it wooden framing—is a beautiful piece of art. It was constructed in Germany, and the builders who had to reconstruct it had to work within millimetres. It's got an amazing entrance. 


Bunjil Place is named after the Aboriginal mythical creature, Bunjil—an eagle. They designed it in the shape of an eagle, and it looks absolutely incredible. I took the Treasurer down there, and he was absolutely blown away by how good this facility was and how much it means to the families of La Trobe, especially those in the south-east. That's what happens when the Turnbull government invests money, in this case $10 million. I also should say that it is in the seat of Holt, and I acknowledge the member for Holt for his interest in and commitment to this project. It's a fantastic local facility.


I also had the great pleasure of going to the opening of the Belgrave South Community Sports Pavilion recently. They had their official opening in November 2017. I previously committed $250,000 as an election commitment, and the entire project was in the vicinity of $2 million. It will benefit 419 people from the local area. What they've done down there just looks great. I'd also like to thank Ian Bakens and his team down there and to say that they had probably the best sporting event I've ever been to: it was a Black Caviar event. It was an incredible event to kick off the project and to get it up and running. When I was a candidate in 2017, I was blown away by how good it was, and that's why we made the election commitment. I'd like to also acknowledge the others from the Belgrave South community and various groups who were involved. It was a very exciting project, and it's now open to the public. We also gave them funding towards their lights. 


We committed $250,000 to the Beaconsfield Football Club to upgrade, to seal, their car park. It's now a bitumen car park. The council is also working to get a skateboard centre for the local kids to give them something to do. We're also helping them get some funding for a storage shed. I would like to acknowledge the president of Beaconsfield Football Club, Troy Robinson, the senior coach, Leigh McQuillan, and the head of football operations, Darren Hamilton, for their efforts. Also, very shortly, the Upwey CRASH project will be opening, with the Upwey football and cricket clubs and all the sporting groups locating there. I'd like to thank Andrew Peterson for the work he's done. The old clubrooms were probably there for 40 or 50 years, especially the Upwey one. They've been demolished. It's just so great for the local area and for the community to get involved in those sorts of projects.


Also, up in Mount Dandenong, we committed $10 million at the last election for the Mount Dandenong tourist road upgrade. It's particular focus is on the cyclists. Cadel Evans—it was fantastic to see Evans win the Tour de France—is up there every weekend in the Dandenong Ranges. We have cyclists coming from absolutely everywhere, which is fantastic. The only thing is: it becomes very frustrating for the local residents. So, rather than complain—and we had some people saying we should ban the cyclists, which is something we would never do—we committed funding to look at improving its usage for cyclists and others. I thank VicRoads for the work and also the Shire of Yarra Ranges. We will need more money for it. I believe, after speaking to VicRoads, that the total project will be in the vicinity of over $30 million. We did approach the state Labor government, and they basically came back and said it wasn't a priority. I think it's a big priority and I think we need to work together and have the state Labor government put some funding into this project. 


The same goes for Ridge Walk, which is a walk from Montrose right across to Upwey. It is to connect all the townships from Sassafras to Olinda to Mount Dandenong to Kalorama, and actually to really focus on the famous landscape artists of the hills and have an arts focus, because I really want to focus on creating tourism jobs up in the Dandenong Ranges. I'm very excited about that because we have this amazing tradition of artists in the hills, with Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton and Arthur Boyd. Artists have created all these amazing works in the Dandenong Ranges, including Aboriginal artist Lin Onus. So we really want to focus on that, and we have committed $2.5 million to the project. We do need the state Labor government to commit.


This project is not only good for telling or capturing the history of the area but also good for local residents, to walk in and experience the area. The footpaths in the hills aren't that great, but this project should make it a lot easier to walk through the parks. Some of the parks, as we see now in Sherbrooke Forest, are fantastic to walk through. In winter, though, it is pretty boggy, so we will be looking at having boardwalks. I'm very excited about the work we are doing with the council on that.


We have committed $5.5 million for Puffing Billy, for the Emerald discovery centre. That is in the planning phase. We've also committed $1 million to restore an old red rattler train, and I thank all those involved in assisting with that restoration. It will be so amazing and exciting when we have the first restored train come out from the CBD to Belgrave, to connect to Puffing Billy.


Finally, I had another commitment for the 1,000 Steps walk, for drinking taps. I remember people—this is more the media—being critical about having $50,000 for drinking taps at the start of the steps and at the top. Well, can I say: while I've been giving my speech, I reckon there would've been probably 100 people using those drinking taps, so that was money well spent.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (17:57):  Australia's a great country, but we really do face some big challenges, and now more than ever Australia needs a Prime Minister with a vision for this country and a vision for its people. But instead we've got a Prime Minister and a government which have completely run out of ideas. Not only have they run out of ideas; they are distracted and divided, and completely bereft of any vision for this country. They say one thing and they do exactly the opposite.


Their plan for Australian workers is breathtaking. They are supporting pay cuts for Australian workers at the very same time as they are supporting tax cuts for their bosses and the big companies. Their plan for the future of our workforce is to cut funding for our TAFEs at the very same time as they are importing skilled workers from overseas to do the jobs that Australian companies need to be done. The government has cut more than $2.8 billion from our TAFEs, from skills and from training.


As to their plan for universities—now this is going to kill you—we've got a Prime Minister who runs around the country and will talk to anyone with two eyes and a pair of ears about the importance of innovation while at the very same time they've cut $617 million from the very institutions that are training Australians in how to innovate! From my own university, Wollongong University—and I'm a proud graduate of that place—$45 million is being cut. This government has lost the plot.


Their plan to close the gap on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inequality is to pretend that the $500 million that they have cut out of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs over the last four years and their five years of inaction just did not happen. Over the last 24 hours, we've seen the ridiculous thing where they're asking us to give them credit for reopening an antismoking program that they closed down only three years ago. They are going to have another conversation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, while the memory of the Prime Minister closing the door on the Uluru Statement from the Heart is still fresh in the minds of those very same people. He has dithered and dallied on reconciliation while making grand speeches about the need for urgent action. He talks about the importance and the need for Australia to respect women and girls, but we see so few of them on his own front bench. He nobbles regional universities with funding cuts and increased enrolment fees. He says, 'We need to unite as one Australia,' while presiding over ever-growing inequality.


In Australia today, wealth is more concentrated than at any time in the last 60 years. The richest 10 per cent of Australians own 45 per cent of all wealth, and the gap between city Australia and regional Australia is widening. If you're in the top 20 per cent, you probably live in one of our capital cities. If you're in the bottom 20 per cent, you probably live outside one of those capital cities. If you're in one of those regional areas and you're represented by a Labor MP, you'll find somebody coming to Canberra and, with every breath they take, they will fight against the pernicious attacks of the government on the very programs and the very institutions which are driving at reducing inequality in this country. But, if you are unfortunate enough in one of the regional areas to be represented by one of the Liberal-National Party MPs, you'll find an MP who fights like a lion in his own electorate and says the most outrageous things about what he or she will take on when they come to Canberra, but they file in here and vote, day after day, against the very interests of their own electorates.


Let's look at what's going on in some of the regional areas. It doesn't matter which indicator you look at: there is a growing gap. There is a health gap, whether you measure it in access to medical care, whether you measure it in access to the necessary pharmaceuticals or whether you measure it in the prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. Diabetes is 3.5 times more common in working adults from the poorer areas, the majority of whom are in regional Australia—a whopping 3.5 times more common. What's the answer from the geniuses opposite? To make it harder for a person in regional Australia to go and see a GP. This is a government bereft of ideas. But it's not just about health. If you look at life expectancy, there is a three-year gap. For the average white Australian—and I'll get to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians—living in regional Australia versus one living in one of the capitals or in one of the metropolitan areas of the country, there is an average three-year life expectancy gap. That blows out to 10 years if you go to rural and remote Australia. We all know, after reading the 10-year Closing the gap report yesterday, what the unacceptably high gap in life expectancy is between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and other Australians in those communities.


Education is the tool that we use to improve the life expectancies and the life opportunities available for people who come from a modest background versus those who are born with every opportunity in life. But, when you look at the data, the gap in the participation rate between the city and the country is also growing. The gap in secondary education between major cities and outer regional areas is a whopping 7.3 per cent. We've got to ask ourselves whether LNP representatives from regional electorates were aware of the 7.3 per cent participation gap in secondary education when they filed into this place and voted in favour of cuts to school education.


The Prime Minister and his government say that they care about rising electricity costs, while rejecting every single sensible plan, including the sensible plans that were commissioned by their own ministers. It takes a special kind of wisdom to get some of the smartest people in the country to prepare a report on how we can have a clean energy future with stable and reliable electricity prices and then send it off to some of the daftest people in your party room and accept the recommendations that come from those very same people. It takes a special kind of genius, a special kind of government, but that's exactly what this mob over here have done. Is it any wonder that electricity bills in the last quarter alone were up by up to 20 per cent? This is the result of their dithering and their do-nothing approach when it comes to energy policy.


Let's talk about housing and housing affordability. The federal government could do something. They could reach across the table and join in a bipartisan effort with the Labor proposals to remove the excessive subsidies that are currently going into the housing sector to support people who are buying their second, third, fourth or fifth house and take some heat out of the housing market at the same time as they do something more productive with that money, but they have rejected Labor's proposal. They are completely bereft of ideas when it comes to housing affordability and, worse than that, when it comes to supporting housing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—tearing up the national partnership agreement which made such tremendous progress in providing both housing and skills in those communities throughout Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and other places.


We had a Treasurer once who said that the answer to housing affordability is to go out and find some rich parents. Well, if that wasn't bad enough, you've got a Deputy Prime Minister who says the answer is to go and move to regional Australia because rent's pretty cheap there. Not everybody has the opportunity of having a rich mate who is going to provide an apartment for them rent free. Most Australians have to struggle hard to put a roof over their head. This government is doing nothing to support them in that. The Prime Minister likes to talk about infrastructure but he has fundamentally failed to fund infrastructure projects in Tasmania, in Victoria and in South Australia—the states which are crying out for massive injections of infrastructure spend. 


The great Gough Whitlam once said that Labor governments see election victories as instructions to perform, while Liberal governments see them as a right to preside. Since the last election, we have seen nothing more than the truth of this saying in the performance of this government. There are only two things that unite a divided coalition government: attacking industrial rights and the industrial relations system and providing big business tax cuts. Let's have a look at the decision to support wage reductions through penalty rate cuts throughout the economy. At the same time as you have a Treasurer who is saying the most urgent economic reform that we need in this country is a pay rise, they are cheering on the Fair Work Commission as it reduced and removed penalty rate rights for thousands and thousands of Australian workers. Over 700,000 workers are likely to be affected by that decision. Cutting penalty rates will see a pay cut for low-, middle- and working-class families of up to $77 a week. That's not a very good way to go about increasing wages—by putting them up to $77 a week behind. In my own electorate, there are over 7,000 workers in the retail sector who are affected by this and around 4,200 workers in the accommodation and food sector who are affected by this. But it's not just electorates like mine; it is the same right throughout regional Australia. I happen to have the figures for Capricornia. There are about 13,000 retail workers in the Rockhampton and Gladstone areas and around 8,700 food and accommodation workers. In fact, if you look at the data, around one in seven workers in the electorates of Capricornia and Flynn are affected by direct decisions of this government and their agencies: a pay cut for these workers, supported by members opposite, with not a plan to do anything about it. 


I want to say something about trickle-down economics because the Prime Minister is fond of lecturing us on what he calls the fundamental laws of economics, which he says have not changed. He says that if we give corporates and the wealthy more money, it will somehow trickle down in the form of pay rises. He's willing to take a $65 billion gamble on federal finances to give this old chestnut of trickle-down economics a go. He could legislate for it, of course. He could put in the legislation that he has before the Senate a requirement that to receive the tax cut you've got to pass it on to your workers, but he won't do that. He won't do that, because he doesn't even believe his own rhetoric and he knows that this tax cut is not going to lead to a pay rise for ordinary Australians. 


Ordinary Australians know that it's not the pay that is going to rise. It's not the pay and the money that are trickling down to households. It's the bills—increases for health insurance costs, increases for school fee costs, paying more money for energy, paying more money for everything. In fact, ordinary Australians know that, when the Prime Minister is talking about trickle-down, they have this vision of him standing on a balcony somewhere and he's pouring scorn down on them. It's certainly not the pay and the money trickling down to them; it's something else indeed. 


There is no credibility, and he can't point to a country on earth where massive tax cuts to the biggest and wealthiest corporations in this country are going to lead to a pay increase for workers. If the government want some ideas, they should look to what Labor's doing. We have a vision for this country. This government is bereft of ideas. They are divided. They have not got an idea for the future of the country.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:12):  I'm pleased to follow the member for Whitlam, channelling Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn at the dispatch box, ranting on about all those good, hard socialist policies. However, the one thing we see time and time again from Labor spokesmen on the economy and why they always get it wrong is: they think the size of the economy, the size of the economic pie, is fixed. They don't understand that the size of our economic pie, the total wealth created in the economy, can grow and shrink. The problem is, which they don't understand, every time that you step in and try and redistribute the wealth, you destroy the very incentives to create that wealth in the first place. This is why we see policy after policy from the Labor side fail. 


The member for Whitlam talks about wage increases from tax cuts. I think the member for Whitlam should actually go and read a few things about what's happening in the USA, because they have reduced their corporate rate of tax. What's happened? Millions upon millions of workers in the USA are receiving pay increases. Many of them are receiving $1,000 cash bonuses from their employees. That is what is happening. That is the evidence of what is happening when you reduce the corporate rate of tax. 


If we go back in our nation's history and we look at every single time we have reduced the percentage rate of corporate tax, do you know what's happened? Without fail, we have ended up with not only more tax revenue but more corporate tax as a percentage of GDP at a lower rate of tax. So we've not only grown the pie; we've ended up with a bigger slice of that bigger pie in taxation revenue. 


No-one knows and no-one can guarantee that that will be exactly what happens in the future, but we have seen it every time in our nation. We saw it recently in New Zealand, where their conservative government lowered the rate of corporate tax. What happened in New Zealand? Wages rose, revenue rose and the government ended up with more revenue, not less. Everything tells us that the same will happen here in Australia.


We've also heard the member for Whitlam rant on about electricity prices. It's so timely that the member for Port Adelaide is in the chamber at this time. You learn as a young child that if you put your hand in the fire you get burnt and then you don't put your hand in the fire again. The way we progress—whether it's in business, as a society or even as a species—is by a series of small-scale experiments where we try something a little bit different. If it fails, we stop immediately and go down another track. If it works, we duplicate it and we roll it out. There has been a thought that a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target—or should I correctly say a 50 per cent compulsory, forced government mandate for generation of intermittent and unreliable energy—would actually lower the price of electricity. That's what many theorists thought, and that's fair enough. If you're thinking about a new idea, it's good that people put their different views and opinions forward. 


We've had this experiment of a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target conducted before our very eyes in South Australia. It has ended in tears. It is probably one of the greatest policy failures in our nation's history at any level. It has delivered that state the most unreliable energy, forcing them to spend half a billion dollars in a state of 1.7 million people in a desperate attempt to keep the lights on by bringing in emergency diesel generators to have on stand-by. Not only that, on top of that it has delivered that state the highest electricity prices anywhere in the world.


Common sense would tell you that if you've tried that experiment and it has been an unmitigated disaster, you'd say, 'Yes, we failed,' you'd pull back and you'd go down another track. That's how we progress. As I said, if you put your hand in the fire and you get burnt, you learn as a young child that you don't do it. Yet we have seen the Labor Party look at South Australia and say, 'Let's copy the 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target and take it nationwide.' This is insane. This is completely nuts. And yet this is the Labor Party's policy on energy—to copy an unmitigated disaster, a failed experiment. It will see pensioners in this nation being unable to heat their homes in winter, it will turn air-conditioning into a luxury good; and businesses will be no longer viable so will be forced to move offshore because of the high cost of energy in this nation. That is what the Labor Party wants to copy.


I call on good members of the Labor Party to speak up in your party room—put aside trying to attract a handful of Greens inner-city votes. Think of the pensioners, the workers and the coalminers that the Labor Party used to stand up for. Ben Chifley would be rolling in his grave if he saw the plans of what they did—a Labor policy that pushed electricity prices up—and how they were selling out the pensioners and workers of this country just to attract a few inner-city Greens votes.


In the time left on this appropriation bill, I'd quickly like to raise the issue of electric cars. There's been quite a bit of debate about this recently in the media. In fact, even the Chief Scientist has chipped into the debate. He's taken the role of chief subsidy seeker in an article he wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald the other week. The Chief Scientist gets it wrong in many respects. The first place he gets it wrong is that the debate is not for or against electric cars. We're not arguing against electric cars. The debate is: should electric cars be subsidised in Australia? That's what the debate is about. Let's take a simple proposition. If electric cars are so great—and they certainly are; they have many wonderful benefits, and I'm the first to acknowledge that—why do they need a subsidy? Why do they need to be subsidised if they are so great?


Our job in government should be to level the playing field between technologies, to let them compete against each other as vigorously as they possibly can, to let them put the best offer they can to the consumer and to let the consumer decide. We shouldn't suppose that we know better down here in Canberra what car the consumer should buy. We should just level the playing field and let the consumer decide. But we already have a substantial range of subsidies for electric cars in this country. We have subsidised finance. We have the fact that electric cars make no contribution to the fuel excise. We have a luxury car tax break. We have subsidised registrations and stamp duty. There's subsidised charging, and we have a tax office ruling that allows very generous deductions.


The argument that's put forward for these subsidies and for more subsidies the electric car industry is asking for is that electric cars will lower emissions—that it's good for the environment. To take the words of the Chief Scientist, we should test this hypothesis with the evidence. And we can look at the evidence, because we can use the science and the maths to make a calculation of the grams of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometre travelled. That is something we can do. In fact, we do that with the Green Vehicle Guide that the government puts out. It is very handy; it does a good job. But it does, unfortunately, leave out a few things. I doesn't make any allowance for the losses for the transmission and distribution of electricity. That should add an extra 10 per cent onto the CO2 emissions of electric cars. It also makes no allowance for the fact that there are substantially higher manufacturing emissions for electric cars. And that's not just my supposition. That's from a study titled 'Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles' published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, where the authors estimate that emissions from electric vehicles produce between 87 and 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre, compared with 44 grams of CO2 associated with a standard petrol or diesel car engine.


The other thing it fails to look at is that when you charge your car from the grid you'll mostly charge it at night, and the carbon intensity of our grids, especially in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, is substantially higher at night. For example, over the last few nights in New South Wales 99 per cent of the electricity came from coal. We know that our hydro plants and our gas plants in New South Wales are used as peaking plants. And, of course, we have no solar at night. Also, it makes no allowance for the fact that when you turn the heater on in an electric car you use substantially more energy than you do in a petrol car. That is because in a petrol car the heat from your heater comes from the passenger engine, and in an electric car it is an almost purely electric heater. When you factor all those things in, there is simply no case for subsidies for electric cars in this nation.


The CO2 emissions, almost on a like-for-like basis, are higher in almost every circumstance. Even the good old Toyota Corolla, our most popular selling car, has lower emissions than a Tesla. I know the Chief Scientist says in his article, 'Oh, yes, but there's the Renault Zoe, which only emits 121 grams per kilometre.' But what he doesn't say is that Renault has another vehicle called the Megane, which is a petrol/diesel car that has lower CO2 emissions at 115 grams of CO2 per kilometre driven. We're often told that the future will be all electric. Earlier this week, we had the publication of the Annual Energy Outlook for 2018 from the US Energy Information Administration. It makes projections out to 2050, the middle of this century. They predict that plug-in electric vehicles in the US, by 2050, will only make up 14 per cent of the US passenger car fleet. Over 80 per cent of the vehicles—




Mr Butler:
  Who said that?




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I hear the member for Port Adelaide. Obviously he is uninformed in this case and I'm happy to send it to him. This is from none other than the US Energy Information Administration. That is their latest projections out to 2050. That is what they project. You may have other projections, you may have other information or you may be making it up, like you've previously done. I notice the member for Grayndler is another culprit in this. The two gentlemen sitting at the table have talked about how thermal coal is in rapid decline. I hope they've looked at the evidence over the last 12 months and seen we've had record exports of coal. Both of you sitting down there have stood up in the media and made ridiculous comments about the decline of exports of thermal coal, and yet we have had the largest increase in coal exports in our nation's history. Everywhere around the world—Japan is importing more thermal coal; China's coal consumption last year was up by 5.2 per cent. I will leave my remarks there. I'd be more than happy at any time to give the two gentlemen at the table a briefing so they don't make so many silly comments in the media and embarrass themselves.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (18:27):  Australians are a reasonable people. With only one exception in our history, Australian voters have given federal governments at least two terms in office. That's enough time to implement their policies and for evidence to emerge as to whether those policies have worked as promised. Voters listen to what we say as parliamentarians. They want proof that the government can actually deliver what it promises. They want a government with a sense of purpose, with a narrative for what it wants to do in office and where it wants to take the country. They want a government that not only anticipates the future but, by its actions, helps to create that future. What is very clear is that for this Prime Minister, in particular, his only objective has been to occupy the Lodge. You can see the lack of foresight and forward thinking when it comes to infrastructure investment, and that is what I want to concentrate on in my contribution to this appropriations debate in the parliament this evening. 


The fact is that this government has cut infrastructure investment and it will continue to cut infrastructure investment into the future. The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that, based upon the government's own figures, infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP will fall from 0.4 to 0.2 per cent over the next decade. It will halve.


If you look at the specific budget figures, you can see why that's occurring. The estimate of what the government would invest on infrastructure in the 2016-17 financial year, as announced on budget night, was $9.2 billion. If you look at the actual investment, it was $7.5 billion—or a $1.7 billion underspend—in circumstances when, because of the mining boom moving from the investment to the production phase, we should have been stepping up investment in infrastructure. But over the forward estimates it gets worse. Over the forward estimates, the amount of infrastructure investment will fall off a cliff to $4.2 billion.


We raised these questions this week in parliament with the hapless and helpless infrastructure minister, who happens to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. What we've learnt is that the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, does not have a clue about this portfolio, despite the fact that he was appointed to the position last year after a long period of stalking the former minister for infrastructure, the member for Gippsland. We asked the minister why, for example, Victoria, home to one in four Australians, receives only nine per cent of the Commonwealth infrastructure budget. Victoria is Australia's fastest-growing state. Melbourne is Australia's fastest-growing city. Yet this government chooses to allocate under 10 per cent of the budget.


In fact, in his answer he raised the $1.5 billion that was forwarded under the East West Link project, determined by the Abbott government in 2014, which the people of Victoria rejected when they elected the Daniel Andrews government. It's not surprising that they rejected it, given it had a benefit-to-cost ratio of just 45c return for every dollar that would have been invested in that project. But, of course, because of the incompetent way in which the government have dealt with infrastructure and their budgetary policies, they'd already forwarded $1.5 billion as an advance payment to Victoria for this project before it had its business case.


This is a government that says that it had a policy of only making milestone payments once something was actually being built. But that $1.5 billion was, of course, reallocated to a range of projects just last year when they realised that it was unsustainable to have that money simply sitting in the bank account of the Victorian government and not building anything, which is what had occurred over the previous couple of years. But the infrastructure minister didn't seem to know that that was the case—just like today, when, in answer to a question from his own side, he then went through and claimed rail projects such as the Regional Rail Link that were funded by the former Labor government and projects like the M80 as well.


We also asked him why he was cutting infrastructure investment in South Australia from $921.4 million in the current year to just $95 million in 2019-20. That represents South Australia receiving just two per cent of the national infrastructure budget in spite of the fact that the government have said they support the upgrading of the entire North-South Corridor road; in spite of the fact that the project between Torrens to Torrens and the South Road Superway is the next one ready to be progressed; in spite of the fact that the Prime Minister says he supports public transport, but the Gawler line electrification is ready to go and is waiting for funding; and in spite of the fact that the South Australian government has developed the AdeLINK light rail expansion to improve mobility and deal with urban congestion in that state. His response was to simply talk about the portfolio of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and defence spending rather than infrastructure and transport spending, which is what he's actually responsible for. We asked why the government allocated $100 million to the Northern Australia Roads Program last year but actually spent $12 million, so there was an underspend of 88 per cent in that program at a time when they say they care about northern Australia. I note that the member for Solomon, who is in the chamber, can certainly identify roads that could have been funded in his electorate around Darwin and Palmerston and could have benefitted from that program. What we heard from the infrastructure minister was quite revealing in that he talked about the Nullarbor Plain. He wasn't quite sure where the Northern Territory and northern Australia is. He talked about the Nullarbor, which says it all about his failure in this area.


Perhaps the worst response from the infrastructure minister, who showed that, frankly, he's out of his depth in that portfolio, was his response to a question we raised about infrastructure investment in Tasmania. Since the change of government in 2013, we've seen a funding cut for the Midland Highway upgrade and a funding cut for the rail revitalisation program. Remarkably, for Tasmania, not a single new major infrastructure project funded by the federal government has begun—nothing in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018. The infrastructure minister referred to the Inland Rail project. If you look at a map of Australia, between the north island, where we are now, and the south island of Tasmania is the Bass Strait. I've got news for the minister for infrastructure: inland rail does not cross the Bass Strait. He should know that because, in fact, inland rail goes nowhere near water at all. It doesn't go to the Port of Melbourne and it stops 38 kilometres short of the Port of Brisbane, at Acacia Ridge. It's quite remarkable.


Today we asked why the government had spent $1 billion less than promised in Queensland in the past four years. Again, there was no response. There was no understanding that what we were talking about wasn't what Labor thought should happen in Queensland. What we were talking about were their own budget papers in their first four budgets and what they said they would spend, and matching that up with actual investment. That cut is due to a failure to invest in programs in Queensland and right around the country. Money was allocated for things such as the Mobile Black Spot Program and the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. At a time when, after decades of a declining road toll, we've had the road toll increase, we have an underspend of half the funds that were allocated for heavy vehicle rest stops. That is a remarkable indictment of the incompetence of this government. That is this government's record on infrastructure.


The total underspend between the 2014-15 budget—its first budget—and 2017-18 has now hit $4.8 billion. Now, occasionally, it may well be that a road project or a rail project has to be deferred slightly because of weather events or because of circumstances beyond the government's control. I accept that that can happen. But this is happening across every state and territory every year, for road and rail projects large and small. That comes down to a simple case of incompetence. The difference between the budget that they announced in May 2017 and the MYEFO that they put out at the end of last year showed a reduction of $914 million—and we're not even there yet. That's what they cut from when they made the big announcements in May, and now we see what's actually happening. On major road projects alone, the underspend is $2.8 billion. That is why Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said, 'The budget confirms the cut to real budgeted capital funding to its lowest level in more than a decade—using a mix of underspend, reprofiling and narrative to cover this substantial drop in real capital expenditure.' There are two ways you can grow an economy: invest in infrastructure or invest in people through education and training. This government is doing neither, which is why it's not creating the conditions for growth in the future economy and for future employment and opportunity for Australians.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (18:42):  I'm very pleased to talk about a very important economic development initiative in my electorate, the Myalup-Wellington project. This is a significant economic development project. It is an industry-led initiative and it will do a number of things in the irrigation space. It is about substantially increasing production capacity. It will create jobs. It will provide economic uplift in what is the underdeveloped Collie River Irrigation District and the Myalup Irrigated Agricultural Precinct.


The project is a major opportunity to help diversify Western Australia's regional economy through irrigated agriculture. Anyone who understands irrigation understands the capabilities of irrigated agriculture. Currently, just 6,557 hectares of the available 34,600 hectares of the Collie River, Harvey and Waroona districts are actually irrigated. The Myalup-Wellington project is an industry-led initiative. It will see saline water that's currently flowing into the Wellington Dam diverted from the Collie River east branch to a mine void, with that water then treated in a new desalination plant. A new, smaller Burekup weir will be built upstream to enable water delivery to be powered by gravity—what a great way to go; environmentally sustainable because it is powered by gravity. The irrigation channels will be replaced with a new, pressurised pipe network. So it is a simple concept. It's about desalination. It's about piping. It's about a delivery network. It will boost horticultural, agricultural and forestry opportunities—what a great combination! It will create jobs and an economic uplift. It will attract even further investment in the region and it will diversify the south-west regional economy.


The old Wellington Dam was built back in 1933 with Commonwealth funding. The salinity in that amazing dam has risen significantly. The Collie River east branch contributes up to 14 per cent of the annual flow and up to 55 per cent of the annual salt load into the Wellington Dam. When you put that in other terms, this means that each year this east branch is delivering between 60,000 and 110,000 tonnes of salt into the Wellington Dam. That's what part of this project is about—the increase in the salinity over the years and how we manage that. There are districts that are choosing, because of this salinity below the Wellington Dam, not to actually irrigate their properties or irrigate as much of them. The productivity isn't there in the same way. That is because of that possibility and risk of soil degradation. So it's important that we deal with the salinity issue as well as the piping process for the delivery of the water ahead.


Existing open channels created in 1960 will be replaced with a closed pipe network. This will save at least 15 gigalitres of water a year currently lost through seepage, leakage or evaporation. The pipe network will replace the open channel system and allow expansion of the amount of land that's currently under irrigation. This will see a piped system from the Collie River Irrigation District to the Myalup Irrigated Agricultural Precinct which will re-inject water from the Wellington Dam into aquifers in the Myalup area to address the issues around volume and salinity concerns in that area.


There's also an idea to re-inject stormwater collected in the Harvey diversion drain. That's also part of the proposal. This is a very sound proposal. It will bring incredible opportunities to the south-west. Around 10 gigalitres a year of potable water from the desal plant will be sold into Water Corp's Great Southern Towns Water Supply Scheme and stored in the Harris dam. There will be ongoing opportunities. It is a fantastic irrigation system, a series of dams in the hills, with water delivered in a gravity-fed pipe-and-channel system. It's simple, it's effective and it delivers. There have been many innovative solutions as part of the sustainable techniques in this multi-awarded delivery system.


I also want to talk about the Bunbury outer ring road. A major development is needed to finish the whole of the Bunbury outer ring road. At the moment, it's like a stranded T-junction. The federal government recently committed $10 million to complete the planning and the project development of the unbuilt sections—the northern and southern sections. This is currently underway. There are new developments in the area proposed. The planning and project development for the bypass will help to reduce congestion, improve safety and—this is the key issue—provide an efficient freight route. It is a major economic driver in the south-west as well.


Of course, we need to deliver on issues around the Forrest Highway, Robertson Drive and Bussell Highway, which are experiencing congestion and safety challenges, mainly with access to the Bunbury Port for road freight. It's currently inefficient, with trucks having to negotiate over and over again several low-speed roundabouts. They compete constantly with local commuter traffic. We need really to reduce the congestion on the existing roads, reduce that dangerous mix of heavy freight and local traffic, and encourage sustainable, economic growth in residential and industrial development so they can get on with what they do around Bunbury and support planning. This is part of the proposal for pedestrian, cycling, public transport and passenger rail and freight solutions and that safe and reliable freight route to the port of Bunbury. We need to seriously improve the efficiencies in the supply chain. 


We have a growing population in the south-west. We have the highest population in the state outside of Perth, and we need to make sure that we keep developing in this region. Those freight accesses are really critical. There are around 300 truck movements a day into the port. That tells you about the mix between local and freight traffic. The port traffic needs to get on with what it does, and local people need a safe way of getting to and from where they're going. 


The port is of such huge, often underestimated, economic importance to Bunbury, the whole of the south-west and the state of Western Australia. It's existed since the 1800s, and we are now seeing the amazing—I think it's amazing—export of alumina. It is the biggest alumina export port in Australia—in Bunbury, in my electorate. I'm very proud of that. I'm proud of the people who produce it, deliver it and ship it out of the port of Bunbury. There are also woodchips, mineral sands, spodumene, silica sands, grain and bauxite, a new export, out of Bunbury, and I'm hoping we'll see lithium as well. 


There are over 10 million tonnes of alumina going out of Bunbury. Every time I see a shipload going out, I think how great it is for our regional economy and the jobs that we are so focused on as a government. Of course, added to that, there are all of the services around the port: the transport services, the maritime services. When the tugs go out, you see how well those men do their job, and the precision of what they do with the vessels that come in is extraordinary to watch. 


Of course, part of this is some of the volunteer groups that operate in and around the port. I want to mention the Bunbury Sea Rescue group. They do a fantastic job. They have 35 volunteers and do so many callouts on a regular basis. They are absolutely vital to ensuring the local marine environment is safe. All those people who choose to go out and enjoy themselves need the Bunbury Sea Rescue group of volunteers. The group are very, very proud—and they should be—of their 11-metre Elite Marine aluminium cat. It has twin—which is the bit I like—740 horsepower Volvo Penta diesel engines and, when that vessel starts up, she's got all the power she needs to do the job that sea rescue need her to do. 


All of these volunteers dedicate an enormous amount of time and effort to their sea rescue efforts. They work very closely with the Western Australia Police in search-and-rescue operations. They are totally volunteer. We often see these people, but we don't think about the amount of time that goes into their training and their efforts. They also educate people on safe boating and survival at sea. They train volunteers as skippers, crews and radio operators. I want to thank all of those at the Bunbury Sea Rescue group for what they do. It's an incredible commitment you make to the safety not only of people who live in our community but also of those who visit. I saw recently where some of the skippers, particularly Michael Cooper and Brett Ladhams, had been doing some work. Michael received an award recently for the amount of time he's spent as a volunteer and, each time one of these members receive a long service recognition, I cannot believe how much time they've spent volunteering. 


The Busselton Volunteer Marine Rescue Group also does a fantastic job. They run out of a state-of-the-art control room, housed in the Busselton Volunteer Marine Rescue Group's headquarters. It is very well located. It has the latest radar, marine radios and weather station and it is also equipped with an AIS—an automatic identifying system tracking device. There is a fabulous group of volunteers. They don't even expect to be thanked for what they do; they're just there. They're absolutely dedicated to safety at sea. It's a simple ambition for these people, but what a wonderful thing to deliver. Their core function is rescuing people. That's what they do: they rescue people; they save lives. And they also help with yachting regattas, outrigger races, the Busselton Jetty swim, the IRONMAN of Western Australia and whale rescues. They are a great group of people. Busselton has 85 volunteers. Of course, there are very active members and others who are not so active. They are such a welcoming group of people that so many others want to be part of this organisation. That's because of the sense of family and the purpose they have in rescuing people and providing what is an invaluable service. They answer approximately 300 callouts a year. These are all volunteers. 


I spoke a couple of days ago about our surf lifesavers and the extraordinary service and the thousands and thousands of hours of their own that they give to make sure they are trained and ready to provide these extraordinary emergency services. For all of those who are involved in emergency services, but particularly the Bunbury Sea Rescue Group and the Busselton Volunteer Marine Rescue Group, I want to say a special thankyou to each one of them. You give up your time, and it costs you money to be a volunteer. What you're doing is rescuing good people, but you're saving lives, and it's one of the most important contributions that you can make—whether it is St John Ambulance, with its extraordinary number of volunteers, or whether it is our volunteer Fire and Rescue people. Our volunteers were amazing with the fire at Augusta. They were on the job straightaway and they saved so many homes and so many people. That fire could have been well out of control but for the work of our volunteers. As always, I'm very supportive of the volunteers who do an extraordinary job right around Australia, but particularly in my electorate. Thank you.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:57):  I too would like to participate in this debate, but I would like to draw some attention to what I see as shortcomings within this government. One thing I've learnt since viewing the activities of the Turnbull government is that we should pay attention not to what they say but to what they do. And I think there's a clear measure of that when you look at what this government has done. Bear in mind, this is the government of Work Choices—that was their origin; that was their commitment. They wanted to reduce the workers' ability in respect to wage rises; they wanted employers to pay people below award rates of pay. It's in their DNA. 


None of this has changed. Work Choices moved to lower the standard of living, and this government continues to do that. They certainly have made a move to cut the standard of living of pensioners, those on disability support, the unemployed, young people. And now they want us to believe that they've changed; that they've turned over a new leaf, as it were. It wasn't that long ago that this mob opposite were banging on about how what we need is budget repair. That's putting it mildly. They talked about a budget emergency or a deficit disaster. They pounded on about that before the last election. But what do we see now? Under this government's watch, the deficit is blowing out and the debt has now crashed through the half-trillion dollar mark.


This is a government of misplaced priorities, with a signature policy of handing out $65 billion to multinationals and big business. This policy is all inspired by the government's misconceived views about trickle-down economics. I'll tell you what: that wasn't one of the terms in any of the economics books I had to read when I was studying. But they have placed all their faith in that—that the more we give the top end of town, the more they'll pass it on. As I said last week, pigs might fly. Yet this is their signature policy with which they want to take the Australian community under their wing, saying, 'Trust us; this'll be all okay.'


Well, as I say, don't listen to what they say; look at what they do. At this time we have unemployment and casualisation at an all-time high. We have stagnant living standards. We have a diminished number of apprenticeships. We have a housing affordability crisis. And the only plan the government has is, quite frankly, to make it hard for families who are battling already. Just a piece of advice for those opposite: if you can't afford to give, straight out, business $65 billion, simply don't do it. But don't do it at the expense of the most vulnerable Australians. That's not what government is about. This is not Robin Hood taking from the rich and giving to the poor. From what they're doing, they misread that book; they're taking from the poor to reward the rich. The government's approach is unfair and ill considered. The type of growth they are targeting is not the right type of growth that this country needs. And it is unaffordable, particularly at a time when this government has the budget in a big mess.


Since this government's economic plan was first introduced, we have talked about the extremely minimal impact that these proposed tax cuts for big business will have. We are talking about giving $65 billion to the top end of town—the top corporates and the multinationals. But the economists have reminded us that it will have negligible economic benefit. As a matter of fact, they have modelled this. It has a benefit of one per cent over the next 20 years—that's to say, in terms of wages, a $2 a day increase in the wages per person in 20 years time. That's what they're basing all this on. No wonder they want to move to cut pensions or make it more difficult for pensions and why they want to move on family tax benefits, and why they are moving on universities and on schools. This is all to pay for this unfunded $65 billion tax cut to big business.


The Treasurer's economic modelling certainly is a one-trick pony. He expects that, if he can give away this money, we are going to see miraculous results within the community. As I say, he believes—as I presume those opposite, if they are shaking their heads, do too—that the more we give the top end of town, the more they're going to feel obliged to expend that in higher wages for their employees. I just don't think the world works that way. This is the same trickle-down approach that has dominated, quite frankly, the last three budgets delivered by the Treasurer.


I've found a comment by a person who I know is friends of people on both sides of this parliament, and I am referring to Father Frank Brennan. He is the CEO of Catholic Social Services. He succinctly summarised this position that the government's wedded to, about their tax cuts. He said:


Our tax and transfer system is critical to ensuring a fairer Australia … Placing the burden of budget repair on those who can least afford it, while providing tax cuts to the wealthy and businesses, is wrong morally and economically.


We agree with that. If Father Frank is making comments like that, he is sure as hell talking to those on the other side and making sure that they understand that.


I am not sure how rusted on those opposite are to this. We would like to think that they will take this to the next election, because those of us who spent a bit of time in our electorates over Christmas know that this is totally unpopular. People get what's occurring here. People get that the government are making cuts that affect families and hardworking people all to further their tax cuts for business. At the same time, the government want to take $17 billion from our schools, $2.2 billion from our universities and almost $650 million from vocational education through our TAFE system—and all of this when we are moving from crisis to crisis in health. In that environment, is it worth giving the top end of town $65 billion? By the way, in the last 12 months, the top end of town has averaged a 20 per cent profit. Does that trickle down anywhere? Wages growth has flatlined, so it hasn't trickled down too far.


I will just highlight some of the ramifications of these cuts. I have spoken a number of times about our schools. I would expect that all members here would, from time to time, visit their schools and their principals to get an idea of how they are going and get an understanding of the practical ramifications of the cuts that the government is now making. In my electorate, under the cuts that the government proposes, our schools will lose $24.8 million in funding. In my discussions with the Western Sydney University last week, they told me that the government's proposed cuts, which they are instituting through the freeze on Commonwealth funding grants, in this year alone will amount to $5.7 million. The university told me that they are going to have to take a lot of their focus away from business and, for example, their start-up incubator.


All the things that the Prime Minister once said were essential for growth in Western Sydney are going to be ratcheted back because of these cuts. These cuts are unfair and are painful for communities such as Western Sydney. This just goes to prove that the government can't be trusted when it comes to the most important investments for our nation. An investment in education is an investment in our future. We need to have the best and brightest if we are going to compete in the world. But that is lost on this government. You don't make cuts to institutions that are responsible for developing skills and training and all those things that we are going to need in an advanced economy to be able compete with the rest of the world—but the government is slashing those institutions.


We see this same sentiment reflected in the government's health policy, where the government failed to reverse their unfair 2020 Medicare freeze. They are effectively asking Australians to pay more for their health care than they should be paying. Over the next four years this amounts to a cut of about $2.2 billion from Medicare, and that is in addition to the savings already banked by the government. The Turnbull government has been cutting Medicare and threatening bulk-billing. I would just remind the House that this is the same bunch that, when they had half a chance, wanted to move to privatise parts of Medicare—and now they want us to believe that they've changed their position. The fact is that the Prime Minister cares only about his own political health, not about the health of those in our community.


The government claim that we have an NDIS emergency and, in a rather cynical way, they are now pretending that there is only one way to address this—through a good old-fashioned tax hike for low-income earners. They want to tax the seven million Australians earning less than $87,000. They say, 'This is the only way we can do it, yet we still want to hand out $65 billion to the top end of town.' What does it mean for the real workers out there? The average household income in my electorate is just a tad over $65,000. For a worker on $55,000, it means that they will be paying an extra $270 a year, and someone on $80,000 a year will be paying around $400 extra tax a year. This is all happening when we know that the corporate profit level is running at around 20 per cent—average profits at 20 per cent over the last 12 months. Yet they still want to think that the only way ahead for our economy is to give big business a bigger slice of the pie, a bigger tax cut, in the belief that it will trickle down to everybody else. While they're doing that, as I said earlier, wages growth has largely flatlined. It's at a record low. Currently it's at 1.9 per cent. That's not the environment in which you want to go out and reward big business that's already making big profits. They're not distributing that to their workers; otherwise it wouldn't be running at 1.9 per cent, as it is now.


Our families are facing rising electricity costs and significant unemployment; 1.1 million Australians are experiencing underemployment. And this government has nothing better to offer than a $65 billion corporate tax cut. When you've got stagnant wage growth and rising inequity, on a background that's already felt the wrath of antiworker legislation passed by this government, no wonder this is a government that did not lift a finger to stop the slashing of penalty rates that now affects 700,000 Australian workers. By the way, these are some of the most low-paid Australian workers, and it's going to cost them up to $77 per week.


We need a government that actually understands community and puts community first. Clearly that's not what this government's doing. This government fails to see the real value of people's pay packets going down and electricity and private health care skyrocketing. We are in a housing affordability crisis, with household debt at record levels. We have high unemployment and job insecurity and a government that is wagering our futures on trickle-down economics.

 (Bendigo) (19:12):  Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2017-2018 is an appropriation bill, and, while Labor has said that it will not block supply, this debate gives us a chance to talk more broadly about the government's agenda and the impact that the government's agenda is having in regional communities, particularly my own community of Bendigo.


A couple of surprises were in the MYEFO this year that hit regional communities tough. One that I particularly wish to highlight is the way in which funding has been ripped away from universities—the freezing of university places. At the Bendigo campus of La Trobe University, in my electorate, they were very concerned about the impact that this cut in support for students would have on all of their regional campuses. In Bendigo, in Shepparton, in Wodonga they feared that with a freezing of university places people would chose to go to the city first, and once the city was full there'd be no places left for the regions. It is typical of this government: they randomly put out these policies, these blunt instruments, without really consulting with the sector, without really asking what impact this would have. The Bendigo campus was hoping that because they have some flagship courses, like dentistry, and because their rural school of health is world-class then that would help attract people to Bendigo as their first choice. 


We also know that freezing university places would make it harder for regional students, people who are re-entering the work force and seeking to upgrade their skills, and mature-aged students—who are a large proportion of our regional campuses—to go to university. The fact is that if you live outside of metro Melbourne you can knock points off your ATAR score; you can knock points off your university entry level score. In Queensland, if you go to school in some regional areas, like on the Sunshine Coast or in Gympie, they say that you knock two points off your OP. If you go to an average school—a state school, not an elite school—you can knock points off of your OP because of the way in which the system has been designed. Kids that are equally as bright, but disadvantaged because of their school marking, could miss out on university places because of this government's freeze—a random arbitrary freeze with no proper consultation with the sector about how it would happen.


The MYEFO also confirmed this government's addiction to their $65 billion in handouts and tax cuts to multinationals. This is at a time when they keep talking about budget repair. Rather than getting the companies that are making the profits—that are making the most money—to actually contribute towards our common wealth, they're making working people on low to middle incomes pay more in the way of tax. The rhetoric of this government—they twist themselves up. Regarding the $65 billion in tax cuts, they actually believe, or they're trying to mislead the Australian people by saying, that, if you give the companies more profits, they'll give it to workers. That is nonsense. It has never happened. The only times that workers actually get a pay rise is when they bargain for it or when it's awarded to them by the Fair Work Commission. It is so rare for a company to say, 'Here is a wage increase just because we like you.'


Talk to the mining workers in Queensland. We found out last week that many of these multinationals who will get a handout under the government's plan have had a massive increase in revenue in the last 12 months. The returns are in and their net export value is up. In coal, it's up 35 per cent. Across all of the mining sectors, including gold from my electorate, it is up 52 per cent. These companies are making mega profits, yet we haven't seen the wages for their workers go up at all. In fact, we've seen the reverse. More and more workers are being told: 'You've lost your job. You have to re-apply for labour hire. It's less money.' I've met coalminers in Central Queensland who've lost 80 per cent of their entitlements—the extra bonuses that they get. They've gone back to the basic-wage structure. I've met people who have been told: 'You no longer work directly for BHP'—or Glencore or Anglo American—'You now work for a labour hire company. It is full-time equivalent, with similar responsibilities, similar expectations of you and the same uniform, but you're getting paid $30,000 to $50,000 a year less.' This is what's happening in Australian workplaces, yet the government wants us to believe that if we give companies money they'll give it to workers. Bring in the instrument. Bring in the legislation to make companies do it, because they won't. We know that they won't, because they never have without us having robust enterprise bargaining rules.


What is also contained in the MYEFO is the government's plan to increase tax on low- and middle-income earners. This comes back to priorities. Rather than asking the companies that are making all of the profits to help contribute towards our common wealth, they're increasing the Medicare levy, which is basically increasing the taxes for low- and middle-income earners, the same group of people that has not had a decent pay rise. Australians need a pay rise. These are the same people that may have had their penalty rates cut. Again, this government—I nearly said 'company', because it acts a bit like a company—did nothing to stop the Fair Work Commission cutting penalty rates. It is this place that sets the rules for the Fair Work Commission. When they make a decision that is not in the best interests of working people, when they make a decision that sees 700,000 Australian workers cop a pay cut, this place should reset the rules to make sure that those workers do keep their penalty rates. These are some of the lowest-paid workers that we have in our community, yet this government did nothing. They stood back, let their penalty rates be cut and then doubled down and said, 'For those of you working full time and earning more than $20,000 a year, we're actually going to hit you with an increased tax by increasing the Medicare levy.'


We also saw in the MYEFO an attack on our pensioners. I guess we shouldn't be surprised, because we had the minister responsible for this area stand up in question time and say, 'The solution to the deeming rates for pensioners, because they're so low, is for them to go out and get a job.' They're now saying to people over the age of 70, over the age of 65, 'The reason why we're not going to look at your pension is we think you should go out there and get a job, and that's the role of government.' They've worked hard enough. It's time that they get a chance to enjoy their retirement. It's already hard for people to keep working to the age of 70, particularly in industries which are labour intensive, whether it be carpentry or nursing. Any job that involves physical movement is very hard to do to the age of 70. It's not like being a politician or working at a desk.


Not to mention it's an equity issue. They've worked hard. They deserve respect in retirement. But what we've seen from this government is not only are they not doing anything about deeming rates but they've also continued their pursuit to ditch the energy supplement. At a time when gas and energy prices are spiralling high and continue to go high, this government wants to ditch the energy supplement, which will leave pensioners $366 a year worse off. They also still want to increase the pension age to 70. It demonstrates again how out of touch they are with older Australians. Despite all of the guarantees of the government, all they've guaranteed are high energy prices. That's all this government has guaranteed.


I met with some pensioners in my electorate during winter. They brought their winter bills in to talk about how they'd gone up. Let's remember the rhetoric of this government when they were in opposition. All their ranting about debt and deficit, all their ranting about the carbon tax, all their promises of '$550 back in your back pocket', all their promises to get debt under control—they've failed on two of their key election campaigns. The pensioners that I met with didn't have an extra $550 in their back pocket because of this government. No. Many of them were saying, 'We're actually paying more than we ever have for our energy bills, and they continue to go up.' I've mentioned the push of the pension age to 70. This again demonstrates that they have very little understanding of what kind of jobs people can do until they're 70. If people want to work until they're 70, we should encourage them, but we shouldn't make it mandatory. It's hard to be a plumber, a carpenter, a nurse or a cleaner until you're 70. We should show older Australians respect and support them.


This government is also failing spectacularly at helping connect jobseekers with the jobs that are available. I was in Tasmania last week talking to some of our berry, apple and fruit industry. Some of their jobs are seasonal. They are concerned about what's going to happen in the peak picking season for them. They need about 2,000 workers in this part of Tasmania. In the north-west, they need about 6,000 workers for harvest, which is eight weeks. But what I did learn by being there is that a lot of their work—their pruning work, their packing work—is ongoing. It is almost full time—11 months, 12 months of continuous work. Yet the job agencies in those areas—jobactive, whatever name you want to give it—had failed to match people looking for work with the jobs that are available.


Another example in my own electorate is a meatworks in Kyneton that is keen to employ locals looking for a job. All the job agencies, the job networks, had failed to connect the jobseekers. The people that they kept bringing out were vegans, vegetarians and the long-term unemployed. It took Bendigo Community Health Services resettlement officers and myself meeting with the company, doing the walkthrough and basically being the matchmaking service to get recently arrived migrants of Karen and Afghani descent working there—and now they are working!


It's a great news story, but it should be something that happens automatically because of the priorities of a government that invests properly in supporting people to work. The job agency, jobactive—whatever fancy name this government gives—aren't working. 


The other area where this government is failing is on jobs. They say all these new jobs have been created under their watch, but what jobs? How many insecure jobs are there? How many casual jobs are there? How many jobs are full-time but working for labour hire so people can be sacked at any minute? We have a real crisis going on in our economy when it comes to jobs. Young people can't get entry-level jobs. Companies are now looking overseas, because they can get experienced overseas workers to come here, before investing and training in our own workers.


Just yesterday we had this government push through a bill in this House that stripped labour market testing out of our 457 visa system. Why would you do that? Why would you give companies the opportunity to bring in whoever they want and not do labour market testing? They've taken it out of the legislation and said, 'Don't worry, we'll do it. We're going to create an instrument. Don't worry, trust us.' Not that that instrument is disallowable; we just have to trust them. Australians do not trust this government, and they do not trust them to stand up for jobs, health and education, and to make sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax and are accountable. 


This government is failing on education. We've just gone back to school in central Victoria, and a number of schools wanted to run programs this year that won't run because of this government's funding cuts to schools. I'm talking about senior secondary, which is $1.2 million worse off because this government did not honour the original Gonski funding model. A school like Weeroona College—$800,000 a year worse off. Just imagine the programs they could have had. Just imagine the support and the opportunities they could have given to those students. Meanwhile, Girton Grammar, just up the road, is a very good school. The parents do pay a lot in fees. That school actually got an increase in funding, close to a million dollars extra from this government. Yet the school that has the disadvantaged students, the kids most at risk and the most diverse student population gets a funding cut. 


It always comes back to priorities in budgets and budgeting, and all I can say is that this government's priorities are wrong. They're not prioritising our schools. They're not prioritising our hospitals. They're not prioritising Victorian roads and rail. They are not prioritising young jobseekers. They are not prioritising TAFE and university. Instead, what they are prioritising is big tax cuts for multinationals and making sure millionaires pay as little tax as possible.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (19:28):  In the time permitting, this could be the final in my series on the by-election of Bennelong. I have previously spoken about the tenor of the debate and some of the volunteers who stood out. However, there are many more people to thank, and I would like to try to name some more of them today. 


As with all campaigns, we would never have been successful without volunteers. Over 700 people came out to help us in this by-election—from making phone calls, handing out leaflets at train stations and standing in the baking heat of the West Ryde pre-poll or the combustible footpath of the Epping pre-poll and, of course, on polling day itself. Our hundreds of volunteers made the difference. 


Some of these people have been with us for every election. Some have just joined the Bennelong family, but every one of them raised the bar of this campaign, giving their all and making the difference at the end of the day. I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to every one of you. 


It's always dangerous to identify individuals as I will most certainly forget some people who deserve special praise. I have already called out Helen Russell, Bob Lawrence and Daryl Maguire MP, for they turned up every single day at the pre-poll and every night to make phone calls rain, hail or shine. Elizabeth Frias was a constant smiling presence at prepoll too, while local stalwart Kevin Pagadinimath was at every station and bus stop every morning. As with every year, the local Young Liberals were the difference. One silver lining of the national spotlight on this campaign was that Young Liberals came from all over the country and I was able to see that our young volunteers—

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (19:30):  I want to talk tonight a little bit about how the Turnbull and Abbott governments and the Hodgman government in Tasmania are really letting our state down. One of the first acts of the federal Liberal government was to cut over a billion dollars from health in Tasmania. That has had a disastrous effect on our state—absolutely disastrous. We have ambulance ramping in our hospitals. We have people waiting ages and ages to get to see a specialist. I am hearing stories all the time of people who are getting bowel test kits back who are waiting way beyond the recommended time frame to see a gastroenterologist. We have some really serious issues in our health system in Tasmania.


But Labor has a plan. State and federal Labor have been working together, and state Labor, under our leader Rebecca White, has made a very comprehensive plan for the future of health in Tasmania. What we saw last weekend was Premier Will Hodgman come out and try and say, 'I'm going to spend more and I've got a better figure,' but when one looks at that figure it says an awful lot, because what Labor is going to do is to actually employ people—paramedics; doctors; nurses—in a first Labor state government term; what the Liberal government is going to do is to spend capital. We've already got a lot of capital works happening in the health system in Tasmania. Our Royal Hobart Hospital reconstruction, that was funded by state and federal Labor, is still underway. It has had delays again under the Hodgman and Turnbull governments. But Labor has a substantive plan, and we want to employ the staff needed to deal with what is happening in our health system in Tasmania—very unlike the Liberal plan.


But it's not just in health where they're letting Tasmanians down very badly. We've heard in this place this week that it's also in infrastructure—roads funding. We've heard about how there has not been one major road or bridge project in Tasmania since the election of the Abbott and Turnbull governments—in all of that time, five years, not one new project has been announced. The only projects underway in Tasmania are those that were already committed to and were going to be invested in by Labor state and federal governments. What we did see was $100 million cut from the Midland Highway. But I was astounded this week—as I'm sure many people in here were—to hear the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, when asked about infrastructure in Tasmania, talk about Inland Rail. I was absolutely flabbergasted. I'm not really sure whether he understands the concept of 'inland', but I don't think that means it crosses the water. I'm also interested in whether or not that means we're getting a bridge to the mainland. I'm sure we're not, but we haven't had any bridge funding either, so perhaps—you never know. We do have a bridge that needs some funding; it's called the Bridgewater Bridge. It is on the Midland Highway—the highway they cut $100 million of funding out of. So it would be quite good if we could actually get a bridge funded in Tasmania—but perhaps not one for the inland rail!


We also need some tourism infrastructure in Tasmania. People would be aware that Tasmania has been very, very successful in growing our tourism numbers. That is a credit to all of the governments, on both sides, for their commitment to tourism. But I am really concerned about the growth in the tourism numbers and the fact that there has been no planning for them. We haven't had a government at the state or federal level that has been willing to plan, with the two tiers of government, for how we're going to deal with this growth. We have iconic national parks that many people in this place will have visited—and if they haven't, they should certainly come on down—places like Freycinet and places like Cradle Mountain, that really need some more care. We need to ensure that the very thing that people are going there to see is not destroyed. If you want to go to Freycinet National Park in mid-season in January and February, you have to turn up before eight o'clock in the morning or you won't get a car park. That is really affecting the whole experience for people coming to Tasmania. At the last federal election, federal Labor had a plan to spend $42 million on tourism infrastructure in Tasmania. It would be great to see a similar commitment from the other side.


The other issue, which has also been raised in this House in the last week or so, is biosecurity. We've seen breaches and we've seen fruit fly in Tasmania for the first time. This comes after the state Liberal government, in its first year, cut a million dollars from biosecurity and cut staff for biosecurity. I've just said we had an increase in tourism. We've had more people coming by plane and boat, and the government's response was to cut biosecurity staff. Now we're seeing the very sad consequences of that. (Time expired)

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (16:00):  Over January, I had the great opportunity to go around and visit some of the community organisations in my electorate that have been funded under the Stronger Communities Program. I think that all members in this place will agree that the commitment from local community organisations is remarkable. They are mostly volunteers, who put in so much time, energy and effort to make a success of these local organisations for their communities. The first one that I visited was Anzac Park at Lindisfarne. They are receiving just $5,742.50, but this will allow them to upgrade their kitchen facilities so that they are able to host functions and events to generate more income for the sporting clubs that use that facility. The cricket, junior football and football clubs of Lindisfarne all use that one facility. It is owned and managed by council and council also puts a lot into that facility, but this very small grant will make a very big difference to the clubs and the events and functions that they're able to hold for members and for the public to raise revenue. So I was really pleased to be able to do that and I know that the grant will be used really well by the local community.


Another grant was made to the iconic Wooden Boat Centre, in Franklin, in my electorate. Franklin is a very small town, a village, on the Huon River in the south of my electorate. The Working Waterfront Association is the body that has applied for the grant for $13,220. This is for much-needed repairs of the roof. This is a master craft place, very unique in Australia, where master craftsmen teach people how to make wooden boats in ancient Huon pine and celery top pine—actually handcrafting vessels in my electorate. It is remarkable to go and see the work that is being done, the number of volunteers and the number of people who are using this facility in my electorate, and I know that it has great support from all parties in Tasmania because it is such a unique facility. It has so many community members coming through. The grant will repair the original workshop's rusty and leaking roof and ensure that the centre is able to go on and be useful for some time. At the moment, they've got all sorts of things trying to catch the water coming through the roof. It is a very old building and this well mean a lot to them. They've already opened up the facility to allow tourists to come through. They're a getting a large number of visitors now to the Wooden Boat Centre. There are also people coming from all over the country and all over the world, including some doctors on sabbatical, to learn how to build a craft boat, by hand, with Tasmania's ancient timbers. It's a remarkable organisation in a remarkable part of my electorate and I'm very pleased to have supported these grants.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:54):  This is another reform from the government that was aimed at avoiding a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector in Australia. Nonetheless, Labor is supporting the establishment of an Australian Financial Complaints Authority, despite the shortcomings of this proposal, which I will go through in some detail in my address.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill makes changes to the external dispute resolution framework for the financial services sector. It implements the recommendations of the Ramsay review into external dispute resolution, which reported in April 2017. The central change in the bill is the new one-stop shop ombudsman, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The AFCA will replace three existing complaints bodies: the two ombudsman schemes—the Financial Ombudsman Service and the small Credit and Investments Ombudsman—and the statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, which operates with respect to superannuation disputes in Australia. The new AFCA will follow the model of the existing ombudsman schemes and will be in the form of a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. The minister will approve a scheme which will become the AFCA. All financial firms and superannuation trustees will be required to be members of the AFCA. As with the FOS and the CIO at the moment, the operational aspects of the AFCA scheme will be based on private-law contractual obligations between the AFCA and the financial firms who are members of the scheme. At the moment, there are three external dispute resolution schemes: the ombudsman schemes and the statutory SCT.


On closer inspection of the government's plans for the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman, this is simply a merging and a rebadging of the two existing ombudsman services into the one scheme, with a different threshold—and we do welcome the higher monetary thresholds for the disputes that can be heard—but with no new additional powers that the existing dispute resolution bodies don't already have.


The bill also purports to copy and paste the powers of the statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal into the new Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which will be a private company listed by guarantee, as I said. However, in doing this, the bill will result in reduced consumer protections for superannuation disputes, and that's the issue Labor has with the government's proposal. The SCT was a specialised tribunal with specialised members who were able to hear complaints regarding superannuation issues from members and others who work in this area, in a timely fashion with expert advice, ensuring that resolutions could be reached. We believe it's disingenuous for the government to try and shut down this SCT scheme because of delays in the resolution of its complaints when we know that the government has cut funding and has cut staff to the SCT, leaving it in a precarious position in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of its work. These changes risk losing some of that expertise that currently exists in the SCT.


While many of the SCT's powers are replicated in the new one-stop shop, there are changes between the powers of the SCT and the powers of the AFCA that stakeholders say result in a reduction in consumer protections. These include the fact that the bill retains appeal rights for superannuation determinations but does not include the current appeal rights for administrative decisions of the SCT. The SCT has the power to require information required or shared at the initial review stage to be kept confidential at the moment. According to the SCT, information collected during superannuation dispute resolutions can be highly personal, sensitive, inflammatory and identifiable—for example, family members fighting over who is entitled to a death benefit under superannuation life insurance policies. Currently, the SCT has an explicit statutory power to cancel the membership of a life policy fund if it finds that the conduct relating to the selling of that fund was unfair or unreasonable. And there's no limit on the value of the claim that the SCT is allowed to hear. This is important in disputes about life insurance policies held through super funds. The bill seeks to retain this unlimited jurisdiction for superannuation disputes. However, the SCT states that it's unclear that all disputes involving life insurance in super would receive the benefit of the unlimited jurisdiction. The final issue includes the fact that, as a private body, the new AFCA is not subject to freedom of information as currently exists for the SCT.


These reforms were supported by the House of Representatives Economics Committee, and Labor more generally. It's because of the government's strong desire to hold the banks to account that they're doing this, but is it also because of the government's intention to stand up for financial victims of the bank rip-offs and scandals over recent years? I don't believe it is. This body exists because it's one element of the government's attempts to prevent a royal commission into the banks. That's the point that I made earlier: this is another limb of this government's argument to stop a royal commission into the banking sector in this country. It was only when the banks gave the green light to the Prime Minister by writing to him and saying, 'It's okay to hold a royal commission now,' that the government eventually rolled over and held the commission, which commenced its proceedings yesterday.


The key issue that I've raised time and time again is: how is this going to work? The bill and the information provided to the industry, and to everybody with an interest in this, is scant at best. We've held several meetings with stakeholders who work in this industry. They have expressed the reservations that I outlined earlier about the operation of this new one-stop stop—in particular the folding into this body of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.


Since 2016, and in response to anger from his backbench about the behaviour of the banks, the Prime Minister has been promising that we will get a low-cost, speedy tribunal to deal with these types of consumer complaints—customer complaints against banks—and that this will be real action. But then the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services had to walk back from this guarantee and argue that the Prime Minister really meant only a 'little T' tribunal, not a 'big T' tribunal. The budget announced a new body, to be called the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, but let's be clear: this reform was designed to take pressure off the banks for that royal commission, a royal commission that the Prime Minister only called when the banks wrote to him and told him that it was okay to do so.


We all know in this place there have been far too many examples of poor behaviour in the banking and financial services sector, going right back to the scandals involving Storm Financial and Trio Capital through to the CBA wealth management scandals, the CommInsure scandals, the bank bill swap-rate scandals and, more recently, the problems that the Commonwealth Bank is having with alleged contraventions of anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws. The scandals keep on coming, and it's only through a royal commission that we will be able to get to the bottom of what's going on in this industry for a fair dinkum, independent assessment of the problems in the banking and financial services sector in Australia and with a set of recommendations that all sides of government, including the opposition and the Greens, can have confidence in. Hopefully, we can restore confidence, strength and stability to Australia's financial services industry.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (17:04):  It's a pleasure to stand in this place and speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017, which the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has put before the House.


I am pleased to say that the particular framework that has been created through this bill is something that I've had a number of discussions with the minister about. I think it's an enormous step in the right direction in terms of providing a robust complaints resolution system for when there are problems. Sadly, the current system has shown its failings, or its shortcomings, in dealing with some of the more egregious examples of bank misbehaviour over the past few years. I think this bill is a practical and much-needed improvement for consumers. An important addition is small business, and providing access to free, fast and binding financial dispute resolution. I think that that is a key component of this bill—that the decisions coming out of this body will be binding resolutions to matters. 


The bill enacts the government's commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the independent review of external dispute resolutions, commonly known as the Ramsay review. I want to give the minister due credit for pursuing this course of action to establish this tribunal to deal with these issues. As I said, I had a number of discussions with the minister on this particular type of model, and I fully support, therefore, what this bill is trying to achieve, because I think it creates a one-stop shop, to resolve these issues where there are these complaints. We've seen, for example, the situation where the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal had taken an average of almost 800 days to resolve consumer complaints. That is nowhere near good enough, in anybody's book—that somebody has to wait nearly 800 days, on average, to have a complaint resolved. The bill addresses these issues with the creation of this new one-stop external dispute resolution body called the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. It will replace FOS, the CIO and the SCT and bring them all into one organisation. It will commence from 1 July 2018, from which time all new complaints will be dealt with by the new body. 


The new Australian Financial Complaints Authority, as I've touched on already, will reduce confusion as it will handle all financial complaints. One of the things we heard frequently was that when people had an issue with financial services it wasn't clear who they should go to, to make a complaint and try to have that complaint resolved. That's what this body will do. By having a one-stop-stop that includes superannuation complaints, managing the complaints will be a smoother and more professional process. 


Importantly, this is about creating a body that will provide resolution for consumers of their concerns. It is true that the banks and the financial services organisations over the years have let themselves down, and they do need to be held accountable for their shortfalls, but this is where people will have the opportunity to raise those complaints and those concerns. Importantly, the new authority will also be able to hear higher value complaints and award higher amounts of compensation, increasing access to redress for consumers and small business. 


The key element of the new one-stop shop is that it is a single new external dispute resolution body to handle all financial disputes, authorised by the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. The scheme will be industry funded, which will allow flexibility to increase funding in response to unforeseen increases in complaint volumes. The authority will be governed by a board, comprising an independent chair and an equal number of directors with consumer and industry backgrounds. At the establishment of the authority, the minister will appoint the chair and a minority of board members. The authority will be able to hear disputes of up to $1 million and be able to award compensation of up to $500,000. Consumers and small business will be able to bring a complaint about a credit facility where the facility is for an amount of up to $5 million, and they may be awarded compensation of up to $1 million. There is an unlimited monetary jurisdiction being maintained for all superannuation disputes. 


I think it is worth looking at the history of how we got to the point of needing to change current arrangements. I've probably touched on some of that already, but it's worth looking at a broader review. The Ramsay review found that the current dispute resolution framework was the product of history rather than design. It found that having multiple schemes with overlapping jurisdictions means it's difficult to achieve comparable outcomes for consumers with similar complaints, and more difficult for consumers to progress disputes involving firms that are members of different schemes. This, as I touched on earlier, increases the risk of confusion for consumers. 


Also, we've seen that the current monetary limits for FOS and the CIO are no longer fit for purpose and are preventing access for many individuals and small business to the complaints resolution processes of FOS and the CIO. The current monetary limit of $500,000 and the compensation cap of $309,000 bear little relationship to the value of most financial products—for example, residential mortgages, a range of insurance policies and even some investments. There are fundamental problems with dispute resolution arrangements for superannuation, which I've touched upon before, with the enormous backlog at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. 


There has been support from the industry for the creation of this authority. Gerard Brody, the CEO of the Consumer Law Action Centre, stated:


Australians need one, high quality service to resolve their disputes against financial institutions quickly and fairly. The one-stop shop … is a sensible move that can help Australians get justice. 


Choice has also welcomed the announcement, which will provide consumers with this single, one-stop shop. The authority will also assist with small business. The Council of Small Business of Australia noted:


… this new Authority will provide business owners with a clear mechanism to seek redress where they have been unfairly done by.


Consumers will benefit from the new framework through the ability of the authority to have flexibility in dealing with complaints in a timely manner and to have direct control over its funding and processes. This is envisaged to deliver practical improvements to consumers and small business. At the end of the day, that's what we're interested in. We're interested in seeking a model that is going to assist consumers and small businesses to have their disputes resolved in a timely and efficient manner. Consumers will be able to approach the authority to resolve all financial complaints, eliminating, as I touched on before, the uncertainty and the confusion. Where complaints cover multiple providers within the financial system, these complaints will now be able to be handled by the one authority. 


The bill also introduces a new internal dispute resolution reporting regime to provide firms with an incentive to have best practice for internal dispute resolution. It is disappointing that, at a time when our financial services organisations are well aware of their corporate responsibility, their internal dispute resolution systems are not able to resolve these complaints and we need to proceed to an external dispute resolution process. But this new internal dispute resolution reporting regime is designed to ensure that financial systems firms do have first-class internal dispute resolution processes. I would hope, through that process, and improving their internal dispute resolution process, that the need for complaints to be referred to the authority and to an external dispute resolution process is minimised.


The establishment of this authority—the powers it has, the opportunities it will provide, the flexibility it has, the increased financial limits that will apply, and consumers and small businesses knowing they can go to one place to have their concerns heard and dealt with—will be of tremendous benefit to consumers and small business. I would like to thank the minister for her willingness to discuss this over the past 12 months or so and to be open to discussing various ideas. I commend this bill to this House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-02-13,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:14):  It is disappointing that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017 is coming forward in this form, and without additional promises of resourcing. I think anyone who has looked at the complaints-handling systems in this area would probably agree that some things could be done better. But, when you ask the people who actually work in those bodies that exist at the moment, 'What could be done to better improve complaints, say, around superannuation?', one of the loud responses that comes back is, 'Properly resource us.' In the context where this government regularly takes the axe to the Public Service and where it sees public servants not as people who work for the benefit of the community but instead simply as a cost to be cut, it's not surprising that people find themselves facing, potentially, long waiting times to get their various disputes resolved.


One of the things we've seen with the royal commission that the government was dragged kicking and screaming to support was that of course it couldn't let pass by an opportunity to attack industry superannuation funds, even though those funds often return much better returns than other funds. I say this as someone with a foot in both camps. I have an industry fund but also a private fossil fuel-free fund in Future Fund. I say this not being on one side of the chamber that feels they have a vested interest to either defend or attack, but it is very, very clear the government will use every opportunity it can to attack what it perceived to be funds that have union links, and so it is with this bill. 


The government comes along and says, 'Well, here's a couple of complaints-handling authorities where we could make a difference'. Then it looks at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and, for reasons that are not really made out, asserts that there is a problem that can't be fixed with better resourcing and so decides that the tribunal needs to be abolished and rolled into a new organisation. One of the things that concern me about that is that this is all being done without any promise of additional resourcing. It is not at all clear from all the things we've heard from members of the government—concerns about trying to get their disputes resolved—that this not necessarily going to fix that at all. At the end of the day this is as much about ideology and responding to political pressures as it is about making a sensible decision about dealing with the governance of superannuation funds. You look at every other area with superannuation funds—changes to directorships and the like—and it is making these changes on an evidence-free basis, purely on the basis of ideology. I worry that is the case with this bill as well. 


There have been some suggestions made that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has been far too legalistic. One of the things the people who work there have impressed on me in my discussions with them is that many of the complaints are resolved informally, without the need to proceed through the formal complaints process. Whether or not they're counted in the statistics that government members rely on, I don't know, but it has certainly been the case that, although they're called a tribunal, in many respects they've actually operated almost like an ombudsman: they've helped take complaints and resolve them, often without having to initiate formal processes with funds, as one might expect and one might hope. It is not at all clear that that process is going to continue or, at least, that there'll be a separate, dedicated level of resources given to that industry. 


It is also concerning in that respect that we see this slow privatisation of complaints handling mechanisms and of government authorities, because—putting aside the principal position, the ideology of that—one of the things that does, for example, is remove the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, to the extent that it's covered by FOI and AAT, from that process, removes it from that oversight. I'm not saying that every decision of the complaints tribunal could be taken to one of those bodies but, certainly, the internal processes were governed by that. The more that governments take bodies that make decisions out of the public realm, slot them over and say, 'We're going to create a new private company now,' the less oversight there is over the way these organisations do business. We've got laws that demand that people get paid superannuation. It's not an option now: if you're an employer you have to pay it for your employee. So, we have a federal law that says we have to funnel huge amounts of money into these schemes. Given that they're federally regulated, you'd expect that when complaints arise there should also be some federal oversight of those complaints. But taking away AAT and taking away FOI in the way that I'm advised will happen as a result of this is not right.


The previous member said: 'Oh, well, this is all good. It's got the support of the industry.' Again, that's not right. Industry Super—again, an organisation that I don't have any particular ties to; I'm not here to bat for them politically, one way or the other—have come out and said: 'No, we don't support this change. We think there's a better way of dealing with complaints within superannuation.'


So I was hopeful that some of the good elements of this bill might have been able to prevail in the amendments that were moved in the Senate—I believe by the opposition—around the issue of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Sadly, they didn't succeed. There were some other amendments that we proposed that I understand did succeed, and that's good. They made the bill slightly better. But without some further attention being paid to and the further case being made out as to why the SCT should be rolled in together with all of these other bodies then that aspect of the bill can't be supported, because it will make a change for which no case has been made and which could be fixed through other means—if the government wanted to stop attacking the Public Service and instead support it. And it has the potential for a number of deleterious consequences, including less oversight.


I imagine that this bill is going to sail through this place in the way that it sailed through the Senate, but I think opposition to that point, in particular, needs to be made, because it's an issue that was raised with the government when this bill was being progressed. They've steadfastly—I think perhaps for ideological reasons—refused to countenance any change to deal with that issue. As a result, opposition to that part of the bill has to be placed on record.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (17:22):  I am very pleased to be able to speak to the issues arising from the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017, currently before this chamber. I speak to the bill in the context of a 30-year career as a legal practitioner, primarily as a commercial practitioner, but also in the latter part of my career as a litigation practitioner, addressing a lot of work within the financial services industry but also dealing with people as customers who were attempting to deal with, I might say, the pointy end of the financial services industry.


It's important for this place to understand that there is significant anxiety generated, particularly when a financial organisation seeks to take possession of real estate that's been pledged to secure a customer's obligations under a loan. In other words, the foreclosure process brings the customer and the bank into conflict. And, up to now, that conflict has really only been softened or ameliorated by the intervention of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the alternative dispute resolution services that are made available by the financial institutions.


We also need to be mindful of the fact that there has been significant disquiet in the community about financial institutions and the banking industry, and that that disquiet has led to significant pressure being placed upon the government to inquire into the conduct of financial institutions. Hence, Labor announced at the last election that it would support the establishment of a royal commission to inquire into misconduct in the financial services sector.


What we have before us today is very much the government's initial response to that political pressure that it was necessary and appropriate to inquire into misconduct within the financial services industry. Unfortunately, as is the case with the government's response with respect to the rolling out of infrastructure, there is a very significant gap between announcement and deliverable, particularly when you look at what's being proposed in this legislation.


Let me be perfectly clear. Labor moved amendments to this legislation in the Senate so as to retain the existing tribunal which addressed statutory superannuation complaints. That was undertaken in order to protect the quality of superannuation dispute resolution and the integrity of the compulsory superannuation system. The central reason for that was that Labor felt that it was necessary to keep this new authority out of regulation of or inquiry into complaints dealing with superannuation. We moved those amendments in good faith because we believed that the changes that we proposed would have significantly improved this legislation. We are disappointed that the amendments were not accepted by the Senate. We are also concerned that the government has not been able to give satisfactory answers to questions about how the transition process that will apply to the new financial complaints body in this bill would work—because we're not talking about something which is trivial in execution. We're talking about the consolidation of a number of different organisations, including a statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, into one body. We know, nevertheless, that this will pass the House, and Labor will support the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives.


It is appropriate that we consider some of the history leading to the introduction of this bill and why we're here today. As I said earlier, in April 2016 the opposition announced that a Labor government would establish a royal commission into misconduct within the financial services sector. It might be fairly put that the government's response was somewhat lacklustre. It concentrated on reforming the powers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and implementing the Ramsay review into the financial system external dispute resolution processes. An expert panel conducted a review to ensure that the Australian system of external dispute resolution was effectively meeting the needs of users of the financial system. As I indicated in my opening, I've seen this in operation. I've seen it in operation while acting for the banks, but I've also seen this at the pointy end when individual customers are endeavouring to deal with external dispute resolution. I've seen where litigation has been stayed as a consequence of a complaint made under the Financial Ombudsman Service and the other schemes.


Whilst there might be a case built for the establishment of a consolidated one-stop shop as described by the government, I do still have significant concerns as to the incorporation of the separate and distinct area of superannuation into that one-stop shop. The bill combines three existing external dispute resolution schemes—that is, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The new body, as everybody is aware, will be known as the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. What needs to be emphasised is that this bill actually abolishes an existing tribunal under what might be described as a 'rebranding' exercise. 


Of course, the context for this is vitally important to understand because this was in the context of Labor's calls for a royal commission. In late 2016 the Prime Minister promised a low-cost speedy tribunal to deal with financial sector complaints. He said this would constitute real action against the banks. Rather than real action, what we have with this bill is a merging of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman rebadged as the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The body has no new or additional powers other than accruing some additional jurisdiction—that is, monetary jurisdiction—in that the new authority can hear disputes with higher monetary thresholds than its predecessors. That is a good thing in the sense that it opens up the jurisdiction to more disputes.


If you were cynical, you would think that the implementation of this complaints authority was simply another delaying tactic from this government intended to stave off increasing public pressure for a banking royal commission. Before now, most disputes with financial service providers in Australia were resolved through internal dispute resolution processes between the customer and the relevant bank or other providers. I know the protocols that apply with particular complaints. I know the banks are required to investigate certain complaints, escalate particular complaints, but it doesn't remove, in my view, the general concerns that we have regarding financial misconduct, particularly in the area of sales of financial instruments and financial advice.


There have been far too many examples of poor conduct on the part of the banks and the financial service providers, including illegal activity, misconduct, inappropriate financial advice, insurance claims unfairly declined, fraudulent activity, the targeting of whistleblowers and irresponsible lending. Many of those complaints of particularly egregious behaviour have been seen by me in the course of my legal practice. And, of course, it is true that if you needed to articulate that argument in a court, it would be very difficult to do that with the resources that are available to a financial institution like a major bank and the resources available to an individual customer. That is, after all, why Labor remain committed to the establishment of a royal commission into the financial sector that would extend to banks, insurance providers and superannuation funds.


It must be emphasised that the word 'authority' in this particular authority's name is a misnomer. This is just another ombudsman scheme, according to the minister, as confirmed in the Senate, in this case in the form of a private company limited by a guarantee. There are already two of these organisations in existence for financial services disputes, which, as I've said earlier, are the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman. The bill abolishes the three existing complaints-handling bodies and, in many respects, represents a merger and rebranding of the work of three separate authorities. There is some overlap between the work of the two previous bodies. Indeed, I've seen some financial firms choose one or other of the ombudsman services and, in practical operation, they seem to me to be indistinguishable. At the moment, a customer who has a dispute with a bank, an insurer, a payday lender or a mortgage broker can go to an ombudsman scheme to have their dispute resolved. Once this bill passes, the customers will be able to go to an ombudsman scheme to have the dispute resolved.


We have some concerns as to the transitional arrangements that are proposed. The government has said that AFCA will start from 1 July 2018 for new complaints and so we're hoping that the government has given proper consideration to make sure the transition process works.


There has been a Senate inquiry, and it has raised concerns about this. A commentator, Mike Taylor, summarised in Super Review some of the concerns about this process in light of evidence given to the Senate:


There is much to suggest that the creation of AFCA represents a bureaucratic slow-motion train crash with the Treasury officials confirming that the financial services industry will have to deal with four different external dispute resolution schemes for at least a year after the necessary legislation is passed and that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will still be clearing its workload as late as 2022.


Labor has questioned the government in the Senate about the transition plans and how they would make sure that the transition to the AFCA would work. The lack of detail in the answers has been very concerning. It seems that since the bill passed the Senate the government has announced additional funding in MYEFO, which of course is welcome, to help the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal work through its existing workload. It was very concerning that the government did not appear to properly plan for this when announcing AFCA in the budget.


As I said earlier, these sorts of external dispute resolution schemes are very important. They are important to give the voice to consumers, sometimes in situations which are really riven by conflict. The situations that I've seen are those where customers are the subject of foreclosure proceedings, and in those circumstances it's certainly appropriate for external dispute resolution to be promoted by any responsible regulator or government. However, as I've said in my remarks this afternoon, it's vitally important that the government understands that there is an existing effective complaint scheme with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The effectiveness of the transitional arrangements needs to be monitored and they need to be properly resourced. We'll have a situation where, if the government takes its eye off the ball, there will be significant distress occasioned to people that are already exposed to the stress of foreclosure or dispute with a financial institution.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (17:37):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Today the government is delivering on its commitment to overhaul the financial dispute resolution framework as announced in the 2017 budget in response to the Ramsay review. There is a clear need to improve the dispute resolution framework, which is a product of history rather than design. Currently, there are three external dispute resolution bodies: the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman.


The existence of multiple external dispute resolution schemes with overlapping jurisdictions means it is more difficult to achieve similar outcomes for consumers with similar complaints. It is also difficult for consumers to know which scheme to approach, leading to duplicative costs within the system. The monetary limits and compensation caps that apply under the existing schemes are manifestly too low and are not working to ensure access to justice for consumers and small businesses. FOS' and the CIO's current monetary limit of $500,000 and compensation caps of $309,000 bear little relationship to the value of most financial products and are no longer fit for purpose. Similarly, the monetary limit of $2 million for credit disputes and a compensation cap of $309,000 is precluding too many small businesses from accessing justice under the existing schemes.


Further, the dispute resolution arrangements for superannuation are in drastic need of improvement. The inflexible tribunal model has meant that the SCT has been unable to resolve disputes in a timely manner, and the body now has a significant backlog of legacy claims. At the time of the Ramsay review, the SCT was taking an average of 796 days to resolve a dispute that reached determination stage. This is clearly unacceptable.


In April 2016, the government commissioned an independent comprehensive review of the dispute resolution framework, led by an expert panel comprising Professor Ian Ramsay, Julie Abramson and Alan Kirkland. The review made 11 recommendations to strengthen and futureproof the dispute resolution framework, and the government accepted all of these recommendations.


The flagship recommendation was for the establishment of a new one-stop shop industry funded dispute resolution scheme to hear and determine all financial disputes, including superannuation disputes. The new scheme would replace the SCT, FOS and CIO. The reforms in this bill to establish the Australian Financial Complaints Authority will radically overhaul how financial disputes are dealt with in Australia and will ensure that significantly more consumers and small businesses have access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution. 


All financial firms, including superannuation funds, that deal with consumers will be required by law to be members of AFCA, and decisions of AFCA will be binding on financial firms. AFCA will be based on an industry ombudsman model, which will provide it with the flexibility to adapt to changes in the financial system and user expectations. By not restricting how AFCA deals with complaints, the framework enables AFCA to be flexible and innovative and to take advantage of new technologies and techniques in the resolution disputes. 


AFCA will be a not-for-profit company governed by a board comprising an independent chair and equal numbers of directors with industry and consumer backgrounds. The bill introduces a legislative framework which sets out the standards that AFCA must adhere to, ensuring that AFCA is accountable to its all users: consumers, small businesses and members of financial firms. Under the legislative framework, AFCA will be accessible to consumers and small businesses which would be able to have their disputes heard by AFCA for free, and will be funded by industry. AFCA will have a range of statutory powers to effectively manage superannuation complaints, such as the ability to join third parties to a dispute, to require parties to attend conciliation, and to require the production of information. 


As the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, I will authorise the new AFCA scheme and I will have the ability to set conditions on authorisation. Until I am satisfied the scheme will have robust systems and processes, I will not authorise AFCA. I will also appoint the independent chair and a minority of the initial AFCA board to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of skills and experience. 


The Australian Securities and Investment Commission will be responsible for overseeing AFCA to ensure that it meets the standards set out in the legislation. So that ASIC can fulfil this role, the legislation will provide ASIC with the ability to set regulatory requirements that AFCA must adhere to and will also provide ASIC with a general directions power to compel AFCA to comply with the standards set out in the legislation. In addition, ASIC will have a specific directions power that can be used to require AFCA to increase funding in the event that it is insufficiently financed. 


The bill was examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. In response to the committee's report, the government moved a number of amendments to provide additional certainty and clarity around aspects of AFCA's operations, to ensure it will operate as effectively as possible. Additionally, the government will commission an independent review of the new external dispute resolution arrangements 18 months after AFCA commences operations. This review will take into account feedback from consumers and small businesses regarding whether AFCA resolved their complaint in a way that was fair, efficient, timely and independent. The review will also specifically examine the appropriateness of the monetary limits applying to complaints relating to credit facilities provided to primary production businesses. The Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations was consulted in relation to the bill and to these amendments, and has approved them as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002.


While overhauling the dispute resolution framework, the government also looked to strengthen the internal dispute resolution processes within firms. The legislation also introduces a new IDR reporting regime. Under the regime, ASIC will be provided with the power to collect and publish IDR data at both the aggregate and firm level.


Being such a significant reform, the government understands the importance of having a smooth transition from the existing dispute resolution bodies to AFCA. That is why the government has created a transition team, led by Dr Malcolm Edey, a former assistant governor of the Reserve Bank, to drive the establishment of AFCA. The transition team has undertaken consultation with key stakeholders, and feedback from that consultation process will inform its advice to government on AFCA's terms of reference, governance and funding arrangements. It will also advise government on the transitional arrangements required to appropriately resolve legacy disputes of the three existing schemes. 


Once the legislation is passed by the parliament, I will be seeking an application for authorisation. Following an assessment of that application, I will be authorising AFCA and making my formal appointments to the board. It is my intention to do this as swiftly as possible, to ensure that the AFCA board has the maximum time available to put in place the required operational arrangements, including securing membership and funding, and to undertake consultation on its terms of reference and funding arrangements ahead of AFCA's commencement. In line with advice received by Dr Edey and the transition team and in order to facilitate an orderly transition to AFCA, it is my intention that AFCA will commence accepting disputes no later than 1 November 2018. 


The change to IDR and the establishment of AFCA will ensure that consumers have free, fast and binding resolutions of complaints regarding financial services, ensuring confidence in our financial system. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:54):  This is another reform from the government that was aimed at avoiding a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector in Australia. Nonetheless, Labor is supporting the establishment of an Australian Financial Complaints Authority, despite the shortcomings of this proposal, which I will go through in some detail in my address.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill makes changes to the external dispute resolution framework for the financial services sector. It implements the recommendations of the Ramsay review into external dispute resolution, which reported in April 2017. The central change in the bill is the new one-stop shop ombudsman, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The AFCA will replace three existing complaints bodies: the two ombudsman schemes—the Financial Ombudsman Service and the small Credit and Investments Ombudsman—and the statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, which operates with respect to superannuation disputes in Australia. The new AFCA will follow the model of the existing ombudsman schemes and will be in the form of a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. The minister will approve a scheme which will become the AFCA. All financial firms and superannuation trustees will be required to be members of the AFCA. As with the FOS and the CIO at the moment, the operational aspects of the AFCA scheme will be based on private-law contractual obligations between the AFCA and the financial firms who are members of the scheme. At the moment, there are three external dispute resolution schemes: the ombudsman schemes and the statutory SCT.


On closer inspection of the government's plans for the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman, this is simply a merging and a rebadging of the two existing ombudsman services into the one scheme, with a different threshold—and we do welcome the higher monetary thresholds for the disputes that can be heard—but with no new additional powers that the existing dispute resolution bodies don't already have.


The bill also purports to copy and paste the powers of the statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal into the new Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which will be a private company listed by guarantee, as I said. However, in doing this, the bill will result in reduced consumer protections for superannuation disputes, and that's the issue Labor has with the government's proposal. The SCT was a specialised tribunal with specialised members who were able to hear complaints regarding superannuation issues from members and others who work in this area, in a timely fashion with expert advice, ensuring that resolutions could be reached. We believe it's disingenuous for the government to try and shut down this SCT scheme because of delays in the resolution of its complaints when we know that the government has cut funding and has cut staff to the SCT, leaving it in a precarious position in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of its work. These changes risk losing some of that expertise that currently exists in the SCT.


While many of the SCT's powers are replicated in the new one-stop shop, there are changes between the powers of the SCT and the powers of the AFCA that stakeholders say result in a reduction in consumer protections. These include the fact that the bill retains appeal rights for superannuation determinations but does not include the current appeal rights for administrative decisions of the SCT. The SCT has the power to require information required or shared at the initial review stage to be kept confidential at the moment. According to the SCT, information collected during superannuation dispute resolutions can be highly personal, sensitive, inflammatory and identifiable—for example, family members fighting over who is entitled to a death benefit under superannuation life insurance policies. Currently, the SCT has an explicit statutory power to cancel the membership of a life policy fund if it finds that the conduct relating to the selling of that fund was unfair or unreasonable. And there's no limit on the value of the claim that the SCT is allowed to hear. This is important in disputes about life insurance policies held through super funds. The bill seeks to retain this unlimited jurisdiction for superannuation disputes. However, the SCT states that it's unclear that all disputes involving life insurance in super would receive the benefit of the unlimited jurisdiction. The final issue includes the fact that, as a private body, the new AFCA is not subject to freedom of information as currently exists for the SCT.


These reforms were supported by the House of Representatives Economics Committee, and Labor more generally. It's because of the government's strong desire to hold the banks to account that they're doing this, but is it also because of the government's intention to stand up for financial victims of the bank rip-offs and scandals over recent years? I don't believe it is. This body exists because it's one element of the government's attempts to prevent a royal commission into the banks. That's the point that I made earlier: this is another limb of this government's argument to stop a royal commission into the banking sector in this country. It was only when the banks gave the green light to the Prime Minister by writing to him and saying, 'It's okay to hold a royal commission now,' that the government eventually rolled over and held the commission, which commenced its proceedings yesterday.


The key issue that I've raised time and time again is: how is this going to work? The bill and the information provided to the industry, and to everybody with an interest in this, is scant at best. We've held several meetings with stakeholders who work in this industry. They have expressed the reservations that I outlined earlier about the operation of this new one-stop stop—in particular the folding into this body of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.


Since 2016, and in response to anger from his backbench about the behaviour of the banks, the Prime Minister has been promising that we will get a low-cost, speedy tribunal to deal with these types of consumer complaints—customer complaints against banks—and that this will be real action. But then the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services had to walk back from this guarantee and argue that the Prime Minister really meant only a 'little T' tribunal, not a 'big T' tribunal. The budget announced a new body, to be called the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, but let's be clear: this reform was designed to take pressure off the banks for that royal commission, a royal commission that the Prime Minister only called when the banks wrote to him and told him that it was okay to do so.


We all know in this place there have been far too many examples of poor behaviour in the banking and financial services sector, going right back to the scandals involving Storm Financial and Trio Capital through to the CBA wealth management scandals, the CommInsure scandals, the bank bill swap-rate scandals and, more recently, the problems that the Commonwealth Bank is having with alleged contraventions of anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws. The scandals keep on coming, and it's only through a royal commission that we will be able to get to the bottom of what's going on in this industry for a fair dinkum, independent assessment of the problems in the banking and financial services sector in Australia and with a set of recommendations that all sides of government, including the opposition and the Greens, can have confidence in. Hopefully, we can restore confidence, strength and stability to Australia's financial services industry.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (17:04):  It's a pleasure to stand in this place and speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017, which the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has put before the House.


I am pleased to say that the particular framework that has been created through this bill is something that I've had a number of discussions with the minister about. I think it's an enormous step in the right direction in terms of providing a robust complaints resolution system for when there are problems. Sadly, the current system has shown its failings, or its shortcomings, in dealing with some of the more egregious examples of bank misbehaviour over the past few years. I think this bill is a practical and much-needed improvement for consumers. An important addition is small business, and providing access to free, fast and binding financial dispute resolution. I think that that is a key component of this bill—that the decisions coming out of this body will be binding resolutions to matters. 


The bill enacts the government's commitment to deliver on the recommendations of the independent review of external dispute resolutions, commonly known as the Ramsay review. I want to give the minister due credit for pursuing this course of action to establish this tribunal to deal with these issues. As I said, I had a number of discussions with the minister on this particular type of model, and I fully support, therefore, what this bill is trying to achieve, because I think it creates a one-stop shop, to resolve these issues where there are these complaints. We've seen, for example, the situation where the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal had taken an average of almost 800 days to resolve consumer complaints. That is nowhere near good enough, in anybody's book—that somebody has to wait nearly 800 days, on average, to have a complaint resolved. The bill addresses these issues with the creation of this new one-stop external dispute resolution body called the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. It will replace FOS, the CIO and the SCT and bring them all into one organisation. It will commence from 1 July 2018, from which time all new complaints will be dealt with by the new body. 


The new Australian Financial Complaints Authority, as I've touched on already, will reduce confusion as it will handle all financial complaints. One of the things we heard frequently was that when people had an issue with financial services it wasn't clear who they should go to, to make a complaint and try to have that complaint resolved. That's what this body will do. By having a one-stop-stop that includes superannuation complaints, managing the complaints will be a smoother and more professional process. 


Importantly, this is about creating a body that will provide resolution for consumers of their concerns. It is true that the banks and the financial services organisations over the years have let themselves down, and they do need to be held accountable for their shortfalls, but this is where people will have the opportunity to raise those complaints and those concerns. Importantly, the new authority will also be able to hear higher value complaints and award higher amounts of compensation, increasing access to redress for consumers and small business. 


The key element of the new one-stop shop is that it is a single new external dispute resolution body to handle all financial disputes, authorised by the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. The scheme will be industry funded, which will allow flexibility to increase funding in response to unforeseen increases in complaint volumes. The authority will be governed by a board, comprising an independent chair and an equal number of directors with consumer and industry backgrounds. At the establishment of the authority, the minister will appoint the chair and a minority of board members. The authority will be able to hear disputes of up to $1 million and be able to award compensation of up to $500,000. Consumers and small business will be able to bring a complaint about a credit facility where the facility is for an amount of up to $5 million, and they may be awarded compensation of up to $1 million. There is an unlimited monetary jurisdiction being maintained for all superannuation disputes. 


I think it is worth looking at the history of how we got to the point of needing to change current arrangements. I've probably touched on some of that already, but it's worth looking at a broader review. The Ramsay review found that the current dispute resolution framework was the product of history rather than design. It found that having multiple schemes with overlapping jurisdictions means it's difficult to achieve comparable outcomes for consumers with similar complaints, and more difficult for consumers to progress disputes involving firms that are members of different schemes. This, as I touched on earlier, increases the risk of confusion for consumers. 


Also, we've seen that the current monetary limits for FOS and the CIO are no longer fit for purpose and are preventing access for many individuals and small business to the complaints resolution processes of FOS and the CIO. The current monetary limit of $500,000 and the compensation cap of $309,000 bear little relationship to the value of most financial products—for example, residential mortgages, a range of insurance policies and even some investments. There are fundamental problems with dispute resolution arrangements for superannuation, which I've touched upon before, with the enormous backlog at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. 


There has been support from the industry for the creation of this authority. Gerard Brody, the CEO of the Consumer Law Action Centre, stated:


Australians need one, high quality service to resolve their disputes against financial institutions quickly and fairly. The one-stop shop … is a sensible move that can help Australians get justice. 


Choice has also welcomed the announcement, which will provide consumers with this single, one-stop shop. The authority will also assist with small business. The Council of Small Business of Australia noted:


… this new Authority will provide business owners with a clear mechanism to seek redress where they have been unfairly done by.


Consumers will benefit from the new framework through the ability of the authority to have flexibility in dealing with complaints in a timely manner and to have direct control over its funding and processes. This is envisaged to deliver practical improvements to consumers and small business. At the end of the day, that's what we're interested in. We're interested in seeking a model that is going to assist consumers and small businesses to have their disputes resolved in a timely and efficient manner. Consumers will be able to approach the authority to resolve all financial complaints, eliminating, as I touched on before, the uncertainty and the confusion. Where complaints cover multiple providers within the financial system, these complaints will now be able to be handled by the one authority. 


The bill also introduces a new internal dispute resolution reporting regime to provide firms with an incentive to have best practice for internal dispute resolution. It is disappointing that, at a time when our financial services organisations are well aware of their corporate responsibility, their internal dispute resolution systems are not able to resolve these complaints and we need to proceed to an external dispute resolution process. But this new internal dispute resolution reporting regime is designed to ensure that financial systems firms do have first-class internal dispute resolution processes. I would hope, through that process, and improving their internal dispute resolution process, that the need for complaints to be referred to the authority and to an external dispute resolution process is minimised.


The establishment of this authority—the powers it has, the opportunities it will provide, the flexibility it has, the increased financial limits that will apply, and consumers and small businesses knowing they can go to one place to have their concerns heard and dealt with—will be of tremendous benefit to consumers and small business. I would like to thank the minister for her willingness to discuss this over the past 12 months or so and to be open to discussing various ideas. I commend this bill to this House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-02-13,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:14):  It is disappointing that the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017 is coming forward in this form, and without additional promises of resourcing. I think anyone who has looked at the complaints-handling systems in this area would probably agree that some things could be done better. But, when you ask the people who actually work in those bodies that exist at the moment, 'What could be done to better improve complaints, say, around superannuation?', one of the loud responses that comes back is, 'Properly resource us.' In the context where this government regularly takes the axe to the Public Service and where it sees public servants not as people who work for the benefit of the community but instead simply as a cost to be cut, it's not surprising that people find themselves facing, potentially, long waiting times to get their various disputes resolved.


One of the things we've seen with the royal commission that the government was dragged kicking and screaming to support was that of course it couldn't let pass by an opportunity to attack industry superannuation funds, even though those funds often return much better returns than other funds. I say this as someone with a foot in both camps. I have an industry fund but also a private fossil fuel-free fund in Future Fund. I say this not being on one side of the chamber that feels they have a vested interest to either defend or attack, but it is very, very clear the government will use every opportunity it can to attack what it perceived to be funds that have union links, and so it is with this bill. 


The government comes along and says, 'Well, here's a couple of complaints-handling authorities where we could make a difference'. Then it looks at the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and, for reasons that are not really made out, asserts that there is a problem that can't be fixed with better resourcing and so decides that the tribunal needs to be abolished and rolled into a new organisation. One of the things that concern me about that is that this is all being done without any promise of additional resourcing. It is not at all clear from all the things we've heard from members of the government—concerns about trying to get their disputes resolved—that this not necessarily going to fix that at all. At the end of the day this is as much about ideology and responding to political pressures as it is about making a sensible decision about dealing with the governance of superannuation funds. You look at every other area with superannuation funds—changes to directorships and the like—and it is making these changes on an evidence-free basis, purely on the basis of ideology. I worry that is the case with this bill as well. 


There have been some suggestions made that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal has been far too legalistic. One of the things the people who work there have impressed on me in my discussions with them is that many of the complaints are resolved informally, without the need to proceed through the formal complaints process. Whether or not they're counted in the statistics that government members rely on, I don't know, but it has certainly been the case that, although they're called a tribunal, in many respects they've actually operated almost like an ombudsman: they've helped take complaints and resolve them, often without having to initiate formal processes with funds, as one might expect and one might hope. It is not at all clear that that process is going to continue or, at least, that there'll be a separate, dedicated level of resources given to that industry. 


It is also concerning in that respect that we see this slow privatisation of complaints handling mechanisms and of government authorities, because—putting aside the principal position, the ideology of that—one of the things that does, for example, is remove the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, to the extent that it's covered by FOI and AAT, from that process, removes it from that oversight. I'm not saying that every decision of the complaints tribunal could be taken to one of those bodies but, certainly, the internal processes were governed by that. The more that governments take bodies that make decisions out of the public realm, slot them over and say, 'We're going to create a new private company now,' the less oversight there is over the way these organisations do business. We've got laws that demand that people get paid superannuation. It's not an option now: if you're an employer you have to pay it for your employee. So, we have a federal law that says we have to funnel huge amounts of money into these schemes. Given that they're federally regulated, you'd expect that when complaints arise there should also be some federal oversight of those complaints. But taking away AAT and taking away FOI in the way that I'm advised will happen as a result of this is not right.


The previous member said: 'Oh, well, this is all good. It's got the support of the industry.' Again, that's not right. Industry Super—again, an organisation that I don't have any particular ties to; I'm not here to bat for them politically, one way or the other—have come out and said: 'No, we don't support this change. We think there's a better way of dealing with complaints within superannuation.'


So I was hopeful that some of the good elements of this bill might have been able to prevail in the amendments that were moved in the Senate—I believe by the opposition—around the issue of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Sadly, they didn't succeed. There were some other amendments that we proposed that I understand did succeed, and that's good. They made the bill slightly better. But without some further attention being paid to and the further case being made out as to why the SCT should be rolled in together with all of these other bodies then that aspect of the bill can't be supported, because it will make a change for which no case has been made and which could be fixed through other means—if the government wanted to stop attacking the Public Service and instead support it. And it has the potential for a number of deleterious consequences, including less oversight.


I imagine that this bill is going to sail through this place in the way that it sailed through the Senate, but I think opposition to that point, in particular, needs to be made, because it's an issue that was raised with the government when this bill was being progressed. They've steadfastly—I think perhaps for ideological reasons—refused to countenance any change to deal with that issue. As a result, opposition to that part of the bill has to be placed on record.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-02-13,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (17:22):  I am very pleased to be able to speak to the issues arising from the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017, currently before this chamber. I speak to the bill in the context of a 30-year career as a legal practitioner, primarily as a commercial practitioner, but also in the latter part of my career as a litigation practitioner, addressing a lot of work within the financial services industry but also dealing with people as customers who were attempting to deal with, I might say, the pointy end of the financial services industry.


It's important for this place to understand that there is significant anxiety generated, particularly when a financial organisation seeks to take possession of real estate that's been pledged to secure a customer's obligations under a loan. In other words, the foreclosure process brings the customer and the bank into conflict. And, up to now, that conflict has really only been softened or ameliorated by the intervention of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the alternative dispute resolution services that are made available by the financial institutions.


We also need to be mindful of the fact that there has been significant disquiet in the community about financial institutions and the banking industry, and that that disquiet has led to significant pressure being placed upon the government to inquire into the conduct of financial institutions. Hence, Labor announced at the last election that it would support the establishment of a royal commission to inquire into misconduct in the financial services sector.


What we have before us today is very much the government's initial response to that political pressure that it was necessary and appropriate to inquire into misconduct within the financial services industry. Unfortunately, as is the case with the government's response with respect to the rolling out of infrastructure, there is a very significant gap between announcement and deliverable, particularly when you look at what's being proposed in this legislation.


Let me be perfectly clear. Labor moved amendments to this legislation in the Senate so as to retain the existing tribunal which addressed statutory superannuation complaints. That was undertaken in order to protect the quality of superannuation dispute resolution and the integrity of the compulsory superannuation system. The central reason for that was that Labor felt that it was necessary to keep this new authority out of regulation of or inquiry into complaints dealing with superannuation. We moved those amendments in good faith because we believed that the changes that we proposed would have significantly improved this legislation. We are disappointed that the amendments were not accepted by the Senate. We are also concerned that the government has not been able to give satisfactory answers to questions about how the transition process that will apply to the new financial complaints body in this bill would work—because we're not talking about something which is trivial in execution. We're talking about the consolidation of a number of different organisations, including a statutory Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, into one body. We know, nevertheless, that this will pass the House, and Labor will support the passage of this bill through the House of Representatives.


It is appropriate that we consider some of the history leading to the introduction of this bill and why we're here today. As I said earlier, in April 2016 the opposition announced that a Labor government would establish a royal commission into misconduct within the financial services sector. It might be fairly put that the government's response was somewhat lacklustre. It concentrated on reforming the powers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and implementing the Ramsay review into the financial system external dispute resolution processes. An expert panel conducted a review to ensure that the Australian system of external dispute resolution was effectively meeting the needs of users of the financial system. As I indicated in my opening, I've seen this in operation. I've seen it in operation while acting for the banks, but I've also seen this at the pointy end when individual customers are endeavouring to deal with external dispute resolution. I've seen where litigation has been stayed as a consequence of a complaint made under the Financial Ombudsman Service and the other schemes.


Whilst there might be a case built for the establishment of a consolidated one-stop shop as described by the government, I do still have significant concerns as to the incorporation of the separate and distinct area of superannuation into that one-stop shop. The bill combines three existing external dispute resolution schemes—that is, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The new body, as everybody is aware, will be known as the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. What needs to be emphasised is that this bill actually abolishes an existing tribunal under what might be described as a 'rebranding' exercise. 


Of course, the context for this is vitally important to understand because this was in the context of Labor's calls for a royal commission. In late 2016 the Prime Minister promised a low-cost speedy tribunal to deal with financial sector complaints. He said this would constitute real action against the banks. Rather than real action, what we have with this bill is a merging of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman rebadged as the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The body has no new or additional powers other than accruing some additional jurisdiction—that is, monetary jurisdiction—in that the new authority can hear disputes with higher monetary thresholds than its predecessors. That is a good thing in the sense that it opens up the jurisdiction to more disputes.


If you were cynical, you would think that the implementation of this complaints authority was simply another delaying tactic from this government intended to stave off increasing public pressure for a banking royal commission. Before now, most disputes with financial service providers in Australia were resolved through internal dispute resolution processes between the customer and the relevant bank or other providers. I know the protocols that apply with particular complaints. I know the banks are required to investigate certain complaints, escalate particular complaints, but it doesn't remove, in my view, the general concerns that we have regarding financial misconduct, particularly in the area of sales of financial instruments and financial advice.


There have been far too many examples of poor conduct on the part of the banks and the financial service providers, including illegal activity, misconduct, inappropriate financial advice, insurance claims unfairly declined, fraudulent activity, the targeting of whistleblowers and irresponsible lending. Many of those complaints of particularly egregious behaviour have been seen by me in the course of my legal practice. And, of course, it is true that if you needed to articulate that argument in a court, it would be very difficult to do that with the resources that are available to a financial institution like a major bank and the resources available to an individual customer. That is, after all, why Labor remain committed to the establishment of a royal commission into the financial sector that would extend to banks, insurance providers and superannuation funds.


It must be emphasised that the word 'authority' in this particular authority's name is a misnomer. This is just another ombudsman scheme, according to the minister, as confirmed in the Senate, in this case in the form of a private company limited by a guarantee. There are already two of these organisations in existence for financial services disputes, which, as I've said earlier, are the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman. The bill abolishes the three existing complaints-handling bodies and, in many respects, represents a merger and rebranding of the work of three separate authorities. There is some overlap between the work of the two previous bodies. Indeed, I've seen some financial firms choose one or other of the ombudsman services and, in practical operation, they seem to me to be indistinguishable. At the moment, a customer who has a dispute with a bank, an insurer, a payday lender or a mortgage broker can go to an ombudsman scheme to have their dispute resolved. Once this bill passes, the customers will be able to go to an ombudsman scheme to have the dispute resolved.


We have some concerns as to the transitional arrangements that are proposed. The government has said that AFCA will start from 1 July 2018 for new complaints and so we're hoping that the government has given proper consideration to make sure the transition process works.


There has been a Senate inquiry, and it has raised concerns about this. A commentator, Mike Taylor, summarised in Super Review some of the concerns about this process in light of evidence given to the Senate:


There is much to suggest that the creation of AFCA represents a bureaucratic slow-motion train crash with the Treasury officials confirming that the financial services industry will have to deal with four different external dispute resolution schemes for at least a year after the necessary legislation is passed and that the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will still be clearing its workload as late as 2022.


Labor has questioned the government in the Senate about the transition plans and how they would make sure that the transition to the AFCA would work. The lack of detail in the answers has been very concerning. It seems that since the bill passed the Senate the government has announced additional funding in MYEFO, which of course is welcome, to help the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal work through its existing workload. It was very concerning that the government did not appear to properly plan for this when announcing AFCA in the budget.


As I said earlier, these sorts of external dispute resolution schemes are very important. They are important to give the voice to consumers, sometimes in situations which are really riven by conflict. The situations that I've seen are those where customers are the subject of foreclosure proceedings, and in those circumstances it's certainly appropriate for external dispute resolution to be promoted by any responsible regulator or government. However, as I've said in my remarks this afternoon, it's vitally important that the government understands that there is an existing effective complaint scheme with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The effectiveness of the transitional arrangements needs to be monitored and they need to be properly resourced. We'll have a situation where, if the government takes its eye off the ball, there will be significant distress occasioned to people that are already exposed to the stress of foreclosure or dispute with a financial institution.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (17:37):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Today the government is delivering on its commitment to overhaul the financial dispute resolution framework as announced in the 2017 budget in response to the Ramsay review. There is a clear need to improve the dispute resolution framework, which is a product of history rather than design. Currently, there are three external dispute resolution bodies: the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman.


The existence of multiple external dispute resolution schemes with overlapping jurisdictions means it is more difficult to achieve similar outcomes for consumers with similar complaints. It is also difficult for consumers to know which scheme to approach, leading to duplicative costs within the system. The monetary limits and compensation caps that apply under the existing schemes are manifestly too low and are not working to ensure access to justice for consumers and small businesses. FOS' and the CIO's current monetary limit of $500,000 and compensation caps of $309,000 bear little relationship to the value of most financial products and are no longer fit for purpose. Similarly, the monetary limit of $2 million for credit disputes and a compensation cap of $309,000 is precluding too many small businesses from accessing justice under the existing schemes.


Further, the dispute resolution arrangements for superannuation are in drastic need of improvement. The inflexible tribunal model has meant that the SCT has been unable to resolve disputes in a timely manner, and the body now has a significant backlog of legacy claims. At the time of the Ramsay review, the SCT was taking an average of 796 days to resolve a dispute that reached determination stage. This is clearly unacceptable.


In April 2016, the government commissioned an independent comprehensive review of the dispute resolution framework, led by an expert panel comprising Professor Ian Ramsay, Julie Abramson and Alan Kirkland. The review made 11 recommendations to strengthen and futureproof the dispute resolution framework, and the government accepted all of these recommendations.


The flagship recommendation was for the establishment of a new one-stop shop industry funded dispute resolution scheme to hear and determine all financial disputes, including superannuation disputes. The new scheme would replace the SCT, FOS and CIO. The reforms in this bill to establish the Australian Financial Complaints Authority will radically overhaul how financial disputes are dealt with in Australia and will ensure that significantly more consumers and small businesses have access to free, fast and binding dispute resolution. 


All financial firms, including superannuation funds, that deal with consumers will be required by law to be members of AFCA, and decisions of AFCA will be binding on financial firms. AFCA will be based on an industry ombudsman model, which will provide it with the flexibility to adapt to changes in the financial system and user expectations. By not restricting how AFCA deals with complaints, the framework enables AFCA to be flexible and innovative and to take advantage of new technologies and techniques in the resolution disputes. 


AFCA will be a not-for-profit company governed by a board comprising an independent chair and equal numbers of directors with industry and consumer backgrounds. The bill introduces a legislative framework which sets out the standards that AFCA must adhere to, ensuring that AFCA is accountable to its all users: consumers, small businesses and members of financial firms. Under the legislative framework, AFCA will be accessible to consumers and small businesses which would be able to have their disputes heard by AFCA for free, and will be funded by industry. AFCA will have a range of statutory powers to effectively manage superannuation complaints, such as the ability to join third parties to a dispute, to require parties to attend conciliation, and to require the production of information. 


As the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, I will authorise the new AFCA scheme and I will have the ability to set conditions on authorisation. Until I am satisfied the scheme will have robust systems and processes, I will not authorise AFCA. I will also appoint the independent chair and a minority of the initial AFCA board to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of skills and experience. 


The Australian Securities and Investment Commission will be responsible for overseeing AFCA to ensure that it meets the standards set out in the legislation. So that ASIC can fulfil this role, the legislation will provide ASIC with the ability to set regulatory requirements that AFCA must adhere to and will also provide ASIC with a general directions power to compel AFCA to comply with the standards set out in the legislation. In addition, ASIC will have a specific directions power that can be used to require AFCA to increase funding in the event that it is insufficiently financed. 


The bill was examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. In response to the committee's report, the government moved a number of amendments to provide additional certainty and clarity around aspects of AFCA's operations, to ensure it will operate as effectively as possible. Additionally, the government will commission an independent review of the new external dispute resolution arrangements 18 months after AFCA commences operations. This review will take into account feedback from consumers and small businesses regarding whether AFCA resolved their complaint in a way that was fair, efficient, timely and independent. The review will also specifically examine the appropriateness of the monetary limits applying to complaints relating to credit facilities provided to primary production businesses. The Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations was consulted in relation to the bill and to these amendments, and has approved them as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002.


While overhauling the dispute resolution framework, the government also looked to strengthen the internal dispute resolution processes within firms. The legislation also introduces a new IDR reporting regime. Under the regime, ASIC will be provided with the power to collect and publish IDR data at both the aggregate and firm level.


Being such a significant reform, the government understands the importance of having a smooth transition from the existing dispute resolution bodies to AFCA. That is why the government has created a transition team, led by Dr Malcolm Edey, a former assistant governor of the Reserve Bank, to drive the establishment of AFCA. The transition team has undertaken consultation with key stakeholders, and feedback from that consultation process will inform its advice to government on AFCA's terms of reference, governance and funding arrangements. It will also advise government on the transitional arrangements required to appropriately resolve legacy disputes of the three existing schemes. 


Once the legislation is passed by the parliament, I will be seeking an application for authorisation. Following an assessment of that application, I will be authorising AFCA and making my formal appointments to the board. It is my intention to do this as swiftly as possible, to ensure that the AFCA board has the maximum time available to put in place the required operational arrangements, including securing membership and funding, and to undertake consultation on its terms of reference and funding arrangements ahead of AFCA's commencement. In line with advice received by Dr Edey and the transition team and in order to facilitate an orderly transition to AFCA, it is my intention that AFCA will commence accepting disputes no later than 1 November 2018. 


The change to IDR and the establishment of AFCA will ensure that consumers have free, fast and binding resolutions of complaints regarding financial services, ensuring confidence in our financial system. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:46):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, for the privilege and opportunity to speak on this matter in the Chamber today. I don't intend to give a long speech but simply to acknowledge, as many other members have done, the progress that has been made and also the sadness that comes with an agenda unfulfilled and one that continues to need to be supported by all members in this place.


As the Closing the gap report outlines, there is still significant disadvantage experienced by people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage compared to much of the rest of the Australian population. The purpose of Closing the Gap is self-evident, but improving the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders so they can live to their full potential is always in our interests. We must remind everybody that this is in the national interest as well as, of course, in the interest of the people affected, because, when you look at everything that our great country has achieved and everything that is before it into the future, you realise the full potential of the individual, you respect their humanity and their dignity, and what they can contribute to enhancing a greater Australia. That is why this agenda is so critical to Australia today—to address the wrongs of the past but also to build the type of country that we want to be into the future. 


As the Closing the gap report outlines, three of the seven targets in the Closing the Gap strategy are on track to be met. But it is with sadness that we also acknowledge that four out of seven are not on track to be achieved at the current rate, and we must redouble our efforts and refocus our energy to make sure they are.


Let's go with the good news. The target to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018 is on track. As the report outlines, over the long term, between 1998 and 2016, the Indigenous child mortality rate declined by 35 per cent. There has been a narrowing of the gap by 32 per cent. Improvements in the key drivers of child and maternal health over the past few years suggest there are further gains to be made. We know the continuing problem of fetal alcohol syndrome in Indigenous communities and remote communities, and these are important issues which continue to need to be addressed. It isn't enough to focus on mortality; it has to be coupled with improved healthcare outcomes throughout all stages of life. 


The second target on track is to have 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. In 2016, around 14,700 Indigenous children, which is 91 per cent, were enrolled in early childhood programs. As we know, that target isn't just about making sure that children are engaged in the discipline of school; it is actually about the important role that education can play in building young minds and in expanding their opportunities beyond the immediacy of their lived experience. We must continue to make sure that we focus on that, because it comes at the heart of the potential for many young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to go on and live as fulfilled a life as they would seek for themselves, and to know the world beyond them and their immediate surrounds, so they can make their choice about their future. 


The target to halve the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020 is also on track. Nationally, the proportion of Indigenous 20- to 24-year-olds who have achieved year 12 or equivalent has increased from 47.4 per cent in 2006 to 65.3 per cent in 2016. While the attainment rates for non-Indigenous Australians also improved at the same time, the gap has narrowed by 12.6 per cent over the past decade, which is a very good achievement as well. It follows on strongly from the sentiments I made about the previous target and the potential and what it can do to improve human lives. 


Sadly, though, there is bad news—or news that leaves room for opportunity for us all to struggle together to do better. Unfortunately, the target to close the gap in school attendance by 2018 is not on track. In 2017 the overall attendance rate for Indigenous students nationally was 83.2 per cent, compared with 93 per cent for non-Indigenous students. So there is a need to continue to focus energy on that as well. The target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy by 2018 is also not on track. In 2017 the proportion of Indigenous students achieving national minimum standards in NAPLAN was on track in only one area—year 9 numeracy—of the eight areas, including reading and numeracy across different levels. However, the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students has narrowed since 2008, across all NAPLAN areas, particularly reading in years 3 and 5, and numeracy in years 5 and 9.


Similarly, the target to halve the gap in employment by 2018 is not on track, with Indigenous employment rates falling slightly over the past decade; however, progress is being masked by a change in remote employment programs during this period. The employment rate has improved by 4.2 per cent over the past 10 years. In 2016 the Indigenous employment rate was 46.6 per cent, compared with 71.8 per cent for non-Indigenous Australians. 


The final target not to have been met, the one that, I think, always brings the most sadness to every Australian, is the gap in life expectancy, that by 2031 we may see a significant reduction in the gap of life expectancy. Instead, between the periods 2005 and 2007 and between 2010 and 2012 there's been a small reduction in the gap of less than a year for males and 0.1 years for females, so almost no significant shift, tragically, for women. The report states:


Over the longer term, Indigenous mortality rates have declined by 14 per cent since 1998.


This report gives all of us pause for thought. I know that many people have remarked already about the disappointment of what has not been achieved in the past decade, but we also need to recognise what has been achieved as well. We have seen a shift and improvement and a proper focus on many of the issues to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, but, as part of the continuing pursuit of justice for our entire country, we need to continue to focus on and address many of these gaps.


It doesn't sit, of course, in isolation. The targets that are very important to provide the foundations for people to be able to go on and live healthy, happy and successful lives have to be matched with other policy priorities that advance the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to be full members and full participants in the Australian community. In my previous capacity as Human Rights Commissioner, one of the bits of work I was very proud to work on was realising the potential of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders over their native title lands to increase the potential for that land to be used to its full extent in the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders under the control of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to pursue the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as part of the fulfilment of the destiny of this great nation.


My hope is that out of this report people will focus on what we need to do next and will make sure that there is proper recognition of the challenges that continue to remain for our Indigenous Australians. It isn't just a responsibility of the state or federal governments. Every Australian needs to take an active interest, because these are our fellow country men and women—people who have experienced many difficult times in the past and the legacy and trauma that continues to be inflicted upon them culturally and socially. It's time that we all took a greater interest and had more sense of obligation about trying to improve the circumstances of every Australian, because that is the only way we will get to the point of developing and building a more inclusive, more harmonious and more respectful nation.


Of course, not having firsthand lived experience of the challenges in many of the areas that this report seeks to address, can sometimes make it challenging for a lot of people, including myself, to understand that lived experience and to participate successfully with full empathy. But I think that most people would see that the situation being faced today by so many other Australians is beyond anything that this nation should tolerate, particularly at this point in our history, with our position of wealth and opportunity. Now is the time for us to take even greater responsibility, to make sure that it does not continue into the future.

Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (17:55):  I rise to join with my parliamentary colleagues in making further comments in relation to the Closing the gap report for 2018. This week in the parliament has been monumental so far. On Monday we saw the Closing the gap report delivered and this morning in the Great Hall we had the breakfast and the coming together of many people from the stolen generations for the 10th anniversary of Kevin Rudd's apology to the stolen generations. 


The apology was a truly remarkable and historic moment for our nation. It acknowledged the painful truth and injustice of the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and the destruction of our families, communities and cultures. It also recognised that while these injustices happened in the past the impact is still with us. Intergenerational trauma is becoming more and more understood, and it is very much a part of this discussion.


At the breakfast this morning there were stories, as there are with every gathering of the stolen generations, on painful display, stories about the indignity and the humiliation that members of the stolen generations were made to feel but also stories about their incredible strength and resilience and the amazing generosity of that generation. I think that is a lesson that we can all well take on board. People were taught to be ashamed of their Aboriginality, and they were often lied to about their family and family circumstances. We heard that today. We heard about how separation affected people—not only individuals and families but whole communities—and how, as I said, the vicious cycle of intergenerational pain and humiliation has impacted young people today.


We can see this in the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in incarceration or out-of-home care. In fact, my side of the parliament argues that there should be two new additional targets: one in relation to incarceration and the other in relation to out-of-home care. The gap that alarmed me most was the gap that still exists in literacy and numeracy, and the fact that it's not going to be met. I think that that and the school attendance gaps are the real story out of this particular report. And when you start to unpack how the numbers were arrived at and the way in which the calculations were made as to what was on track and what wasn't, you start to get even more questions about the accuracy of the report.


The apology 10 years ago was a great national effort to close the gap but it is also everyone's business. It was also part of the journey towards healing and part of the journey towards reconciliation. I have always maintained that reconciliation is not a destination; in fact, it's a journey. This is about the acknowledgement of this journey and how long it will continue for, and what the tangible, practical and meaningful steps towards closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians actually require.


The report the Prime Minister delivered on Monday clearly said that there is so much more to do. I find it rather galling at times when we say we've made such big efforts; we've made such big gains. Well, let's remind ourselves just how low the bar is. Of course, the progress for year 12 completion, early childhood participation and mortality rate improvements are welcomed, but they are still way below those of the broader Australian community. It is also disappointing to still see that the progress in life expectancy, employment, school attendance, and literacy and numeracy outcomes are not going to be met. It is almost incredulous when I speak to people from other countries and say that my life expectancy as a first-nation woman is much less than it is for my non-Aboriginal sisters. It is difficult to understand in a First World nation like ours, a wealthy nation like ours, how this situation can still exist.


We also know that we need to listen and we need leadership. The Labor Party have said to the government, in a very, very real way, that we will work with you but we will not wait with you. We have made the point, although it has been denied, that there has been half a billion dollars cut out of the Indigenous Affairs program, and there are consequences of that that many of us see in our daily lives as members of parliament.


I do want to emphasise in the little bit of time I have left the proposed cuts to the remote housing program. If these funds are cut, if this effort is not renewed with the states and territories, then we may as well not even print a Closing the Gap report next year, because it will make a mockery of the whole idea of closing the gap. One of the important things is this notion of self-determination, which was clearly one of the recommendations in the Bringing them home report. Self-determination is at the heart of closing the gap; self-determination is at the heart of much of the rhetoric of both sides of parliament in this place. Self-determination can be realised by way of an Indigenous voice to this parliament. We want to work with the government on this, and I was very disappointed to hear the Prime Minister's statements in the House today in light of this.


Last night, I attended the screening of a film about the alarming rates of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care. It is just incredulous, and I know each side of politics agrees wholeheartedly with this. It is difficult to accept. We understand that the states are the jurisdictions that basically look after child protection, but the number of children in out-of-home care has doubled in the last 10 years. One of the women last night said there is not a new Stolen Generation but that the Stolen Generation has never finished.


I have spoken about many things today and I'm not going to be able to speak about everything that I wanted to, but I did want to say that I am very proud of Labor's story when it comes to Indigenous policy. We will never forget that image of Gough Whitlam pouring sand into the hands of Vincent Lingiari at the handover of Uluru, of the Whitlam government's abolishment of discriminatory practices perpetrated against Aboriginal Australians. We also know that we look at the Keating government's passage of native title and also the Mabo decision. Keating's Redfern statement is something that will sear into the heart of this country forever. I know some of you were here at the time, but I was in the gallery, actually, when Kevin Rudd made the apology to the Stolen Generations. We, today, make an ongoing commitment to the Stolen Generations by way of a $10 million fund and also reparations when it comes to the ACT, the Northern Territory and other federal jurisdictions. We will also have a first-nations children's summit within the first 100 days of forming government if Labor is elected.


I will finish my comments today to this chamber by saying that it is critical that there be a mechanism put in place. We're not talking about a third chamber; we are talking about an advisory committee to this parliament, made up of first nations peoples from across the country, to make sure that the decisions that we make within this parliament will truly contribute to the realisation of closing the gap and the aspirations in the Bringing them home report. As I said, we are prepared to work with the government in a very real way, and Labor, as a first step to ultimately recognising the first nations voice, will do some preliminary work around what that voice might look like.


I finish by saying we are confident that, in the fullness of time, the Australian public will see that this is an important mechanism within the parliament and something that we can all embrace. This, too, will not be easy, but Labor has listened and Labor now stands ready to lead. We ask the Prime Minister and the government to do the same thing.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (18:05):  I rise to respond to the 10th Closing the gap report, tabled yesterday by the Prime Minister. I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are meeting on Ngunawal country, and I acknowledge and pay respects to their elders past, present and future. Reflecting on the past 10 years of the Closing the Gap framework, there's been a lot of progress, but I think we can all recognise that there's a lot more work to be done. As I look around this parliament, I see a resolve and a commitment to close the gap on all sides of the chamber. I see it when I'm part of events such as as the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of the Close the Gap Campaign and I see it as a member of the backbench policy committee on Indigenous affairs in the government. I see it in the hard work and the commitment of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Indigenous Health, including through this government's commitment to continuing this work with the involvement of First Australians as well as all states and territories. And I see it in the heartbeat of our Indigenous people on the Central Coast through their passion and their care for one another and our community.


In particular, on a day like today, I'd like to pay tribute to the Barang organisation, which includes the NAISDA Dance College, led by the talented and indefatigable Kim Walker; Yerin Aboriginal Health Services, led by Central Coast local Belinda Field; and, of course, the Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Council, led by our respected community leader Sean Gordon. To each of you, thank you for the extraordinary work that you do in our community.


I'd also like to place on the parliamentary record the resolve and commitment demonstrated on a daily basis by the selfless advocates at The Glen. The Glen is the largest Aboriginal drug and alcohol residential rehabilitation centre in New South Wales. It's based at Chittaway Point and it's assisting our Indigenous community right across the Central Coast and, indeed, beyond. Under the leadership of CEO Joseph Coyte, The Glen is a great example of how the Closing the Gap process is more than just a piece of paper, it's more than just a symbol and it's more than just a process. For people like Joe, there are people coming to The Glen who need help, rehabilitation and support that I'd venture to say extend well beyond what those of us in this place would have to deal with in our everyday lives. At The Glen, opportunity is more than a mission statement. It's a life-changing shift that can save lives and open doors to a brighter future. But to get there we first need the framework that's enabled by initiatives like the Indigenous Procurement Policy, or IPP. Joe has told me that The Glen has responded to the IPP by starting numerous social enterprises, including setting up a separate company to make profits that help fund the running of the rehabilitation program. Joe said:


This is a space that we have strategically identified as a possible avenue for us to help create employment opportunities for Indigenous people.


Joe also told me that the IPP will allow The Glen to become self-reliant, moving away from a reliance on government funding and, thus, allowing them to drive the future direction of the organisation. It's a practical example of what is being achieved. The IPP target was achieved three years ahead of schedule and has now eclipsed $1 billion in contracts to Indigenous business since it was launched 2½ years ago, up from just $6.2 million in 2012-13. The success of the IPP shows what we can achieve together when we set targets for which we have responsibility. 


Importantly, this is not the only item that's now on track. As we heard in the House, for the first time since 2011, three of the Closing the Gap targets are on track. I acknowledge that this may not, for many, be seen as a significant step forward, but it is progress nonetheless. This year, the Closing the gap report found that the target to halve child mortality is back on track, with significant improvements in health care. Between 1998 and 2016 we've seen a decline of 35 per cent in the Indigenous child mortality rate and a closing of the gap by 32 per cent. The report also indicates outcomes in education are improving, with the early childhood education and year 12 attainment targets on track. Today there around 14,700 or 91 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children enrolled in early childhood education in the crucial year before starting school. This improvement means the target to have 95 per cent of Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025 is set to be realised. There are also more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students staying on until year 12, with over 65 per cent of Indigenous young adults aged 20 to 24 achieving year 12 or equivalent—well up from around 47 per cent in 2006. 


I know, in concluding, that there is a thirst and desire for this common ground to be more than just a statement, particularly when it comes to our young people. This is true on the Central Coast, for example, with the advocacy of locals like Lisa Wriley in Kariong, who for many years has been involved in activities that have drawn together people from across our region to tackle issues around closing the gap and much more. Lisa told me about the initiatives of people like Dr Beryl Collier, Reverend Penny Jones, Phil Bligh and many others who hosted film screenings and barbecues for Indigenous young people. In fact, at the wonderful Kariong Eco Garden, there is a truly inspiring welcome mural and display, including a panel painted by Aunty Joyce Dukes. I'd love to know that this local committee and its initiatives have a future, and I commit to finding out. 


I also know that it's another example of my community's desire to do their bit in helping to close the gap. It echoes the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister, who spoke about how the solution to closing the gap rests within the imagination, the ingenuity, the passion and the drive of Indigenous people themselves, with government the enabler of their success. We must also seek common ground, the Prime Minister said, guided by the values that make us all Australians—values of mutual respect, equality and equal treatment under the law. I commend the latest Closing the gap report and I thank the House for the opportunity to speak to it.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (18:13):  Last year, I put together a video for Harmony Day and I asked locals from various multicultural backgrounds to deliver a message of peace and unity in their native language. We had representatives from the Chinese, the Greek, the Bangladeshi, the Indian and the Muslim communities, who delivered a message in their native language for Harmony Day. But I wanted the video to begin with the oldest language of our area—the language of the local Aboriginal population at La Perouse, the Bidjigal people. When I made inquiries with the local community about finding someone to begin the video in that local language, I was stunned to learn that there was no-one left in that community that could speak the language. In fact, when many of those now elders were children at the La Perouse primary school they were actively discouraged from speaking their native language by the teachers at the school. They relayed stories to me of talking in their native language at school earning them a rap over the knuckles from the teacher. As a result, that language is now lost to Australia. In the wake of that, I thought to myself, 'What a waste.' Here we have the oldest continuing culture in the world, and a language that passes on and tells the stories of that culture—that history, that connection those people have with the lands and the waters around Kamay, or Botany Bay as it's more commonly known—is lost to generations. That is a symbol of the disrespect that white Australians have shown to Aboriginal Australians over the last 200 years. 


There has been a lot of talk in this place and in Australian commentary over the course of the last couple of years about our approach to Aboriginal reconciliation and what we need to do as a nation to close the gap, to reconcile with Aboriginal people and, ultimately, to provide them with a better quality of life and higher living standards. A common theme that we've heard is, 'Do things with us, not to us.' That can be summarised in one word, in my view: respect. The Aboriginal people are only asking for respect, the respect that hasn't been there for the last 200 years. That is evident in the fact that they were not represented under our Constitution as citizens of our country until 1967. We thought we knew what was best for them when we took their babies away from them, despite the fact that parents were capable of raising their own children in a loving family environment as part of a community. We believed that they shouldn't have access to proper education and to places of public importance in our nation—most notably, pubs—where, in the past, we asked people to be segregated. Unfortunately, young Aboriginal men are well over-represented in our jails throughout the country, through their rates of incarceration. 


I don't believe that present-day Australia, particularly with this Turnbull government, is adhering to that motto of, 'Do things with us, not to us.' That is evident in the Turnbull government's approach to the Uluru Statement from the Heart from the Aboriginal people. That was their voice. It was their recommendation to the leaders of this nation of that view, 'Do things with us, not to us.' It was their recommendation to ensure that that can occur in Australian politics. It was dismissed out of hand by this Prime Minister. In fact, it was done in a disrespectful way in that it was leaked from cabinet before it was even announced publicly that the government were rejecting those recommendations. It was a blanket dismissal of the wishes and the will of the Aboriginal people. It was disrespect continuing, unfortunately. 


Now we've released the ninth Closing the gap report and it makes damning reading, once again. We are only making progress in actually closing the gap with three of the seven goals. And we're not going to close that gap—we are not going to make progress in these identifiable areas that the parliament has assigned as areas of proof of closing the gap—while we continue to show disrespect to Aboriginal people. At the heart of the problem is the fact that we continue to disrespect Aboriginal people in the approach that this government takes to Aboriginal affairs. 


That's why, when it comes to life expectancy, there's a huge gap between Aboriginal Australia and white Australia, and why we're not on track to meet the goal of closing the gap on life expectancy by 2031. When it comes to school attendance, there's still a gap and we're not on track. When it comes to halving the gap in teaching reading and numeracy for Indigenous students, we are not on track. And we are not on track when it comes to halving the gap in employment by 2018. Thankfully, we are on track in three of the areas: child mortality, early education and halving the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020.


Bill Shorten has announced, quite properly, that if elected at the next election Labor will add a justice target, where we will work to reduce the shocking rates of incarceration of young Indigenous men. Each year in NAIDOC Week, I visit Long Bay jail and attend a function with Aboriginal inmates. Unfortunately, there are too many of them in Long Bay jail. You see in their eyes the lost hope, the feeling of despair from being away from country and from community and the plight of Aboriginal people over the course of the last 200 years.


For me, it all begins with respect. That gap is not going to halve and we're not going to make progress on Aboriginal affairs until we begin to show respect to Aboriginal people. We haven't done that in the past, and it's time that we started to do that. Thankfully, Bill Shorten has said that, if we are elected, we will introduce this justice target. More importantly, we will offer compensation for the victims of the stolen generations. We'll set up a $10 million healing fund to work with those people, and we'll launch an inquiry into the shocking rates of out-of-home care for Aboriginal children. Importantly, we'll also show respect to the Aboriginal people by working with them on the recommendations of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, rather than dismissing them out of hand, because we believe that respect means actually doing things with Aboriginal people, not doing things to them. That means action, not just hollow words. Labor, led by Bill Shorten, is committed to doing that.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:21):  Today marks the 10th anniversary since the former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologised unreservedly to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. This was a watershed moment for our country. It was a step in the right direction towards achieving reconciliation and an opportunity to begin genuine truth-telling and healing that would benefit our whole nation. This was the day when we said 'sorry' for the mistreatment, injustices and hurts that the stolen generations experienced. They carry the scars to this very day. It was a day when all Australians embraced one another and a day when we committed to working together to genuinely create equal opportunities. To use Senator McCarthy's words, the day of the apology was a day where our nation's heart beat as one.


Ten years ago today, we aspired to do better for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters in communities across the nation. We set out what were perceived to be ambitious targets to close the gap, to improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These targets included closing the gap in life expectancy within a generation; halving the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade; having 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025; closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous school attendance in five years, by 2018; halving the gap for Indigenous children in reading, writing and numeracy achievements within a decade, by 2018; halving the gap for Indigenous Australians aged 20 to 24 in year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates by 2020; and halving the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade, by 2018.


The 2018 Closing the gap report finds that, for the first time since 2011, three of the seven closing the gap targets are on track to be met. Sadly, however, this demonstrates that we are behind on four of the seven targets that we aim to achieve. This then begs the question: are we succeeding in achieving our objectives to close the gap? Are our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander brothers and sisters getting better lives in rural and remote communities?


Today especially I reflect on whether the lives of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been made better since the apology. We must read the Closing the gap report in its entirety and acknowledge the fact that we have not succeeded and that we can, and must, do better. If the lives of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had improved, then we would not see the life expectancy for Aboriginal people at approximately 10 years less than that of non-Indigenous people. The suicide rate for Aboriginal people is six times higher than that of the non-Aboriginal population. Countrywide, rates of imprisonment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are worse per capita than they were for coloured people in South Africa during apartheid! Clearly, governments aren't doing anywhere near enough.


I am proud to be the member for Herbert, which includes the largest discrete Aboriginal community in Australia, on Palm Island. Against all odds, the Palm Island people have survived and launched their centenary anniversary this year. The men came to this island in chains. The dormitories have left a lasting impact on the people of Palm Island. Palm Island has a rich history, but it is a history rich in pain. But they are a resilient community, with some unique challenges that the Turnbull government is completely ignoring.


Palm Island's unemployment rate is almost 27 per cent. The Palm Island Shire Council, led by Mayor Alf Lacey, are doing remarkable work to address these issues, and I will continue to work with them to secure recognition, equality and a better life. The biggest threat that the Palm Island community has now is the Turnbull government's cuts to the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. Instead of working with the community to address unemployment, the Turnbull government is cutting the national partnership on remote Indigenous housing, a 10-year, $5.4 billion program which expires on 30 June this year. For the Palm Island community this means job losses. Let me reiterate: it has a 27 per cent unemployment rate. Because of the Turnbull government's cuts, seven apprentices on Palm Island will lose their jobs. Last week during question time I asked the Prime Minister why he was cutting the program. He couldn't answer the question and instead referred the question to the Minister for Indigenous Health, the member for Hasluck, the Hon. Ken Wyatt.


Labor is prepared to work with the government, but rest assured that we will not wait for them when it comes to bettering the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, announced a few policies that Labor will take to the next election. A Labor government will provide $10 million to programs that assist with the healing of stolen generation members and their descendants nationwide. These are to be administered by the Healing Foundation. It will implement a program that will look at intergenerational healing, family reunion and return to country. Labor will work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to set justice targets, reduce incarceration rates and improve community safety. In its first 100 days, a new Labor government will convene a national summit for first nation children.


Further to this, Labor has already started working on legislating an Indigenous voice to parliament, without government support, because bipartisan issues of constitutional change do not mean doing nothing. Labor will work to enshrine a voice in the Constitution; a declaration to be passed by all parliaments—Commonwealth and state—acknowledging the unique place of the first nations people in our history, and of their culture and their connection. There will also be a makarrata commission to oversee a process of agreement-making and truth-telling.


Serious action needs to be taken to address closing the gap, and it needs to start today. It's a national shame that must be addressed urgently, and it certainly doesn't start with the Turnbull government cutting seven apprenticeship jobs on Palm Island. My message to the Turnbull government is simple: falling short of our targets does not mean that we should begin lowering those targets. We need to identify why the targets are not being met.


We do have to have the courage to acknowledge that a one-size-fits-all solution is totally unacceptable. We have to accept that we do not have the answers ourselves. We need the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have self-determination, and when we see that happen we will see the gap closed. If governments are failing to meet the current targets then we must ask why, and continue to ask why. This is about doing what is right. Labor will work with the government on Indigenous affairs, but we certainly will not wait for them.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (18:29):  There are two matters I would like to talk to the House about tonight on behalf of local constituents. The first one is in relation to Australian disability enterprises.


In January I had the opportunity to host the shadow minister for disability and carers, Senator Carol Brown, in Wollongong. I was specifically keen to have her there and she was very happy to come along at the invitation of some of our local enterprises, particularly Greenacres disability enterprises and the Flagstaff group, who were keen for her to meet with workplace representatives, with carers and, very importantly, with the employees of those organisations. They have been concerned for many months about the forthcoming modern award review and the issues arising from the transition to the NDIS. They have been running as part of a campaign called My Job Counts. I have to say I have been very proud and pleased to be able to support them. 


I'm regularly at these organisations for particular graduations. Or, indeed, one of the greatest pleasures is to go along to their functions for retirements of people who have worked in some cases for 50 years with these organisations. Just the simple pride and joy that these people take in their work should be a stark reminder to all of us that, indeed, their job counts. So I have been very happy. We have had rallies in Wollongong with several hundred turning up to support their campaign. Of course, they are worried about their job security and they want to work. 


I just wanted to share—at one of the rallies—one of the Greenacres workers, Sharon Kennedy, was so worried about her job that she wrote a poem. I said if I could get the chance to share it I would, so I will share it with the nation through this chamber. This is Sharon's poem:


My job at Greenacres Disability Services means so much to me. 


Making lots of friends and happy memories. 


As I'm sure you will agree, it's not about the money that I receive, it's about the life skills that I can learn and achieve.


Coming to work and feeling proud each day I know that I have done an important job today.


That's why the Fair Work Commission of Australia should listen to us all as a nation.


We stand strong because we are not failures. 


Please listen to us, the federal government of today 


Because we are telling you that my job counts in so many different ways.


This is a shout-out to one and all.


Please accept our pay system for us all so the future will be bright for one and all. 


We will keep fighting till the end. So we can stand tall. 


So we can just all live happily after all.


Thank you, Sharon, for the opportunity to share that poem with the nation. 


Labor supports Australian disability enterprises, and we recognise their vital role as employers of people with disabilities. We also acknowledge and value the training, the life skills and the social opportunities that people with disabilities access through their employment with ADEs. In addition, we strongly support ADEs providing pathways for so many people to open employment. We believe they should receive real and practical support from government to maintain their viability in this complex and changing employment and workplace environment, and in the context of the NDIS. 


We will continue to support them. I will continue to support them, along with my colleague the member for Whitlam—our local ADEs, and more importantly than anything, those workers at those organisations and their families. You can tell from that poem how much meaning and purpose and pride those workers have in the work they do.


The other issue I would like to raise to the House tonight on behalf of my community is to do with home care. Many, I'm sure, colleagues across all sides of the chamber would be having significant numbers of representations into their office about issues with significant delays around the allocation of home care packages. Last November, figures in the Home Care Packages Program data report revealed approximately 950 older Australians in the Illawarra were waiting for home care. That included 321 patients who are requiring high care or level 4 packages. Across the country, of course, more than 100,000 people are waiting for this care. They have—particularly those with high needs, including many with dementia—the need for those packages to be delivered as quickly as can be the case. 


In December last year, I visited Prabhunath Mukherjee, a man who had been approved for a high level—a level 4—package. But he couldn't get anyone to tell him how long he would have to wait for this additional assistance, which was critical to him being able to remain in his home. Prab has suffered two strokes and has numerous other medical problems. His mobility is very limited. He has no family living close by so he's been forced to pay for transport to shopping and doctors' appointments from his disability pension and, not surprisingly, he's finding this to be a struggle. I wrote to the Minister for Aged Care two months ago and I'm still awaiting a response regarding Prab's upgrade for his package.


I have to report to the House today my office contacted the parliamentary liaison hotline to see if there was any progress and I was very disappointed that they refused to discuss the matter with my staff, saying that they had to get a verbal approval from Prab over the phone to be able to discuss a constituent's case with their local member. This is a very frustrating thing. I'm sure members across the House have come across this on occasion. I wrote to the minister on behalf of two other constituents who contacted my office in relation to home care package problems. I was disappointed to receive a response from the minister which provided me with a list of phone numbers that the constituents could ring. Well, as many would appreciate—I'm sure the minister himself has had this in his electorate office—people come to you when they have tried all those standard departmental phone lines. They are coming to you because they are frustrated and have a problem they can't progress. I think that was fair enough to include the numbers because often ministers do that, but usually they outline where the policy issue is at and how that particular constituent's case could either be resolved or suggest some direct line to get some assistance, not just the general phone lines, and also to then give me the MP liaison line and suggest that my office ring that line. I mean, we have been doing this; this is why we wrote to the minister.


I can only assume that colleagues across the chamber are all having the same problem, because this extensive delay in these home care packages being allocated, I know, is a problem in other electorates, and I would be surprised if it wasn't right across the nation. I understand the minister may be under pressure on this matter, but I would suggest that when MPs, from whatever part of the parliament they come, are writing to the minister, it's an indication we are looking for a higher level of responsiveness than just to tell us what the phone numbers are. It was quite disappointing.


People are suffering while they wait. Families are suffering and are stressed, worried about their loved ones who need these home care packages. I have talked to families where the family carers had to give up work because of their caring responsibility to their relative, which they may not have had to do if the higher care package was delivered and enabled that support to happen in the home.


I'm aware that the minister has indicated that he's become aware of the pressing problem. In February last year, he said he hadn't been aware of how many people were waiting for care. We've had 12 months now for the government to respond effectively to this crisis. I would suggest that it needs to really give its full attention to this matter because there are people across all our communities who deserve to know when they will get access to these services. And there are service providers who quite often are carrying the additional cost, which they cannot afford to do forever and a day. Because these people have been allocated a lower care package, the service provider is delivering that, but they need and have been assessed for a higher care one, and service providers don't want to leave them out on a limb by providing higher services so often they are carrying the cost of that themselves to keep it up. This is happening in all our communities. It is urgent, and the government must give urgent attention to this matter.

Ms Sharkie
  asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 04 December 2017:


(1) Should any former detainee on Manus Island require medical services that are not available in Papua New Guinea (PNG), is the Australian Government willing to transfer them to Australia for medical treatment if their life is at risk.


(2) Does the Australian Government have any legal or other obligation to assist men who were transferred to PNG if they have critical health conditions that cannot adequately be treated in PNG.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2018-02-13,"



Mr Dutton:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is:


(1) The management of refugees and failed asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a matter for the Government of PNG. Australia continues to support the Government of PNG to meet the health needs of persons transferred under regional processing arrangements.


(2) The Australian Government's position is that it does not owe any general legal responsibility or obligations under domestic common law in relation to the welfare of all individuals transferred to PNG under the regional processing arrangements.
