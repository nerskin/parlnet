Today I have presented 10 petitions that the Petitions Committee has found to comply with the standing orders. I want to repeat a remark that I make from time to time. The committee may or may not agree with the contents of a petition but its role is not to decide whether a petition is acceptable for tabling on the basis of the members
'
 personal beliefs; rather, the Petitions Committee
'
s role is to consider whether a petition complies with the rules of the House in terms of its form, content and language. If it complies, the committee will authorise its presentation. This approach reflects the historic nature of petitions, the committee
'
s role as a conduit between the people and the House, and the House
'
s respect for freedom of speech.





I would also like to point out that, in addition to House standing orders which govern petitioning, the Petitions Committee—and indeed all proceedings of parliament—are also guided by broader foundations of parliamentary practice. These foundations lay down some fundamental expectations of all who participate in the work of the parliament. This is something that petitioners need to consider when preparing petitions.




The right of petitioning the Crown and parliament is not a modern activity; it has existed in the Westminster system since the 13th


century. Petitions are essentially requests by citizens or residents for action by the House of Representatives. Petitions set out the


issue that gives rise to the petition and then make a request of the House.

For example, petitions may ask the House to: introduce legislation or appeal or change existing legislation; take action for a certain purpose for the benefit of particular persons; or redress a personal grievance, such as correction of an administrative error.


Back in the days of King Edward I, the petitioning process was primarily used to redress personal grievances. Over the centuries, the basis of petitioning has evolved and developed such that petitioning now focuses less on individual grievances and more on issues affecting the collective. One of the reasons for this change is that there are now many other avenues for individuals to pursue the resolution of a personal grievance—for example, through approaching their local member of parliament.


Agencies today that may also be relevant for Commonwealth matters include the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The petitioning process is therefore not usually the first port of call for petitioners to seek a resolution or a solution to personal grievances, given that other often more specialised avenues exist to raise these matters. Engaging in the petitioning process, like any engagement an individual or a group of individuals undertakes with the parliament, should be undertaken in a considered and respectful manner.


Finally, petitions are a powerful tool for the general public to air their views or issues with the possibility of influencing policy or causing action to be taken. Even if no action results immediately, one of the most valuable results of the process is that members and the government of the day are informed in a formal and public manner of the views of certain citizens on a given matter. Parallel to this ability is the expectation that petitioners will treat the process with care and respect, ensuring that petitions comply with the letter and spirit of the requirements of the House.

Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (10:09):  Good morning. Today I am happily representing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, which is currently conducting an inquiry into the use of fly-in fly-out—FIFO—and drive-in drive-out—DIDO—workforce practices in regional Australia. It has come at the behest of a number of communities throughout Australia and from members in this parliament. The member for Capricornia, for example, who is in the House at the moment, has been interested in this workforce practice for some time and was instrumental in having it referred to the regional Australia committee.


We are inviting—indeed welcoming—responses from throughout Australia about the various aspects of fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive out workforce practices. In the main, people normally associate it with mining, but it affects many other rural and regional areas of Australia as well. The committee has adopted the following terms of reference, which I would like to share with the House, in order to give a framework for people to respond:


The Standing Committee on Regional Australia will inquire into and report on the use of 'fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and 'drive-in, drive-out' (DIDO) workforce practices in regional Australia, with specific reference to:


the extent and projected growth in FIFO/DIDO work practices, including in which regions and key industries this practice is utilised;


costs and benefits for companies, and individuals, choosing a FIFO/DIDO workforce as an alternative to a resident workforce;


the effect of a non-resident FIFO/DIDO workforce on established communities, including community wellbeing, services and infrastructure;


the impact on communities sending large numbers of FIFO/DIDO workers to mine sites;


long term strategies for economic diversification in towns with large FIFO/DIDO workforces;


key skill sets targeted for mobile workforce employment, and opportunities for ongoing training and development;


provision of services, infrastructure and housing availability for FIFO/DIDO workforce employees;


strategies to optimise FIFO/DIDO experience for employees and their families, communities and industry;


potential opportunities for non-mining communities with narrow economic bases to diversify their economic base by providing a FIFO/DIDO workforce;


current initiatives and responses of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments; and


any other related matter.


The concept of fly-in fly-out, drive-in drive-out—indeed, float-in float-out, literally, by those who arrive at work sites by boat—is a phenomenon which began in the late 1940s in the offshore oil sector in the Gulf of Mexico. As the offshore oil industry—the gas industry et cetera—developed, so FIFO expanded with it. Indeed, figures I have recently seen estimate that, for instance, in the late 1980s, with the developments in the North Sea, something like 60,000 workers were working in the North Sea as FIFOs. That of course has now developed throughout the world, particularly in the resources sector and more so in Australia. The idea of establishing a mine and then a town around the mine—and I use as an example the west coast of Tasmania, which is part of my electorate—and the town becoming a mining town meant there was a robust community of long-term economic development and a very close association between that community, the workforce and the mine. In many cases that is now breaking down.


So, we wish to discover, if this is a fact of life, what strategies exist, what strategies can exist to make that a better association and behaviour, and what are some of the detriments and strategies we can use to combat these. These are just some of the issues we will be looking at in the inquiry.

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (10:15):  I rise today to make a statement about the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia into the use of fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out workforce practices in regional Australia. The committee adopted this inquiry on 23 August 2011 after the matter was referred to the committee by the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. There has been significant public and media interest in the inquiry. Many regional members in this chamber will be familiar with work practices commonly known as FIFO, where workers are flown to a work site—most commonly a mine—for a shift lasting up to several weeks and are then flown home for a break of some days or weeks. The practice has been in place in Western Australia for many years, it is rapidly expanding in Queensland, and it is being introduced as DIDO—drive-in drive-out—across New South Wales.


While this is not a new practice, it has expanded in recent years with such rapidity that it is time that the community, industry and government gained a better understanding of the impact of the practice. It is for this reason that the Standing Committee on Regional Australia sought to have this inquiry. The committee is hoping to gain a thorough understanding of the extent of FIFO/DIDO work practices and the impacts they have on both the towns that host these mobile workforces and the 'home base' towns that see many of their residents coming and going for long work shifts. We want to understand what the costs and benefits are for individuals, families and companies that choose a FIFO/DIDO work practice over developing a resident workforce as well as what impacts the practice has on communities.


The committee has a blank sheet of paper. It has no predetermined idea of what the outcomes of this inquiry will be; however, we do know that we are looking for ideas to strengthen regional Australia and for long-term strategies for economic diversification in those towns that host large FIFO/DIDO workforces. The committee also wants to find out more about skilling: what skills are targeted for FIFO/DIDO employment and how individuals access further training and development. Is there a skills drain being felt in some areas as people take up FIFO/DIDO employment, and what can be done about this? The deputy chair of the committee, the member for Braddon, reports that Tasmanian workers are being tempted by FIFO jobs in South Australia, leaving his electorate looking for skilled tradespeople. Clearly, this is an issue that needs a 'big picture' examination.


The terms of reference for this committee are wide ranging. Already we have heard concerns about air safety, health funding, taxation, family and relationship breakdown and the loneliness of the FIFO bachelor. The cost of housing, antisocial behaviour and how to optimise the FIFO/DIDO experience for families are also on the committee's agenda. In my electorate of Durack, 51 per cent of the mining workforce are already working on a fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out basis, and this is of great concern. It turns out to be almost a love-hate relationship. The practice suits some incredibly well and it does not suit others. The drain of skills out of rural communities to FIFO and DIDO workforces is causing major problems in some areas and yet, for those who are developing resources in Western Australia, often the only way is to deploy a FIFO workforce.


I would encourage members of this place to get involved in this inquiry. The committee can, of course, have supplementary members appointed; however, I would ask those members whose electorates are impacted in any way by FIFO or DIDO work practices to let their constituents know about this inquiry and encourage people to make a submission. The committee secretariat has some resources that members can distribute, post on their websites or distribute with newsletters. Submissions close on 7 October and after that the committee will be deciding on a public hearing schedule. We have already been invited to travel widely through Western Australia and Queensland and the committee will also focus its attention on other areas of the country where the practice is having an impact.


I sincerely hope that we hear from as many people as possible who are impacted by FIFO/DIDO work practices in order to inform the committee and also future governments about how this practice can be used to strengthen regional Australia.




The SPEAKER:
  The time for statements has expired. I wish the committee well in its endeavours.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:20):  In presenting this bill to the House I commend and congratulate the senator from South Australia who is often referred to as the farmers friend and the voice of the village. In this case, the village is paying twice what they should be paying for their fruit and vegetables in Australia and the farmer is getting half. In other words, the people in the middle are arguably getting 400 per cent more than they should be getting. Let me be very specific. These figures were compiled by Senator Xenophon and his staff. They were not very hard to compile because the markets give you a market quotation for the value of an orange every day in the markets. So anyone can find out what the farmer is getting paid. And of course you can find out what the consumers pay by simply walking into the supermarket. So it is not very profoundly hard to get these figures. It was profoundly hard for the ACCC—those people who assure us of no competition. Let me quote figures—and these are just ordinary, everyday fruit and vegetable items: apples—the supermarket pays the farmer $2 and charges the consumer $5.98; oranges—18c a kilogram to the farmer, $1.98 to the consumer; potatoes—35c to the farmer, $2.98 to the consumer; broccoli—$1 to the farmer, $1.92 to the consumer; and cabbages—55c to the farmer, $2.38 to the consumer. That is 199 per cent on the first item; 1,000 per cent on the second item; 751 per cent on the third item; 92 per cent on the fourth item; and 333 per cent on the fifth item.


How long is this parliament going to continue to accept the oligopolistic pricing regime in the supermarkets of Australia? I have said continuously in this place, wasting my breath, because no-one here seems to care: within three years, Australia will be a net importer of food. Every four days—I have not seen the latest figures, but two or three years ago these figures were from a comprehensive report—a farmer commits suicide in Australia.


Seven years ago we became a net importer of pork, thanks to the decisions taken by the LNP in this House. Four years ago we became a net importer of fruit and vegetables—the items I am talking about here. We cannot feed ourselves in fruit and vegetables. Two years ago we became a net importer of seafood. The projections for this year are that 72 per cent of our seafood will be bought into this country, so we cannot feed ourselves in seafood. So it is not remarkable for those who have been following this story to know that within three years we will be a net importer of food.


The Fin Review already claims that we are now a net importer of food. I can use different statistics which might push it out to nine years, but there is not the slightest doubt in any set of statistics you want to use that this country will not be able to feed itself within three years. Who is to blame? We have come into this place and said again and again that we are asked to meet conditions of health and hygiene in our production, which are not remotely being met.


Let me take the case of prawns. Our prawns have to be grown in absolutely pristine water. It has to be regulated on its way in so that it is pure and free of bacteria, but then it has to be regulated on its way out, pure and free of bacteria. All water contains some bacteria. The impositions upon this industry have simply closed it down. I am the minister given the credit for starting this industry off, for which I deserve no credit. It was the six entrepreneurs: Wahedy, Coco, Sciacca and the very famous Irwin Vidor. They are the people that deserve the credit and, probably most of all, Jimmy Ryall and Dr Joe Baker from the Institute of Marine Science that commenced this industry.


We started off with great hopes. We felt that we would overtake Thailand in prawn production by the year 2000—this was about the mid- to late eighties. We reckoned that over the next 15 years we would catch up to Thailand. Thailand was on $2,000 million a year of production, and we forged ahead. We went up to, I think, $65 or $85 million—some figure like that—within a few short years. Starting from scratch, we went zoom and were on course to catch them. After the environmentalists had finished with us, we are now down to $24 million, and I think that very shortly we will have no production at all. That would be my prediction.


Let's have a look at the prawns that are coming in. Those are the impositions that are placed upon the Australian industry. You have to have twice the number of ponds plus there is twice the amount of water because you have got to put clean water back into the ocean. I said, 'What contaminant is there?' They said, 'The prawns do their business in the water.' 'Do they have toilets out in the ocean for the prawns?' They said, 'Concentration' and I said, 'Good. I was waiting, Mr Environmentalist, for you to say that because we have fought again and again to have the sewerage outfall into the oceans stopped.' They said, 'Oh no. It dissipates.' You could write a treatise on this, couldn't you? Human waste dissipates but prawn waste concentrates. 


It just demonstrates that these people are completely out of control. They are dangerous and they are evil. The environmentalist movement in Australia has moved from being a great asset to this country to a cancer. Here is their handiwork. Let's go back to Thailand. Australia has gone down from $65 million to $25 million; Thailand has gone up to over $8,000 million. All of our agricultural exports in Australia—200 items—only amount to $28,000 million. Thailand has got $8,000 million in a single industry. Their sugar industry is now rivalling ours—it might even be bigger than ours now. These are two industries. They are forging ahead of us. We will run out of coal, we will run out of iron ore and, when we do, this country will be bankrupt. I want to put on the record that I said this in the year of our Lord 2011. I pleaded with this parliament to wake up to itself. You have destroyed agriculture in this country and are destroying it whilst I speak.


Everyone knows the Americans are whingeing, crying, screaming and howling over Walmart. Walmart and its nearest competitor, the big two in America, have 23 per cent of the market. Depending on what set of figures you want to use in Australia, between 88 per cent and 92 per cent of the Australian market is held by the big two. There is no country on earth that would allow two players to dominate the market. They would not allow it on any items at all, but of all items they would not allow it on those—the anti-trust legislation would have smashed them long ago in the United States. Similarly, that would happen in Britain, France, Germany, Japan or any country you want a name. But not here in Australia, where we suffer the power of the great corporations.



I did the figures some years ago on milk, when this parliament decided that it would facilitate the deregulation of the dairy industry. Here is the letter from Dairy Farmers to farmers in my electorate. On the day of deregulation the price for milk was 59c; the day after it was 42c. (Time expired)

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (12:06):  I continue where I started—that is, by saying that there are three simple things about all these bills together: 1) climate change is real; 2) there are things that we can do about it; 3) the things that we can do about it are affordable. Given that we all agree in this place and, of course, much more widely—not only in Australia but also right across the globe—about climate change, it is just a matter of what type of system we should put in place to best achieve our goals. By far the best system is a broad-based carbon price. It is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to reduce pollution. A carbon price puts a price tag on pollution. Through the carbon price, for the first time, an incentive will be provided for people not to pollute—in particular for our 500 biggest polluters, who will be required to pay for each tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere in.


This scheme will start on 1 July 2012. Let us be clear that these bills will go through this place—there is agreement here for these bills to pass. There will be a fixed-price period for  2 years, and then we will move to a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme whereby the market will set the price. A market based mechanism is by far the best way to deal with climate change. During the fixed-price period the starting price will be $23 per tonne, and during the next two years it will rise by 2.5 per cent. So, assuming inflation of 2.5 per cent, the carbon price will be $25.40 per tonne by 2014-15.


The flexible market, set-price period will commence on 1 July in three years time—that is, in 2015. During the flexible price period, the government will set the cap by issuing a fixed number of carbon units each year, and some of those units will be auctioned by government. This is the best way to move forward with the system. It means that the market decides and that business gets to adapt, to adjust, to evolve and to grow.


But we are not going to allow this to happen without accepting the fact that there is some cost and that that cost has to be abated in some way. That is why we have put together an assistance package for industry as well as for households. Over the first three years of the carbon price, the government will devote $9.2 billion to assistance for affected jobs in emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. That is to provide with them a transition period to adjust, to adopt, to match what is happening in the rest of the world and an opportunity to continue to grow.


There will be $800 million in the Clean Technology Investment Program, which will provide grants to manufacturers to support investment in energy efficient equipment technologies, processes and products. Over six years there will be $150 million for the food processing industry and $50 million for the metal forging and foundry industries. The government will also provide $200 million in grants to support business research and development in areas of renewable energy, low pollution technology and energy efficiency.


The government is also ensuring that households, tradespeople, farmers and small businesses do not face a carbon price on fuel—because the will not be a carbon price on fuel. The government will reduce the fuels tax credits received by many large polluters so that they too pay an effective carbon price. Many businesses will be exempted from the reduction in fuel credits and shielded from the carbon price on fuel. Heavy vehicles such as semitrailers will also be exempt until 2014-15. While the carbon price will be paid directly by the 500 biggest polluters in this country, the government has designed a generous package to help small business grow and invest in energy efficient assets. Farming and other land-based activities will not be covered by the mechanism. However, the Carbon Farming Initiative will give farmers an opportunity to generate income by taking action to reduce their pollution.


I said earlier that these measures can be effective—and they are. The world is already acting on climate change; in every country there is something being done. It might be called something different and look slightly different in other countries, but every country is taking action on climate change. It is clearly in Australia's national interest to continue to work to achieve the international goal of limiting warming to below two degrees. In order to do this, it is imperative that we play a responsible role in the international arena by taking strong action at home. We have to act locally and think globally.


The government's plan will cut carbon pollution and drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. It will generate new jobs in these fields. The carbon price will see Australia's annual emissions reduced by at least 159 million tonnes by 2020 from where they would have been had we done nothing. By 2050, we will have taken over 17 billion tonnes of carbon pollution out of the atmosphere by saving nine out of every 10 tonnes of pollution we would have emitted had this plan not been in place.


Australia has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, including hydro, wind, bioenergy, geothermal, wave and tide—not to mention one of our most abundant resources: solar energy. By 2050, according to Treasury modelling, with a carbon price $100 billion will have been invested in renewable energy, and 40 per cent of Australia's electricity generation will come from renewables. Australia's renewable energy sector will have grown 17 times because of the changes that we are putting in place.


But, as I said earlier, all this does come at a cost and we acknowledge that cost—and it must be compensated for. So nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts or payment increases, and two in three households will get tax cuts or increased payments that will cover the expected average price impact on them. We have tried in this area to be a little bit more generous: we will give a little bit extra, because we would rather err on the side of assistance than on the side of not getting it quite right.


Over four million Australian households will get assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the expected average price impact on them. Over one million additional Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. That is right—one million additional Australian taxpayers will never have to lodge a tax return again because of these changes. On average, the scheme will cost households $9.90 per week, but they will get $10.10 per week in assistance. The assistance is permanent and will increase over time in step with any expected increases caused by these changes. The government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and will increase it further if necessary.


We will go further than that—there will also be tax cuts. Everyone earning up to $80,000 will receive a tax cut. For most people, it will be at least $300. The tax-free threshold will triple in size: no one will pay tax on the first $20,000 they earn. This means that half a million people will go from having to pay tax to paying no tax at all. This is a major tax reform that will encourage people who only need part-time work only to join the workforce. It is an incentive to create jobs and an incentive for people to work.


Of course, pensioners and self-funded retirees will not be left out. Pensioners and self-funded retirees holding a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will get a cash increase of $338 each year if they are single and $510 combined each year if they are couples. That means that, on average, 1.8 million pensioner households will come out at least $210 ahead of the expected carbon price impact on them. Around 150,000 self-funded retirees and part rate pensioners will also receive tax cuts in the order of over $300. We have not forgotten families either. They are an important part of what we are doing. Increases in family tax benefit A for each child will be up $110 per year. Single-income families with children will get up to $69 extra in each family tax benefit B plus up to $300 in additional supplement. Allowance recipients such as people on Newstart and youth allowance will also get up to $218 a year for singles and up to $390 a year for couples. These are good things for the nation across the board. 


Specifically, people will want to know what will happen in my electorate of Oxley. Out of the 62,000 taxpayers in Oxley, around 54,000 will receive a tax cut and 45,000 of these will receive a tax cut of at least $300. More than 38,000 people in Oxley will receive household assistance through income support payments or family assistance payments. A typical family in Oxley will have expected cost increases of around $497 per year, but they will receive around $754 in tax cuts and family assistance. They will be about $257 better off per year. There are more than 3,000 single parents in Oxley who will also get an extra $289 per year and 17,100 pensioners in Oxley will receive an extra $338 per year for singles and $510 per couple—that is, extra after all their expenses. Pensioners will be better off, students will be better off and families will be better off but, most importantly, our economy and our economy will be better off. It is always difficult to make the big decisions in government and to take the next steps forward. It is always difficult to be able to see beyond the horizon, to look where the future takes us—not after the next election or the election after that but the next generation in this country. That is what this is about. This is about making fundamental change. This is about structural reform. This is about changing the way our economy operates. This is about ensuring that industries of the future have a future. This is about making sure that we do not get caught in old thinking, old traps or old ways, which mean that you cannot transition economies and then the jobs you are trying protect today disappear tomorrow because no government took the courageous steps it needed to ensure you could have a clean energy future. This is about making sure we are part of the global economy, the global village. It is a small planet. We are connected. We are a trading nation. Not only do we need to do these things but also we need to shield the impacts of some of these things locally, at a domestic level, and that is exactly what we are doing. We are talking about one of the biggest changes in this economy that has been seen, I would say, for well over 100 years. It is well thought out and well considered and it will be well delivered.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (12:18):  I rise to speak on the bills which will introduce the carbon tax. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue facing this parliament. It comes to one of the most fundamental issues in our democracy, and that is whether the community should be told what a government is going to do before an election. Six days before the last election the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It was explicit and in none of the documentation—in none of the policies, in none of the material that was put out by any Labor candidate—did the government say they would be introducing a carbon tax.


Australian political history shows that Australians will exact a very heavy price on governments which mislead. Paul Keating, campaigning against a GST, in effect introduced a GST by stealth in the 1993 budget. He massively increased the then wholesale sales tax on a range of goods. Here we have a carbon tax bill that emerged after the 2010 election, when the Prime Minister clearly said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This shows no respect for democracy in this country. You cannot make specific promises as part of your election platform and then ignore them once elected. 


The proposal of the government will cost Australians $9 billion per year. To put this in perspective, the carbon trading scheme in Europe, a much larger economy than Australia's, raises $500 million a year. The impact of the carbon tax will be felt very heavily by people with fixed incomes, such as self-funded retirees and pensioners, and by families. The government has spent a lot of time in this debate focusing on the compensation that people are to receive. If you do not tax someone, you do not need to compensate them. But, if the carbon tax does not hurt, it will not work. What will happen is that the carbon tax will result in a 10 per rise in electricity prices and a nine per cent rise in gas bills in the first year alone. There will be a $4.3 billion hit on the budget bottom line. At the moment we already see enormous pressure on the cost of living for families and all this will do is add to it. At a time when we are seeing retail and small business sectors struggling as never before, this is the worst time to be introducing a carbon tax, which will only increase all of those pressures. Since 2007, when Labor came to office, on average electricity prices have risen 51 per cent, gas prices have risen 30 per cent and water and sewerage prices have risen 46 per cent. Despite what the government says, any tax cuts provided will not keep pace with the increasing cost of the carbon tax, and most Australians know this. While the carbon tax will start at $23 per tonne, it will be a floating price after three years, with the government expecting the price to be $37 a tonne in 2020 and over $350 a tonne in 2050.


What will this do to the cost of living? Australian manufacturing is already under pressure, cost of living for everyday Australians is forever increasing, and a carbon tax will only make this worse. Australian businesses will be put at a major disadvantage. On the government's own figures, more than three million Australian households are going to be worse off under the carbon tax.


But worst of all is that under Labor's carbon tax scheme emissions will actually increase. Australian emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes in 2012 to 621 million tonnes in 2020. The whole point of the government's proposal is to reduce emissions in Australia. At the most basic argument, the carbon tax fails in this purpose. The only way the government is going to reach its emissions reduction targets is to buy offshore carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. Under Labor's proposal, the government itself estimates that Australia will be spending $3½ billion purchasing carbon credits from foreign carbon traders in 2020. By 2050 we as a nation will be spending $57 billion a year, or 1½ per cent of our GDP, on purchasing offshore carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. This means that we will be spending $3½ billion in 2020 to buy up foreign carbon credits from potentially dodgy foreign carbon traders to plant trees in other countries, not in Australia. To put this into perspective, Australian government health funding in the latest financial year, as a percentage of GDP, was only 4.1 per cent.


All the Labor Party's carbon tax will do is shift emissions overseas, at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer. The only way that a carbon tax can reduce emissions is if people use less coal produced electricity and less oil powered transport. The problem with this is that the use of electricity is inelastic—not entirely, but quite significantly. Electricity consumption does not drop with increased costs. We are dependent on electricity. Labor's carbon tax will not work. It will hurt families and cost jobs.


The government's own paperwork reveals that the scheme will raise $27 billion in revenue in the first three years of the tax. This is not a tax about the environment; this is a wealth redistribution tax. The 750,000 small businesses in Australia will receive no direct compensation for the massive hikes in electricity prices. What it means is that jobs will be lost and product prices will rise.


As I go around my electorate holding my listening posts and doorknocking, the issue of the carbon tax is raised continually. Residents in my electorate have constantly contacted me about the impact that this carbon tax is going to have on their family, their household or their business. People tell me how this tax is going to mean that their small business is going to struggle even more than before when their expenses go up under the carbon tax. Labor members have spent a lot of time talking about compensation which families will receive, but they have not spent any time talking about the impact on small business, who will receive no compensation. Self-funded retirees and other people on fixed incomes tell me how this tax is going to mean they will struggle to make ends meet because grocery bills and electricity bills are going to go up. These bills are going to go up just as our emissions are going to go up under this carbon tax. There is negligible environmental benefit achieved under this new tax.


I recently met with one of the local councils in my electorate. They informed me that their annual power bill is $1.3 million, 70 per cent of which is for street lighting. Based on the government's own figures, the carbon tax will have an instant impact of $130,000 a year on this local council's budget—money that would otherwise have been spent on providing services to the community. The only way they can recover that $130,000 per year is to increase rates on their ratepayers. This is an example of the fact that power is inelastic. The council cannot just turn off its street lights.


I would also like to focus a bit on the impact that the carbon tax will have on health care in this country. We have already heard from the Victorian government that this will have an impact of millions of dollars on the power bills of hospitals in Victoria. The carbon tax will dramatically increase the cost of running Australia's public and private hospitals. Hospitals are huge consumers of electricity, and there is no way that this consumption can be reduced. Hospitals, through services like radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging, use enormous amounts of electricity, and there is no compensation for them in this carbon tax proposal. What a diagnostic imaging practice will see is a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill. What a public hospital will see is, again, a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill. A private hospital will see the same. For a clinic delivering radiotherapy and radiation oncology, it will be a 10 per cent increase in that power bill. Electricity prices will increase by 10 per cent in the first year alone, and the government refuses to tell us how much they are expected to rise in future years. When you consider primary care, a general practice, again, will see a 10 per cent increase in their power bill. In allied health, high users of electricity such as physiotherapy practices and dentists will also see a 10 per cent increase in their power bill, with no offset there at all. This is money that could have been spent on providing more front-line health services, and instead it will now be spent on electricity bills due to the government's carbon tax.


I would like now to talk about the coalition's alternative, which is our direct action plan. Despite what those opposite say, the coalition does believe that climate change is real and that mankind is making a contribution. Therefore we do support practical action on climate change. It is right that we protect our environment, and I do not think any Australian would argue with that. During the 2010 election, I made a promise that under a coalition government there would be several Green Corps projects to improve environmental conservation within my electorate. Our direct action policy is aimed at reducing emissions by five per cent by 2020, just like the government's plan. However, we believe that the action we take must be reasonable. We believe that the action we take must not be at the expense of Australian jobs or at the expense of our standards of living. The action we take should not, and must not, drive up the cost of living for people who are already struggling. There is a fundamental difference between the ideology of those opposite and that of the coalition. While those opposite prefer to penalise, punish, and tax, the coalition believes in providing incentive and optimism. This can be seen in many of the government's policies, but it is most clearly seen in their attitude towards climate change.


The coalition's direct action climate policy provides incentives for Australian businesses to reduce their carbon emissions voluntarily. Under a coalition direct action plan, there will be no cost to families, no new taxes and no rise in electricity prices. Our direct action plan is costed, capped and fully funded. By using incentives, our plan allows the market to determine the cheapest way to reduce emissions.


This is a bad tax, based on a lie. We must never forget that the Prime Minister lied to our country before the election—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Boothby knows that he cannot use that word.




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I withdraw.


The Prime Minister, six days before the election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That can only be described as misleading. Residents in the minister's own electorate are well aware of this. I have a very clear vision of a nice photo opportunity held at the Findon bowling club, where the Prime Minister was explaining her carbon tax. She was buttonholed by a constituent who realised instantly what the impact of the carbon tax was going to be and said, very correctly, that India and the major emitters were not taking any action. This is a major breach of faith by the Prime Minister. The coalition will be voting against the carbon tax legislation and, if elected, we will rescind the carbon tax legislation.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (12:32):  On behalf of the residents of Bowman, I rise to make the two most obvious points that have been clear since the debate on emissions trading and the carbon tax began, and that is that we need to get the right mechanism and that we need to do it at the right time. I do not need to go back into the history of the misleading of voters before the last election, but I do need to acknowledge, more importantly, that it has been a long and tortuous debate on both sides of this chamber that has led us to this position.


The point I want to make clear today is that we need to get the right system for Australia because we are lawmakers here in Australia. It does not matter what the rest of the world is doing if we are doing the right thing for this nation. That is my job. It is the job of international agencies and international agreements to work out what is the right thing for the globe. I know if we do not have a global solution on carbon we do not have a solution at all. My speech today is going to focus on where we are globally in that agreement. I will also look at the temporal elements and the history of carbon negotiation—where we have got to and where the pitfalls have been. I do not doubt that a year or two from now we will revisit this debate and ask, 'What did we pass, and why?'


The best comparison for carbon negotiation globally is most likely the trade negotiations that began after World War II and continue today. We still do not have a worldwide trade agreement, 60 years on. More recently we have seen the poverty negotiations around the millennium goals—again, we are halfway to 2020 and we still do not have global agreement on action regarding poverty.


The point about carbon is that a quick and dirty agreement does not get you any closer to a global agreement. We know from international negotiation that it is a slow, trust-building, layer-upon-layer, meeting-upon-meeting approach that takes you towards the solution, or the destination, which is a global agreement. The early GATT negotiations began in 1947, in Annecy, Geneva, Dillon, Torquay and Kennedy. They then rolled right through Tokyo and then, finally, to the Uruguay Round, which began in 2001. Even 10 years after that tortuous process, no-one came out and said, 'I'm dropping all my trade barriers and that's the right thing for the planet.'


That is not the right thing to do in carbon. So the first point I want to address is this notion that we have to set an example for the rest of the world. We do not set examples for the rest of the world when it comes to jobs and livelihoods; we negotiate with the rest of the world. And what has happened since Copenhagen and since Bali? If we are this committed as a nation, why isn't this Prime Minister calling the President of the United States saying, 'Let's do something together'; getting in contact with Russia, Japan, Singapore and South Africa; bringing together the trade economies for meetings; and saying, 'Let's have a carbon arrangement'? It does not matter to this Prime Minister. This is purely a journey of political expediency for a Prime Minister desperate for something that she can look tough on.


Of course, in Australia we know that the impact will be significant. If we as a country wish to lead on climate we must be doing so at every opportunity, not just finding a way to punish our own people. That might be in some masochistic sense impressive to those that are looking for action on climate, but it does nothing to take us closer to global agreement. The fundamental point that has never been made by this government is whether us signing up to something makes other nations more likely or less likely to sign up. If you set up asymmetry in trade and in business where there is an advantage for other countries not to sign up, it is called the first-mover disincentive. It leads to perverse outcomes where you perpetuate the situation. Why would another economy come together and say, 'Australia's harming its trade exposed exports with this carbon tax; let's quickly do the same and remove the advantage we have'? It is pathetic and it is ridiculous. How that occurs is a point that has never been made on this side of the House.


The government would lead us to believe from their Treasury modelling that every other nation in the world will fall into a carbon tax when the ink is barely dry on the agreement—that they are only months or years away from a carbon tax. That is complete folly. No-one on the floor of congress in the US wants a carbon tax. Prime Minister, visit Japan. Go and visit Russia. Talk to Brazil. Show me the mining economies that say that a carbon tax is the right way to go. You will not find an economy that says that. With the greatest of respect to our colleagues in the EU and to New Zealand, our brothers across the Tasman Sea, they are not a mining, trade exposed economy. It is quite easy when you have consumed your natural resources to raise your hand for a carbon tax. It is not that hard to do—particularly when it is at about a dollar per person per year. It is not a hard thing to do. It is a far different thing when you are a commodity-producing economy, where carbon is attributed to the economy where it is mined, not where it is consumed. 


I do not forget the words of those who were at the Copenhagen meeting just two years ago. They said that three things brought down Copenhagen. It is good to remember what they were. They said that the first thing was that the nations of this planet did not arrive at Copenhagen universally agreed on the problem. There was not universal agreement. The preparatory work had not been done. They had a ground rush and got there with all different proposals. No less than our own then Prime Minister came with his own shiny apple of an ETS. But nobody was interested. No-one was tempted by Kevin Rudd's proposal at the time because that is not where the world was heading.


The second thing was that the leaders turned up at Copenhagen too early in the negotiation process. So the minute the leaders jetted in everything was paralysed. All the cameras turned to the leaders and we got no agreement. The third thing that was pointed out by those who were at Copenhagen was the obvious point that this is no longer a debate about who has the shiniest apple and the fanciest carbon tax; it is now about what is right for me. It is now, if I am a commodity-producing trade-exposed economy, about how I do it with other like economies. I want to know what they are doing before I do something. 


There is a weird notion that if we cut our hand in some sort of pact and hold it out, even though no-one grabs it, that will fix the climate. That is patently ridiculous. Every international agreement is a painstaking, slow process of trust-building. Where is Australia doing that at the moment? We are not. We have retreated to the simple task of having a carbon tax debate here in Australia and we have let the rest of the world back away from it.


My fundamental point today is the temporal notion of whether a carbon tax is the right thing right now. I know that we are incredibly animated by this carbon tax debate but it does deserve pause for thought as to why we are the only nation on the planet having a carbon tax debate in 2011. Is it because we have a finely balanced parliament? Is it because someone tapped the Prime Minister on the shoulder and said, 'Unless you pass a carbon tax we will not support you in government'? No, nobody said that. The reality is that, in wanting to do the right thing, we as a nation have simply chosen a foolish course. We have chosen (a) to go it alone and (b) to have a large and churning carbon tax through which the potential for profit seeking, rent seeking, administrative overload and corruption is simply too great for this chamber to pass it.


This carbon tax is clumsily designed. It is overly bulky. It is unwieldy. It offers none of the protections for the industries that we need to be looking after. I do not care that those industries are not voters for the Australian Labor Party, because at some point you have to separate yourself from your own political myopia and say, 'They may not vote for us but possibly it is the right thing to do for the economy and for jobs.'


I do not see why one job should be lost in the pursuit of a carbon agreement. I want to see the evidence that these clean green jobs are going to occur. Let us look for a comparator nation. There is none better than Spain. They embarked on the green economy just five years ago. They made enormous investments in solar energy. And no-one has pointed out to me yet exactly how paying twice as much for a solar panel as you will five years from now helps the climate. No-one has told me how paying twice as much now for a solar panel as Spain did will not bring down the economy just as it did in Spain—because the green bubble simply vanished at the time of the GFC. That enormous investment in solar energy has collapsed.


As Bjorn Lomborg says in his book Cool It, there is plenty of agreement that there is a problem. There are plenty of solutions. The question is: are we prepared to pay, now, for those solutions? Lomborg himself talks about climate being a $5 trillion economic problem between now and the turn of the century. Do we want to pay $15 trillion now to fix it or do we want to pay $3 trillion later? I cannot tell you when that 'later' will be but I know that the solutions get cheaper every day. I do not want to be in the one nation—the one economy—that has a carbon tax in place in 2011 because that will damage our economy. No-one overseas will thank us. The EU will not—it has a very light, almost imperceptible carbon tax. New Zealand will not, because in the main we do not compete with them as a commodity exporter. Certainly the other major economies of the world will not thank us. I do not want to always mention China but their growth in emissions over a year will be three times the size of Australia's entire economy. 


I have used this analogy in the past, for people who do not have the time to read all of these carbon publications. Nobody loved peeing in the pool, did they? But we are all in the pool together here. It is an atmosphere just like a pool and, I tell you what, we are all peeing in that pool. We all agree it is a problem. We differ a little bit on just how bad for your health it is but if there is an elephant and a bullock peeing in the pool I see no point punishing the mouse. 


I am sure we are all contributing to this problem but let us get an agreement in which we are all talking. We do not have that; we are not even close to that. Is this Prime Minister stepping out at saying, 'Let's bring together the tier-2 economies—the great exporters on this planet—for this discussion about climate'? No, there is none of that. She is too busy doing other things, like finding out ways to raise billions of dollars a year in carbon tax and then apportion them—distribute them—as only the friendly hand of government can do! Come on! We can continue under this Labor administration to find excuses to tax Australians. We have had 17 of these excuses so far without a tax cut. In the end we have to trust in their benevolence to distribute the funds appropriately. 


How much can Australians take in this 'servility' to assume that all knowledge rests in Canberra? 'I don't care how much they collect,' we are meant to say, 'as long as I get a little more back than I am going to pay.' This servility—this sense that only a government knows how to distribute these carbon collections—is a complete fallacy. 


We may not always have someone with the priorities of the current Prime Minister. I do not see why another $71 billion has to be collected out of the pockets of people like those in the gallery over the next six years, while at the same time the EU has only collected a fraction with their carbon tax. If you look at the eastern US renewable energy arrangements, where they have only collected $825 million from 50 million people, you see that it is about $5 per person per year. These systems overseas are token systems compared to what we are potentially doing to our economy. The points that I have made here have been simple. We are moving too early and we are moving alone. We are nothing like the EU because we are a commodity-producing economy. Our competitors are not Switzerland and Hungary. Our competitors are those that mine the iron ore and coal, those that bring the natural gas and other energy requirements to South-East Asia. They are the ones we need to be looking at—and do they move closer to a carbon tax? No matter how many times you try to airbrush away the reality, they are phasing it back, they are delaying, they are issuing free permits; they are doing anything they can to not harm their own economies.


That is exactly what this lot over here are not seeing. We have the temporal element and then we have the structural components of the carbon tax, which time will not allow me to go through. But let me say this: huge economic impact with very little environmental benefit. Australia's system alone would give a hundredths of a degree of Celsius reduction. We are talking about massive investment, in the billions now, that I cannot spend on hospitals and health care in order to—what—delay global warming by nine hours by the year 2100?


There is no solution without a global solution. I would love to see an administration focused purely on that very hard and adaptive work to bring other commodity exporters with us. I do not have a problem with being a leader in the field, but there is no point leading if no-one goes with you. Reach out the hand. Let us see if there is an agreement on this carbon tax structure. I severely doubt that there is. I ask if there is one economy heading in our direction in 2011. The frank reality is that there is not. I ask if there is one contemplating an economy-wide approach that hits not just 500 or 1,000 but 60,000 businesses having to pay or be compensated, and not the added prices that will be imposed upon their businesses as the result of the removal of fuel credits. In my electorate there are the waterborne taxis alone, the barges that serve our islands. It is okay to exempt one industry but not another, so they are paying more for their water taxis and vehicles are exempted. There is too much picking of winners. There are too many favourites. We have gone down this path alone with no support internationally and this is a bill that has to be opposed. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (12:47):  I must say that the contribution by the member for Bowman really says a lot about the level of debate that has been engaged in by the opposition. There are no details, there is just a whole lot of political rhetoric. He even said in his contribution that he would not go into detail. What he said was misleading and did not paint a true picture of what is happening not only in Australia but also around the world. In comparing it with Spain and the collapse of the Spanish economy he might as well have compared it with Greece or any other nation that is having problems. It has absolutely nothing to do with investing in clean energy.


The clean energy bills are revolutionary legislation, legislation that will work with other measures and measures adopted by other countries to ensure the future of not only Australia but also our planet. I listened to the contribution made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I learnt more about the opposition's policies from the Prime Minister than from the Leader of the Opposition, who used his 30 minutes to hurl insults at the Prime Minister, create fear and make unsubstantiated one-liners that he thought would make a good grab on the news—just as the member for Bowman did.


The legislation before us today is a market based reform which places a price on carbon pollution on around 500 big polluting companies. This carbon price mechanism is designed to reduce carbon pollution by at least 160 million tonnes a year in 2020, deliver tax cuts and increase pensioner and family payments to Australians. It is about putting a price on pollution whilst ensuring that polluters pay, not Australian workers, families and pensioners. The aim of the legislation is to change behaviour by making polluting costly and rewarding clean initiatives and non-polluting behaviours.


This legislation is a blueprint for a clean energy future, a future with investment in clean energy and clean energy jobs. This legislation is about embracing the future and moving to implement the recommendation of the myriad reports and inquiries that have spanned years. It is about action not inaction, the future not the past. Never has there been legislation that has been more vilified and never has the behaviour of an opposition leader been more irresponsible. For this opposition leader it is about living in the Lodge—not about the future of Australians and the best action to reduce climate pollution and address the pressing issues of climate change.


Not only do I question the motivation of the Leader of the Opposition but also I believe that he and his opposition have failed to substantiate their claim that putting a price on carbon would only lead to job losses, increased prices and failure to reduce carbon emissions. Not true. I also believe the opposition have failed to establish that their direct action plan is an effective measure to address climate change. It will require an increase in taxation of five per cent if they are to reach their target in 2020. 


I believe that climate change is caused by CO2 emissions and that humans contribute to those emissions. I accept the science. I have visited the Solomon Islands and seen the impact that climate change has had on those islands, just as you have, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have spoken to people who have been forced to flee the islands on which they live because the increased temperatures have led to sea level rises, which have devoured their homes. I saw photos of orchards that separated the National Referral Hospital in Honiara from the sea, and I saw how today the ocean was just metres from the hospital. Recent news reports have shown that the polar icecaps are at their lowest level in recorded history, and the melting of that ice is leading to sea level rises. It is serious. It is not something that we can ignore. 


In Australia, we have seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events. This year, we had the floods and cyclones in Queensland that caused havoc. In 2007, the electorate I represent was subjected to an extreme weather event when it and all areas in the Hunter and the Central Coast were lashed by storms, high winds and flooding, causing enormous devastation. There is no shortage of information that shows that climate change is a reality, and that temperatures are rising. There is no shortage of information that shows that CO2 is contributing to these increases, that humans are contributing to the increase in CO2 emissions and that, consequently, climate change is increasing. The government accepts that climate change is a reality and must be addressed. The opposition plays politics, promoting misinformation, as we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Bowman, and failing to provide a viable, affordable alternative to pricing carbon. 


In Australia we hear the mantra that, until China acts, Australia should not act. If that is the case, the time to act is now. I recently visited China with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, to see what, if any, action was taking place in China to address climate change. The overwhelming message that the committee received whilst in China was that the Chinese government and the Chinese people accept the reality of climate change. There is no debate there as to whether or not climate change is a reality. Rather, the debate is about how to cut CO2 pollution, and the Chinese government has committed to doing that. China knows its future depends on action to reduce its emissions; that is why China is making a massive investment in research into renewable energies. We visited an ecologically sustainable city, Tianjin. We also learnt about carbon price mechanisms that have been used in some regions of China; in fact, I believe that six such pricing mechanisms have been implemented within China. So China is acting and is putting a price on carbon.


The member for Wentworth knows that climate change and global warming are a reality and he knows that pricing carbon is the only effective way to change behaviour and reduce pollution—and he is not the only one on the opposition side who knows that carbon must be priced if we are to address the issue of CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not hold the same belief. He has stated in the past that climate change is 'crap', and his close alliance with anti-climate-change groups proves that he is a climate change denier. His direct action plan is really about inaction rather than direct action. I believe if the opposition gained government at the next election and Tony Abbott became Prime Minister, Australia would see inaction, not direct action, as his plan is costly and would place a tax on all Australians. On Thursday, 15 September, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the coalition's direct action plan would cost 'at least double' the cost of the government's clean energy package. Michael Hitchens, Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, said:


We understand … that the cost of abatement might double if we try to achieve the full abatement domestically—


as set out in the coalition's direct action plan.


The article goes on to discuss in some detail how the plan that has been put up by the coalition will cost each and every Australian.


The government's clean energy package will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy technology. The legislation is about taxing polluters: approximately 500 of Australia's biggest polluters will have to pay for every tonne of carbon they emit into the atmosphere. These industries have been identified by the Prime Minister and the minister, and I do not intend to go into details here; it is all already on the parliamentary record. All the money collected will go to jobs, clean energy and households. The tax-free threshold will be increased to $18,000, and increased payments will be provided to those Australians who need them. Nine out of 10 households will get some form of tax cut or increased payment. The legislation provides for increased payments to pensioners, veterans, self-funded retirees, Australian families and other Australians who qualify for assistance. There will be an initial lump-sum advancement for households before the carbon pricing scheme comes into effect, and this is to ensure that nobody receives any initial disadvantage.


The legislation is about taxing polluters, as I said, not about increasing costs for Australians. It is legislation designed to change behaviour and to ensure our future and that of our children and their children. Over four million households will be better off in terms of the average price impact. On average, households will see a cost increase of $9.90, while the average assistance to them will be $10.10 per week. Almost six million households will be assisted to meet the average price impact on them, and this means they will receive assistance that covers at lease the average price impact of carbon on their cost of living. Around eight million households will get some assistance. They will receive some assistance through payment increases and tax cuts, as I have already outlined. Those households that improve their energy efficiency—and, remember, this is about changing behaviour—will help the environment and at the same time they will save money.


Pensions will increase by $338 per year for seniors and $510 per year for pensioner couples. Concession card holders who rely on essential medical equipment will also be eligible to receive a $140 essential medical equipment payment. Self-funded retirees who have a Commonwealth seniors card will get the same amount of cash assistance as is provided through the pension. Age pensioners, disability pensioners and carers will all be taken care of.


This government is about ensuring that the people of Australia do not bear the brunt of pricing carbon. This is about the polluters paying. Family payments will increase. Families who receive family tax benefit A will receive up to $110 per child per year extra and there will be up to $69 extra for families who receive family tax benefit B. There will up to $218 extra per year for single income support recipients, $234 per year for single parents and up to $390 for couples combined for jobseekers and students per year.


This is important legislation. This is legislation that is about the future. In summary, the government's clean energy legislation will ensure that big polluters pay, that householders receive tax cuts and are compensated for any cost-of-living increases and that there is a clean energy future for Australia, whilst the opposition's direct action plan will cost individual Australians $1,300 a year. The opposition's plan is not deliverable and will become a non-core promise if a coalition government were ever elected; the government's plan is for a clean energy future and will become a reality on 1 July next year.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (13:02):  I rise today to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. I have gone through the plethora of bills to try to see if there is anything really positive that I can speak on but, quite frankly, the more you look into the legislation the greater your concern for your local community and the impacts that this legislation is going to have on it, both socially and economically. For that reason, I certainly support the coalition's position in vehemently opposing the imposition of this very, very unfair, job-destroying and ineffective carbon tax on my community—and, by extension, on the nation. There is no doubt that we live in a global economy, and these bills are certainly going to impose a very, very unfair impost on business, industries and families and they will have a serious negative impact on our trading with competing countries who do not have to endure this particular tax.


I think what makes this particularly difficult is that this whole debate has been predicated on deceit and dishonesty. The Prime Minister stated very clearly on 16 August 2010 on the Ten Network:


There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.


And in an interview in the Australian on 20 August she said quite clearly and categorically:


I rule out a carbon tax.


The Australian public voted on this issue. They accepted the Prime Minister on her word and on the basis that she would not introduce a carbon tax. To now break her word and introduce it without first taking this to an election represents, in my view, a very gross breach of trust with the Australian people. When I speak to people in my electorate you see that that is very much the consensus. They are very, very disappointed and they feel very much betrayed. I am talking here about people who would have voted for the Labor Party at the last election, and they feel very betrayed.


I was a member of this House back in 1998 when we went to an election on the GST. Much has been said about the then Prime Minister, John Howard, changing his view. But at least he had the conviction to take the issue to an election. We lost quite a few of our colleagues at that time but, nevertheless, we won that election based on that commitment, and subsequently a GST was introduced. I notice that a lot of attention is being focused on the Leader of the Opposition and this nonsense about his 'No, no, no' and 'He is not going to support these bills' et cetera. I was here back in the days when we talked about the GST, and it was 'No, no, no, no' from the then Leader of the Opposition and that was the chorus from the opposition at that time—and the member across the chamber from me, the member for Banks, was part of that very, very loud chorus at the time. So I think it is a little bit hypocritical to now come into this place and suggest that, because we have some very serious and real concerns about this legislation and the impact that it is going to have on our community, we do not have the right to express our concerns and say, 'No; we believe there is a better way.'


People always say that we have to keep up with the world. I do not have a problem with that but, at the end of the day, we should not lead so that we are so far out in front that we get absolutely destroyed. They were talking about what has been happening overseas. There is no other country that is planning to impose an economy-wide carbon price. The Productivity Commission clearly stated that not one country on earth is bringing in an economy-wide carbon tax or emissions trading scheme.


In the United States, for example, all moves towards a national cap-and-trade scheme have been abandoned. The government always uses Europe as an example—they say, 'Europe has got an ETS'—of course it has an ETS, but it certainly does not cover the whole economy. It provides many industries with free emissions permits, and the ETS, interestingly enough. only raises about $500 million a year. The tax we are talking about here in Australia, a much smaller economy, would be raising $9 billion to kick off with. That is a hell of a cost in relation to the Australian people. The government also claims that China is acting to reduce its carbon emissions, but the reality is that China is forecast to rise by something like 500 per cent by the year 2020. So that does not seem to me to be much of a significant reduction in costs.


The actual carbon price would start at $23 a tonne, but after three years that price—it will not be fixed—will float in line with market prices. Government will have no control over that. By the government's own forecast, that price will increase to $29 a tonne in 2016, $37 a tonne in 2020, and over $350 a tonne in 2050. What on earth is that going to do for our cost of living? The Centre for International Economics has forecast that the price will rise to $49 a tonne by 2016.


It is interesting to note that those who are really running the government at the moment—Greens senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne—say that the price needs to be at least $40 a tonne and that there needs to be a shift away from coal for electricity generation. Another Greens senator, Senator Hanson-Young, has canvassed a price of up to $100 a tonne. You can only imagine what sort of impact that is going to have not only on our economy but also on the cost of living of so many people. Any compensation is only being factored in for the introduction of this; this is not ongoing. I can assure you that, as the costs continue to escalate, the cost of living will be escalating with that. It will really make for a hell of an impost, particularly for those who can least afford it.


Cairns has a very diverse economy. From a regional perspective, we have mining—we have the Rio Tinto bauxite mine—but we also have agriculture and horticulture and we have a small Navy base. But tourism is the primary lifeblood of our economy, and we should never forget that. We have done it tough over the last few years, and businesses are now just starting to try to come back. Of course the floods and cyclones certainly have not helped; neither has the loss of flights into our international airport. That is just starting to recover now. There was the tsunami in Japan, one of our main feeder markets, and there was the disaster with the earthquakes in New Zealand, another major and important market for our economy.


We were in fact the unemployment capital of Australia; we were up to 13 per cent at one stage, and the value of the Australian dollar makes it very tough. So the last thing we need is a significant cost increase. They talk about whether we are going to compensate households for electricity and other living costs—as I said, very short term.


When you talk to people like Charlie and Pip Woodward—they have the Capita Group in my electorate, one of the major tourism operators there, operating buses, boats and a whole range of other experiences up there—you find that the increase in the cost of electricity and fuel is going to be quite profound. We have many other great companies up there, including Quicksilver, Jim and Jo Wallace, and Great Adventure Boats. Their costs for fuel for the dive boats going out to the Great Barrier Reef is going to be very significant. These are costs that they have to pass on; they cannot carry these costs. Down Under Tours, James and Gordon Dixon, is a bus tour operation that travels quite extensively around our region. They also have these costs that they are going to have to pass on to the consumer, in a market that is already very, very price sensitive. To suggest that they can cover these costs, while they are still trying to recover from the impacts of the last couple of years, is a nonsense. On top of that they have no control over costs such as electricity and other costs. Again, it is something that they have to pass on.


One of the big concerns I have is in relation to the impact on our airlines. As I said, we have just started to attract further services into Cairns, and this means that there is an opportunity for the whole region. The international airport is an area where people arrive and disperse. The fuel costs in relation to this are going to make travelling into this area a lot less competitive.


Those on the other side say that it is only a minimum cost and they are all doing it overseas, but I note that the International Air Cargo Association has recently urged the EU to suspend the implementation of its emissions trading scheme on aviation and instead pursue a global agreement on aviation carbon emissions. They firmly believe that the aviation emissions must be addressed through a global framework; otherwise it will not result in any decrease in emissions but it will certainly impose a massive impost on the aviation sector. Yet here we are looking at putting the same thing on Australian aviation as well. I think that what we need to do is what we have committed to do in opposition, and that is looking for direct action. One of the things we are looking at is the development, through James Cook University, of carbon dioxide-eating algae that is being developed up there. Professor Kirsten Heimann is heading that project and they are going to retrofit it onto the stacks at Tarong Energy in Queensland. Basically, the algae consumes the carbon dioxide, they are able to harvest the algae, which grows at an accelerated rate, and from that they are able to take biodiesel, stock food and fertiliser. To me that is a much more practical way of reducing emissions. Investing in that creates an opportunity to export not our jobs but a technology that we as Australians can get a benefit from and, in the meantime, we can continue to reduce our own emissions.


I note that we are talking about buying foreign carbon credits. We have seen them in the media in recent times, and I have got to say: start selling credits into equatorial Guinea or Nigeria. That is the sort of thing that would happen if it is a repeat of a lot of the other initiatives that this government has been involved in. I think it is absolutely appalling that we are continuing down this track. I think there are far better ways in which we could do this. We have got to look at alternatives. I think it is right that we should be absolutely opposing this. I think that the compensation will never cover the costs of the losses of the things that we are going to see for families.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-09-19,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:17):  When you are listening to some of this debate it is easy to forget why we are here. Ice caps are melting and the seas are rising. Hurricanes, storms and floods are becoming more intense and dangerous, and extreme fires are becoming more powerful and are happening more often. This is just the beginning of our pathway to a more dangerous and harsher world.


The existing and growing threat of climate change is the reason that we are here today. We are all—every person and every species on this planet—threatened by catastrophic climate change and the potential of it, and we are running out of time to prevent this catastrophe. The catastrophe is not going to be just social but also economic. The hit to the Australian economy if we are not able to prevent runaway climate change is going to be enormous. We have just heard about the tourism sector in Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef has bleached up to nine times since the 1970s, which is completely unusual when you look at the period before it. Sixty-seven thousand jobs are directly dependent on tourism and the Barrier Reef. There will be no compensation that will be able to fully address the situation of those people who are going to be turfed out of a job and a livelihood when the Great Barrier Reef becomes nothing more than a perpetually bleaching feature.


We can look at the Murray-Darling Basin and see Professor Ross Garnaut's predictions of, by the end of the century, a potential loss of about 92 per cent of productivity if we do not get climate change under control. The Australian Climate Commission released a report this year which makes it clear that, to prevent disaster, countries like Australia need to be effectively zero pollution economies by the middle of the century. Indeed, for countries like Australia, it should happen sooner, by somewhere closer to 2040. As the report points out, we are in a critical decade. This decade must be the one in which our pollution in this country is the highest it is ever going to be and it needs to reduce. That means we need to begin the big steps to transform our economy to one which runs on clean energy. I believe it is vitally important in this debate that we do not lose sight of those basic facts. Climate change requires us to act, and today we are acting with this legislation.


If you follow the current debate in the media with its almost obsessive focus on the narrow political implications of this package, it is easy to lose sight of the great significance of this moment in Australia's history. For the first time, after decades of discussion about the need for action, we now have a comprehensive package of national measures to make a start in tackling climate change. For the first time we have a pollution reduction target of 80 per cent by 2050, and that is close to what the science says is needed. For the first time we have a climate change authority that will make recommendations every year on a carbon budget that will get us to that target. And for the first time we have a price on pollution to drive up the relative cost of fossil fuels and to drive down the price of cleaner and renewable energy. And, for the first time we have a well-funded agency whose sole focus is the promotion of renewable energy. And for the first time we have a publicly-funded green bank that can invest in clean energy and leverage billions of dollars in private sector investment as well. We will also have in legislation a commitment to keep global warming below the guardrail of two degrees—one of the few changes that the Greens proposed to the draft legislation.


So I think it is a very significant step towards Australia making its fair share of a global contribution to cutting pollution as well as participating in the global fight against climate change. I am particularly proud to be speaking on these bills today because, of course, we would not be having this debate at this point in time if the electorate of Melbourne had not shown the leadership that it did at the last election. By switching to the Greens, Melbourne was able to empower me and my fellow party members to make a price on pollution one of our conditions for supporting a minority government. We did this because, whilst we agree that a price on pollution alone will not be enough to fix climate change, we know we will not be able to fix climate change without one. A price on pollution, it is worth remembering, comes from a very simple premise. Until now we have presumed as a human race that we can put as much pollution into the atmosphere as we like without any cost. This has not happened because some evil cabal has sat around saying, 'How can we put as much pollution into the atmosphere as possible?' It is just the way our society has been organised for the last couple of hundred years, and we have all benefited from it. We now know it comes at a cost. We now know you cannot continue to put pollution into the atmosphere for free, and this package will begin to say for the first time that polluters who put that pollution into the atmosphere are going to have to pay something approximating the real cost of that pollution.


A price is an essential part of both driving investment decisions and generating revenue that can be directed to cutting pollution and invested in renewables like wind and solar. It is a crucial platform on which further action can be built in the energy efficiency of buildings, transport and other areas of the economy. The negotiations with the government and the Independents, in which I participated and which led to these bills, set out a process for addressing some of these areas, and the Greens have a plan for more measures that will build on the carbon price.


I find very strange this current debate, within this parliament in particular, about false dichotomies between direct action and a price on pollution. That false debate has been created by the Leader of the Opposition for political purposes rather than a reflection of a real disagreement over the best way to act to cut pollution. How do we know that? Because we know the Leader of the Opposition has supported a price on pollution in the past, but we also know that conservative governments in Europe and the UK support the same. The conservative Prime Minister in the United Kingdom has just agreed to cut that country's greenhouse gas pollutions in half by 2025-27. We even have Silvio Berlusconi saying recently, 'You've got to put aside this national interest. It's going to affect us all.' There are not many things that I would agree with Silvio Berlusconi on, but he hits the nail on the head with that. It shows that elsewhere, when you step out of the narrow confines, you will find this is not a partisan political issue.


I think in different political circumstances the Leader of the Opposition would be backing a price on pollution. So I make the prediction that if the Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister we will see a change of heart. We will see him join the ranks of the other conservative leaders around the world and back a price on pollution. The words of the shadow Treasurer today that the coalition will unwind the clean energy package and scrap the compensation that goes with it ring hollow.


This package will triple the tax-free threshold, and I cannot believe that a shadow Treasurer, if you were ever in the position, would go to the million Australians who will now not have to file a tax return and say, 'We want you to pay tax' and go to those hundreds of thousands of pensioners and recipients of welfare who are going to get hundreds of extra dollars, if not thousands, to help them deal with this and say, 'We want to take it back.'


The other reason that this debate between direct action and price on pollution is a false dichotomy is that if you think about other areas where we tackle problems in society we do not apply this kind of dichotomy. We know that smoking causes enormous damage and is a major risk to health. We know that, despite the misinformation and fear campaign pedalled by big tobacco, successive governments have sort to reduce, significantly curb and eventually get smoking rates down to zero.


When we discuss how to deal with smoking, we do not ask, 'Are you a direct actionist or a price supporter?' We do not suggest that putting a price on cigarettes is somehow in conflict with education and health sector intervention. We do everything. We jack up the price. We send doctors on the warpath. We put ads on TV and pictures of cancer on packets of cigarettes. Does anyone seriously believe that investments in public health alone would work to cut smoking if you could buy a pack of cigarettes for $2? Would education programs alone cut through if buying cigarettes was cheaper than a cup of coffee? It is the same argument here: if we allow polluting energy to continue to be unreasonably and wrongly priced as a cheap commodity, we are going to continue to see people flock to it no matter what kind of direct action we take.


It is not just the decisions of consumers that this package is going to change. If you happen to be lucky enough to have a spare few billion lying around and you want to invest in a power station here in Australia, this price sends a signal to you as well: you can either invest in a dirty power station where you are going to have to pay a price on pollution for every tonne of CO2 you emit or you can invest in a clean power station—wind, solar, solar-thermal—and not have to pay a cent. As investment changes we are going to set Australia on the path to being the renewable economy that it should be.


It has been my privilege since I have been elected to meet a number of remarkable people, one of whom is the adviser on climate change to the conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel and the G8. He said, 'I cannot understand why you Australians are not leading the world in renewable energy technology. Look at your intellectual resources. Look at your human resources. Look at how much sun, wind and wave power you have. Why aren't you leading the world?' It is a very good question. We need to be willing to put in place a range of policies that will take us on the path towards a zero carbon economy. Believing it can occur without a carbon price is a dangerous false hope.


I want to outline briefly some important aspects of this package of bills that I think highlight the success of the Greens in negotiating the cross-party agreement that led to these bills. The package means $13 billion investment for clean and renewable energy. There will be a $10 billion publicly owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will leverage tens of billions more in private sector investment in clean renewable energy. There will be a new $3.2 billion Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which will for the first time create a systemic, whole-of-government approach to renewable energy from R&D to rollout and planning. The Australian energy planner, AEMO, will prepare plans for the electricity grid to move forward with 100 per cent renewable energy. There is generous compensation for households, especially low-income earners. Nine out of 10 households will receive assistance through tax cuts, increased payments or both. A supplement will increase pensions, allowances and family payments by 1.7 per cent and a big increase to the tax-free threshold will mean over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return.


The bills also mean we will start replacing dirty power stations. Two thousand megawatts of dirty coal fired power such as Hazelwood, Australia's dirtiest power station, will be closed. The price on pollution importantly means no new conventional commercial coal fired power stations will be built.


I want to take this moment to congratulate the Prime Minister on seeing this package through. Although Labor's platform was to do this in many years' time rather than now, the circumstances of this parliament, where the coalition did not win a majority, have meant that there has to be give and take. We have asked, and the Australian people want, the parliament to take action on climate change and for it to happen soon. I commend the Prime Minister and the government on sticking to that. I hope they use this opportunity not to have their foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time. If they are looking to save $100 million in the next budget, they could easily do it by not giving it for the construction of a new coal fired power plant in Victoria, the HRL.


The reality is that the real opposition to a price on pollution in most cases is not based on a genuine desire to cut pollution. It usually comes from those who are opposed to any action on climate change. That is because, usually, carbon change deniers are those who want to protect polluters or have accepted the arguments of climate deniers. There are those who say that climate change is uncertain or not real, but really that is a question about risk. We may say, 'I cannot tell you the day when Australia will be invaded or where the ships will land or who will be invading us and I cannot tell you whether our submarines will be parked in the right place at the right time,' but that is not an argument for having no Defence Force. You do not get to the end of the year and say, 'My house did not burn down: that is more money I have just wasted on fire insurance;' you say, 'Thank goodness I am safe.' So it is that we should be adopting the question of risk when it comes to climate change. We should be saying, 'If the scientists are right in their over 90 per cent certainty that this is happening, let's address it commensurate with the full consequences of the risk of the most extraordinary extreme events occurring. What can we do to prevent them? How can we make sure that our children and our grandchildren in future generations inherit a world in a better state than it is in at the moment.'


There is also an argument that what Australia does is inconsequential because our pollution is too small. We are the world's largest per capita emitter and we cannot with any seriousness say to countries like China and India, 'We want you to cut your emissions,' if we do not do the same ourselves. Unless we do this, we will be a drag on any effective global action. Conversely, taking this action makes it much more likely that other countries will get on board.


It was reading the climate change science and a realisation of how quickly we had to act that led me to quit my job and begin running in election campaigns.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (13:32):  While it is tempting to spend my time rebutting the member for Melbourne's speech, I will try to resist. But I will say that in this House I have never heard so much emotional claptrap so removed from reality. The member for Melbourne thanked the people of Melbourne for putting him here for this momentous occasion. I was in Melbourne last week and it seems to me that there are a lot of houses and a lot of buildings in the middle of Melbourne made out of concrete. They have glass windows. They have trams running on steel tracks using electricity to drive them around. While the good folk of Melbourne might have a desire to improve the environment, they do not appear to be doing too much of it themselves.


The member for Melbourne's scare campaign of referring to catastrophic climate change is nothing short of ridiculous. The member for Melbourne is still using the images of the Murray-Darling Basin after suffering 10 years of drought to demonstrate his argument. If the member for Melbourne would like to get out of the capital city and go to look at the Murray-Darling Basin, he will find out that it actually has rained, we are not in drought and the system has not run dry, as he would lead us to believe. The interesting thing is that the good folk of Melbourne, supported by the Greens during that drought, started a pipeline to pipe water from the Murray-Darling Basin for the good people of Melbourne to flush down their toilets. This is gross hypocrisy.


Professor Garnaut, who did the original report on climate change and an emissions trading scheme for the Rudd government, said that regional Australia would have an economic downturn of 20 per cent and the cities would have one of eight per cent. When the member for Melbourne comes in here with a scheme where the people of his electorate undertake the same amount of hardship as the people of my electorate, we might start talking. This is nonsense.


We talk about 100 per cent renewable energy in Australia. How do you make a solar farm or a wind turbine without a steel mill? How do you make a wind turbine without an iron ore mine and a coalmine to make the steel to make the turbine? Do the good climate fairies come in at midnight and put these turbines up to generate the electricity? This is an absolute nonsense.


This is, indeed, a historic occasion, but I suggest that we do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves. This is the third time I have spoken on this subject in this place. On the previous two occasions that I spoke, the members of the government and the more recent Greens member had breathless anticipation of worldwide change, but it did not quite happen—so we have not got there yet. Do not count your chickens until they hatch. As I said in my very first speech on the subject, in 2008, this is going to have a devastating effect on the Australian economy.


This bill has been couched as compensation and it has been couched as tax reform. Pardon me—I thought the idea of this legislation was for it to have some sort of environmental effect. We are talking about global environmental effect; Australia does not live in a bubble. As a result of this tax and of the belief by some that it will come about, we are starting to see changes of behaviour, but not the sorts of changes of behaviour that the breathless member for Melbourne spoke about. We are starting to see Australian industry move offshore. For instance, about 100 tonnes of concrete are needed to secure each of the wind turbines which are supposedly going to generate all our power. But guess where that concrete is going to come from. It is not going to come from the plant in central New South Wales at Kandos, because, due to the uncertainty over the economy and due to the price of carbon, it has closed—cement is a triple emitter.




Mr Lyons:
  We haven't got a carbon price yet, and it has closed already.




Mr COULTON:
  Yes, it has closed; but I do not suppose the good folk of Bass are going to go without cement. No—the good folk of Bass are going to get their cement on a ship that will come from Indonesia or China or Japan where they do not have a carbon trading scheme and where, incidentally, they put out about 20 per cent or 30 per cent—



Mr Stephen Jones interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  You will get your chance. Cement factories in Indonesia or China put out about 20 per cent or 30 per cent more carbon per tonne of cement than the factory in Australia did. So not only will more carbon be produced in a Third World country but the jobs will also be in the Third World country, and we will have ships traversing the globe to bring cement into Australia. It will be the same with the steel. Where does the good member for Melbourne think the steel is going to come from when they need new tracks for their trams in Melbourne? It is going to come from overseas. Where are the jobs that are going to create these things going to be? They are going to be overseas.


Being a member of parliament is not a popularity contest. People say that the coalition is running a popularity contest. In 2008, When I first spoke on the carbon price, 85 per cent of Australians were saying that they wanted an emissions trading scheme—that they wanted to put a price on carbon—but now it is down to about 20 per cent. I would like to think that this change was because of the great work that the coalition has done, but it is not; the reason for the change is that the Australian people have realised that they have been sold a dud and that they are going to be asked to change their lifestyle for no environmental gain. There was an article in the paper today about how the price of Weet-Bix is going to go up one cent per biscuit or something like that and that milk is going to go up by so much, and so on. But that is not the argument. A cement worker at Kandos does not care about the price of Weet-Bix; he has to worry about affording the Weet-Bix in the first place because he has lost his job. What about the steelworkers? We have the member for whatever that suburb is in Wollongong where the steelworkers in Wollongong are losing their jobs. What about the people in Western Sydney who work in the factories which do repair works on the steel mills—who is going to protect their jobs?


For the members of the government and the Greens and the Independents this debate is like a year 5 social studies class where they come in, breathlessly excited, to show the teacher how they are going to save the world with absolutely no practical understanding of the consequences. The reason I am opposed to this legislation is that regional Australia will have an economic downturn of 20 per cent—we are users of energy. Do you think the tractor that grows the wheat to make the bread eaten by those good folk in Melbourne who are so warm and fuzzy about this bill is going to be run on a solar panel? Do you think the irrigation pump that pumps the water which grows the cotton used to make their shirts is going to be run on a solar panel? This is gross ignorance and hypocrisy. This House has turned its back on this tax twice before. It is not too late to save Australia from this tax yet again.


Behind me here sit the Independents—the member for New England and the member for Lyne. The member for New England has been making some very disparaging comments of late about redneck politics. He has been taking the high moral ground: he wants to give the Australian environment the benefit of the doubt. But you don't give something the benefit of the doubt if you know that it is going to have no environmental effect. Why would the member for New England and the member for Lyne support legislation that was clearly going to be detrimental to the economies of their electorates—which are exporters—and their country?


A farmer in my electorate who wants to produce a tonne of grain and process it into bread or stockfeed or something like that will pay a tax; a farmer somewhere else in the world will not. If I want to dig up a tonne of coal at Mudgee in my electorate and mix it with a tonne of iron ore from the electorate of my good colleague up the back here and make something here in Australia, there will be a tax; if I want to put those things on a boat and send them to China to get them to make it and send it back to us, there will be no tax. But how are we going to pay for it when it comes back? Agriculture and mining were the two industries—and, in my electorate, they are now equally productive—that saved this country from global recession. It was not the stupid stimulus package that put up those dodgy walls and burnt houses down with insulation that saved the country; it was mining and agriculture. But those industries are going to be hit. My electorate is going to be hit. The pensioners in my electorate may get some compensation, but it will not be enough. Already we are finding that they are, through fear of the future, shivering in winter because they are not game to turn their heaters on.


Opposing this legislation is about doing the right thing. It is about looking after the future of our children and grandchildren. We have heard the member for Melbourne talking about looking after the future of our children, but you can only look after the environment when you have a couple of bob in your pocket to spend on making the necessary improvements. If you are a farmer who is cash strapped, you cannot afford to make the improvements in technology which you need to be more efficient. If you are a business and you are being taxed, the ability to improve your business to make it more environmentally sustainable is taken away from you. You do not help the Australian people to change and improve the way they live by taxing them.


This legislation is going to have no environmental effect. We have heard from others in this debate that we have to catch up with the rest of the world. Between 2005 and 2011, the EU's emissions trading scheme raised $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. That operates in over 30 countries, including 27 members of the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The Australian carbon tax, which we are speaking about now and will vote on—

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (12:06):  I continue where I started—that is, by saying that there are three simple things about all these bills together: 1) climate change is real; 2) there are things that we can do about it; 3) the things that we can do about it are affordable. Given that we all agree in this place and, of course, much more widely—not only in Australia but also right across the globe—about climate change, it is just a matter of what type of system we should put in place to best achieve our goals. By far the best system is a broad-based carbon price. It is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to reduce pollution. A carbon price puts a price tag on pollution. Through the carbon price, for the first time, an incentive will be provided for people not to pollute—in particular for our 500 biggest polluters, who will be required to pay for each tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere in.


This scheme will start on 1 July 2012. Let us be clear that these bills will go through this place—there is agreement here for these bills to pass. There will be a fixed-price period for  2 years, and then we will move to a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme whereby the market will set the price. A market based mechanism is by far the best way to deal with climate change. During the fixed-price period the starting price will be $23 per tonne, and during the next two years it will rise by 2.5 per cent. So, assuming inflation of 2.5 per cent, the carbon price will be $25.40 per tonne by 2014-15.


The flexible market, set-price period will commence on 1 July in three years time—that is, in 2015. During the flexible price period, the government will set the cap by issuing a fixed number of carbon units each year, and some of those units will be auctioned by government. This is the best way to move forward with the system. It means that the market decides and that business gets to adapt, to adjust, to evolve and to grow.


But we are not going to allow this to happen without accepting the fact that there is some cost and that that cost has to be abated in some way. That is why we have put together an assistance package for industry as well as for households. Over the first three years of the carbon price, the government will devote $9.2 billion to assistance for affected jobs in emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. That is to provide with them a transition period to adjust, to adopt, to match what is happening in the rest of the world and an opportunity to continue to grow.


There will be $800 million in the Clean Technology Investment Program, which will provide grants to manufacturers to support investment in energy efficient equipment technologies, processes and products. Over six years there will be $150 million for the food processing industry and $50 million for the metal forging and foundry industries. The government will also provide $200 million in grants to support business research and development in areas of renewable energy, low pollution technology and energy efficiency.


The government is also ensuring that households, tradespeople, farmers and small businesses do not face a carbon price on fuel—because the will not be a carbon price on fuel. The government will reduce the fuels tax credits received by many large polluters so that they too pay an effective carbon price. Many businesses will be exempted from the reduction in fuel credits and shielded from the carbon price on fuel. Heavy vehicles such as semitrailers will also be exempt until 2014-15. While the carbon price will be paid directly by the 500 biggest polluters in this country, the government has designed a generous package to help small business grow and invest in energy efficient assets. Farming and other land-based activities will not be covered by the mechanism. However, the Carbon Farming Initiative will give farmers an opportunity to generate income by taking action to reduce their pollution.


I said earlier that these measures can be effective—and they are. The world is already acting on climate change; in every country there is something being done. It might be called something different and look slightly different in other countries, but every country is taking action on climate change. It is clearly in Australia's national interest to continue to work to achieve the international goal of limiting warming to below two degrees. In order to do this, it is imperative that we play a responsible role in the international arena by taking strong action at home. We have to act locally and think globally.


The government's plan will cut carbon pollution and drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure. It will generate new jobs in these fields. The carbon price will see Australia's annual emissions reduced by at least 159 million tonnes by 2020 from where they would have been had we done nothing. By 2050, we will have taken over 17 billion tonnes of carbon pollution out of the atmosphere by saving nine out of every 10 tonnes of pollution we would have emitted had this plan not been in place.


Australia has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world, including hydro, wind, bioenergy, geothermal, wave and tide—not to mention one of our most abundant resources: solar energy. By 2050, according to Treasury modelling, with a carbon price $100 billion will have been invested in renewable energy, and 40 per cent of Australia's electricity generation will come from renewables. Australia's renewable energy sector will have grown 17 times because of the changes that we are putting in place.


But, as I said earlier, all this does come at a cost and we acknowledge that cost—and it must be compensated for. So nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts or payment increases, and two in three households will get tax cuts or increased payments that will cover the expected average price impact on them. We have tried in this area to be a little bit more generous: we will give a little bit extra, because we would rather err on the side of assistance than on the side of not getting it quite right.


Over four million Australian households will get assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the expected average price impact on them. Over one million additional Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. That is right—one million additional Australian taxpayers will never have to lodge a tax return again because of these changes. On average, the scheme will cost households $9.90 per week, but they will get $10.10 per week in assistance. The assistance is permanent and will increase over time in step with any expected increases caused by these changes. The government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and will increase it further if necessary.


We will go further than that—there will also be tax cuts. Everyone earning up to $80,000 will receive a tax cut. For most people, it will be at least $300. The tax-free threshold will triple in size: no one will pay tax on the first $20,000 they earn. This means that half a million people will go from having to pay tax to paying no tax at all. This is a major tax reform that will encourage people who only need part-time work only to join the workforce. It is an incentive to create jobs and an incentive for people to work.


Of course, pensioners and self-funded retirees will not be left out. Pensioners and self-funded retirees holding a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will get a cash increase of $338 each year if they are single and $510 combined each year if they are couples. That means that, on average, 1.8 million pensioner households will come out at least $210 ahead of the expected carbon price impact on them. Around 150,000 self-funded retirees and part rate pensioners will also receive tax cuts in the order of over $300. We have not forgotten families either. They are an important part of what we are doing. Increases in family tax benefit A for each child will be up $110 per year. Single-income families with children will get up to $69 extra in each family tax benefit B plus up to $300 in additional supplement. Allowance recipients such as people on Newstart and youth allowance will also get up to $218 a year for singles and up to $390 a year for couples. These are good things for the nation across the board. 


Specifically, people will want to know what will happen in my electorate of Oxley. Out of the 62,000 taxpayers in Oxley, around 54,000 will receive a tax cut and 45,000 of these will receive a tax cut of at least $300. More than 38,000 people in Oxley will receive household assistance through income support payments or family assistance payments. A typical family in Oxley will have expected cost increases of around $497 per year, but they will receive around $754 in tax cuts and family assistance. They will be about $257 better off per year. There are more than 3,000 single parents in Oxley who will also get an extra $289 per year and 17,100 pensioners in Oxley will receive an extra $338 per year for singles and $510 per couple—that is, extra after all their expenses. Pensioners will be better off, students will be better off and families will be better off but, most importantly, our economy and our economy will be better off. It is always difficult to make the big decisions in government and to take the next steps forward. It is always difficult to be able to see beyond the horizon, to look where the future takes us—not after the next election or the election after that but the next generation in this country. That is what this is about. This is about making fundamental change. This is about structural reform. This is about changing the way our economy operates. This is about ensuring that industries of the future have a future. This is about making sure that we do not get caught in old thinking, old traps or old ways, which mean that you cannot transition economies and then the jobs you are trying protect today disappear tomorrow because no government took the courageous steps it needed to ensure you could have a clean energy future. This is about making sure we are part of the global economy, the global village. It is a small planet. We are connected. We are a trading nation. Not only do we need to do these things but also we need to shield the impacts of some of these things locally, at a domestic level, and that is exactly what we are doing. We are talking about one of the biggest changes in this economy that has been seen, I would say, for well over 100 years. It is well thought out and well considered and it will be well delivered.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (12:18):  I rise to speak on the bills which will introduce the carbon tax. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue facing this parliament. It comes to one of the most fundamental issues in our democracy, and that is whether the community should be told what a government is going to do before an election. Six days before the last election the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It was explicit and in none of the documentation—in none of the policies, in none of the material that was put out by any Labor candidate—did the government say they would be introducing a carbon tax.


Australian political history shows that Australians will exact a very heavy price on governments which mislead. Paul Keating, campaigning against a GST, in effect introduced a GST by stealth in the 1993 budget. He massively increased the then wholesale sales tax on a range of goods. Here we have a carbon tax bill that emerged after the 2010 election, when the Prime Minister clearly said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This shows no respect for democracy in this country. You cannot make specific promises as part of your election platform and then ignore them once elected. 


The proposal of the government will cost Australians $9 billion per year. To put this in perspective, the carbon trading scheme in Europe, a much larger economy than Australia's, raises $500 million a year. The impact of the carbon tax will be felt very heavily by people with fixed incomes, such as self-funded retirees and pensioners, and by families. The government has spent a lot of time in this debate focusing on the compensation that people are to receive. If you do not tax someone, you do not need to compensate them. But, if the carbon tax does not hurt, it will not work. What will happen is that the carbon tax will result in a 10 per rise in electricity prices and a nine per cent rise in gas bills in the first year alone. There will be a $4.3 billion hit on the budget bottom line. At the moment we already see enormous pressure on the cost of living for families and all this will do is add to it. At a time when we are seeing retail and small business sectors struggling as never before, this is the worst time to be introducing a carbon tax, which will only increase all of those pressures. Since 2007, when Labor came to office, on average electricity prices have risen 51 per cent, gas prices have risen 30 per cent and water and sewerage prices have risen 46 per cent. Despite what the government says, any tax cuts provided will not keep pace with the increasing cost of the carbon tax, and most Australians know this. While the carbon tax will start at $23 per tonne, it will be a floating price after three years, with the government expecting the price to be $37 a tonne in 2020 and over $350 a tonne in 2050.


What will this do to the cost of living? Australian manufacturing is already under pressure, cost of living for everyday Australians is forever increasing, and a carbon tax will only make this worse. Australian businesses will be put at a major disadvantage. On the government's own figures, more than three million Australian households are going to be worse off under the carbon tax.


But worst of all is that under Labor's carbon tax scheme emissions will actually increase. Australian emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes in 2012 to 621 million tonnes in 2020. The whole point of the government's proposal is to reduce emissions in Australia. At the most basic argument, the carbon tax fails in this purpose. The only way the government is going to reach its emissions reduction targets is to buy offshore carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. Under Labor's proposal, the government itself estimates that Australia will be spending $3½ billion purchasing carbon credits from foreign carbon traders in 2020. By 2050 we as a nation will be spending $57 billion a year, or 1½ per cent of our GDP, on purchasing offshore carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. This means that we will be spending $3½ billion in 2020 to buy up foreign carbon credits from potentially dodgy foreign carbon traders to plant trees in other countries, not in Australia. To put this into perspective, Australian government health funding in the latest financial year, as a percentage of GDP, was only 4.1 per cent.


All the Labor Party's carbon tax will do is shift emissions overseas, at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer. The only way that a carbon tax can reduce emissions is if people use less coal produced electricity and less oil powered transport. The problem with this is that the use of electricity is inelastic—not entirely, but quite significantly. Electricity consumption does not drop with increased costs. We are dependent on electricity. Labor's carbon tax will not work. It will hurt families and cost jobs.


The government's own paperwork reveals that the scheme will raise $27 billion in revenue in the first three years of the tax. This is not a tax about the environment; this is a wealth redistribution tax. The 750,000 small businesses in Australia will receive no direct compensation for the massive hikes in electricity prices. What it means is that jobs will be lost and product prices will rise.


As I go around my electorate holding my listening posts and doorknocking, the issue of the carbon tax is raised continually. Residents in my electorate have constantly contacted me about the impact that this carbon tax is going to have on their family, their household or their business. People tell me how this tax is going to mean that their small business is going to struggle even more than before when their expenses go up under the carbon tax. Labor members have spent a lot of time talking about compensation which families will receive, but they have not spent any time talking about the impact on small business, who will receive no compensation. Self-funded retirees and other people on fixed incomes tell me how this tax is going to mean they will struggle to make ends meet because grocery bills and electricity bills are going to go up. These bills are going to go up just as our emissions are going to go up under this carbon tax. There is negligible environmental benefit achieved under this new tax.


I recently met with one of the local councils in my electorate. They informed me that their annual power bill is $1.3 million, 70 per cent of which is for street lighting. Based on the government's own figures, the carbon tax will have an instant impact of $130,000 a year on this local council's budget—money that would otherwise have been spent on providing services to the community. The only way they can recover that $130,000 per year is to increase rates on their ratepayers. This is an example of the fact that power is inelastic. The council cannot just turn off its street lights.


I would also like to focus a bit on the impact that the carbon tax will have on health care in this country. We have already heard from the Victorian government that this will have an impact of millions of dollars on the power bills of hospitals in Victoria. The carbon tax will dramatically increase the cost of running Australia's public and private hospitals. Hospitals are huge consumers of electricity, and there is no way that this consumption can be reduced. Hospitals, through services like radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging, use enormous amounts of electricity, and there is no compensation for them in this carbon tax proposal. What a diagnostic imaging practice will see is a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill. What a public hospital will see is, again, a 10 per cent increase in their electricity bill. A private hospital will see the same. For a clinic delivering radiotherapy and radiation oncology, it will be a 10 per cent increase in that power bill. Electricity prices will increase by 10 per cent in the first year alone, and the government refuses to tell us how much they are expected to rise in future years. When you consider primary care, a general practice, again, will see a 10 per cent increase in their power bill. In allied health, high users of electricity such as physiotherapy practices and dentists will also see a 10 per cent increase in their power bill, with no offset there at all. This is money that could have been spent on providing more front-line health services, and instead it will now be spent on electricity bills due to the government's carbon tax.


I would like now to talk about the coalition's alternative, which is our direct action plan. Despite what those opposite say, the coalition does believe that climate change is real and that mankind is making a contribution. Therefore we do support practical action on climate change. It is right that we protect our environment, and I do not think any Australian would argue with that. During the 2010 election, I made a promise that under a coalition government there would be several Green Corps projects to improve environmental conservation within my electorate. Our direct action policy is aimed at reducing emissions by five per cent by 2020, just like the government's plan. However, we believe that the action we take must be reasonable. We believe that the action we take must not be at the expense of Australian jobs or at the expense of our standards of living. The action we take should not, and must not, drive up the cost of living for people who are already struggling. There is a fundamental difference between the ideology of those opposite and that of the coalition. While those opposite prefer to penalise, punish, and tax, the coalition believes in providing incentive and optimism. This can be seen in many of the government's policies, but it is most clearly seen in their attitude towards climate change.


The coalition's direct action climate policy provides incentives for Australian businesses to reduce their carbon emissions voluntarily. Under a coalition direct action plan, there will be no cost to families, no new taxes and no rise in electricity prices. Our direct action plan is costed, capped and fully funded. By using incentives, our plan allows the market to determine the cheapest way to reduce emissions.


This is a bad tax, based on a lie. We must never forget that the Prime Minister lied to our country before the election—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Boothby knows that he cannot use that word.




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I withdraw.


The Prime Minister, six days before the election, said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That can only be described as misleading. Residents in the minister's own electorate are well aware of this. I have a very clear vision of a nice photo opportunity held at the Findon bowling club, where the Prime Minister was explaining her carbon tax. She was buttonholed by a constituent who realised instantly what the impact of the carbon tax was going to be and said, very correctly, that India and the major emitters were not taking any action. This is a major breach of faith by the Prime Minister. The coalition will be voting against the carbon tax legislation and, if elected, we will rescind the carbon tax legislation.

 (Bowman) (12:32):  On behalf of the residents of Bowman, I rise to make the two most obvious points that have been clear since the debate on emissions trading and the carbon tax began, and that is that we need to get the right mechanism and that we need to do it at the right time. I do not need to go back into the history of the misleading of voters before the last election, but I do need to acknowledge, more importantly, that it has been a long and tortuous debate on both sides of this chamber that has led us to this position.


The point I want to make clear today is that we need to get the right system for Australia because we are lawmakers here in Australia. It does not matter what the rest of the world is doing if we are doing the right thing for this nation. That is my job. It is the job of international agencies and international agreements to work out what is the right thing for the globe. I know if we do not have a global solution on carbon we do not have a solution at all. My speech today is going to focus on where we are globally in that agreement. I will also look at the temporal elements and the history of carbon negotiation—where we have got to and where the pitfalls have been. I do not doubt that a year or two from now we will revisit this debate and ask, 'What did we pass, and why?'


The best comparison for carbon negotiation globally is most likely the trade negotiations that began after World War II and continue today. We still do not have a worldwide trade agreement, 60 years on. More recently we have seen the poverty negotiations around the millennium goals—again, we are halfway to 2020 and we still do not have global agreement on action regarding poverty.


The point about carbon is that a quick and dirty agreement does not get you any closer to a global agreement. We know from international negotiation that it is a slow, trust-building, layer-upon-layer, meeting-upon-meeting approach that takes you towards the solution, or the destination, which is a global agreement. The early GATT negotiations began in 1947, in Annecy, Geneva, Dillon, Torquay and Kennedy. They then rolled right through Tokyo and then, finally, to the Uruguay Round, which began in 2001. Even 10 years after that tortuous process, no-one came out and said, 'I'm dropping all my trade barriers and that's the right thing for the planet.'


That is not the right thing to do in carbon. So the first point I want to address is this notion that we have to set an example for the rest of the world. We do not set examples for the rest of the world when it comes to jobs and livelihoods; we negotiate with the rest of the world. And what has happened since Copenhagen and since Bali? If we are this committed as a nation, why isn't this Prime Minister calling the President of the United States saying, 'Let's do something together'; getting in contact with Russia, Japan, Singapore and South Africa; bringing together the trade economies for meetings; and saying, 'Let's have a carbon arrangement'? It does not matter to this Prime Minister. This is purely a journey of political expediency for a Prime Minister desperate for something that she can look tough on.


Of course, in Australia we know that the impact will be significant. If we as a country wish to lead on climate we must be doing so at every opportunity, not just finding a way to punish our own people. That might be in some masochistic sense impressive to those that are looking for action on climate, but it does nothing to take us closer to global agreement. The fundamental point that has never been made by this government is whether us signing up to something makes other nations more likely or less likely to sign up. If you set up asymmetry in trade and in business where there is an advantage for other countries not to sign up, it is called the first-mover disincentive. It leads to perverse outcomes where you perpetuate the situation. Why would another economy come together and say, 'Australia's harming its trade exposed exports with this carbon tax; let's quickly do the same and remove the advantage we have'? It is pathetic and it is ridiculous. How that occurs is a point that has never been made on this side of the House.


The government would lead us to believe from their Treasury modelling that every other nation in the world will fall into a carbon tax when the ink is barely dry on the agreement—that they are only months or years away from a carbon tax. That is complete folly. No-one on the floor of congress in the US wants a carbon tax. Prime Minister, visit Japan. Go and visit Russia. Talk to Brazil. Show me the mining economies that say that a carbon tax is the right way to go. You will not find an economy that says that. With the greatest of respect to our colleagues in the EU and to New Zealand, our brothers across the Tasman Sea, they are not a mining, trade exposed economy. It is quite easy when you have consumed your natural resources to raise your hand for a carbon tax. It is not that hard to do—particularly when it is at about a dollar per person per year. It is not a hard thing to do. It is a far different thing when you are a commodity-producing economy, where carbon is attributed to the economy where it is mined, not where it is consumed. 


I do not forget the words of those who were at the Copenhagen meeting just two years ago. They said that three things brought down Copenhagen. It is good to remember what they were. They said that the first thing was that the nations of this planet did not arrive at Copenhagen universally agreed on the problem. There was not universal agreement. The preparatory work had not been done. They had a ground rush and got there with all different proposals. No less than our own then Prime Minister came with his own shiny apple of an ETS. But nobody was interested. No-one was tempted by Kevin Rudd's proposal at the time because that is not where the world was heading.


The second thing was that the leaders turned up at Copenhagen too early in the negotiation process. So the minute the leaders jetted in everything was paralysed. All the cameras turned to the leaders and we got no agreement. The third thing that was pointed out by those who were at Copenhagen was the obvious point that this is no longer a debate about who has the shiniest apple and the fanciest carbon tax; it is now about what is right for me. It is now, if I am a commodity-producing trade-exposed economy, about how I do it with other like economies. I want to know what they are doing before I do something. 


There is a weird notion that if we cut our hand in some sort of pact and hold it out, even though no-one grabs it, that will fix the climate. That is patently ridiculous. Every international agreement is a painstaking, slow process of trust-building. Where is Australia doing that at the moment? We are not. We have retreated to the simple task of having a carbon tax debate here in Australia and we have let the rest of the world back away from it.


My fundamental point today is the temporal notion of whether a carbon tax is the right thing right now. I know that we are incredibly animated by this carbon tax debate but it does deserve pause for thought as to why we are the only nation on the planet having a carbon tax debate in 2011. Is it because we have a finely balanced parliament? Is it because someone tapped the Prime Minister on the shoulder and said, 'Unless you pass a carbon tax we will not support you in government'? No, nobody said that. The reality is that, in wanting to do the right thing, we as a nation have simply chosen a foolish course. We have chosen (a) to go it alone and (b) to have a large and churning carbon tax through which the potential for profit seeking, rent seeking, administrative overload and corruption is simply too great for this chamber to pass it.


This carbon tax is clumsily designed. It is overly bulky. It is unwieldy. It offers none of the protections for the industries that we need to be looking after. I do not care that those industries are not voters for the Australian Labor Party, because at some point you have to separate yourself from your own political myopia and say, 'They may not vote for us but possibly it is the right thing to do for the economy and for jobs.'


I do not see why one job should be lost in the pursuit of a carbon agreement. I want to see the evidence that these clean green jobs are going to occur. Let us look for a comparator nation. There is none better than Spain. They embarked on the green economy just five years ago. They made enormous investments in solar energy. And no-one has pointed out to me yet exactly how paying twice as much for a solar panel as you will five years from now helps the climate. No-one has told me how paying twice as much now for a solar panel as Spain did will not bring down the economy just as it did in Spain—because the green bubble simply vanished at the time of the GFC. That enormous investment in solar energy has collapsed.


As Bjorn Lomborg says in his book Cool It, there is plenty of agreement that there is a problem. There are plenty of solutions. The question is: are we prepared to pay, now, for those solutions? Lomborg himself talks about climate being a $5 trillion economic problem between now and the turn of the century. Do we want to pay $15 trillion now to fix it or do we want to pay $3 trillion later? I cannot tell you when that 'later' will be but I know that the solutions get cheaper every day. I do not want to be in the one nation—the one economy—that has a carbon tax in place in 2011 because that will damage our economy. No-one overseas will thank us. The EU will not—it has a very light, almost imperceptible carbon tax. New Zealand will not, because in the main we do not compete with them as a commodity exporter. Certainly the other major economies of the world will not thank us. I do not want to always mention China but their growth in emissions over a year will be three times the size of Australia's entire economy. 


I have used this analogy in the past, for people who do not have the time to read all of these carbon publications. Nobody loved peeing in the pool, did they? But we are all in the pool together here. It is an atmosphere just like a pool and, I tell you what, we are all peeing in that pool. We all agree it is a problem. We differ a little bit on just how bad for your health it is but if there is an elephant and a bullock peeing in the pool I see no point punishing the mouse. 


I am sure we are all contributing to this problem but let us get an agreement in which we are all talking. We do not have that; we are not even close to that. Is this Prime Minister stepping out at saying, 'Let's bring together the tier-2 economies—the great exporters on this planet—for this discussion about climate'? No, there is none of that. She is too busy doing other things, like finding out ways to raise billions of dollars a year in carbon tax and then apportion them—distribute them—as only the friendly hand of government can do! Come on! We can continue under this Labor administration to find excuses to tax Australians. We have had 17 of these excuses so far without a tax cut. In the end we have to trust in their benevolence to distribute the funds appropriately. 


How much can Australians take in this 'servility' to assume that all knowledge rests in Canberra? 'I don't care how much they collect,' we are meant to say, 'as long as I get a little more back than I am going to pay.' This servility—this sense that only a government knows how to distribute these carbon collections—is a complete fallacy. 


We may not always have someone with the priorities of the current Prime Minister. I do not see why another $71 billion has to be collected out of the pockets of people like those in the gallery over the next six years, while at the same time the EU has only collected a fraction with their carbon tax. If you look at the eastern US renewable energy arrangements, where they have only collected $825 million from 50 million people, you see that it is about $5 per person per year. These systems overseas are token systems compared to what we are potentially doing to our economy. The points that I have made here have been simple. We are moving too early and we are moving alone. We are nothing like the EU because we are a commodity-producing economy. Our competitors are not Switzerland and Hungary. Our competitors are those that mine the iron ore and coal, those that bring the natural gas and other energy requirements to South-East Asia. They are the ones we need to be looking at—and do they move closer to a carbon tax? No matter how many times you try to airbrush away the reality, they are phasing it back, they are delaying, they are issuing free permits; they are doing anything they can to not harm their own economies.


That is exactly what this lot over here are not seeing. We have the temporal element and then we have the structural components of the carbon tax, which time will not allow me to go through. But let me say this: huge economic impact with very little environmental benefit. Australia's system alone would give a hundredths of a degree of Celsius reduction. We are talking about massive investment, in the billions now, that I cannot spend on hospitals and health care in order to—what—delay global warming by nine hours by the year 2100?


There is no solution without a global solution. I would love to see an administration focused purely on that very hard and adaptive work to bring other commodity exporters with us. I do not have a problem with being a leader in the field, but there is no point leading if no-one goes with you. Reach out the hand. Let us see if there is an agreement on this carbon tax structure. I severely doubt that there is. I ask if there is one economy heading in our direction in 2011. The frank reality is that there is not. I ask if there is one contemplating an economy-wide approach that hits not just 500 or 1,000 but 60,000 businesses having to pay or be compensated, and not the added prices that will be imposed upon their businesses as the result of the removal of fuel credits. In my electorate there are the waterborne taxis alone, the barges that serve our islands. It is okay to exempt one industry but not another, so they are paying more for their water taxis and vehicles are exempted. There is too much picking of winners. There are too many favourites. We have gone down this path alone with no support internationally and this is a bill that has to be opposed. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (12:47):  I must say that the contribution by the member for Bowman really says a lot about the level of debate that has been engaged in by the opposition. There are no details, there is just a whole lot of political rhetoric. He even said in his contribution that he would not go into detail. What he said was misleading and did not paint a true picture of what is happening not only in Australia but also around the world. In comparing it with Spain and the collapse of the Spanish economy he might as well have compared it with Greece or any other nation that is having problems. It has absolutely nothing to do with investing in clean energy.


The clean energy bills are revolutionary legislation, legislation that will work with other measures and measures adopted by other countries to ensure the future of not only Australia but also our planet. I listened to the contribution made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I learnt more about the opposition's policies from the Prime Minister than from the Leader of the Opposition, who used his 30 minutes to hurl insults at the Prime Minister, create fear and make unsubstantiated one-liners that he thought would make a good grab on the news—just as the member for Bowman did.


The legislation before us today is a market based reform which places a price on carbon pollution on around 500 big polluting companies. This carbon price mechanism is designed to reduce carbon pollution by at least 160 million tonnes a year in 2020, deliver tax cuts and increase pensioner and family payments to Australians. It is about putting a price on pollution whilst ensuring that polluters pay, not Australian workers, families and pensioners. The aim of the legislation is to change behaviour by making polluting costly and rewarding clean initiatives and non-polluting behaviours.


This legislation is a blueprint for a clean energy future, a future with investment in clean energy and clean energy jobs. This legislation is about embracing the future and moving to implement the recommendation of the myriad reports and inquiries that have spanned years. It is about action not inaction, the future not the past. Never has there been legislation that has been more vilified and never has the behaviour of an opposition leader been more irresponsible. For this opposition leader it is about living in the Lodge—not about the future of Australians and the best action to reduce climate pollution and address the pressing issues of climate change.


Not only do I question the motivation of the Leader of the Opposition but also I believe that he and his opposition have failed to substantiate their claim that putting a price on carbon would only lead to job losses, increased prices and failure to reduce carbon emissions. Not true. I also believe the opposition have failed to establish that their direct action plan is an effective measure to address climate change. It will require an increase in taxation of five per cent if they are to reach their target in 2020. 


I believe that climate change is caused by CO2 emissions and that humans contribute to those emissions. I accept the science. I have visited the Solomon Islands and seen the impact that climate change has had on those islands, just as you have, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have spoken to people who have been forced to flee the islands on which they live because the increased temperatures have led to sea level rises, which have devoured their homes. I saw photos of orchards that separated the National Referral Hospital in Honiara from the sea, and I saw how today the ocean was just metres from the hospital. Recent news reports have shown that the polar icecaps are at their lowest level in recorded history, and the melting of that ice is leading to sea level rises. It is serious. It is not something that we can ignore. 


In Australia, we have seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events. This year, we had the floods and cyclones in Queensland that caused havoc. In 2007, the electorate I represent was subjected to an extreme weather event when it and all areas in the Hunter and the Central Coast were lashed by storms, high winds and flooding, causing enormous devastation. There is no shortage of information that shows that climate change is a reality, and that temperatures are rising. There is no shortage of information that shows that CO2 is contributing to these increases, that humans are contributing to the increase in CO2 emissions and that, consequently, climate change is increasing. The government accepts that climate change is a reality and must be addressed. The opposition plays politics, promoting misinformation, as we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Bowman, and failing to provide a viable, affordable alternative to pricing carbon. 


In Australia we hear the mantra that, until China acts, Australia should not act. If that is the case, the time to act is now. I recently visited China with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, to see what, if any, action was taking place in China to address climate change. The overwhelming message that the committee received whilst in China was that the Chinese government and the Chinese people accept the reality of climate change. There is no debate there as to whether or not climate change is a reality. Rather, the debate is about how to cut CO2 pollution, and the Chinese government has committed to doing that. China knows its future depends on action to reduce its emissions; that is why China is making a massive investment in research into renewable energies. We visited an ecologically sustainable city, Tianjin. We also learnt about carbon price mechanisms that have been used in some regions of China; in fact, I believe that six such pricing mechanisms have been implemented within China. So China is acting and is putting a price on carbon.


The member for Wentworth knows that climate change and global warming are a reality and he knows that pricing carbon is the only effective way to change behaviour and reduce pollution—and he is not the only one on the opposition side who knows that carbon must be priced if we are to address the issue of CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not hold the same belief. He has stated in the past that climate change is 'crap', and his close alliance with anti-climate-change groups proves that he is a climate change denier. His direct action plan is really about inaction rather than direct action. I believe if the opposition gained government at the next election and Tony Abbott became Prime Minister, Australia would see inaction, not direct action, as his plan is costly and would place a tax on all Australians. On Thursday, 15 September, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the coalition's direct action plan would cost 'at least double' the cost of the government's clean energy package. Michael Hitchens, Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, said:


We understand … that the cost of abatement might double if we try to achieve the full abatement domestically—


as set out in the coalition's direct action plan.


The article goes on to discuss in some detail how the plan that has been put up by the coalition will cost each and every Australian.


The government's clean energy package will cut pollution and drive investment in clean energy technology. The legislation is about taxing polluters: approximately 500 of Australia's biggest polluters will have to pay for every tonne of carbon they emit into the atmosphere. These industries have been identified by the Prime Minister and the minister, and I do not intend to go into details here; it is all already on the parliamentary record. All the money collected will go to jobs, clean energy and households. The tax-free threshold will be increased to $18,000, and increased payments will be provided to those Australians who need them. Nine out of 10 households will get some form of tax cut or increased payment. The legislation provides for increased payments to pensioners, veterans, self-funded retirees, Australian families and other Australians who qualify for assistance. There will be an initial lump-sum advancement for households before the carbon pricing scheme comes into effect, and this is to ensure that nobody receives any initial disadvantage.


The legislation is about taxing polluters, as I said, not about increasing costs for Australians. It is legislation designed to change behaviour and to ensure our future and that of our children and their children. Over four million households will be better off in terms of the average price impact. On average, households will see a cost increase of $9.90, while the average assistance to them will be $10.10 per week. Almost six million households will be assisted to meet the average price impact on them, and this means they will receive assistance that covers at lease the average price impact of carbon on their cost of living. Around eight million households will get some assistance. They will receive some assistance through payment increases and tax cuts, as I have already outlined. Those households that improve their energy efficiency—and, remember, this is about changing behaviour—will help the environment and at the same time they will save money.


Pensions will increase by $338 per year for seniors and $510 per year for pensioner couples. Concession card holders who rely on essential medical equipment will also be eligible to receive a $140 essential medical equipment payment. Self-funded retirees who have a Commonwealth seniors card will get the same amount of cash assistance as is provided through the pension. Age pensioners, disability pensioners and carers will all be taken care of.


This government is about ensuring that the people of Australia do not bear the brunt of pricing carbon. This is about the polluters paying. Family payments will increase. Families who receive family tax benefit A will receive up to $110 per child per year extra and there will be up to $69 extra for families who receive family tax benefit B. There will up to $218 extra per year for single income support recipients, $234 per year for single parents and up to $390 for couples combined for jobseekers and students per year.


This is important legislation. This is legislation that is about the future. In summary, the government's clean energy legislation will ensure that big polluters pay, that householders receive tax cuts and are compensated for any cost-of-living increases and that there is a clean energy future for Australia, whilst the opposition's direct action plan will cost individual Australians $1,300 a year. The opposition's plan is not deliverable and will become a non-core promise if a coalition government were ever elected; the government's plan is for a clean energy future and will become a reality on 1 July next year.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (13:02):  I rise today to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. I have gone through the plethora of bills to try to see if there is anything really positive that I can speak on but, quite frankly, the more you look into the legislation the greater your concern for your local community and the impacts that this legislation is going to have on it, both socially and economically. For that reason, I certainly support the coalition's position in vehemently opposing the imposition of this very, very unfair, job-destroying and ineffective carbon tax on my community—and, by extension, on the nation. There is no doubt that we live in a global economy, and these bills are certainly going to impose a very, very unfair impost on business, industries and families and they will have a serious negative impact on our trading with competing countries who do not have to endure this particular tax.


I think what makes this particularly difficult is that this whole debate has been predicated on deceit and dishonesty. The Prime Minister stated very clearly on 16 August 2010 on the Ten Network:


There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.


And in an interview in the Australian on 20 August she said quite clearly and categorically:


I rule out a carbon tax.


The Australian public voted on this issue. They accepted the Prime Minister on her word and on the basis that she would not introduce a carbon tax. To now break her word and introduce it without first taking this to an election represents, in my view, a very gross breach of trust with the Australian people. When I speak to people in my electorate you see that that is very much the consensus. They are very, very disappointed and they feel very much betrayed. I am talking here about people who would have voted for the Labor Party at the last election, and they feel very betrayed.


I was a member of this House back in 1998 when we went to an election on the GST. Much has been said about the then Prime Minister, John Howard, changing his view. But at least he had the conviction to take the issue to an election. We lost quite a few of our colleagues at that time but, nevertheless, we won that election based on that commitment, and subsequently a GST was introduced. I notice that a lot of attention is being focused on the Leader of the Opposition and this nonsense about his 'No, no, no' and 'He is not going to support these bills' et cetera. I was here back in the days when we talked about the GST, and it was 'No, no, no, no' from the then Leader of the Opposition and that was the chorus from the opposition at that time—and the member across the chamber from me, the member for Banks, was part of that very, very loud chorus at the time. So I think it is a little bit hypocritical to now come into this place and suggest that, because we have some very serious and real concerns about this legislation and the impact that it is going to have on our community, we do not have the right to express our concerns and say, 'No; we believe there is a better way.'


People always say that we have to keep up with the world. I do not have a problem with that but, at the end of the day, we should not lead so that we are so far out in front that we get absolutely destroyed. They were talking about what has been happening overseas. There is no other country that is planning to impose an economy-wide carbon price. The Productivity Commission clearly stated that not one country on earth is bringing in an economy-wide carbon tax or emissions trading scheme.


In the United States, for example, all moves towards a national cap-and-trade scheme have been abandoned. The government always uses Europe as an example—they say, 'Europe has got an ETS'—of course it has an ETS, but it certainly does not cover the whole economy. It provides many industries with free emissions permits, and the ETS, interestingly enough. only raises about $500 million a year. The tax we are talking about here in Australia, a much smaller economy, would be raising $9 billion to kick off with. That is a hell of a cost in relation to the Australian people. The government also claims that China is acting to reduce its carbon emissions, but the reality is that China is forecast to rise by something like 500 per cent by the year 2020. So that does not seem to me to be much of a significant reduction in costs.


The actual carbon price would start at $23 a tonne, but after three years that price—it will not be fixed—will float in line with market prices. Government will have no control over that. By the government's own forecast, that price will increase to $29 a tonne in 2016, $37 a tonne in 2020, and over $350 a tonne in 2050. What on earth is that going to do for our cost of living? The Centre for International Economics has forecast that the price will rise to $49 a tonne by 2016.


It is interesting to note that those who are really running the government at the moment—Greens senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne—say that the price needs to be at least $40 a tonne and that there needs to be a shift away from coal for electricity generation. Another Greens senator, Senator Hanson-Young, has canvassed a price of up to $100 a tonne. You can only imagine what sort of impact that is going to have not only on our economy but also on the cost of living of so many people. Any compensation is only being factored in for the introduction of this; this is not ongoing. I can assure you that, as the costs continue to escalate, the cost of living will be escalating with that. It will really make for a hell of an impost, particularly for those who can least afford it.


Cairns has a very diverse economy. From a regional perspective, we have mining—we have the Rio Tinto bauxite mine—but we also have agriculture and horticulture and we have a small Navy base. But tourism is the primary lifeblood of our economy, and we should never forget that. We have done it tough over the last few years, and businesses are now just starting to try to come back. Of course the floods and cyclones certainly have not helped; neither has the loss of flights into our international airport. That is just starting to recover now. There was the tsunami in Japan, one of our main feeder markets, and there was the disaster with the earthquakes in New Zealand, another major and important market for our economy.


We were in fact the unemployment capital of Australia; we were up to 13 per cent at one stage, and the value of the Australian dollar makes it very tough. So the last thing we need is a significant cost increase. They talk about whether we are going to compensate households for electricity and other living costs—as I said, very short term.


When you talk to people like Charlie and Pip Woodward—they have the Capita Group in my electorate, one of the major tourism operators there, operating buses, boats and a whole range of other experiences up there—you find that the increase in the cost of electricity and fuel is going to be quite profound. We have many other great companies up there, including Quicksilver, Jim and Jo Wallace, and Great Adventure Boats. Their costs for fuel for the dive boats going out to the Great Barrier Reef is going to be very significant. These are costs that they have to pass on; they cannot carry these costs. Down Under Tours, James and Gordon Dixon, is a bus tour operation that travels quite extensively around our region. They also have these costs that they are going to have to pass on to the consumer, in a market that is already very, very price sensitive. To suggest that they can cover these costs, while they are still trying to recover from the impacts of the last couple of years, is a nonsense. On top of that they have no control over costs such as electricity and other costs. Again, it is something that they have to pass on.


One of the big concerns I have is in relation to the impact on our airlines. As I said, we have just started to attract further services into Cairns, and this means that there is an opportunity for the whole region. The international airport is an area where people arrive and disperse. The fuel costs in relation to this are going to make travelling into this area a lot less competitive.


Those on the other side say that it is only a minimum cost and they are all doing it overseas, but I note that the International Air Cargo Association has recently urged the EU to suspend the implementation of its emissions trading scheme on aviation and instead pursue a global agreement on aviation carbon emissions. They firmly believe that the aviation emissions must be addressed through a global framework; otherwise it will not result in any decrease in emissions but it will certainly impose a massive impost on the aviation sector. Yet here we are looking at putting the same thing on Australian aviation as well. I think that what we need to do is what we have committed to do in opposition, and that is looking for direct action. One of the things we are looking at is the development, through James Cook University, of carbon dioxide-eating algae that is being developed up there. Professor Kirsten Heimann is heading that project and they are going to retrofit it onto the stacks at Tarong Energy in Queensland. Basically, the algae consumes the carbon dioxide, they are able to harvest the algae, which grows at an accelerated rate, and from that they are able to take biodiesel, stock food and fertiliser. To me that is a much more practical way of reducing emissions. Investing in that creates an opportunity to export not our jobs but a technology that we as Australians can get a benefit from and, in the meantime, we can continue to reduce our own emissions.


I note that we are talking about buying foreign carbon credits. We have seen them in the media in recent times, and I have got to say: start selling credits into equatorial Guinea or Nigeria. That is the sort of thing that would happen if it is a repeat of a lot of the other initiatives that this government has been involved in. I think it is absolutely appalling that we are continuing down this track. I think there are far better ways in which we could do this. We have got to look at alternatives. I think it is right that we should be absolutely opposing this. I think that the compensation will never cover the costs of the losses of the things that we are going to see for families.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (13:17):  When you are listening to some of this debate it is easy to forget why we are here. Ice caps are melting and the seas are rising. Hurricanes, storms and floods are becoming more intense and dangerous, and extreme fires are becoming more powerful and are happening more often. This is just the beginning of our pathway to a more dangerous and harsher world.


The existing and growing threat of climate change is the reason that we are here today. We are all—every person and every species on this planet—threatened by catastrophic climate change and the potential of it, and we are running out of time to prevent this catastrophe. The catastrophe is not going to be just social but also economic. The hit to the Australian economy if we are not able to prevent runaway climate change is going to be enormous. We have just heard about the tourism sector in Queensland. The Great Barrier Reef has bleached up to nine times since the 1970s, which is completely unusual when you look at the period before it. Sixty-seven thousand jobs are directly dependent on tourism and the Barrier Reef. There will be no compensation that will be able to fully address the situation of those people who are going to be turfed out of a job and a livelihood when the Great Barrier Reef becomes nothing more than a perpetually bleaching feature.


We can look at the Murray-Darling Basin and see Professor Ross Garnaut's predictions of, by the end of the century, a potential loss of about 92 per cent of productivity if we do not get climate change under control. The Australian Climate Commission released a report this year which makes it clear that, to prevent disaster, countries like Australia need to be effectively zero pollution economies by the middle of the century. Indeed, for countries like Australia, it should happen sooner, by somewhere closer to 2040. As the report points out, we are in a critical decade. This decade must be the one in which our pollution in this country is the highest it is ever going to be and it needs to reduce. That means we need to begin the big steps to transform our economy to one which runs on clean energy. I believe it is vitally important in this debate that we do not lose sight of those basic facts. Climate change requires us to act, and today we are acting with this legislation.


If you follow the current debate in the media with its almost obsessive focus on the narrow political implications of this package, it is easy to lose sight of the great significance of this moment in Australia's history. For the first time, after decades of discussion about the need for action, we now have a comprehensive package of national measures to make a start in tackling climate change. For the first time we have a pollution reduction target of 80 per cent by 2050, and that is close to what the science says is needed. For the first time we have a climate change authority that will make recommendations every year on a carbon budget that will get us to that target. And for the first time we have a price on pollution to drive up the relative cost of fossil fuels and to drive down the price of cleaner and renewable energy. And, for the first time we have a well-funded agency whose sole focus is the promotion of renewable energy. And for the first time we have a publicly-funded green bank that can invest in clean energy and leverage billions of dollars in private sector investment as well. We will also have in legislation a commitment to keep global warming below the guardrail of two degrees—one of the few changes that the Greens proposed to the draft legislation.


So I think it is a very significant step towards Australia making its fair share of a global contribution to cutting pollution as well as participating in the global fight against climate change. I am particularly proud to be speaking on these bills today because, of course, we would not be having this debate at this point in time if the electorate of Melbourne had not shown the leadership that it did at the last election. By switching to the Greens, Melbourne was able to empower me and my fellow party members to make a price on pollution one of our conditions for supporting a minority government. We did this because, whilst we agree that a price on pollution alone will not be enough to fix climate change, we know we will not be able to fix climate change without one. A price on pollution, it is worth remembering, comes from a very simple premise. Until now we have presumed as a human race that we can put as much pollution into the atmosphere as we like without any cost. This has not happened because some evil cabal has sat around saying, 'How can we put as much pollution into the atmosphere as possible?' It is just the way our society has been organised for the last couple of hundred years, and we have all benefited from it. We now know it comes at a cost. We now know you cannot continue to put pollution into the atmosphere for free, and this package will begin to say for the first time that polluters who put that pollution into the atmosphere are going to have to pay something approximating the real cost of that pollution.


A price is an essential part of both driving investment decisions and generating revenue that can be directed to cutting pollution and invested in renewables like wind and solar. It is a crucial platform on which further action can be built in the energy efficiency of buildings, transport and other areas of the economy. The negotiations with the government and the Independents, in which I participated and which led to these bills, set out a process for addressing some of these areas, and the Greens have a plan for more measures that will build on the carbon price.


I find very strange this current debate, within this parliament in particular, about false dichotomies between direct action and a price on pollution. That false debate has been created by the Leader of the Opposition for political purposes rather than a reflection of a real disagreement over the best way to act to cut pollution. How do we know that? Because we know the Leader of the Opposition has supported a price on pollution in the past, but we also know that conservative governments in Europe and the UK support the same. The conservative Prime Minister in the United Kingdom has just agreed to cut that country's greenhouse gas pollutions in half by 2025-27. We even have Silvio Berlusconi saying recently, 'You've got to put aside this national interest. It's going to affect us all.' There are not many things that I would agree with Silvio Berlusconi on, but he hits the nail on the head with that. It shows that elsewhere, when you step out of the narrow confines, you will find this is not a partisan political issue.


I think in different political circumstances the Leader of the Opposition would be backing a price on pollution. So I make the prediction that if the Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister we will see a change of heart. We will see him join the ranks of the other conservative leaders around the world and back a price on pollution. The words of the shadow Treasurer today that the coalition will unwind the clean energy package and scrap the compensation that goes with it ring hollow.


This package will triple the tax-free threshold, and I cannot believe that a shadow Treasurer, if you were ever in the position, would go to the million Australians who will now not have to file a tax return and say, 'We want you to pay tax' and go to those hundreds of thousands of pensioners and recipients of welfare who are going to get hundreds of extra dollars, if not thousands, to help them deal with this and say, 'We want to take it back.'


The other reason that this debate between direct action and price on pollution is a false dichotomy is that if you think about other areas where we tackle problems in society we do not apply this kind of dichotomy. We know that smoking causes enormous damage and is a major risk to health. We know that, despite the misinformation and fear campaign pedalled by big tobacco, successive governments have sort to reduce, significantly curb and eventually get smoking rates down to zero.


When we discuss how to deal with smoking, we do not ask, 'Are you a direct actionist or a price supporter?' We do not suggest that putting a price on cigarettes is somehow in conflict with education and health sector intervention. We do everything. We jack up the price. We send doctors on the warpath. We put ads on TV and pictures of cancer on packets of cigarettes. Does anyone seriously believe that investments in public health alone would work to cut smoking if you could buy a pack of cigarettes for $2? Would education programs alone cut through if buying cigarettes was cheaper than a cup of coffee? It is the same argument here: if we allow polluting energy to continue to be unreasonably and wrongly priced as a cheap commodity, we are going to continue to see people flock to it no matter what kind of direct action we take.


It is not just the decisions of consumers that this package is going to change. If you happen to be lucky enough to have a spare few billion lying around and you want to invest in a power station here in Australia, this price sends a signal to you as well: you can either invest in a dirty power station where you are going to have to pay a price on pollution for every tonne of CO2 you emit or you can invest in a clean power station—wind, solar, solar-thermal—and not have to pay a cent. As investment changes we are going to set Australia on the path to being the renewable economy that it should be.


It has been my privilege since I have been elected to meet a number of remarkable people, one of whom is the adviser on climate change to the conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel and the G8. He said, 'I cannot understand why you Australians are not leading the world in renewable energy technology. Look at your intellectual resources. Look at your human resources. Look at how much sun, wind and wave power you have. Why aren't you leading the world?' It is a very good question. We need to be willing to put in place a range of policies that will take us on the path towards a zero carbon economy. Believing it can occur without a carbon price is a dangerous false hope.


I want to outline briefly some important aspects of this package of bills that I think highlight the success of the Greens in negotiating the cross-party agreement that led to these bills. The package means $13 billion investment for clean and renewable energy. There will be a $10 billion publicly owned Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which will leverage tens of billions more in private sector investment in clean renewable energy. There will be a new $3.2 billion Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which will for the first time create a systemic, whole-of-government approach to renewable energy from R&D to rollout and planning. The Australian energy planner, AEMO, will prepare plans for the electricity grid to move forward with 100 per cent renewable energy. There is generous compensation for households, especially low-income earners. Nine out of 10 households will receive assistance through tax cuts, increased payments or both. A supplement will increase pensions, allowances and family payments by 1.7 per cent and a big increase to the tax-free threshold will mean over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return.


The bills also mean we will start replacing dirty power stations. Two thousand megawatts of dirty coal fired power such as Hazelwood, Australia's dirtiest power station, will be closed. The price on pollution importantly means no new conventional commercial coal fired power stations will be built.


I want to take this moment to congratulate the Prime Minister on seeing this package through. Although Labor's platform was to do this in many years' time rather than now, the circumstances of this parliament, where the coalition did not win a majority, have meant that there has to be give and take. We have asked, and the Australian people want, the parliament to take action on climate change and for it to happen soon. I commend the Prime Minister and the government on sticking to that. I hope they use this opportunity not to have their foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time. If they are looking to save $100 million in the next budget, they could easily do it by not giving it for the construction of a new coal fired power plant in Victoria, the HRL.


The reality is that the real opposition to a price on pollution in most cases is not based on a genuine desire to cut pollution. It usually comes from those who are opposed to any action on climate change. That is because, usually, carbon change deniers are those who want to protect polluters or have accepted the arguments of climate deniers. There are those who say that climate change is uncertain or not real, but really that is a question about risk. We may say, 'I cannot tell you the day when Australia will be invaded or where the ships will land or who will be invading us and I cannot tell you whether our submarines will be parked in the right place at the right time,' but that is not an argument for having no Defence Force. You do not get to the end of the year and say, 'My house did not burn down: that is more money I have just wasted on fire insurance;' you say, 'Thank goodness I am safe.' So it is that we should be adopting the question of risk when it comes to climate change. We should be saying, 'If the scientists are right in their over 90 per cent certainty that this is happening, let's address it commensurate with the full consequences of the risk of the most extraordinary extreme events occurring. What can we do to prevent them? How can we make sure that our children and our grandchildren in future generations inherit a world in a better state than it is in at the moment.'


There is also an argument that what Australia does is inconsequential because our pollution is too small. We are the world's largest per capita emitter and we cannot with any seriousness say to countries like China and India, 'We want you to cut your emissions,' if we do not do the same ourselves. Unless we do this, we will be a drag on any effective global action. Conversely, taking this action makes it much more likely that other countries will get on board.


It was reading the climate change science and a realisation of how quickly we had to act that led me to quit my job and begin running in election campaigns. It is with great pride that I stand here today knowing that we are taking our first ever steps on climate change one year into this government.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2011-09-19,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (13:32):  While it is tempting to spend my time rebutting the member for Melbourne's speech, I will try to resist. But I will say that in this House I have never heard so much emotional claptrap so removed from reality. The member for Melbourne thanked the people of Melbourne for putting him here for this momentous occasion. I was in Melbourne last week and it seems to me that there are a lot of houses and a lot of buildings in the middle of Melbourne made out of concrete. They have glass windows. They have trams running on steel tracks using electricity to drive them around. While the good folk of Melbourne might have a desire to improve the environment, they do not appear to be doing too much of it themselves.


The member for Melbourne's scare campaign of referring to catastrophic climate change is nothing short of ridiculous. The member for Melbourne is still using the images of the Murray-Darling Basin after suffering 10 years of drought to demonstrate his argument. If the member for Melbourne would like to get out of the capital city and go to look at the Murray-Darling Basin, he will find out that it actually has rained, we are not in drought and the system has not run dry, as he would lead us to believe. The interesting thing is that the good folk of Melbourne, supported by the Greens during that drought, started a pipeline to pipe water from the Murray-Darling Basin for the good people of Melbourne to flush down their toilets. This is gross hypocrisy.


Professor Garnaut, who did the original report on climate change and an emissions trading scheme for the Rudd government, said that regional Australia would have an economic downturn of 20 per cent and the cities would have one of eight per cent. When the member for Melbourne comes in here with a scheme where the people of his electorate undertake the same amount of hardship as the people of my electorate, we might start talking. This is nonsense.


We talk about 100 per cent renewable energy in Australia. How do you make a solar farm or a wind turbine without a steel mill? How do you make a wind turbine without an iron ore mine and a coalmine to make the steel to make the turbine? Do the good climate fairies come in at midnight and put these turbines up to generate the electricity? This is an absolute nonsense.


This is, indeed, a historic occasion, but I suggest that we do not want to get too far ahead of ourselves. This is the third time I have spoken on this subject in this place. On the previous two occasions that I spoke, the members of the government and the more recent Greens member had breathless anticipation of worldwide change, but it did not quite happen—so we have not got there yet. Do not count your chickens until they hatch. As I said in my very first speech on the subject, in 2008, this is going to have a devastating effect on the Australian economy.


This bill has been couched as compensation and it has been couched as tax reform. Pardon me—I thought the idea of this legislation was for it to have some sort of environmental effect. We are talking about global environmental effect; Australia does not live in a bubble. As a result of this tax and of the belief by some that it will come about, we are starting to see changes of behaviour, but not the sorts of changes of behaviour that the breathless member for Melbourne spoke about. We are starting to see Australian industry move offshore. For instance, about 100 tonnes of concrete are needed to secure each of the wind turbines which are supposedly going to generate all our power. But guess where that concrete is going to come from. It is not going to come from the plant in central New South Wales at Kandos, because, due to the uncertainty over the economy and due to the price of carbon, it has closed—cement is a triple emitter.




Mr Lyons:
  We haven't got a carbon price yet, and it has closed already.




Mr COULTON:
  Yes, it has closed; but I do not suppose the good folk of Bass are going to go without cement. No—the good folk of Bass are going to get their cement on a ship that will come from Indonesia or China or Japan where they do not have a carbon trading scheme and where, incidentally, they put out about 20 per cent or 30 per cent—



Mr Stephen Jones interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  You will get your chance. Cement factories in Indonesia or China put out about 20 per cent or 30 per cent more carbon per tonne of cement than the factory in Australia did. So not only will more carbon be produced in a Third World country but the jobs will also be in the Third World country, and we will have ships traversing the globe to bring cement into Australia. It will be the same with the steel. Where does the good member for Melbourne think the steel is going to come from when they need new tracks for their trams in Melbourne? It is going to come from overseas. Where are the jobs that are going to create these things going to be? They are going to be overseas.


Being a member of parliament is not a popularity contest. People say that the coalition is running a popularity contest. In 2008, When I first spoke on the carbon price, 85 per cent of Australians were saying that they wanted an emissions trading scheme—that they wanted to put a price on carbon—but now it is down to about 20 per cent. I would like to think that this change was because of the great work that the coalition has done, but it is not; the reason for the change is that the Australian people have realised that they have been sold a dud and that they are going to be asked to change their lifestyle for no environmental gain. There was an article in the paper today about how the price of Weet-Bix is going to go up one cent per biscuit or something like that and that milk is going to go up by so much, and so on. But that is not the argument. A cement worker at Kandos does not care about the price of Weet-Bix; he has to worry about affording the Weet-Bix in the first place because he has lost his job. What about the steelworkers? We have the member for whatever that suburb is in Wollongong where the steelworkers in Wollongong are losing their jobs. What about the people in Western Sydney who work in the factories which do repair works on the steel mills—who is going to protect their jobs?


For the members of the government and the Greens and the Independents this debate is like a year 5 social studies class where they come in, breathlessly excited, to show the teacher how they are going to save the world with absolutely no practical understanding of the consequences. The reason I am opposed to this legislation is that regional Australia will have an economic downturn of 20 per cent—we are users of energy. Do you think the tractor that grows the wheat to make the bread eaten by those good folk in Melbourne who are so warm and fuzzy about this bill is going to be run on a solar panel? Do you think the irrigation pump that pumps the water which grows the cotton used to make their shirts is going to be run on a solar panel? This is gross ignorance and hypocrisy. This House has turned its back on this tax twice before. It is not too late to save Australia from this tax yet again.


Behind me here sit the Independents—the member for New England and the member for Lyne. The member for New England has been making some very disparaging comments of late about redneck politics. He has been taking the high moral ground: he wants to give the Australian environment the benefit of the doubt. But you don't give something the benefit of the doubt if you know that it is going to have no environmental effect. Why would the member for New England and the member for Lyne support legislation that was clearly going to be detrimental to the economies of their electorates—which are exporters—and their country?


A farmer in my electorate who wants to produce a tonne of grain and process it into bread or stockfeed or something like that will pay a tax; a farmer somewhere else in the world will not. If I want to dig up a tonne of coal at Mudgee in my electorate and mix it with a tonne of iron ore from the electorate of my good colleague up the back here and make something here in Australia, there will be a tax; if I want to put those things on a boat and send them to China to get them to make it and send it back to us, there will be no tax. But how are we going to pay for it when it comes back? Agriculture and mining were the two industries—and, in my electorate, they are now equally productive—that saved this country from global recession. It was not the stupid stimulus package that put up those dodgy walls and burnt houses down with insulation that saved the country; it was mining and agriculture. But those industries are going to be hit. My electorate is going to be hit. The pensioners in my electorate may get some compensation, but it will not be enough. Already we are finding that they are, through fear of the future, shivering in winter because they are not game to turn their heaters on.


Opposing this legislation is about doing the right thing. It is about looking after the future of our children and grandchildren. We have heard the member for Melbourne talking about looking after the future of our children, but you can only look after the environment when you have a couple of bob in your pocket to spend on making the necessary improvements. If you are a farmer who is cash strapped, you cannot afford to make the improvements in technology which you need to be more efficient. If you are a business and you are being taxed, the ability to improve your business to make it more environmentally sustainable is taken away from you. You do not help the Australian people to change and improve the way they live by taxing them.


This legislation is going to have no environmental effect. We have heard from others in this debate that we have to catch up with the rest of the world. Between 2005 and 2011, the EU's emissions trading scheme raised $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. That operates in over 30 countries, including 27 members of the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The Australian carbon tax, which we are speaking about now and will vote on—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (13:45):  Last Friday I met a group of people who were inspirational in every way. I joined social workers Mark Silver and Fiona Riley for a meeting of their Parkinson's support group at the Elgin Street Centre in Hawthorn. Each week around a dozen men gather to share their experiences about living with Parkinson's. They are among the more than 750 people living in the electorate of Kooyong who are afflicted with the disease. These men range in ages, come from a remarkable variety of vocational and cultural backgrounds and have more than one trait in common. Their bravery and zest for life was obvious as they recounted wonderful stories from their time as a CEO of a leading corporation, a sport administrator and a medical practitioner. Dare I say it; one man was even a politician of note.


As I listened to these men talk about their experiences, including one who immigrated to Australia from the subcontinent and another from war torn Europe, I was struck by how debilitating this degenerative disease is. It is a condition of the central nervous system that affects a person's physical condition. There is no cure and no clear cause. Medication does help. This disease, first termed 'shaking palsy' by Dr James Parkinson in 1817, has altered the lives of so many people. It affects more than 100,000 Australians, including my great friend Sir Zelman Cowen, and more than 6.3 million worldwide. I know as I stand here today the best and brightest are desperately searching for a cure. One hopes that they find it soon. (Time expired)

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:31):  I would like to take the opportunity to respond to a number of issues that were raised before the debate was interrupted. I think it is fair to say that the principal claim that was being made by the opposition went to the question of the integrity of forecasting and figures that might be provided by the Treasury. In particular, there was some discussion around the PEFO, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and I was able to indicate that those figures are independently verified and that they need to be signed off by the secretaries of the departments of Treasury and finance. In the context of that discussion, the member for North Sydney raised some concerns in relation to the other reports that might be required to be produced under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, in particular in relation to the budget economic and fiscal outlook and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The allegation was made that in some respects in the past there had been political interference by previous treasurers with those forecasts and figures. If I recall correctly, the member for North Sydney indicated that he had been there and that he spoke with some personal experience in relation to these matters.


In addressing those concerns, I make the following points. The first one is that each of the matters contained within the two reports that have been referred to—the budget and MYEFO—the forecasts upon which each of those reports is to be provided, are forecasts that are provided by the Treasury. The assumptions that underpin those reports are produced by the Treasury, but of course those reports are provided by the Treasurer.


In relation to those forecasts, it is worth making the point that these forecasts are the subject of considerable and very robust review, and there are a number of checks and balances that are in place and that have been in place for some time. In particular, the Treasury forecasts are informed by extensive and regular discussions with the Reserve Bank, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and also the ABS, through the Joint Economic Forecasting Group. In addition to JEFG, there is also the opportunity for the Senate estimates process to be used to test the assumptions and parameters outlined within the various reports. In addition, the Reserve Bank and others, in particular private institutions and market economists, will make their own forecasts from time to time and, in the context of the public debate around those forecasts and the scrutiny that will naturally be applied to the government's forecasts, there is a degree of accountability that occurs in that sense as well.


I think it is also worth making the point that the Parliamentary Budget Office will have direct access to the Treasury and finance departments, notwithstanding what has been said in this debate before. So, regardless of where those forecasts might be generated, there will be full, frank and free access, without any ministerial intervention or encumbrance, that will allow the PBO to contact and to test various forecasts and to raise concerns that they may have. That is something that is permitted within the regime that the government is supporting in the bill.


I think it is also worth making the point, in the interests of clarity, that the legislation does not in any way prevent the PBO from assessing, evaluating or analysing the economic forecasts. The PBO is free to do that, but what they are not free to do is to dedicate resources that would be allocated to them to the task of forecasting. There is a very good reason for that, and that is why the joint committee—which, I remind the House, handed down recommendations that were unanimous, including members from the opposition—made the point that this would be a very expensive exercise and one that would not be a very useful allocation of resources. The opposition referred to the Congressional Budget Office on a number of occasions. In doing so they should make the point that the annual budget of the Congressional Budget Office is $US50 million, considerably more than what is envisaged for the PBO, because it has different functions.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:37):  The parliamentary secretary has just confirmed everything that I said. He absolutely confirmed that in fact the PBO will be only able to use the fiscal and economic forecasts of the Treasury, unless it is in relation to the pre-election fiscal outlook, which is the only document under the Charter of Budget Honesty that is in fact signed off as the figures that actually belong to the Department of the Treasury and department of finance. Otherwise, the PBO is constrained to looking only at the government's figures; that is all. Then they had the audacity to claim that this was a recommendation in the report. I do not recall seeing it; in fact, I went back to the report.


There is no recommendation in the committee's report. The mandates of the PBO can only use information and reports published under the charter. There is one mention, which at 3.100 says:




…the PBO should not be required to produce its own fiscal forecasts. Rather, it should provide analysis of the Government
'
s fiscal forecasts…



Okay; fine. But that is actually not a recommendation, nor is it the case that it says it would not be able to produce its own fiscal forecasts. So, for example, let's take this, an issue that is highly contentious: what is the structural deficit? The Treasury does not do its own modelling on a structural deficit. It had a part of the budget papers that was allocated to a discussion of the structural deficit. This is an issue that is hugely contentious in relation to the fiscal outlook, and under the government's amendment the PBO would not be able to do any assessment of the structural deficit. How bizarre. It is not an independent body.


Secondly, it would not be able to use data provided by the Reserve Bank, nor would it be able to use data provided by ABARES. Under this situation, the government is saying, 'Look, there is only one set of data that can go into the PBO—that is, the government's data, the executive's data. All other information cannot go to the PBO because it cannot be challenged.' Frankly, if this is what the parliament thinks is an independent body, it is seriously kidding itself.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (15:39):  When we began debating this last week, I made the point that what the government is proposing for this Parliamentary Budget Office is something that is simply linked to the coattails of Treasury. That is totally and utterly unacceptable to the opposition for very good reasons, because the Treasury has become so politicised. I made the point that Treasury and the head of Treasury had been rewarded for things that they had done to assist the government.


I want to go specifically to some of what happened after the election when the Independents said that they wanted to have our costings analysed because we had said we did not want to politicise Treasury to look at them. We had them done independently, and then the Independents said that they would make up their decision about how good or bad we were on what Treasury had to say about those costings.


I want to go to some of them directly to say why we cannot have a Parliamentary Budget Office which is attached to a politicised Treasury. Let's look at the conservative bias allowance. First of all we said we would have a saving of $2.5 billion. Mr Henry said, 'No, you can't have that, actually. You can't be counted as having $2.5 billion,' because, in his words, 'it will not realise any actual budgetary savings if you cut back on the conservative bias allowance that is factored in to allow a little bit of a buffer in the way projections are made.' Yet at the same time in the 2009-10 budget, Mr Henry, himself responsible for that budget, in Budget Paper No. 1 had set out that the government was saving $4.6 billion 'by savings from the conservative bias allowance over the forward estimates'. He said, 'This results in a reduction of expenses of $1.5 billion in 2010-11, $1.5 billion in 2011-12 and $1.6 billion in 2012-13, totalling $4.6 billion.' Yet Mr Henry said to the Independents, who were making a judgment: 'They can't count $2.5 billion. That's part of the $11 billion so-called black hole.'


Then we go to cutting expenditure for the Health and Hospitals Fund—another interesting one. Here we said we were going to save $3.3 billion, and Mr Henry said to the Independents, 'They can't do that. They would have to identify before the election just what programs were going to be cut out of the three funds.' They were: the Health and Hospitals Fund, the Education and Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund. Then we said, 'But we asked you for that list of programs, Mr Henry, and you said you couldn't find one. It didn't exist.' Finally, in the middle of these protracted discussions for the benefit of the Independents to decide who they might back for government, he said, 'I've got a secret list. I've got it here, but guess what? I can't let you see it.' Isn't that amazing? 'I can't let you see it.' Did he ever give a reason for why this was a secret list, why it couldn't be made public or why it hadn't been able to be found before? Of course not. Of course Mr Henry should be rewarded. He did a wonderful job for the government.


Then we come to the NBN. Savings here were going to be $2.4 billion, and we were going to save that by not borrowing money on which we said the interest rate payable was 5.5 per cent. Mr Henry came to the rescue of the government again and said, 'You can't save that amount of money, because we say the interest rate will be 4.9 per cent.' He would not be moved. He said, 'I've made a decision, so that will be another $900 million to add to your black hole.'


I took the figures today for the average interest rate paid from July 2010 to today. Guess what it is? It is 5.23 per cent. So Mr Henry should be rewarded—4.9 per cent helped the government find an error in our costings of another $900 million.


Then we go on to employment participation where we said we will make savings in welfare payments of $600 million. 'Oh no,' Mr Henry said, 'you can't count that because that's a second-round figure.' But, heavens to Betsy, in the same budget this year we see that a second-round saving of $600 million on the so-called mining tax was allowed by Dr Henry. Dr Henry assisted the government to find another $600 million so-called error in our accounts. So Dr Henry should be rewarded with a $528,000 a year job in the Prime Minister's office. That is why it is politicised and that is why we cannot trust them. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (15:45):  My two colleagues have shown how the current process is devoid of integrity and credibility and has been grossly politicised. I experienced that firsthand after the last election. The parliamentary secretary opposite is yet to provide one decent argument on amendment (1). We will start with amendment (1); that is what we are debating at the moment, right? He has not provided one argument why the PBO and all the rest of us should be hogtied to the numbers, figures, forecasts and analysis of Treasury. Why should that be the case?


I will give you an example. Over the last four years we have been debating perhaps the biggest structural adjustment that will ever be considered by any of these parliamentary members: the imposition of a carbon tax and, subsequently, an emissions trading scheme. There has been endless modelling for four years of the impact of this, but not once has the model that has generated all of these numbers, all of these outcomes, all of this rhetoric and all of these forecasts by the government been revealed. They are all part of a black box in Treasury. We have asked endlessly to see the modelling; never have we seen one line of code from that modelling—not one assumption. We have deduced that one assumption built into the model is that there would be no unemployment by 2050. Surprise, surprise! When they got the outcome of the modelling there was no unemployment by 2050. If you put in that assumption, it is not a surprise.


What if you changed that one assumption and made it a floating variable in that model? What would be the outcome? What is the sensitivity to fixing that particular variable? We will never know. What would the Parliamentary Budget Office do if they were given that model? They would do some of that sensitivity analysis. We would be better informed; the public would be better informed; the nation would be better informed—especially when we are going it alone on this carbon tax. We are ahead of the world. No-one else is doing it. Yet we have been tied to this situation with Treasury. This is why we need credibility and integrity restored to the process. Treasury has been politicised in this whole exercise. We need the capacity for an independent body to analyse such critical matters as the modelling—the detailed, exhaustive, massive modelling—that has been undertaken.


We will get results this week again, but I can assure you they will just be outcomes. Out of this black box again will come a whole series of outcomes around which you will make the most ambitious statements. You will hold everyone hostage to this black box. Having come to government and said that transparency was at the heart of the way in which you would run government, since then we have had nothing but obfuscation, no benefit-cost analyses and a refusal to provide any of the analysis that sits behind all of this. No wonder we need to go to the next election and debate policy based on independently assessed analysis—not only our policies but the policies of the government. The policies of the government need to be scrutinised and analysed. They have not been, and that is why this process is heavily politicised. It is why you need integrity and credibility to be restored to this process.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (15:49):  I rise to endorse particularly the member for Goldstein's contribution. The parliamentary secretary is a trier—I will give him that—but quite clearly he has not addressed any of the issues which are raised in the debate we had the other evening. In fact, he has tried to divert the argument by suggesting that this was a recommendation made in a report of a parliamentary committee. We do not accept the parliamentary secretary's argument that, if a parliamentary committee finds that in some way, the parliament has to agree. These debates have no purpose at all, apparently, if a parliamentary committee comes up with a recommendation. I am not sure why we sit. We should just let committees sit and come up with their recommendations.


The amendment moved by the member for North Sydney is probably the most important amendment of the lot that we are moving because it is about having that contested advice. The parliamentary secretary's view is that you cannot question Treasury. If you go through the history of our government and now your government, the Treasury never gets the numbers right on its forecasts. That is not a criticism; that is just the truth. For instance, last year they forecast—




Mr Perrett:
  The GST they got right.




Mr BRIGGS:
  Right on cue, the member for Moreton. No, they did not, member for Morton. The numbers changed—of course they did, because they are estimates, based on models. As the member for Goldstein rightly pointed out, they put numbers into a model and it spits out other numbers. The assumptions changed and the realistic outcomes changed. The point is we should have contestable advice from an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. If you want to take away the politics of the costings in an election campaign, which is what the member for Lyne talks about doing, and have a genuine assessment, you should have a genuine independent body.


One of the reasons the parliamentary secretary gave that we cannot go down the route of the Congressional Budget Office was that the funding for the Congressional Budget Office was $50 million a year. Of course, the United States is a slightly bigger country than Australia, Parliamentary Secretary, so it is little surprise that it would have a larger budget office. But quite clearly there is a need for additional powers for the Parliamentary Budget Office so that they can make their own assumptions and arrive at their own numbers based on an analysis of the information that comes before us. The ideas contained in the arguments that the member for Goldstein and the member for Mackellar have just put forward would reduce the unhappiness of an opposition—and, if you think that this is the first opposition to be unhappy with costings during an election campaign, you have not been around for very long. The same problems have arisen in election after election, and it is the very reason that we need and want a genuinely independent parliamentary budget office. The reason you do not want to go down this road is the short-term politics of today. That position is ill thought through, because in the long term it will have consequences for the effective operation of what should be a genuinely good development in Australian public policy.


This is a smart amendment. It addresses genuine concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the numbers, the independence of the decisions and the release of the information. It should be supported, and if you are serious about doing this, Parliamentary Secretary, you will take on board and answer some of the genuine questions that have been raised rather than try to cover them over with half-truths, as you have so far. This is an important debate and you should take it seriously.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:53):  I again commend this amendment to the government. We were all feeling a bit awkward while we sat here watching the parliamentary secretary last Thursday as very legitimate and considered questions about how the PBO would operate were being asked of him, and clearly his briefing had not extended to his being able to answer them. The shadow Treasurer and others sought to highlight that, by handcuffing the Parliamentary Budget Office to the Treasury numbers and then to the Treasurer's numbers—which was a very salient point raised by the shadow Treasurer—you are effectively undermining the whole point of the PBO. You are effectively saying, 'Be free to inquire and be free to add to the better governance of Australia, but we are going to nobble you so you can't drift too far away from what the Treasurer would like to assert is the only set of numbers that anyone should be taking any notice of.' This amendment is trying to inoculate against this situation, whereby the Parliamentary Budget Office—who, like the new kids on the block, cannot be left to their own professional competence to find the analytical basis best suited to the task being asked of them and must instead take the gospel according to the Treasurer—effectively become the apprentices of Treasury.


The only opportunity for the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at the numbers before the Treasurer puts his fingerprints all over them would be after the calling of an election. But they are the Treasurer's numbers up until that point and—given whatever mystery and nuancing has gone on to get them to the point—if we were to remain able to rely only upon Treasury numbers in the election context, I explained to the parliamentary secretary at the table how the situation would play out, since he could not answer my concerns himself. If the opposition announced a policy and then said, 'Here are the costings behind them', the first thing you would hear from the Treasurer would be 'No—those numbers are out of date', and the government would make up some mystery black hole and base an argument on it. They would do that because, prior to the election period, there could be some interaction between opposition members and the Parliamentary Budget Office, but it could only be on the basis of the Treasurer's numbers. Getting those numbers revised and updated on the basis of Treasury numbers could only happen in the election context, and in the election context all that material is publicised the moment that the work is concluded. There is no opportunity for the opposition to consider the data generated by the PBO. There is no chance to reflect on our own policy commitments and on the calibration of those policies on the basis of the most up-to-date information provided by Treasury, because as soon as that information becomes available we are in the election context, and it all gets thrown up in the air to allow the government to make all sorts of claims and allegations, even though the opposition may not even have a simple view on the question that it was getting tested and costed and analysed through the PBO. We may not even have a chance to reflect on it before the government makes all sorts of claims about what the data means, and that is an important point.


I have often spent considerable time trying to urge the Independents to do things, though I must admit that my track record is not great. Still, gentleman, I will persevere. The point here is that the numbers that now form the foundation of considerations are the Treasurer's numbers; Treasury's numbers form the foundation of considerations only during the election period. According to the way that this bill has been constructed, all those numbers will be thrown up in the air for the world to see during an election period. Where is the opportunity for sober and careful consideration of numbers by the opposition or any Independent members before the government sets its enormous resources to the task misrepresenting what we may be contemplating? I urge the Independents to agree that, under this bill, the PBO is not an independent costing organisation but a nobbled Parliamentary Budget Office.



As I said last Thursday, PBO could stand for 'pretty bleeding obvious'. The government is trying through this bill to nobble the PBO so it becomes yet another arm of government, not a body that can independently contribute to the good governance of the country. The government is trying to nobble the resources of the PBO and the basis from which it can start. The PBO's analysis will be throw out into the public domain during elections, because that is the only time that Treasury numbers are used. Why can't other numbers be used? Why can't the Reserve Bank's forecast, which many in the economy think are very reliable, be used? Why can't the Canadian model, by which a range of independent sources can arrive at their own numbers, be used? Why can't the PBO be treated as an adult and satisfy itself that maybe the Treasurer's numbers are a good starting point— (Time expired)

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (15:59):  I commend the amendments. Although the funding was allocated in this year's budget for a PBO, we are now almost three months down the road in the financial year and only now beginning to debate the policy in earnest. It will be astonishing if the PBO is up and running by the end of this year.


Almost everything the government touches ends up turning sour. The only reason we are debating the bill this week is that the coalition has introduced its own PBO legislation. We on this side of the House believe that the government's bill is deeply flawed, and that is why we are pushing for a number of amendments. On this point it is worth examining the differences between the two pieces of legislation and, in order to do so, we need to reflect on the motivation for creating a PBO in the first place. The PBO is a necessary reform to ensure transparency and integrity of budgetary and fiscal processes. In short, it levels up the playing field between government and non-government members by giving them equal ability to scrutinise government policy and to evaluate their own policies. If it is to be anything more than a paper tiger, the PBO needs the power to obtain relevant information from government departments; it needs the flexibility to perform whatever analysis it sees fit; and, most importantly, it needs to provide a level of discretion to allow members and senators to retain control of their own policy. It is there, at the first hurdle, that the government's policy falls down. Under the government's proposal, the PBO is unable to prepare economic forecasts or budget estimates. Why and how is the PBO supposed to prepare accurate analysis of the budgetary impacts of policy over the longer term?


This bill also restricts the PBO from using any economic data prepared by a third party in its determinations, as mentioned by the member for North Sydney earlier. Data from the Reserve Bank and ABARES could not be used in a determination. Instead it can only rely on information provided by the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Again, why? What is the purpose of limiting the scope of the PBO's research to such an extreme degree? How can the PBO be expected to fulfil its full mandate with one arm tied behind its back?


Unfortunately, the problems do not end there. The government's bill severely restricts the PBO's powers to gather information by requiring it to enter into an agreement with the relevant departments to determine what information they can get and when they can get it. The PBO will have nothing to trade with during the negotiation of these agreements, so it stands to reason that any agreement entered into by the government departments will be heavily biased in favour of the departments in question rather than the PBO. In short, what we are looking at here is a Clayton's PBO: it is the PBO you have when you do not have a PBO.


The coalition's policy does not contain any of these rather obvious shortcomings. Instead the PBO, as envisaged by us, will have considerable powers to obtain information from government departments. These powers will be based more on the powers of the Auditor-General and will ensure the PBO is a much more effective body than the diluted version being offered by those opposite.


Of course, one of the most significant functions of the PBO will be to prepare costings, yet even here the government's bill has some rather strange provisions. For instance, during caretaker periods the costings facilities available to members and senators is different from those available at other times. Indeed, during election campaigns the costings functions provided by the PBO would be identical to those already provided to the opposition under the existing Charter of Budget Honesty. So, again, I find myself asking why. What is the reason for this differentiation and what is the point of this duplication?


The Charter of Budget Honesty was a groundbreaking reform, but unfortunately the costings process provided under the charter are not confidential. In fact, they are exactly the opposite. As it stands, not only are requests for costings immediately published on the website of both Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation but also the results of the said costings are made available in the same way. Perhaps this is a belated attempt from the Prime Minister to live up to her promise last year to draw the curtains back and let the sun shine in. But perhaps not. 


In conclusion I believe the government's bill is deeply flawed. The bill provides the PBO with insufficient power to gather the information it needs to do the job, it makes insufficient provisions for discretion and it is structured in such a way that it protects the interests of the government of the day rather than the interests of budgetary transparency and its fiscal integrity.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-09-19,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:04):  I want to speak very briefly to put on the record my condemnation of the opposition's accusation that the Treasury is heavily politicised. That is a most serious accusation, particularly as it comes from the alternative government of this country. It is the case that in times past there has been some politicisation within the Public Service. At the time I was very outspoken about the practice by the then Prime Minister John Howard to personally vet all SES appointments in his own office. I do not think that is the way we should be appointing our senior public servants. But those times are behind us now, thankfully, and it is my observation that we have the world's finest Public Service. It is to the great credit of the Public Service that the country ran so well during those weeks of uncertainty following last year's election result. There are very few countries in the world where the country can be administered so confidently as Australia. I put on the record my praise for the Australian Public Service and my concern that we should be having a discussion about the degree to which the Treasury, of all departments, would be politicised.


I support the government's Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill; I do not support the opposition's amendment. Not only is it important to have scrutiny of election promises but also it is important to have transparency; hence, I think it most important that in the period of the election campaign itself there should be some visibility of what has been costed. If the opposition or the crossbenchers want to have any policy examined privately, that can be done before the election is called, but once we are in the election period itself the whole purpose of the PBO is to shine a light on those costings. Frankly, I personally found the work that was done costing the opposition's policies in the immediate aftermath of last year's federal election very important. The fact that the opposition's policies were found to have a black hole of between $7 billion and $11 billion was not the reason for my decision to put support of supply and confidence behind the government, but it was not lost on me that that was in the mix, particularly at a time when I was very generously being offered $1 billion towards a new hospital in my seat of Denison. It was a time when I could not have confidence that the money was in fact there, given that the opposition had a black hole of between $7 billion and $11 billion. 


In essence, I do not support the opposition's amendment. I think the government's model is sound because it does bring scrutiny and transparency. I applaud the government for again staying true to its commitment to the crossbenchers and to me personally, as contained in our written agreement.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:07):  Firstly, I have been advised—and it was a matter that was raised, I think, by the Treasurer, the member for Lyne and others—that the model that they chose is based far more on the Canadian parliamentary budget office than on the US Congressional Budget Office. We were told that the Canadian budget office does not do analyses or—for the benefit of the member for Denison—provide transparency in regard to critical analysis, like four years of modelling of the biggest decision all of us will ever take, where we cannot analyse or look at one single variable out of hundreds of variables that are put into that modelling. Transparency is what we are talking about, not politics. This thing is dripping with politics.


Now we find that as of the middle of this year the Canadian budget office, in contrast to its previous practice of preparing fiscal projections using government numbers, is basing its fiscal outlook on its own economic projections. Answer that, Parliamentary Secretary—sorry, I forgot your office. Parliamentary Secretary, you might be able to answer that question. I will read from the latest PBO economic and fiscal outlook. This is the PBO of Canada. You might listen to this if you want to talk about transparency. This is a report by the Canadian PBO:


To enhance PBO's independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends in the national economy and given the downside risks to the average private sector outlook, PBO is providing—for the first time—its own medium‐term economic outlook … PBO's economic outlook incorporates its judgement of the balance of risks and as a result it can be viewed as a 'balanced' projection, which means that higher or lower outcomes are equally likely.


In other words, in Canada, for the first time, they have an independent body which can in fact do its own analysis and give its own sensitivity of the government projections to changes in all sorts of variables. It seems an unremarkable thing that this should happen. It would seem to be a great strength for this parliament to have access to an independent body that can give some sensitivity analysis in regard to key analysis provided by Treasury. That does not mean Treasury is wrong; it just means that we have a far more substantial debate and that we have, in fact, an ability to test the projections and not sit here and be fed, like mushrooms, in the dark. We need this sort of analysis. This is what my colleague and friend the member for North Sydney has put forward. He has put forward this analysis and this request that we as an opposition be able to get the benefit of an independent analysis. I would suggest that the government at times would also benefit from an alternative point of view.


Secondly, on the question of the secretary and the Treasury, with great respect to the member for Denison, he did not spend 3½ hours in detailed debate with senior Treasury officers following the election and he did not witness, as my colleague the member for Mackellar has started to articulate, the type of discussion and obstinacy that was provided. There were many examples which we have documented previously, which are a matter of public record and which have again been repeated—some of them today in this House—where we were simply told, 'We have made a decision,' every time we got to a point where they could not argue against what we were saying, such as with the 5.5 per cent bond rate. We had canvassed around the community, with all the leaders of the finance market, what would be a sensible bond rate. Why would we, for the sake of a few dollars, try to obfuscate and cover up?

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:12):  As we consider the amendment before us at this consideration in detail stage, what we are doing is asking ourselves the question: which of the two alternative models put forward, one by the member for North Sydney and one by the government, better gives effect to the policy objective that, we are all agreed, makes sense—a policy objective in which resources are available to the parliament, the legislative branch of government, to assist it in having available to it alternative expert advice on economic, financial and budgetary matters? It is a question of which scheme—which mechanism; which process—is best going to give effect to the principle upon which we are all in agreement.


Against that backdrop, there is a pretty clear contrast between the two alternative frameworks which have been put forward. The government's framework, laid out in proposed section 64E(2) and (3), specifically bars the Parliamentary Budget Office from carrying out certain functions such as preparing budget estimates. It also specifically constrains the Parliamentary Budget Office to use forecasts, parameters and fiscal estimates released by the Treasurer. By contrast, the scheme put forward by the member for North Sydney in his excellent amendment is a scheme under which the Parliamentary Budget Office has a maximum degree of discretion in performing its functions. In the words of the amendment, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is given the discretion to 'prepare, or have regard to, either or both of economic forecasts or budget estimates'. In other words, it is a provision which grants the maximum extent of discretion to the Parliamentary Budget Officer so that he or she is best placed to discharge the functions which this legislation is imposing upon him or her—namely, the function of being a provider of independent expert advice to the legislative branch of government.


When the policy suggestion was put forward by the coalition, and subsequently taken up in the negotiations between the Independents and the government, the underlying logic was to establish an independent body, an independent office which would provide a source of independent advice. There is no notion of being critical of the existing departments of state. There is no notion of saying that they are in some way inherently flawed in what they do, but there is a mature recognition that executive government will often have a different set of interests from the parliament, from the legislative branch. There is also a mature recognition that it makes sense to better inform the parliament to provide a source of specialist expertise to the parliament to allow it to discharge its weighty responsibilities.


If a consequence of these new arrangements is that there is a battle of ideas, that there is contestability in policy, that is no bad thing; indeed we on this side of the House say that is a good thing. But the one thing we say very specifically and very precisely about the two alternative schemes that are before the House this afternoon is that we are deeply suspicious of the bona fides of the government in putting forward the particular scheme it has, because we do not believe that the restrictions on the Parliamentary Budget Office contained in proposed section 64E(2) or the constraints on the sources to which it may have regard contained in 64E(3) adequately and sensibly give effect to the policy objective which all of us share in this debate, which is a Parliamentary Budget Office best able to provide independent advice to the parliament about these complex and important matters. It is on that basis that I believe the amendment put forward by the member for North Sydney ought to be supported this afternoon.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:17):  In order to assist the Independents with their judgment I want to provide three real-world examples of why there is a need for contestability, as has been set out by the member for North Sydney. Let me begin with three examples from my own portfolio in recent years. Firstly, under the Home Insulation Program, we were given a set of estimates by the government which were rock solid and ironclad and which we were to accept as Holy Writ.


It is known by all members of this House that virtually none of those estimates came to pass. They did not come to pass in terms of their costs, their safety assessments, the rate of installation or, indeed, the emissions reduction. We were told that $2.45 billion had been set aside under the Home Insulation Program to achieve installation in just over 2.7 million homes around Australia. Unfortunately, only one million homes, less than 40 per cent of the government figures, were ever installed with insulation. Almost a billion dollars had to be set aside in provisioning for repair and maintenance and restoration. The rate of emissions reduction was one-third of that given by government agencies, and obviously endorsed by Treasury, as Holy Writ. We were derided for contesting those figures, yet we were correct and the government agencies were incorrect, I am sorry to say.


I do not blame the government agencies. They were forced to act against a set of parameters imposed upon them by the executive government. It is important to understand that executive government can, but it should not, under this current government impose parameters on the bureaucracy and administration. That has distorted the way in which that bureaucracy and administration produces its figures.


Contrary to what the member for Denison says, we are not asserting that this is a bad bureaucracy. We are asserting that there probably has never been any greater interference in the operations of the bureaucracy in Australia's history. For us, then, to have to rely upon the figures which come from that process is utterly unacceptable. There must be contestability. Perhaps we could have avoided a tragedy such as the Home Insulation Program, let alone the waste and the extraordinary impact on so many small businesses. Contestability in public figures would have assisted throughout the Home Insulation Program. That is not provided for under this bill but it is provided for under the alternative model that the member for North Sydney has set out.


I also want to give two current examples before the parliament under the existing carbon tax modelling provided by the government—again I say 'the government'. There is an assumption in the modelling that the United States will have an effective carbon tax—a cap-in-trade system, in their words—up and running on a full national basis by 2016. That is simply fallacious. It is a fantasy that the United States under any foreseeable political structure will have a fully functioning carbon tax or cap-in-trade scheme. That has a huge impact on the global assumptions and, therefore, the entire base for the Treasury modelling. That is not the fault of Treasury. It is the fault of a government that imposes a straitjacket on the bureaucracy, that reaches into its operation and distorts the way Treasury works and distorts the figures. For that, we say, there must be contestability. A similar thing is that there is a change in the assumption of elasticity regarding the sensitivity of the population to changes in electricity prices and demand. There is no basis for this. There is no explanation for this. It does not sit with Australian economic history. It does not sit with the work of the New South Wales independent regulator. Again, none of this is contestable under the model which is currently proposed. 


These are real-world examples. There is the home insulation program. There is the fact that the United States, in no foreseeable future, will have a fully functioning cap-and-trade system by 2060. And there has been a complete rewriting of economic history regarding the sensitivity of people to changes in electricity pricing. That is why the amendment should be supported and there should be contestability in figures. (Time expired)

We are building a service for this House. We are not building a service for the executive.

Mr Briggs:
  Stop verballing people, Rob.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I am not verballing anyone. The big question that I wanted cleared up at the end of the last debate was: can any member of this chamber, including the member for Mayo, confidentially ring the Parliamentary Budget Office and ask for work to be done on any topic of their choice? The answer is yes.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  You can have another go, all of you. I am happy if you have information that proves this wrong. The question then is: does the Parliamentary Budget Office, whoever the independent CEO is, have rights of confidential access into Treasury? The answer is yes. 


The member for North Sydney shakes his head. I ask him, please, to get up and tell me his views on why that advice is wrong. Let's get to the heart of whether a confidential process, as a service for members of parliament in this chamber, with nothing to do with the Treasurer and nothing to do with the executive, actually applies. The only point in all of that is whether the Treasurer signs off on a budget or not. It is illogical if we, as a chamber, are asking for a Treasurer not to sign off on the budget. If we accept that then we accept that the figures that are used from the Treasury as the starting point for the process of PEFO, and other similar documents as part of the Charter of Budget Honesty, already apply. What seems to be in place is a direct attack on the independence of the Treasury. I have heard that from speakers twice now.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  It is not independent.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  The member for Mackellar confirms that. The shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance sit either side of the member for Mackellar as she directly attacks the independence of the Treasury.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Correct.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  She again confirms it: 'Correct.' We have silence from the two key finance officers of the coalition. This is a direct attack on the independence of the Treasury. If that is the case—if that is the point of your position in this debate—why on earth did you waste this parliament's time in the last 12 months by participating in a process that arrived at unanimous recommendations? That process involved Barnaby Joyce, Chris Pyne and Kelly O'Dwyer. Why on earth did you waste 16 days after the election reaching an agreement over these proposals for a better parliament? Please explain your position as to why you consider this is not confidential and why it is not independent.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:27):  To help the member for Lyne, who seems to pride himself on understanding how legislation works, I refer him to proposed section 64E of the bill before the House:


(2) The Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions under subsection (1) do not include:


(a) preparing economic forecasts; or


(b) preparing budget estimates (whether at the whole-of-government, agency or program level.




Mr Oakeshott interjecting—





Mr HOCKEY:
  Just listen. I know this is hard to get through, but give it a shot. And 64E(3) says:


(3) In performing his or her functions under subsection (1), the Parliamentary Budget Officer must use the economic forecasts and parameters and fiscal estimates contained in the most recent relevant reports released under Parts 5, 6 and 7 of Schedule 1 to the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998.


The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998—




Mr Oakeshott:
  You still haven't answered it.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Hang on. I know it is hard to listen because you have signed up to the other mob, but just for one brief moment put the parliament ahead of your own sectoral interests. I say to the member for Lyne that part 5 refers to annual government reporting. Then at (1) of 13 it says:




Commonwealth bodies to provide information to help prepare report



(1) To help the Treasurer to prepare a budget economic and fiscal outlook report, the Treasurer may request a Commonwealth body to provide information.


That means these are the Treasurer's numbers. They are not the Treasury's numbers, they are the Treasurer's numbers—and you do not understand that.




Mr Oakeshott:
  You haven't proved a thing.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Okay, fine. Vote with the government against this amendment and defang the Parliamentary Budget Office. We have given you a chance. We have given the member for Lyne a chance to have a truly independent parliamentary budget office. If the member for Lyne does not want it, okay, fine, no problems. Go with a weaker parliamentary budget office and live with the consequences, if you are there at the next parliament.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:30):  I rise to support the member for North Sydney's amendments to the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. We start from the position that the Parliamentary Budget Office is a net positive and it is not new. An OECD survey found that another 18 countries have some sort of legislative parliamentary involvement in setting the fiscal situation with a PBO. The United States has a $45 million per annum budget for its Parliamentary Budget Office. The Dutch Parliamentary Budget Office has more than 150 staff and we have heard about the Canadian budget office. Indeed, this is our idea and ever since 2007 the coalition has driven the idea of a parliamentary budget office. That is why the shadow Treasurer has before the parliament his own bill. It is because those opposite have such a poor record with costing and releasing their policies that we need a parliamentary budget office.



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  You will remember that in 2007 you released your costings the day before the election. In 2010 you released your costings the day before the election.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! I would remind the member for Kooyong not to refer in your speech to 'you'. You are referring to me in this occupied chair, the Deputy Speaker. You will refer to the government or the opposition, please.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  I was simply making the point that when—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You will refer your comments through the chair not at the chair.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point is that those opposite have a very poor record when it comes to releasing and costing their policies. What happened in 2007 and at the election in 2010 bears that out. The Parliamentary Budget Office amendment we are moving will bring greater transparency to the fiscal situation and fiscal process. It will ensure that non-government MPs and senators and parties have access to the proper costings and it mitigates the disadvantage that those in opposition have against a better resourced government.


We only have to look at what happened with our costings before the last election, when we were looking at the interest to be saved from not proceeding with the NBN. We used the Commonwealth bond rate as the discount rate. It was the NBN implementation study which showed that you should have used the Commonwealth bond rate to assess the amount of savings that you would have if you did not proceed with the NBN, and you would not have that information released.


There are three key criteria that our amendments to this bill are pushing. Firstly, there is confidentiality. Requests to have policies costed should not be immediately put up on the website when they are received. The timing of release of those costings should not be immediately put up on the website and made public once they are done. It should be up to those who are seeking those costings to assess the timing of that release—whether they want to resubmit a request for costing or whether they want to change the assumptions they are putting forward for their particular policy or whether they want to discuss and alter those particular assumptions.


Secondly, there need to be fewer restrictions on the PBO's ability to source material to make its analysis. As the member for North Sydney said: why cannot ABARE, why cannot the Reserve Bank of Australia be able to provide information to the Parliamentary Budget Office for them to make their analysis? Why restrict it to those reports under the Charter of Budget Honesty? That will very much limit the quality of the analysis that is done.


Thirdly, we must increase the powers of the PBO to get information from other departments. Currently, under the government's bill, it is about an MOU. It is just about an MOU with departments but not giving the PBO the ability to compel those departments to release that information. That is why the member for North Sydney has very appropriately suggested that he should use powers akin to those of the Auditor-General in order to source that material from other departments.


The Independents have a privileged position at the moment. They, particularly the Greens, are getting assistance from the government. But that will not always be the case. They need to get behind these amendments we are moving because they are right for the parliament and right for the budget office. (Time expired)

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (16:35):  In order to assist the process, the member for Lyne was asking for a very specific piece of information. I think he was contesting the assertion of the opposition on confidentiality, to which he placed considerable weight, so that members could seek, with confidence, confidential advice and have some interaction. We were highlighting how that is compromised and he was contesting that, if that is a fair characterisation. I draw his attention to proposed section 64L of the bill and I will read it. This is under the heading 'Caretaker period policy costing requests made before polling day—public release of requests and costings.' It says:


This section applies in relation to a policy costing request that is made under subsection 64J(2) or (5) before polling day during the caretaker period for a general election.


It goes on to say:


As soon as practicable after the request has been made and before polling day, the Parliamentary Budget Officer must publicly release the request and a costing of the policy.


That is the practical black-and-white provision to which we were referring and I hope that is helpful. I was seeking to illuminate the parliament—and it is perhaps not as helpful as I might hope it would be and, dare I say it, the Member for Lyne, I have been there before, but I will persevere—and I hope that is helpful. 


The point I was making and that the shadow Treasurer has made is that, up until the caretaker period, the base against which costings are provided is provided by the Treasurer. The Treasurer owns that costing basis. He can do whatever fiscal magic and wisdom he feels is appropriate to release his figures. The point I was trying to emphasise—and perhaps I did not do it well, and I stand admonished for that—is the only time the Treasury has undiluted, unadulterated data during the entire period between elections available is from the PEFO, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. That is the only time, Member for Lyne, that the dataset upon which you are placing such great weight is actually the Treasury's dataset. The rest of the time under those other economic and forecasting bases it is the Treasurer. So if the member for Lyne places such an enormous weight and respect, as I do, on Treasury, let Treasury be heard. That is really what the opposition is on about.


But what we are also saying is if you are only interested—sorry, not you, Madam Deputy Speaker.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Yes, I was going to say to everybody that perhaps if he keeps—




Mr BILLSON:
  I have been pretty good up to that point.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, everybody has been pretty bad. I may enter the debate, seeing as I sat on the inquiry, but I won't be that cheeky. The member for Dunkley has the call.




Mr BILLSON:
  I hope the clerks take that 15 seconds off your time and not mine, Madam Deputy Speaker. The point I was trying to make to the member for Lyne is that if the Treasury figures are to be allowed to be used, let them be used, not the Treasurer's figures. The only time in which the Treasury's figures are used are during the caretaker period. So any effort by anyone in this chamber to rely upon Treasury's figures only happens during the caretaker period where there is this obligation under 64L to release all the material. There is no opportunity to go back on the basis of the analysis that is provided to recalibrate, to contemplate whether it is worth 'moving forward', dare I use a phrase, on the material that is provided—none whatsoever.


So if he is fair dinkum about Treasury, let them be heard. But if he is also only wanting to hear one tune—that we have all got to be on exactly the same tune in this nation's parliament—then persist with his point of view. If he would like to hear other voices, other options, other analysis to make sure there is rigour and robustness to this work, he must support the opposition's amendments, because there is a range of other analysis available that will strengthen the quality of governance in this country, and not have the parliament handcuffed to whatever the Treasurer thinks is advantageous from his political perspective.


We are on about good governance in this country; not what is good for the government. He has been hoodwinked into being locked into this 'PBO Lite' that relies upon the magic of the Treasurer doing whatever he likes with material that Treasury might produce, to have that as the starting point, to say, 'No other voice interests us; no other basis of analysis has any value whatsoever.' I get a bit sick of hearing unctuousness about public servants. We respect public servants, but when they get rolled out and manipulated by a dodgy, poor government, that is a problem for everybody. My last point is: what about the Parliamentary Budget Officer? Is he or she not deserving of the respect to go and source advice where he or she sees fit? I have respect for that position as well, not just some that are chosen to be favoured. (Time expired)

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2011-09-19,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:41):  To try and settle this debate, I have seven questions that I would like to put to the parliamentary secretary. My understanding of the answers to those questions is yes, but if there is any doubt about any of these, it is good for them to be on the record and for us as a parliament to then work them through. 


The first is: does the PBO under this legislation have full and unfettered access to the departments of Treasury and finance? I hope the answer is yes.


The second is: is this access direct—that it does not depend on any minister's office and it will not go through any minister's office? My understanding of that is yes, but I need to hear from the parliamentary secretary if otherwise.


Third: does this allow, therefore, the PBO to question, critique, test any of the forecasts of the budget or of the government more generally? My understanding is yes, but please answer otherwise if it is incorrect.


Fourth: is this direct access unencumbered by any ministerial oversight, providing another critical check and balance for this parliament? My understanding is yes.


Fifth: under these arrangements would it quickly become obvious, as was a point made by the member for North Sydney last week, if there were any fudging of the figures along the lines that were implied last week? My understanding is the PBO would actually add to this parliament and a shadow Treasurer's ability to pick up whether the Treasurer was fudging anything that the Treasury was actually doing.


Sixth: can the PBO inform their analysis by drawing on other sources of information such as the RBA, the IMF, the OECD, whatever? My understanding is yes.


Finally: is the use of forecasts and estimates prepared by Treasury and Finance about providing a more sensible basis for comparison of policy costings, reducing an expensive and unnecessary duplication of effort? Anyone in business understands double-handling is bad. We have got to have a common set of rules from somewhere. I would have thought an undisputed independent Treasury was the place for macroforecasting to be done, and then the politics can go its hardest on the back of that. Can you answer those seven questions to assist the debate?

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:43):  The answer to those questions is yes. In relation to the first one, the PBO does have full and unfettered access to the Department of the Treasury. In relation to whether that access is direct or not, that is correct. In relation to whether or not the PBO has the ability to test that advice, there is nothing in the act to preclude them from being able to test that advice. In relation to whether or not there is the ability for that to occur unencumbered by ministerial interference, the answer to that is yes. In relation to whether or not it would become obvious if there were any fudging, for the reasons I set out earlier in terms of the robust processes that exist to test these forecasts, the answer to that would be yes as well. In relation to whether or not the PBO can inform their analysis by drawing upon forecasts from others, certainly that is an option that is available to them, with exception of course being in relation to the basis upon which costings are to be formed. When it comes to the question of the preparation of costings in relation to particular proposals, that is to be based upon the forecasts that are to be obtained from Treasury.


That goes to the final question that the member for Lyne has asked in relation to a more sensible basis for comparison. That is the very heart of this debate. We need to ensure that, when the public is being given the opportunity to compare one particular set of election commitments with another, they are able to compare apples with apples. It is important that the set of forecasts upon which those costings are to be made is a comparable set of forecasts. That is the key consideration in this whole debate. So the answer to that question of course is yes.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Mayo is warned!




Mr BRADBURY:
  That is why the elements that have been set out in the bill and debated and supported by the government go to the very heart of making sure that there is some integrity in the process.


I do not want to speak at great length, but I will make the point that, if this bill is passed and becomes legislation, for the first time oppositions will have the opportunity to test polices and cost those policies on an ongoing and iterative basis. That is something that is not currently available. That will be a major advancement in allowing a more level playing field when it comes to costing policies, particularly throughout the non-election period, and that will assist oppositions in a way that they do not currently have assistance under the Charter of Budget Honesty.


In relation to the importance of that point and the question that goes to this amendment regarding forecasts, I simply make the point that it is essential that, when the public is being given an opportunity to test the value of the proposals that have been put forward by the respective parties, they can have some confidence that the parameters and the forecasts upon which those costings have been based are comparable. If that were not the case, that would lead to a very destructive and very wasteful discussion, particularly in the course of election campaigns, around parameters and assumptions rather than where that debate should be focused, which is on the question of the actual costs of the proposals that have been put forward by the respective parties, so that the electors, the people of Australia, can go to that election in full confidence that the policies of the respective parties have been properly and comparably costed so that they can make their judgments. It is on that basis that we are opposed to the amendment that the member for North Sydney has brought forward.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:47):  I rise in support of the amendment brought forward by the shadow Treasurer to strengthen the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Office. We on this side of the chamber are the only people interested in a rigorous analysis on the economic and fiscal impacts of policy proposals, which is why we brought forward our very own bill. Let us not forget that it was actually this side of the chamber that brought forward, before the last election, a policy to initiate a parliamentary budget office. That is why we are having this debate in the chamber today—not because of any agreement with the Independents but because the coalition brought forward this policy before the last election.


This has not been a longstanding commitment of the government. They rushed in legislation in response to our policy proposal, and their legislation is deficient. That is why the shadow Treasurer has needed to bring forward an amendment, which he has done so very ably. What he has brought forward is an amendment to make sure that the Parliamentary Budget Office, when it is brought into effect, will be an independent parliamentary budget office, that it will not be unduly restricted in what it can look at and what it can do in the performance of its role and function. Critical to that, of course, is the fact that it should be able to have regard to its own ability to perform economic forecasts and budget estimates. It can of course have regard to Treasury's economic forecasts and budget estimates, but it also should be able to initiate its own if in fact it believes it is required.


The government's bill restricts the ability of the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at only Treasury and Finance figures, and this of course goes to the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its own functions. We believe that this will, unfortunately, make a of the eunuch parliamentary budget office. Unlike the US Congressional Budget Office or the Canadian Parliamentary Office, it will be a parliamentary budget office which is a parliamentary budget office in name only.


I was on the joint committee that recommended that a parliamentary budget office be initiated. I, along with the Independents, agreed that we needed to have a parliamentary budget office that had the power to gather information, a parliamentary budget office that would be independent and would not be unduly restricted. Unfortunately, though, I think the bill before us today will in fact restrict the ability of the Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its role and function, which is why we have needed to bring forward the amendment that we have.


I notice that the government has not been able to respond to the amendment that has been brought forward. It has not been able to provide one sensible reason as to why it cannot accept the amendment. Instead, I notice that, on the weekend, the Treasurer put out a media release that attacked our amendment by saying that it went to our economic competence. It said, in fact, that we were economically incompetent. That is a little bit like Silvio Berlusconi giving a critique on the virtues of celibacy. It is a little bit like the member for Dobell telling us about the importance of good governance and financial accounting.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Higgins is straying.




Ms O'DWYER:
  It is not something that is remotely credible for the government to say. We believe, as I have just said—and which has been said by all of my colleagues—that a transparent, independent budget office that is not restricted in the performance of its role and function is the most critical thing that we can achieve here today. If we get this wrong today, we will be getting it wrong for the future. That is why it is so critical that the government actually answer the question that has been brought forward by the amendments that the shadow Treasurer has put on the table today. They cannot provide one reason why we should not be able to accept the amendments brought forward by the shadow Treasurer. I think they should simply accept that our amendments will improve their bill, and they should support them.

My second question is: why won't you now support an initiative which the opposition supported unanimously in committee—did someone belatedly realise that there had been an inadvertent episode of being constructive? My third question is: why all the focus in here this afternoon on the need for confidentiality during an election campaign, when, if the opposition stopped saying no to everything and instead did some good policy development work now, they could get everything they want costed in confidence before the next election campaign?

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:54):  In answer to question 1: no. In relation to question 2: you clearly have not even read the report that has come before this parliament on this bill, because in fact the specific amendment I am moving at the moment is not even a recommendation in the report.




Mr Bradbury:
  It is dealt with under the report.




Mr HOCKEY:
  It is not a recommendation of the report. Have you read the report? I would urge you to read the report that you are referring to. In response to the third question, relating to constructive analysis: we have not said that we will not reveal all of our costings before the next election. We have said we will but we are not going to submit our costings to a parliamentary budget office or a Treasury that is an arm of the government and is using government data. Full stop.


If the member for Denison had looked at all the other amendments when I endeavoured to engage in conversation about this bill, he would see that in fact what we are doing through these amendments is making the PBO more independent and more accountable to the parliament. That is why I said this is the chance; there may not be a second chance in the next parliament. And I would say to the member for Denison: look carefully at our amendments, have a good think about them and ask yourself whether these would enhance the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office and not reduce it.


I do not understand why the Independents—and I say this very genuinely—are so hogtied to the government on this bill. It is not a bill that goes to good government; it is a bill that goes to the integrity of the parliament and to the independence of the chamber. We were the ones who initiated a parliamentary budget office policy. Malcolm Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition did that, and it was carried on by the current Leader of the Opposition. We went to the last election promising to introduce a parliamentary budget office. Senator Guy Barnett in the other place had worked on this initiative for an extended period of time. This is not anything new. We are the ones who actually put forward the initiative. We were the ones who introduced a bill.




Mr Briggs:
  We introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Exactly right. We are the ones who introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty. And we are the ones now who are introducing a bill for a PBO. The government only reacts when it is forced to do so. Obviously the Independents feel that they have done a deal with the government—they have made their decisions even though they do not even know what they are talking about—so be it. That is the way it is; let it be on their heads.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:57):  I have some questions for the parliamentary secretary. Firstly, I would be grateful if he could confirm or otherwise that Canada and its parliamentary budget office now carry out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends. Secondly, I would like the parliamentary secretary to confirm that in the United States the Congressional Budget Office carries out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends. Thirdly, I would ask the parliamentary secretary to explain why in Australia the Parliamentary Budget Office, as pronounced in this bill, will not allow that authority to carry out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends?


The next question relates to the issue of access to Treasury data. The member for Lyne asserted and then asked a question about the PBO. He said that the Parliamentary Budget Office would get private access to Treasury data and analysis and would have the ability to make their own assessment of Treasury data and analysis on a confidential basis. The parliamentary secretary confirmed; he said yes to all of those propositions. So I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary: if the government's Parliamentary Budget Office is put into place, would the Parliamentary Budget Office get access to things such as the modelling to do with the carbon tax, which has been carried out extensively? Will the Parliamentary Budget Office get access to the variables and all of the assumptions embodied in that analysis? Do you want to take some notes, or have you got all this in your head? I am just getting a bit worried. I am onto question 11—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Goldstein has the call and the member for Mayo should remember that he has been warned.




Mr Bradbury:
  When you say 'you', are you referring to me?




Mr ROBB:
  I said 'the parliamentary secretary', thanks very much.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary is not assisting and my patience is being worn down by everybody.




Mr ROBB:
  It would be better if the parliamentary secretary were to take notes rather than putting cheap shots across the chamber. I am very worried that I am not going to get answers to any of this, and it is quite relevant to the two Independents up here—and I am going to disregard the patronising cheap shots from the member for Denison in all of that. I ask: would the Parliamentary Budget Office be able to get access to Treasury modelling of, say, the education rebate? It is modelling that we were denied in the 3½ hours that we met with the Treasury officials. We got told to pull our heads in, effectively, and to take what they had to say—even though we had commissioned modelling from NATSEM, which Treasury uses. But they said there is a $900 million black hole, and we were told, 'You cop it.' That is what we were told, and you call that not interference. That was no cooperation whatsoever, and you have got the hide to stand up there and say that we are playing games. This is very serious business. They are in government because of the way in which that material was mishandled by Treasury and then by the government, and how you lapped it up! How those members lapped it up!


The next question I would like to ask is quite critical. In fact, I might come back to it in a minute, because I am running out of time. According to this bill as I read it: in the caretaker period if you present any proposal, automatically the costing of that is released immediately. I reserve the right to come back and finish that proposition. (Extension of time granted) The critical point in all of this, the thing that has really got our back up, is the proposition—and one of our own members of the committee has confirmed this—that unanimous agreements are not being delivered upon in this bill. The thing that is really getting up our nose is the fact that if we present a proposal, or two alternative proposals, to the Parliamentary Budget Office in the caretaker period, where we are trying to explore the relative merits of that proposal, or some competing proposals, we are trying to compare the relative merits. We are trying to come up with an answer which is economically responsible, economically doable, robust and independently assessed. If we present those two alternatives, over which we have taken no final decision, is it true that the analysis and costing of those two proposals—over which we have taken no final decision but we are in the caretaker period—will be automatically released? That is how we read this bill, and the shadow Treasurer's amendments go to making it absolutely crystal clear that that is not the case and that in fact we could test some proposals that we are looking at the relative merits of before we have made a final decision and keep in confidence the costings of those two proposals. If you say that it is true that those costings have to be released, no-one can form any other conclusion than that this is an act of politicising this whole Parliamentary Budget Office.

 (Mackellar) (17:05):  I would cede to the parliamentary secretary to answer the questions, but he was not making any movement to rise to answer them. I have in front of me a 'note for file: post-briefing feedback for the opposition; meetings of Independent MPs with departmental secretaries.' As I read through it, I see that follow-up question No. 1 was to have some, but every other question says, 'no follow-up'. On the questions where our costings were challenged by Treasury, I went through earlier, chapter and verse—before the member for Denison came into the chamber but the member for Lyne was here—why the disallowing of a legitimate saving of $2.5 billion with regard to our conservative bias allowance savings was knocked out by Treasury. I went through why the $3.3 billion of expenditure savings against the Health and Hospital Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund were knocked out by Treasury and why the $2.4 billion saving that was put in place with regard to the NBN was knocked out. We had assessed that the savings that would be made on interest payable was 5.5 per cent, which was the average of the 10-year bond rate for six months leading up to the election, and Treasury said, 'No, we've decided it's 4.9 per cent,' and I said that I had taken out the figures today showing that, in fact, the bond rate from July 2010 to August 2011 is 5.23 per cent. And yet that was knocked out. Why were the $600,000 of savings from putting people back into the workforce—people over 50 and under 30—knocked out by Treasury, because they called it 'a second-round effect', whereas in fact they allowed it for the government in their own budget papers, as they had indeed allowed other things for the government and denied them for the opposition.


Then there was a further $1.5 billion knocked out by Treasury with regard to the savings that could be made on the PBS, whereas the forecast was that 40 per cent could be saved and the government's legislative base was 23 per cent. A further 17 per cent in savings was available, which was accounted for in the $1.15 billion.


That totals $9.95 billion knocked out by Treasury, and you accepted it according to these minutes. When the question was asked about the bottom line impact of the department's costings, that was when you decided that you would go with this lot, the government of the day and not us. The answer came back from Mr Henry, who, as I said, has been rewarded by the new appointment in the Prime Minister's office.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Mackellar is straying, and there is imputation in what she has said—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  This is why we have to have—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  and I would ask her to withdraw.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  No, I cannot withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Then the member for Mackellar may have to resume her seat.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Secretary to the Treasury—and what we are talking about here is whether or not—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We are not going to debate this.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  we have an independence. The point about independence is: is the head of the Treasury serving the government of the day and therefore not able to give independent advice on opposition costings? That is a fair and legitimate point to make in this debate—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  All I have asked—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  and it is the one that I am making.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  is for you to withdraw the imputation.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I am sorry: it is a fact, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You have made—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  The fact of the matter is—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  All I have asked you to do is to withdraw.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I will read from—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You have made an imputation about—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I have made a statement of fact.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  a public servant, and I am asking you to withdraw.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I am sorry: I cannot do that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Then the member for Mackellar will resume her seat. The question is that amendment (1), moved by the member for North Sydney—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  On what basis am I being asked to resume my seat?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Because you are refusing to withdraw an imputation, and I think—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  It is a statement of fact.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The statement you made was that he had been—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I will read you Mr Dreyfus's remarks.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  rewarded. That is an imputation—




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Where is the standing order?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. 




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not accept.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You will have to move a dissent, won't you? Otherwise, you will resume your seat. 




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I will resume my seat, but I do not—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you very much. The question is that amendment (1), moved by the member for North Sydney, be agreed to. I call the member for Mayo.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (17:10):  I wanted to just address a couple of issues which were raised earlier, particularly one raised by the member for Denison who said, in one of his cheap shots, as the member for Goldstein described, about doing work now in preparation for the next election campaign to avoid the release of confidential information which you would be familiar with. Budgets change. Numbers change quite substantially over a period of time, so much so that the government of the day's numbers change between the mid-year budget review and the final outcome. In fact, we do not know what the final outcome of the budget was last year, because the revenue numbers change and the parameters you work with change.


If you understood the Commonwealth budget and how budgeting works, member for Denison, you would understand that you cannot do a costing now for a tax cut you might want in two years time for an election campaign. Guess who does not do that themselves? The executive. So, in your view, it is okay for the executive to have that right to test their policies to get it right but not for the opposition or in fact yourself. That is completely illogical, but we should not be surprised, I guess. It is as logical as attacking any public servant appointed by John Howard but then getting outraged if anyone raises questions about current public servants. It is a completely illogical position. It is all right to slander the former Prime Minister, but if it is anyone in this place it is a great outrage. Hypocrite—absolute hypocrite.


I go back to the issues raised by the member for Lyne. I point this out to him: in the questions he raised to the parliamentary secretary, who did not answer those questions, he did not point to the sections but said, 'There is nothing which will stop it.' I thought that was a fascinating answer for the third question you raised. I put this to you, member for Lyne: 64B of the bill says:


Purpose of Parliamentary Budget Office


The purpose of the Parliamentary Budget Office—


I am reading from the bill—


is to inform the Parliament by providing, in accordance with this Division, independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals.


It then directly rules that out when in 64E2 it says:


The Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions under subsection (1) do not include:


(a) preparing economic forecasts; or


(b) preparing budget estimates


Give me a break. This is an absolute sell-out of this policy. If you want to go through the history, you do not own this. In fact, this was owned by the coalition who proposed this in the budget in reply, but that is not the point. If we want good outcomes in this place, if you want the parliament to work properly, as you say—and I take you at your word on that—this is a really good reform if you make some changes. What they are proposing is a halfway house.


It is the same as when the Labor Party opposed the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1996. We do not take these people on trust. They opposed the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1996 because they completely politicised the process in 1995 and 1996. The member for Denison probably forgets that. It might have been one of his hazy periods. They completely politicised the budget process in that time, and that is why, when the Howard government came to power, there was a $10 billion black hole in the budget. That is how the Charter of Budget Honesty came about.


This is our proposal from when the member for Wentworth was the Leader of the Opposition. It is a good proposal, with some improvements, including making it genuinely independent to give it the power to make its own forecasts. You know what: the Treasury is not always right. They would say to you themselves that they are not always right. It is economic forecasting. Access Economics does it. Lots of people do it. Lots of people on the internet do it these days. It should be a contested thing. We should have the right to improve policies in this place and get decent and genuinely independent access to information, including forecasts. This is a good amendment. It is not about playing politics; it is improving what is decent reform in this place.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:14):  Of the questions that were asked by the crossbenchers of the parliamentary secretary, I would like to add an eighth. I am sure the member for Lyne had so many questions that the issue he spoke quite vigorously about, in fairness—the opportunity to get considered independent advice—did not feature in the top seven. Maybe it would have been eighth. The assertion that was being raised by the member for Lyne was around our concern about the inability to obtain confidential independent advice, weigh policy options and even analyse announcements made by others to see where they might be improved through calibration and policy settings. The opportunity to do that confidentially is denied to the opposition and to all Independents during the caretaker period. As I sought to do before, I draw his attention to section 64L of the bill, which makes that quite explicit. If he wants a rewritten account of that, page 10 of the explanatory memorandum emphasises that point quite clearly.


To draw connections between why that should be of concern to Independent members and all members in this place and why it should be of concern to the broader Australian public, my friend and colleague the member for Mayo points to a very excellent example. In 1996, we were all told the budget was in surplus by the then Labor government, only to find a $10.4 billion black hole that took considerable expertise and adultness to work through to put the budget back into surplus. That leads to the point that, under the construct that the Independents seem to be shackled to, they seem to overlook the consequences of some of the settings within this bill. One is the caretaker period. There is no opportunity for private consideration and discourse, recalibration, weighing up of options or even examining other proposals that might come forward, even from the member for Lyne. There is no chance to look at that or at whether there may be some opportunity for improvement, dare that be conceivable.


Going back to 1996, the other point is that that is the only point in time when the Treasury's figures were available. If the member for Lyne and the member for Denison have such love and affection for the Treasury figures and point to them as such a credible and solid foundation for analysis, why then deny the parliament and all the members in this place the chance to have policy ideas costed against those figures?


The member for Denison was quite right and very insightful: policy work is an ongoing process. Even in my portfolio area of small business, there is some policy that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet blue book said would boost productivity. I am happy to have that work outsourced so the government could actually do something about small business. That work is an ongoing process, but the member and others would rightly criticise the opposition if we were not using the most up-to-date data for our costings. In the entire period between elections and the issuing of writs, we are beholden—we are hogtied—to the Treasurer's numbers, which in case after case have been illustrated as not as reliable and robust as they can be, because the Treasurer can influence them and, dare I say, adulterate them from what the Treasury may have provided and inject new assumptions. The only time there is purity in those numbers is during the election period. You would expect us to go back to those numbers to make sure they are up to date and as reliable as possible on the least adulterated data available, the Treasury figures, and that only happens during the caretaker period. There is an obligation under this bill that that work gets released publicly.


Please join up the dots. This is not that hard. It is PBO, pretty bleeding obvious, that what the government is trying to do here is nobble this process so we are all shackled and handcuffed to whatever the Treasurer expects to be the starting point for this analysis, and the only time we can get away from that and have pure Treasury figures as the starting point is during the election period, when there is no confidentiality. This is not that complicated.


I urge you to look at those points. I take you at your word that those things matter. If they matter, I am finding it hard to work out why you are not actually connecting the facts that are in these bills with that concern and the reason that the opposition's amendments are so important. I take you at your word, but you are all backswing at the moment and no follow-through. The follow-through would see you back the opposition's amendments if you are genuinely concerned about those points. Nice backswing; we are looking for a bit of follow-through, gentlemen.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:19):  I would like to address some of the questions that were asked in this debate by the member for Goldstein. The questions broadly fit into the following categories. The first one was in relation to other models of parliamentary budget office and the extent to which some of those models may be empowered to create their own forecasts. I can confirm that there are other parliamentary budget offices across the world that do have the capacity to generate their own forecasts, but that is not the model that the government has decided to go with. In fact, we are not going with that model because we happen to agree with the recommendations and, indeed, the content of the report that was handed down by the joint select committee.


I know that the member for North Sydney has made much of the fact that he says there is no finding or recommendation in the committee report. The committee report, at item 3.100, reads:


Given the resource intensive nature of the work and the need to minimise the duplication of work produced elsewhere, the PBO should not be required to produce its own fiscal forecasts. Rather, it should provide analysis of the Government's fiscal forecasts, commenting on the assumptions, judgements and overall reliability of Government assessments.


That is what was in the report and that is why the government has gone down the path it has.


The report indicated that this is a very resource-intensive exercise. It might be worth putting on the record the fact that Treasury currently has 30 officers engaged in economic forecasting and a further 50 engaged in revenue forecasting, and Finance's budget group has around 250 officers, all of whom are engaged in preparing the budget forecasts. I think we can see that, apart from it being a waste of time to duplicate those functions in a new entity, it would be a waste of resources—a waste of money. That is why the government has not opted to go that way. But the most significant reason why we have not opted to create an alternative set of forecasts and assumptions in the PBO is comparability of the costings. I note that in today's Herald Ross Gittins made the very point that the government relies upon. He said:


It is infinitely preferable that all parties' costings be prepared on the same basis—


rather than allowing oppositions to choose different economic forecasts or different budget parameters and costing conventions. Exactly. The second set of questions which the member for Goldstein asked was about the free flow of information. I can confirm that there will be unfettered and free access, subject to privacy provisions and the usual FOI requirements that operate outside the regime that is envisaged here. But that will occur, and that is contained within the bill.




Mr Hockey:
  Where's that?




Mr BRADBURY:
  Section 64F.



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  It refers to a memorandum of understanding type arrangement, and that will put in place as the mechanism for the free flow of information. The third—and, I think, the most significant—set of questions raised by the member for Goldstein was about the confidentiality of costings during the caretaker period. These questions go to the nub of why the opposition, who unanimously supported these propositions in the committee process, have come forward now and opposed them. Why are they opposed to them? They are opposed to them because they know that under these arrangements their election commitments will be subjected to the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Budget Office. It is true that a matter which is publicly announced—and that is the key; what the legislation refers to is 'publicly announced'—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
 The opposition has two years and 11 months of the parliamentary term to do the hard yards on policy. If the opposition cannot do the hard yards on policy throughout the two years and 11 months and instead have to rely upon the possibility of putting in election costings during the election campaign, it shows just how lazy the current opposition is.



Let us call this what it is, because this is all about one thing, and it is a very simple proposition: the coalition, now that they have stumbled across the fact that they have the huge challenge of a $70 billion black hole, have discovered that they need to construct an alibi so that they can avoid being held to account for the fiscal atrocities that they are about to commit. We know that these fiscal atrocities are going to be grievous. There is a $70 black hole, and they know how difficult a job that is. If casting aspersions, denying the importance of this reform and challenging the credibility of the PBO is what they need to do to avoid any scrutiny when it comes to the next election, that is exactly what they will do. They will try to talk down this body, because to do that is to deny— (Time expired)

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (17:24):  I am deeply troubled by the lingering accusation in this place that the Treasury is politicised. I applaud some members of the opposition, who have trod around this issue much more carefully than some of their colleagues, but as it is at the moment the member for North Sydney has refused to withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on Treasury through the claim that it is politicised, and the member for Mackellar, by refusing to withdraw her comment, has not helped things at all.


For the public record, so it is absolutely clear to everyone in this country, I ask the member for North Sydney: will you now withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on the Treasury and the claim that it is politicised?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:26):  The concerns of the member for Denison will be addressed if the amendments proposed by the member for North Sydney are adopted. The parliamentary secretary sought to answer some of the questions I asked, but in doing so he exposed the motivation of the government in the way in which they have interpreted the committee's recommendations.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  The fact of the matter is that the only time that we see Treasury data in its rawest form, so the member for Denison can be satisfied that we are working with Treasury data unadulterated, is when PEFO is released. PEFO is not released until 10 days after the issuing of the writs—is that correct?



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  Right?




Mr Bradbury:
  You're telling the story.




Mr ROBB:
  Yes, right. Let us say that we had obtained access 10 days into the caretaker period, and we wished to see whether the policy proposals that we had been preparing for three years—




Mr Bradbury:
  What have you got at the moment?




Mr ROBB:
  The reason your government is in such trouble is that you did not prepare any policy in three years—that is the reason. We would want to wait for PEFO, despite having prepared a raft of policy, so that we got the latest statistics on costings when we released our documents publicly. Let us say that the government released a policy in the second week of the campaign and that we wanted to prepare and release a variation on that; or that we were preparing to release something, but it was partly covered by the government's policy. If you wanted to assess the merits of the policy, you are telling me, Parliamentary Secretary, that, if we put it into the office, the detail of that would be automatically released. We would not have the opportunity to make a considered assessment of whether that was affordable—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, do I have to put up with these cheap shots?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary will stop interrupting.




Mr ROBB:
  The Treasurer has sent a boy on a man's errand here—that is what we have found out tonight. Why doesn't he have the courage to come in here and answer these questions? The only way you are answering any questions is with the help of the advisers over there; you have no idea yourself, Parliamentary Secretary. Why isn't the Treasurer here to answer these accusations? This is a very important issue. An election swung on it last time, and now we are sitting here with the parliamentary secretary grinning over at his advisers to see if they will give him another piece of advice that he can come up to the box with.


On the free flow of information, which the member for Lyne quite appropriately asked a question about, you have just confirmed, Parliamentary Secretary, that if the Parliamentary Budget Office is set up as you have described it and as it is embodied in the bill and if the office went confidentially they could get access to the assumptions, the variables and the modelling for such things as the education rebate and the carbon tax. I would be grateful if you could properly and directly answer the following questions. Would the Parliamentary Budget Office get private and confidential access to the modelling of such things as the education rebate and the carbon tax—not only to the outcomes but also to the hundreds of assumptions and to the way in which that model was written? Would it have the ability to get an assessment of what would happen if some of those variables were changed?


If you are true to the broad statement you made before, you will answer yes to that. If you cannot answer yes to that, the member for Lyne and the member for Denison and every other person in this chamber should be deeply concerned about the motive, the veracity, the credibility and the integrity of this process. On two counts now—firstly, on the access to private information and, secondly, on the presentation of policies before an election in the caretaker period—you have created great doubt. (Time expired)

Mr HOCKEY:

  You did that! I encourage you to get a copy of the Hansard. It was a telling admission after how many hours of debate? He has now accepted that the government—




Mr Bradbury:
  It was the committee.




Mr HOCKEY:
  And now he is blaming the committee! There can never be any difference of opinion between this chamber and a committee! That is impossible to countenance!

This chamber is not allowed to disagree with a committee, even though the amendment immediately before the House was not a recommendation of the committee. This chamber is not allowed under any circumstances to disagree with a recommendation of a committee. So we are the echo chamber of a parliamentary committee. That is all it is.


What most interested me in this debate is that, after admitting that this is a lesser parliamentary budget office than those of other countries, the parliamentary secretary then went on to say, 'Yes,' in answer to the member for Lyne, who has already made up his mind but who did ask a question about—



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  No, I do not think there is any change coming, mate. Sorry to let you down. I do not think he ever moves on these things. It was quite interesting when the member for Lyne asked the question about access to information from Treasury. The parliamentary secretary just retorted: 'Section 64F. Look at that. That is how you are going to get the information out of Treasury.' Now, I have read section 64F—I do not know if the member for Lyne has—and it says:


The Parliamentary Budget Officer may make an arrangement—


This is the subject of another of my amendments. It says the PBO may make an arrangement. Not 'will', not 'must', not 'shall', but 'may':


in writing, with the Head … of a Commonwealth body … to obtain from the body information and documents relevant to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions.


I am prepared to put my wallet on this table and make a bet with the member for Lyne. Here is 20 bucks, right here. I seek leave to table $20.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  The member for North Sydney would be aware that that is not a parliamentary thing to do.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am seeking leave.


Leave not granted.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am prepared to put $20 on the table to have a bet with the member for Lyne that the only source of information this body will have out of the Treasury will be the Treasury forecast in the MYEFO or the budget. I bet that the MOU, if it should ever be agreed between the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Treasury, will never extend to getting any further information out of the Treasury other than that which is published. I am betting my money here because that is what this piece of legislation says. It says you can only use the budget numbers—that is, the Treasurer's numbers—and should you require any further information you need to have an MOU, a memorandum of understanding, with the department from the PBO. What a laugh!



Mr Oakeshott interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am sorry, but I understand the legislation. It is in here. It is going to come as a rude shock, but it is actually in the legislation and I look forward—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I indicate to members that it is extremely unseemly to be casting bets around in this chamber and I will ask that you desist from doing so.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am happy not to have a bet. I am just using that line. Perhaps we can lay something more significant on the line, like the seat of the member for Lyne. Maybe we could lay his seat on the line and see whether this turns out to be the case.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:36):  To reiterate a point the shadow Treasurer made, the saviour that the parliamentary secretary sought to offer was the prospect of an elusive MOU. We have established that we are handcuffed to the Treasurer's numbers. The only time we get a clear run at Treasury numbers is during the election period, when there is no confidentiality. I am grateful that it was not necessary for me to hand over the bill, but now we are relying on the provision that relates to the memorandum. I can just imagine a department secretary saying: 'Look, I've had this approach from the Parliamentary Budget Office. It's been so hollowed out by the parliament because the executive doesn't want it actually doing what parliamentary budget offices do in other jurisdictions, and now there's a memorandum of understanding.' Does anyone—particularly the Independents—think for one minute that an MOU will trump the legislation of the parliament? Does anyone think that will happen? Does anyone think that the department—the Treasury officials—will sit there and say, 'Look, I know there's been this express wish of the parliament, as reflected in the legislation.'


The parliamentary secretary has rolled out all of these spurious and incredibly unpersuasive arguments about why it is in the national interest to nobble the Parliamentary Budget Office before it even starts. Then Treasury officials say, 'Well, there is scope for us to enter into an MOU.' Do you think for one minute that that MOU will go anywhere further? Of course it will not. It may even be more restrictive than what the parliament said. It might even say: 'Now that you're nobbled to the Treasurer's numbers and PEFO, we don't even want you to be critical of those; that's under the MOU.' The MOU might say, 'You can't criticise any of the pre-election data or challenge any of the economic foundations in the forecasts, so, on the basis of the MOU, we will provide you with that material only so long as you are completely respectful and not in any way contradicting what the Treasury—or in this case the Treasurer—has had to say,' or the MOU might simply go down to: 'Would you like it on an Excel spreadsheet? Can we send it electronically? How quickly would you like it? If it happens to be late on a Friday night, is Monday okay?' Come on, Parliamentary Secretary! We know you are a lightweight in the Treasury portfolio, but do not tell the parliament or try to reassure the Independents that this completely empty, vacuous argument you put up has anything to do with the substantive issues that we are debating here.


The MOU will add nothing to this debate. It risks actually constraining further the information that is available. If it goes to information at all, it will not touch on any of the assumptions, any of the modelling or any of the various parameters that have been set and selected. It will not go to that; it will actually be more focused on the process of obtaining the already constrained information. The executive is hell-bent on making sure that only its view of the economic world and forecast ever sees the light of day.


I go back to where this started, the PBO—pretty bleeding obvious! They are trying to take the heart out of this, deny it to the Independents and deny it the respect that the Parliamentary Budget Officer deserves—and that is to satisfy himself or herself on what should be the basis of calculations that he or she is undertaking. That should be what is available here, and for the parliamentary secretary to come up and say, 'Hey, the MOU's the answer for everything,' is just utter, utter nonsense.

You confirmed to the House in response to the member for Lyne's question that if the Parliamentary Budget Office as embodied in your bill wants to see, privately and confidentially, the modelling of the carbon tax, the education rebate or any other modelling for that matter—if it wants to see the assumptions that have been made, the variables that have been included, the code that has been written and the impact of changing certain assumptions on the outcomes—then that is in fact embodied in this legislation. If that is true, that is a huge step forward. I would be grateful if you could confirm whether that is true or not.


Secondly, I would be grateful if you could also confirm that, under this Parliamentary Budget Office as espoused by the government, if we as an opposition, in the third week of the caretaker period of the next legislation, present two competing proposals which we are looking to get costed so that we can make—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  You have your chance to answer the question; let me just put it first so that people can understand what I am getting at. Suppose that we in the third week of the caretaker period of the forthcoming campaign, from opposition, have two competing proposals to achieve a similar objective and we wish to have those costed so that we can find out which is the proposal which has most merit, which is economically the best, which one may be robust and which one may be less affected by changes in the economic environment. If we wish to have that analysis done, are you saying, Parliamentary Secretary, that this bill requires that material to be made public on both of those considerations before we have made a decision?

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:43):  I will address those two points. As I indicated earlier, in relation to the ability to access information, proposed section 64F provides the mechanism through which a memorandum of understanding can be brought into effect, and that would provide sufficient opportunity for access to that information.


In relation to the second question that the member for Goldstein has asked, on the provision of materials for costing during the caretaker period, I draw the member's attention to proposed section 64J of the bill, which provides the direction in relation to matters that might be brought forward for costing during the caretaker period. At proposed section 64J(2), the bill reads:


An authorised member of a Parliamentary party may request the Parliamentary Budget Officer to prepare a costing of a publicly announced policy of the Parliamentary party.


That, in effect, is no different to the way in which the Charter of Budget Honesty occurs in relation to the caretaker period.




Mr Hockey:
  It is just a duplication of the Charter of Budget Honesty.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I find that amusing because, for all of the time I observed those within the Howard government, they held up the Charter of Budget Honesty as though it were some particular beacon for good governance. 



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  The member for Mayo will withdraw!




Mr Briggs:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a bit befuddled about what I am withdrawing but, whatever it is, I will withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I am equally as befuddled about this suggestion that, somehow, the opposition is now not holding up the Charter of Budget Honesty as some beacon of good governance. The committee inquiry in its report did indicate that there were some deficiencies in the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, in particular, in relation to the uneven way in which those provisions treat governments and oppositions.


The proposals contained within this bill are significant and they are a significant step forward that will assist oppositions. It is not often you see a government come forward and support a set of proposals that in fact do provide assistance to oppositions in carrying out their functions. In fact, when the coalition introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, they were single-minded in their attempt to make it as difficult as possible for oppositions then and into the future. And, having now come into opposition, they have seen just how hard that is. I will not restate the debacle that was the $11 billion black hole, other than to make this point, and that is that the provisions that the member for Goldstein is referring to essentially represent the way in which the Charter of Budget Honesty currently operates. Collectively, the amendments that the opposition are bringing forward represent a very desperate attempt to weaken the Charter of Budget Honesty. In fact, I will conclude by making this point in relation to the confidentiality provisions to which the member for Goldstein is referring.


Under the proposals that are being put forward in these amendments by the opposition, it would be possible for the opposition in the caretaker period to bring forward a set of policies that may be publicly announced, to have them costed but, in the event that their confidentiality provisions were allowed to prevail, then there would not be a requirement for the PBO to release those details. Under your proposals, that is what you have suggested. The other amendment that you are moving would suggest—



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  With great respect, this has been a wide-ranging debate and the question I have been asked does not go to this amendment either; it goes to the amendment to which I am referring. I make the point that, under the amendments that have been brought forward by the opposition, you could have a situation where they publicly announce a policy, they take it to the PBO, they do not like the answer that they get from the PBO, they go off to one of their accounting firms—one of their mates—and they get alternative costings and then they shop around for the one they want. We do not want that. We want a comparable set of benchmarks and that is why we are proposing this system. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:48):  This has taken us about 2½ hours, but the parliamentary secretary has finally confirmed that the caretaker period under the proposal that is embodied in this government's Parliamentary Budget Office is absolutely no different to the situation we confronted at the last election and the election before that. We have a choice: we can use non-current Treasury data before the caretaker period or we can wait for PEFO—PEFO is very important data—and get accurate assessments of alternative policies, some of which we have not yet made a decision on because it depends on what data the PEFO comes up with. Those will be used and abused by the government. This is a total stitch-up and you have confirmed it. You have confirmed today that the only thing this does is give us access to costings well ahead of an election. That is what you have confirmed.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  Can I just ask the member for Goldstein to make it clear that it is not me who is doing that. You were speaking through the chair.




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I apologise for that. The second thing is that we have heard great defences of Treasury here from the member for Denison, the member for Lyne and others, but both they and the parliamentary secretary have continued to cast imputations on me and the member for North Sydney. That is against standing orders. However, it is not against standing orders to cast imputations against others other than members.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  None of the people here, including the member for Hunter—was that you just throwing in your two-penneth? You have not been here for 2½ hours.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Hunter is out of his seat, so he will not be intervening at all.




Mr ROBB:
  Now that we have confirmed that nothing has changed and that, as far as the caretaker period is concerned, this is a total stitch-up, why are we wasting our time on this bill in this place? If you are going to use and abuse the office of government to misrepresent the findings of a committee, why are we wasting our time here when we will end up in the same dogfight again next time? Why not have a process where we can get rid of the calculations at a point of contention and then we can debate the merit of policy during the campaign. No, you are not prepared to do that. You just want to get down in the gutter again at the next election and spend 33 days casting aspersions on our ability to make assessments of the costings, when we would like to have an independent office which makes its own judgment of your policies and our policies so that we can take this costing process out of the public arena and we can debate policy. That is the root of the problem. The second thing is that the parliamentary secretary has again, in a very—



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, do you have several debates going on here or not?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  I might have the call but I am having trouble hearing myself because of the Leader of the House. 



A government member:  You're not missing much!




Mr ROBB:
  That is true. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We will all stop interjecting and the member for Goldstein will continue his remarks through the chair and not refer to 'you' as often as he has been.




Mr ROBB:
  I will forget 'you'. The parliamentary secretary very craftily slipped around the second issue. I did ask him very explicitly whether, if the Parliamentary Budget Office wanted to get access to the carbon tax modelling and the assumptions—to all of the variables—and the impact of changes in those assumptions—



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  I am asking a question. Do you want to listen or do you just want to prattle on over there?



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  You are not in this debate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein will resume his seat for a moment. I indicate that there has been a great deal of interjection, including interjections by members on their own speakers. The debate has been robust and I have allowed it to run but it is now my feeling that it is getting out of hand. The member for Goldstein will not respond to other conversations in the room. Those having other conversations will take them outside. The member for Goldstein has the call but his time is up. Is the member for Goldstein seeking the call a second time?




Mr ROBB:
  I am. (extension of time granted) Thank you for that privilege. The second point I would like to raise is the fact that I asked, quite specifically and directly, of the parliamentary secretary whether the Parliamentary Budget Office would have access to the variables and the modelling and the opportunity to change assumptions in that modelling and assess the outcome of that modelling—and any other modelling, for that matter. In a very obtuse way he said that the Parliamentary Budget Office could seek to strike a memorandum of understanding. The question I have to the parliamentary secretary is: does that mean that if a particular department—pick any one of 30—feels, on a day that they are requested by the Parliamentary Budget Office, that they do not want the department or the modelling that they have used and developed to be put under any scrutiny, they can just refuse to agree to a memorandum of understanding which gives the Parliamentary Budget Office that sort of access? If that is the case this is like the FOI process, where you are denied anything of any consequence.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (17:55):  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have sought the call because the member for Grayndler came in and told the member at the table not to answer any questions. It is just part of the ongoing transparency of the government, I suppose! And the Independents are voting for it, I might add, but so be it. If you think we are using the filibuster I will speak on this in summary—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney, I do not think anything.




Mr HOCKEY:
  on behalf of the opposition, because the government are not going to answer any further questions at the instruction of the member for Grayndler. First, the parliamentary secretary has now admitted that this is a lesser model than that which is applying in other countries. He would say that because, as he failed to note, the Parliamentary Library's pre-election policy unit identified that the PBO 'should include the provision of the kinds of assistance offered by the PBO such as costing and economic modelling'. So the Parliamentary Library says the PBO should be able to do its own independent modelling.


And the Clerk of the House of Representatives, in the submission to the committee that the member for Lyne boasts of being a part of, says: 


... discussion may be more comprehensive if Members had access to some additional quantitative analysis on how government projections had been arrived at and their sensitivity to assumptions.


That is the point the member for Goldstein raised. 


We now know that the government's justification for having the Treasurer and the minister for finance as the sole contributors of economic data, economic modelling and fiscal data to the PBO is cost. That is what he said before. This is a government that is now concerned about cost. After four years it has suddenly grown concerned about cost. What a revelation! Forget the billions of dollars that were handed out, the $900 cheques, now is the time to draw a line: 'We don't want it to go from $6 million to $7 million a year; we are going to be prudent as a government and we are going to hold back.' 




Mr Briggs:
  Return to surplus!




Mr HOCKEY:
  This will be the path to surplus! My second point, in summary, is that the parliamentary secretary has admitted that now there will be no additional access to information out of the Treasury or the department of finance or any other department without a memorandum of understanding. It will be a memorandum of understanding that this Parliamentary Budget Office is going to have signed with 30 different departments by the next election—yeah, right! They are going to have unfettered access under those MOUs, but that is the subject of another of my amendments.


The first of my amendments seeks, after all these hours of debate, to prove the case that this government, in partnership with the Independents, is just not serious about having a fully independent parliamentary budget office. By the words of the parliamentary secretary and the admissions in the very drafting of this bill, it is now clear that the government itself, in partnership with the Independents, is de-fanging the Parliamentary Budget Office. In the words of the parliamentary secretary himself: 'It is a lesser parliamentary budget office than that which exists in some other jurisdictions.' Question put:


That the amendment (Mr Hockey's) be agreed to.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:31):  I would like to take the opportunity to respond to a number of issues that were raised before the debate was interrupted. I think it is fair to say that the principal claim that was being made by the opposition went to the question of the integrity of forecasting and figures that might be provided by the Treasury. In particular, there was some discussion around the PEFO, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and I was able to indicate that those figures are independently verified and that they need to be signed off by the secretaries of the departments of Treasury and finance. In the context of that discussion, the member for North Sydney raised some concerns in relation to the other reports that might be required to be produced under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, in particular in relation to the budget economic and fiscal outlook and the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The allegation was made that in some respects in the past there had been political interference by previous treasurers with those forecasts and figures. If I recall correctly, the member for North Sydney indicated that he had been there and that he spoke with some personal experience in relation to these matters.


In addressing those concerns, I make the following points. The first one is that each of the matters contained within the two reports that have been referred to—the budget and MYEFO—the forecasts upon which each of those reports is to be provided, are forecasts that are provided by the Treasury. The assumptions that underpin those reports are produced by the Treasury, but of course those reports are provided by the Treasurer.


In relation to those forecasts, it is worth making the point that these forecasts are the subject of considerable and very robust review, and there are a number of checks and balances that are in place and that have been in place for some time. In particular, the Treasury forecasts are informed by extensive and regular discussions with the Reserve Bank, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and also the ABS, through the Joint Economic Forecasting Group. In addition to JEFG, there is also the opportunity for the Senate estimates process to be used to test the assumptions and parameters outlined within the various reports. In addition, the Reserve Bank and others, in particular private institutions and market economists, will make their own forecasts from time to time and, in the context of the public debate around those forecasts and the scrutiny that will naturally be applied to the government's forecasts, there is a degree of accountability that occurs in that sense as well.


I think it is also worth making the point that the Parliamentary Budget Office will have direct access to the Treasury and finance departments, notwithstanding what has been said in this debate before. So, regardless of where those forecasts might be generated, there will be full, frank and free access, without any ministerial intervention or encumbrance, that will allow the PBO to contact and to test various forecasts and to raise concerns that they may have. That is something that is permitted within the regime that the government is supporting in the bill.


I think it is also worth making the point, in the interests of clarity, that the legislation does not in any way prevent the PBO from assessing, evaluating or analysing the economic forecasts. The PBO is free to do that, but what they are not free to do is to dedicate resources that would be allocated to them to the task of forecasting. There is a very good reason for that, and that is why the joint committee—which, I remind the House, handed down recommendations that were unanimous, including members from the opposition—made the point that this would be a very expensive exercise and one that would not be a very useful allocation of resources. The opposition referred to the Congressional Budget Office on a number of occasions. In doing so they should make the point that the annual budget of the Congressional Budget Office is $US50 million, considerably more than what is envisaged for the PBO, because it has different functions. (Time expired)

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:37):  The parliamentary secretary has just confirmed everything that I said. He absolutely confirmed that in fact the PBO will be only able to use the fiscal and economic forecasts of the Treasury, unless it is in relation to the pre-election fiscal outlook, which is the only document under the Charter of Budget Honesty that is in fact signed off as the figures that actually belong to the Department of the Treasury and department of finance. Otherwise, the PBO is constrained to looking only at the government's figures; that is all. Then they had the audacity to claim that this was a recommendation in the report. I do not recall seeing it; in fact, I went back to the report.


There is no recommendation in the committee's report. The mandates of the PBO can only use information and reports published under the charter. There is one mention, which at 3.100 says:




…the PBO should not be required to produce its own fiscal forecasts. Rather, it should provide analysis of the Government
'
s fiscal forecasts…



Okay; fine. But that is actually not a recommendation, nor is it the case that it says it would not be able to produce its own fiscal forecasts. So, for example, let's take this, an issue that is highly contentious: what is the structural deficit? The Treasury does not do its own modelling on a structural deficit. It had a part of the budget papers that was allocated to a discussion of the structural deficit. This is an issue that is hugely contentious in relation to the fiscal outlook, and under the government's amendment the PBO would not be able to do any assessment of the structural deficit. How bizarre. It is not an independent body.


Secondly, it would not be able to use data provided by the Reserve Bank, nor would it be able to use data provided by ABARES. Under this situation, the government is saying, 'Look, there is only one set of data that can go into the PBO—that is, the government's data, the executive's data. All other information cannot go to the PBO because it cannot be challenged.' Frankly, if this is what the parliament thinks is an independent body, it is seriously kidding itself.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (15:39):  When we began debating this last week, I made the point that what the government is proposing for this Parliamentary Budget Office is something that is simply linked to the coattails of Treasury. That is totally and utterly unacceptable to the opposition for very good reasons, because the Treasury has become so politicised. I made the point that Treasury and the head of Treasury had been rewarded for things that they had done to assist the government.


I want to go specifically to some of what happened after the election when the Independents said that they wanted to have our costings analysed because we had said we did not want to politicise Treasury to look at them. We had them done independently, and then the Independents said that they would make up their decision about how good or bad we were on what Treasury had to say about those costings.


I want to go to some of them directly to say why we cannot have a Parliamentary Budget Office which is attached to a politicised Treasury. Let's look at the conservative bias allowance. First of all we said we would have a saving of $2.5 billion. Mr Henry said, 'No, you can't have that, actually. You can't be counted as having $2.5 billion,' because, in his words, 'it will not realise any actual budgetary savings if you cut back on the conservative bias allowance that is factored in to allow a little bit of a buffer in the way projections are made.' Yet at the same time in the 2009-10 budget, Mr Henry, himself responsible for that budget, in Budget Paper No. 1 had set out that the government was saving $4.6 billion 'by savings from the conservative bias allowance over the forward estimates'. He said, 'This results in a reduction of expenses of $1.5 billion in 2010-11, $1.5 billion in 2011-12 and $1.6 billion in 2012-13, totalling $4.6 billion.' Yet Mr Henry said to the Independents, who were making a judgment: 'They can't count $2.5 billion. That's part of the $11 billion so-called black hole.'


Then we go to cutting expenditure for the Health and Hospitals Fund—another interesting one. Here we said we were going to save $3.3 billion, and Mr Henry said to the Independents, 'They can't do that. They would have to identify before the election just what programs were going to be cut out of the three funds.' They were: the Health and Hospitals Fund, the Education and Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund. Then we said, 'But we asked you for that list of programs, Mr Henry, and you said you couldn't find one. It didn't exist.' Finally, in the middle of these protracted discussions for the benefit of the Independents to decide who they might back for government, he said, 'I've got a secret list. I've got it here, but guess what? I can't let you see it.' Isn't that amazing? 'I can't let you see it.' Did he ever give a reason for why this was a secret list, why it couldn't be made public or why it hadn't been able to be found before? Of course not. Of course Mr Henry should be rewarded. He did a wonderful job for the government.


Then we come to the NBN. Savings here were going to be $2.4 billion, and we were going to save that by not borrowing money on which we said the interest rate payable was 5.5 per cent. Mr Henry came to the rescue of the government again and said, 'You can't save that amount of money, because we say the interest rate will be 4.9 per cent.' He would not be moved. He said, 'I've made a decision, so that will be another $900 million to add to your black hole.'


I took the figures today for the average interest rate paid from July 2010 to today. Guess what it is? It is 5.23 per cent. So Mr Henry should be rewarded—4.9 per cent helped the government find an error in our costings of another $900 million.


Then we go on to employment participation where we said we will make savings in welfare payments of $600 million. 'Oh no,' Mr Henry said, 'you can't count that because that's a second-round figure.' But, heavens to Betsy, in the same budget this year we see that a second-round saving of $600 million on the so-called mining tax was allowed by Dr Henry. Dr Henry assisted the government to find another $600 million so-called error in our accounts. So Dr Henry should be rewarded with a $528,000 a year job in the Prime Minister's office. That is why it is politicised and that is why we cannot trust them. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (15:45):  My two colleagues have shown how the current process is devoid of integrity and credibility and has been grossly politicised. I experienced that firsthand after the last election. The parliamentary secretary opposite is yet to provide one decent argument on amendment (1). We will start with amendment (1); that is what we are debating at the moment, right? He has not provided one argument why the PBO and all the rest of us should be hogtied to the numbers, figures, forecasts and analysis of Treasury. Why should that be the case?


I will give you an example. Over the last four years we have been debating perhaps the biggest structural adjustment that will ever be considered by any of these parliamentary members: the imposition of a carbon tax and, subsequently, an emissions trading scheme. There has been endless modelling for four years of the impact of this, but not once has the model that has generated all of these numbers, all of these outcomes, all of this rhetoric and all of these forecasts by the government been revealed. They are all part of a black box in Treasury. We have asked endlessly to see the modelling; never have we seen one line of code from that modelling—not one assumption. We have deduced that one assumption built into the model is that there would be no unemployment by 2050. Surprise, surprise! When they got the outcome of the modelling there was no unemployment by 2050. If you put in that assumption, it is not a surprise.


What if you changed that one assumption and made it a floating variable in that model? What would be the outcome? What is the sensitivity to fixing that particular variable? We will never know. What would the Parliamentary Budget Office do if they were given that model? They would do some of that sensitivity analysis. We would be better informed; the public would be better informed; the nation would be better informed—especially when we are going it alone on this carbon tax. We are ahead of the world. No-one else is doing it. Yet we have been tied to this situation with Treasury. This is why we need credibility and integrity restored to the process. Treasury has been politicised in this whole exercise. We need the capacity for an independent body to analyse such critical matters as the modelling—the detailed, exhaustive, massive modelling—that has been undertaken.


We will get results this week again, but I can assure you they will just be outcomes. Out of this black box again will come a whole series of outcomes around which you will make the most ambitious statements. You will hold everyone hostage to this black box. Having come to government and said that transparency was at the heart of the way in which you would run government, since then we have had nothing but obfuscation, no benefit-cost analyses and a refusal to provide any of the analysis that sits behind all of this. No wonder we need to go to the next election and debate policy based on independently assessed analysis—not only our policies but the policies of the government. The policies of the government need to be scrutinised and analysed. They have not been, and that is why this process is heavily politicised. It is why you need integrity and credibility to be restored to this process.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (15:49):  I rise to endorse particularly the member for Goldstein's contribution. The parliamentary secretary is a trier—I will give him that—but quite clearly he has not addressed any of the issues which are raised in the debate we had the other evening. In fact, he has tried to divert the argument by suggesting that this was a recommendation made in a report of a parliamentary committee. We do not accept the parliamentary secretary's argument that, if a parliamentary committee finds that in some way, the parliament has to agree. These debates have no purpose at all, apparently, if a parliamentary committee comes up with a recommendation. I am not sure why we sit. We should just let committees sit and come up with their recommendations.


The amendment moved by the member for North Sydney is probably the most important amendment of the lot that we are moving because it is about having that contested advice. The parliamentary secretary's view is that you cannot question Treasury. If you go through the history of our government and now your government, the Treasury never gets the numbers right on its forecasts. That is not a criticism; that is just the truth. For instance, last year they forecast—




Mr Perrett:
  The GST they got right.




Mr BRIGGS:
  Right on cue, the member for Moreton. No, they did not, member for Morton. The numbers changed—of course they did, because they are estimates, based on models. As the member for Goldstein rightly pointed out, they put numbers into a model and it spits out other numbers. The assumptions changed and the realistic outcomes changed. The point is we should have contestable advice from an independent Parliamentary Budget Office. If you want to take away the politics of the costings in an election campaign, which is what the member for Lyne talks about doing, and have a genuine assessment, you should have a genuine independent body.


One of the reasons the parliamentary secretary gave that we cannot go down the route of the Congressional Budget Office was that the funding for the Congressional Budget Office was $50 million a year. Of course, the United States is a slightly bigger country than Australia, Parliamentary Secretary, so it is little surprise that it would have a larger budget office. But quite clearly there is a need for additional powers for the Parliamentary Budget Office so that they can make their own assumptions and arrive at their own numbers based on an analysis of the information that comes before us. The ideas contained in the arguments that the member for Goldstein and the member for Mackellar have just put forward would reduce the unhappiness of an opposition—and, if you think that this is the first opposition to be unhappy with costings during an election campaign, you have not been around for very long. The same problems have arisen in election after election, and it is the very reason that we need and want a genuinely independent parliamentary budget office. The reason you do not want to go down this road is the short-term politics of today. That position is ill thought through, because in the long term it will have consequences for the effective operation of what should be a genuinely good development in Australian public policy.


This is a smart amendment. It addresses genuine concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the numbers, the independence of the decisions and the release of the information. It should be supported, and if you are serious about doing this, Parliamentary Secretary, you will take on board and answer some of the genuine questions that have been raised rather than try to cover them over with half-truths, as you have so far. This is an important debate and you should take it seriously.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:53):  I again commend this amendment to the government. We were all feeling a bit awkward while we sat here watching the parliamentary secretary last Thursday as very legitimate and considered questions about how the PBO would operate were being asked of him, and clearly his briefing had not extended to his being able to answer them. The shadow Treasurer and others sought to highlight that, by handcuffing the Parliamentary Budget Office to the Treasury numbers and then to the Treasurer's numbers—which was a very salient point raised by the shadow Treasurer—you are effectively undermining the whole point of the PBO. You are effectively saying, 'Be free to inquire and be free to add to the better governance of Australia, but we are going to nobble you so you can't drift too far away from what the Treasurer would like to assert is the only set of numbers that anyone should be taking any notice of.' This amendment is trying to inoculate against this situation, whereby the Parliamentary Budget Office—who, like the new kids on the block, cannot be left to their own professional competence to find the analytical basis best suited to the task being asked of them and must instead take the gospel according to the Treasurer—effectively become the apprentices of Treasury.


The only opportunity for the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at the numbers before the Treasurer puts his fingerprints all over them would be after the calling of an election. But they are the Treasurer's numbers up until that point and—given whatever mystery and nuancing has gone on to get them to the point—if we were to remain able to rely only upon Treasury numbers in the election context, I explained to the parliamentary secretary at the table how the situation would play out, since he could not answer my concerns himself. If the opposition announced a policy and then said, 'Here are the costings behind them', the first thing you would hear from the Treasurer would be 'No—those numbers are out of date', and the government would make up some mystery black hole and base an argument on it. They would do that because, prior to the election period, there could be some interaction between opposition members and the Parliamentary Budget Office, but it could only be on the basis of the Treasurer's numbers. Getting those numbers revised and updated on the basis of Treasury numbers could only happen in the election context, and in the election context all that material is publicised the moment that the work is concluded. There is no opportunity for the opposition to consider the data generated by the PBO. There is no chance to reflect on our own policy commitments and on the calibration of those policies on the basis of the most up-to-date information provided by Treasury, because as soon as that information becomes available we are in the election context, and it all gets thrown up in the air to allow the government to make all sorts of claims and allegations, even though the opposition may not even have a simple view on the question that it was getting tested and costed and analysed through the PBO. We may not even have a chance to reflect on it before the government makes all sorts of claims about what the data means, and that is an important point.


I have often spent considerable time trying to urge the Independents to do things, though I must admit that my track record is not great. Still, gentleman, I will persevere. The point here is that the numbers that now form the foundation of considerations are the Treasurer's numbers; Treasury's numbers form the foundation of considerations only during the election period. According to the way that this bill has been constructed, all those numbers will be thrown up in the air for the world to see during an election period. Where is the opportunity for sober and careful consideration of numbers by the opposition or any Independent members before the government sets its enormous resources to the task misrepresenting what we may be contemplating? I urge the Independents to agree that, under this bill, the PBO is not an independent costing organisation but a nobbled Parliamentary Budget Office.



As I said last Thursday, PBO could stand for 'pretty bleeding obvious'. The government is trying through this bill to nobble the PBO so it becomes yet another arm of government, not a body that can independently contribute to the good governance of the country. The government is trying to nobble the resources of the PBO and the basis from which it can start. The PBO's analysis will be throw out into the public domain during elections, because that is the only time that Treasury numbers are used. Why can't other numbers be used? Why can't the Reserve Bank's forecast, which many in the economy think are very reliable, be used? Why can't the Canadian model, by which a range of independent sources can arrive at their own numbers, be used? Why can't the PBO be treated as an adult and satisfy itself that maybe the Treasurer's numbers are a good starting point— (Time expired)

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (15:59):  I commend the amendments. Although the funding was allocated in this year's budget for a PBO, we are now almost three months down the road in the financial year and only now beginning to debate the policy in earnest. It will be astonishing if the PBO is up and running by the end of this year.


Almost everything the government touches ends up turning sour. The only reason we are debating the bill this week is that the coalition has introduced its own PBO legislation. We on this side of the House believe that the government's bill is deeply flawed, and that is why we are pushing for a number of amendments. On this point it is worth examining the differences between the two pieces of legislation and, in order to do so, we need to reflect on the motivation for creating a PBO in the first place. The PBO is a necessary reform to ensure transparency and integrity of budgetary and fiscal processes. In short, it levels up the playing field between government and non-government members by giving them equal ability to scrutinise government policy and to evaluate their own policies. If it is to be anything more than a paper tiger, the PBO needs the power to obtain relevant information from government departments; it needs the flexibility to perform whatever analysis it sees fit; and, most importantly, it needs to provide a level of discretion to allow members and senators to retain control of their own policy. It is there, at the first hurdle, that the government's policy falls down. Under the government's proposal, the PBO is unable to prepare economic forecasts or budget estimates. Why and how is the PBO supposed to prepare accurate analysis of the budgetary impacts of policy over the longer term?


This bill also restricts the PBO from using any economic data prepared by a third party in its determinations, as mentioned by the member for North Sydney earlier. Data from the Reserve Bank and ABARES could not be used in a determination. Instead it can only rely on information provided by the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Again, why? What is the purpose of limiting the scope of the PBO's research to such an extreme degree? How can the PBO be expected to fulfil its full mandate with one arm tied behind its back?


Unfortunately, the problems do not end there. The government's bill severely restricts the PBO's powers to gather information by requiring it to enter into an agreement with the relevant departments to determine what information they can get and when they can get it. The PBO will have nothing to trade with during the negotiation of these agreements, so it stands to reason that any agreement entered into by the government departments will be heavily biased in favour of the departments in question rather than the PBO. In short, what we are looking at here is a Clayton's PBO: it is the PBO you have when you do not have a PBO.


The coalition's policy does not contain any of these rather obvious shortcomings. Instead the PBO, as envisaged by us, will have considerable powers to obtain information from government departments. These powers will be based more on the powers of the Auditor-General and will ensure the PBO is a much more effective body than the diluted version being offered by those opposite.


Of course, one of the most significant functions of the PBO will be to prepare costings, yet even here the government's bill has some rather strange provisions. For instance, during caretaker periods the costings facilities available to members and senators is different from those available at other times. Indeed, during election campaigns the costings functions provided by the PBO would be identical to those already provided to the opposition under the existing Charter of Budget Honesty. So, again, I find myself asking why. What is the reason for this differentiation and what is the point of this duplication?


The Charter of Budget Honesty was a groundbreaking reform, but unfortunately the costings process provided under the charter are not confidential. In fact, they are exactly the opposite. As it stands, not only are requests for costings immediately published on the website of both Treasury and the Department of Finance and Deregulation but also the results of the said costings are made available in the same way. Perhaps this is a belated attempt from the Prime Minister to live up to her promise last year to draw the curtains back and let the sun shine in. But perhaps not. 


In conclusion I believe the government's bill is deeply flawed. The bill provides the PBO with insufficient power to gather the information it needs to do the job, it makes insufficient provisions for discretion and it is structured in such a way that it protects the interests of the government of the day rather than the interests of budgetary transparency and its fiscal integrity.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:04):  I want to speak very briefly to put on the record my condemnation of the opposition's accusation that the Treasury is heavily politicised. That is a most serious accusation, particularly as it comes from the alternative government of this country. It is the case that in times past there has been some politicisation within the Public Service. At the time I was very outspoken about the practice by the then Prime Minister John Howard to personally vet all SES appointments in his own office. I do not think that is the way we should be appointing our senior public servants. But those times are behind us now, thankfully, and it is my observation that we have the world's finest Public Service. It is to the great credit of the Public Service that the country ran so well during those weeks of uncertainty following last year's election result. There are very few countries in the world where the country can be administered so confidently as Australia. I put on the record my praise for the Australian Public Service and my concern that we should be having a discussion about the degree to which the Treasury, of all departments, would be politicised.


I support the government's Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill; I do not support the opposition's amendment. Not only is it important to have scrutiny of election promises but also it is important to have transparency; hence, I think it most important that in the period of the election campaign itself there should be some visibility of what has been costed. If the opposition or the crossbenchers want to have any policy examined privately, that can be done before the election is called, but once we are in the election period itself the whole purpose of the PBO is to shine a light on those costings. Frankly, I personally found the work that was done costing the opposition's policies in the immediate aftermath of last year's federal election very important. The fact that the opposition's policies were found to have a black hole of between $7 billion and $11 billion was not the reason for my decision to put support of supply and confidence behind the government, but it was not lost on me that that was in the mix, particularly at a time when I was very generously being offered $1 billion towards a new hospital in my seat of Denison. It was a time when I could not have confidence that the money was in fact there, given that the opposition had a black hole of between $7 billion and $11 billion. 


In essence, I do not support the opposition's amendment. I think the government's model is sound because it does bring scrutiny and transparency. I applaud the government for again staying true to its commitment to the crossbenchers and to me personally, as contained in our written agreement.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:07):  Firstly, I have been advised—and it was a matter that was raised, I think, by the Treasurer, the member for Lyne and others—that the model that they chose is based far more on the Canadian parliamentary budget office than on the US Congressional Budget Office. We were told that the Canadian budget office does not do analyses or—for the benefit of the member for Denison—provide transparency in regard to critical analysis, like four years of modelling of the biggest decision all of us will ever take, where we cannot analyse or look at one single variable out of hundreds of variables that are put into that modelling. Transparency is what we are talking about, not politics. This thing is dripping with politics.


Now we find that as of the middle of this year the Canadian budget office, in contrast to its previous practice of preparing fiscal projections using government numbers, is basing its fiscal outlook on its own economic projections. Answer that, Parliamentary Secretary—sorry, I forgot your office. Parliamentary Secretary, you might be able to answer that question. I will read from the latest PBO economic and fiscal outlook. This is the PBO of Canada. You might listen to this if you want to talk about transparency. This is a report by the Canadian PBO:


To enhance PBO's independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends in the national economy and given the downside risks to the average private sector outlook, PBO is providing—for the first time—its own medium‐term economic outlook … PBO's economic outlook incorporates its judgement of the balance of risks and as a result it can be viewed as a 'balanced' projection, which means that higher or lower outcomes are equally likely.


In other words, in Canada, for the first time, they have an independent body which can in fact do its own analysis and give its own sensitivity of the government projections to changes in all sorts of variables. It seems an unremarkable thing that this should happen. It would seem to be a great strength for this parliament to have access to an independent body that can give some sensitivity analysis in regard to key analysis provided by Treasury. That does not mean Treasury is wrong; it just means that we have a far more substantial debate and that we have, in fact, an ability to test the projections and not sit here and be fed, like mushrooms, in the dark. We need this sort of analysis. This is what my colleague and friend the member for North Sydney has put forward. He has put forward this analysis and this request that we as an opposition be able to get the benefit of an independent analysis. I would suggest that the government at times would also benefit from an alternative point of view.


Secondly, on the question of the secretary and the Treasury, with great respect to the member for Denison, he did not spend 3½ hours in detailed debate with senior Treasury officers following the election and he did not witness, as my colleague the member for Mackellar has started to articulate, the type of discussion and obstinacy that was provided. There were many examples which we have documented previously, which are a matter of public record and which have again been repeated—some of them today in this House—where we were simply told, 'We have made a decision,' every time we got to a point where they could not argue against what we were saying, such as with the 5.5 per cent bond rate. We had canvassed around the community, with all the leaders of the finance market, what would be a sensible bond rate. Why would we, for the sake of a few dollars, try to obfuscate and cover up?

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:12):  As we consider the amendment before us at this consideration in detail stage, what we are doing is asking ourselves the question: which of the two alternative models put forward, one by the member for North Sydney and one by the government, better gives effect to the policy objective that, we are all agreed, makes sense—a policy objective in which resources are available to the parliament, the legislative branch of government, to assist it in having available to it alternative expert advice on economic, financial and budgetary matters? It is a question of which scheme—which mechanism; which process—is best going to give effect to the principle upon which we are all in agreement.


Against that backdrop, there is a pretty clear contrast between the two alternative frameworks which have been put forward. The government's framework, laid out in proposed section 64E(2) and (3), specifically bars the Parliamentary Budget Office from carrying out certain functions such as preparing budget estimates. It also specifically constrains the Parliamentary Budget Office to use forecasts, parameters and fiscal estimates released by the Treasurer. By contrast, the scheme put forward by the member for North Sydney in his excellent amendment is a scheme under which the Parliamentary Budget Office has a maximum degree of discretion in performing its functions. In the words of the amendment, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is given the discretion to 'prepare, or have regard to, either or both of economic forecasts or budget estimates'. In other words, it is a provision which grants the maximum extent of discretion to the Parliamentary Budget Officer so that he or she is best placed to discharge the functions which this legislation is imposing upon him or her—namely, the function of being a provider of independent expert advice to the legislative branch of government.


When the policy suggestion was put forward by the coalition, and subsequently taken up in the negotiations between the Independents and the government, the underlying logic was to establish an independent body, an independent office which would provide a source of independent advice. There is no notion of being critical of the existing departments of state. There is no notion of saying that they are in some way inherently flawed in what they do, but there is a mature recognition that executive government will often have a different set of interests from the parliament, from the legislative branch. There is also a mature recognition that it makes sense to better inform the parliament to provide a source of specialist expertise to the parliament to allow it to discharge its weighty responsibilities.


If a consequence of these new arrangements is that there is a battle of ideas, that there is contestability in policy, that is no bad thing; indeed we on this side of the House say that is a good thing. But the one thing we say very specifically and very precisely about the two alternative schemes that are before the House this afternoon is that we are deeply suspicious of the bona fides of the government in putting forward the particular scheme it has, because we do not believe that the restrictions on the Parliamentary Budget Office contained in proposed section 64E(2) or the constraints on the sources to which it may have regard contained in 64E(3) adequately and sensibly give effect to the policy objective which all of us share in this debate, which is a Parliamentary Budget Office best able to provide independent advice to the parliament about these complex and important matters. It is on that basis that I believe the amendment put forward by the member for North Sydney ought to be supported this afternoon.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:17):  In order to assist the Independents with their judgment I want to provide three real-world examples of why there is a need for contestability, as has been set out by the member for North Sydney. Let me begin with three examples from my own portfolio in recent years. Firstly, under the Home Insulation Program, we were given a set of estimates by the government which were rock solid and ironclad and which we were to accept as Holy Writ.


It is known by all members of this House that virtually none of those estimates came to pass. They did not come to pass in terms of their costs, their safety assessments, the rate of installation or, indeed, the emissions reduction. We were told that $2.45 billion had been set aside under the Home Insulation Program to achieve installation in just over 2.7 million homes around Australia. Unfortunately, only one million homes, less than 40 per cent of the government figures, were ever installed with insulation. Almost a billion dollars had to be set aside in provisioning for repair and maintenance and restoration. The rate of emissions reduction was one-third of that given by government agencies, and obviously endorsed by Treasury, as Holy Writ. We were derided for contesting those figures, yet we were correct and the government agencies were incorrect, I am sorry to say.


I do not blame the government agencies. They were forced to act against a set of parameters imposed upon them by the executive government. It is important to understand that executive government can, but it should not, under this current government impose parameters on the bureaucracy and administration. That has distorted the way in which that bureaucracy and administration produces its figures.


Contrary to what the member for Denison says, we are not asserting that this is a bad bureaucracy. We are asserting that there probably has never been any greater interference in the operations of the bureaucracy in Australia's history. For us, then, to have to rely upon the figures which come from that process is utterly unacceptable. There must be contestability. Perhaps we could have avoided a tragedy such as the Home Insulation Program, let alone the waste and the extraordinary impact on so many small businesses. Contestability in public figures would have assisted throughout the Home Insulation Program. That is not provided for under this bill but it is provided for under the alternative model that the member for North Sydney has set out.


I also want to give two current examples before the parliament under the existing carbon tax modelling provided by the government—again I say 'the government'. There is an assumption in the modelling that the United States will have an effective carbon tax—a cap-in-trade system, in their words—up and running on a full national basis by 2016. That is simply fallacious. It is a fantasy that the United States under any foreseeable political structure will have a fully functioning carbon tax or cap-in-trade scheme. That has a huge impact on the global assumptions and, therefore, the entire base for the Treasury modelling. That is not the fault of Treasury. It is the fault of a government that imposes a straitjacket on the bureaucracy, that reaches into its operation and distorts the way Treasury works and distorts the figures. For that, we say, there must be contestability. A similar thing is that there is a change in the assumption of elasticity regarding the sensitivity of the population to changes in electricity prices and demand. There is no basis for this. There is no explanation for this. It does not sit with Australian economic history. It does not sit with the work of the New South Wales independent regulator. Again, none of this is contestable under the model which is currently proposed. 


These are real-world examples. There is the home insulation program. There is the fact that the United States, in no foreseeable future, will have a fully functioning cap-and-trade system by 2060. And there has been a complete rewriting of economic history regarding the sensitivity of people to changes in electricity pricing. That is why the amendment should be supported and there should be contestability in figures. (Time expired)

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:22):  As someone who was part of the agreement—an agreement that included representatives of all members of this chamber—to establish a parliamentary office in this term, I am at a loss why we are seeing so much trouble in passing this legislation. Likewise, I was a committee member of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office, along with Barnaby Joyce, Kelly O'Dwyer and Christopher Pyne. The three coalition members, the government members, the Greens and I unanimously supported various recommendations for the establishment of a PBO. Again, I am at a loss as to why we are now struggling to turn this into legislation. 


We are building a service for this House. We are not building a service for the executive. There was an important question asked at the end of the last engagement over this piece of legislation—I think it was last Tuesday night, when, thankfully, we adjourned so that we could all consider our positions. Further work has obviously been done by all of us. As far as I can see, questions that I was raising at the end of that debate regarding the difference between Treasury and the Treasurer seem somewhat spurious, at the very least.




Mr Hockey:
  Spurious!




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  Spurious, the member for North Sydney. I am increasingly—




Mr Hockey:
  You have been stiffened up by them, have you?




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  Not at all. The member for North Sydney thinks I have been stiffened up, sticking up for an independent parliamentary budget office, a service of this parliament agreed, by members of his own party, to be put into legislation twice in the last 12 months.




Mr Briggs:
  Stop verballing people, Rob.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I am not verballing anyone. The big question that I wanted cleared up at the end of the last debate was: can any member of this chamber, including the member for Mayo, confidentially ring the Parliamentary Budget Office and ask for work to be done on any topic of their choice? The answer is yes.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  You can have another go, all of you. I am happy if you have information that proves this wrong. The question then is: does the Parliamentary Budget Office, whoever the independent CEO is, have rights of confidential access into Treasury? The answer is yes. 


The member for North Sydney shakes his head. I ask him, please, to get up and tell me his views on why that advice is wrong. Let's get to the heart of whether a confidential process, as a service for members of parliament in this chamber, with nothing to do with the Treasurer and nothing to do with the executive, actually applies. The only point in all of that is whether the Treasurer signs off on a budget or not. It is illogical if we, as a chamber, are asking for a Treasurer not to sign off on the budget. If we accept that then we accept that the figures that are used from the Treasury as the starting point for the process of PEFO, and other similar documents as part of the Charter of Budget Honesty, already apply. What seems to be in place is a direct attack on the independence of the Treasury. I have heard that from speakers twice now.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  It is not independent.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  The member for Mackellar confirms that. The shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance sit either side of the member for Mackellar as she directly attacks the independence of the Treasury.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Correct.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  She again confirms it: 'Correct.' We have silence from the two key finance officers of the coalition. This is a direct attack on the independence of the Treasury. If that is the case—if that is the point of your position in this debate—why on earth did you waste this parliament's time in the last 12 months by participating in a process that arrived at unanimous recommendations? That process involved Barnaby Joyce, Chris Pyne and Kelly O'Dwyer. Why on earth did you waste 16 days after the election reaching an agreement over these proposals for a better parliament? Please explain your position as to why you consider this is not confidential and why it is not independent.

(b) preparing budget estimates (whether at the whole-of-government, agency or program level.

Mr HOCKEY:

Commonwealth bodies to provide information to help prepare report



(1) To help the Treasurer to prepare a budget economic and fiscal outlook report, the Treasurer may request a Commonwealth body to provide information.


That means these are the Treasurer's numbers. They are not the Treasury's numbers, they are the Treasurer's numbers—and you do not understand that.

  Okay, fine. Vote with the government against this amendment and defang the Parliamentary Budget Office. We have given you a chance.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:30):  I rise to support the member for North Sydney's amendments to the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill 2011. We start from the position that the Parliamentary Budget Office is a net positive and it is not new. An OECD survey found that another 18 countries have some sort of legislative parliamentary involvement in setting the fiscal situation with a PBO. The United States has a $45 million per annum budget for its Parliamentary Budget Office. The Dutch Parliamentary Budget Office has more than 150 staff and we have heard about the Canadian budget office. Indeed, this is our idea and ever since 2007 the coalition has driven the idea of a parliamentary budget office. That is why the shadow Treasurer has before the parliament his own bill. It is because those opposite have such a poor record with costing and releasing their policies that we need a parliamentary budget office.



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  You will remember that in 2007 you released your costings the day before the election. In 2010 you released your costings the day before the election.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! I would remind the member for Kooyong not to refer in your speech to 'you'. You are referring to me in this occupied chair, the Deputy Speaker. You will refer to the government or the opposition, please.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  I was simply making the point that when—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You will refer your comments through the chair not at the chair.




Mr FRYDENBERG:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point is that those opposite have a very poor record when it comes to releasing and costing their policies. What happened in 2007 and at the election in 2010 bears that out. The Parliamentary Budget Office amendment we are moving will bring greater transparency to the fiscal situation and fiscal process. It will ensure that non-government MPs and senators and parties have access to the proper costings and it mitigates the disadvantage that those in opposition have against a better resourced government.


We only have to look at what happened with our costings before the last election, when we were looking at the interest to be saved from not proceeding with the NBN. We used the Commonwealth bond rate as the discount rate. It was the NBN implementation study which showed that you should have used the Commonwealth bond rate to assess the amount of savings that you would have if you did not proceed with the NBN, and you would not have that information released.


There are three key criteria that our amendments to this bill are pushing. Firstly, there is confidentiality. Requests to have policies costed should not be immediately put up on the website when they are received. The timing of release of those costings should not be immediately put up on the website and made public once they are done. It should be up to those who are seeking those costings to assess the timing of that release—whether they want to resubmit a request for costing or whether they want to change the assumptions they are putting forward for their particular policy or whether they want to discuss and alter those particular assumptions.


Secondly, there need to be fewer restrictions on the PBO's ability to source material to make its analysis. As the member for North Sydney said: why cannot ABARE, why cannot the Reserve Bank of Australia be able to provide information to the Parliamentary Budget Office for them to make their analysis? Why restrict it to those reports under the Charter of Budget Honesty? That will very much limit the quality of the analysis that is done.


Thirdly, we must increase the powers of the PBO to get information from other departments. Currently, under the government's bill, it is about an MOU. It is just about an MOU with departments but not giving the PBO the ability to compel those departments to release that information. That is why the member for North Sydney has very appropriately suggested that he should use powers akin to those of the Auditor-General in order to source that material from other departments.


The Independents have a privileged position at the moment. They, particularly the Greens, are getting assistance from the government. But that will not always be the case. They need to get behind these amendments we are moving because they are right for the parliament and right for the budget office. (Time expired)

We were highlighting how that is compromised and he was contesting that, if that is a fair characterisation. I draw his attention to proposed section 64L of the bill and I will read it. This is under the heading 'Caretaker period policy costing requests made before polling day—public release of requests and costings.' It says:


This section applies in relation to a policy costing request that is made under subsection 64J(2) or (5) before polling day during the caretaker period for a general election.


It goes on to say:


As soon as practicable after the request has been made and before polling day, the Parliamentary Budget Officer must publicly release the request and a costing of the policy.


That is the practical black-and-white provision to which we were referring and I hope that is helpful. I was seeking to illuminate the parliament—and it is perhaps not as helpful as I might hope it would be and, dare I say it, the Member for Lyne, I have been there before, but I will persevere—and I hope that is helpful. 


The point I was making and that the shadow Treasurer has made is that, up until the caretaker period, the base against which costings are provided is provided by the Treasurer. The Treasurer owns that costing basis. He can do whatever fiscal magic and wisdom he feels is appropriate to release his figures. The point I was trying to emphasise—and perhaps I did not do it well, and I stand admonished for that—is the only time the Treasury has undiluted, unadulterated data during the entire period between elections available is from the PEFO, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. That is the only time, Member for Lyne, that the dataset upon which you are placing such great weight is actually the Treasury's dataset. The rest of the time under those other economic and forecasting bases it is the Treasurer. So if the member for Lyne places such an enormous weight and respect, as I do, on Treasury, let Treasury be heard. That is really what the opposition is on about.


But what we are also saying is if you are only interested—sorry, not you, Madam Deputy Speaker.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Yes, I was going to say to everybody that perhaps if he keeps—




Mr BILLSON:
  I have been pretty good up to that point.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, everybody has been pretty bad. I may enter the debate, seeing as I sat on the inquiry, but I won't be that cheeky. The member for Dunkley has the call.




Mr BILLSON:
  I hope the clerks take that 15 seconds off your time and not mine, Madam Deputy Speaker. The point I was trying to make to the member for Lyne is that if the Treasury figures are to be allowed to be used, let them be used, not the Treasurer's figures. The only time in which the Treasury's figures are used are during the caretaker period. So any effort by anyone in this chamber to rely upon Treasury's figures only happens during the caretaker period where there is this obligation under 64L to release all the material. There is no opportunity to go back on the basis of the analysis that is provided to recalibrate, to contemplate whether it is worth 'moving forward', dare I use a phrase, on the material that is provided—none whatsoever.


So if he is fair dinkum about Treasury, let them be heard. But if he is also only wanting to hear one tune—that we have all got to be on exactly the same tune in this nation's parliament—then persist with his point of view. If he would like to hear other voices, other options, other analysis to make sure there is rigour and robustness to this work, he must support the opposition's amendments, because there is a range of other analysis available that will strengthen the quality of governance in this country, and not have the parliament handcuffed to whatever the Treasurer thinks is advantageous from his political perspective.


We are on about good governance in this country; not what is good for the government. He has been hoodwinked into being locked into this 'PBO Lite' that relies upon the magic of the Treasurer doing whatever he likes with material that Treasury might produce, to have that as the starting point, to say, 'No other voice interests us; no other basis of analysis has any value whatsoever.' I get a bit sick of hearing unctuousness about public servants. We respect public servants, but when they get rolled out and manipulated by a dodgy, poor government, that is a problem for everybody. My last point is: what about the Parliamentary Budget Officer? Is he or she not deserving of the respect to go and source advice where he or she sees fit? I have respect for that position as well, not just some that are chosen to be favoured. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member's time has expired—with extra time for my interruption.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:41):  To try and settle this debate, I have seven questions that I would like to put to the parliamentary secretary. My understanding of the answers to those questions is yes, but if there is any doubt about any of these, it is good for them to be on the record and for us as a parliament to then work them through. 


The first is: does the PBO under this legislation have full and unfettered access to the departments of Treasury and finance? I hope the answer is yes.


The second is: is this access direct—that it does not depend on any minister's office and it will not go through any minister's office? My understanding of that is yes, but I need to hear from the parliamentary secretary if otherwise.


Third: does this allow, therefore, the PBO to question, critique, test any of the forecasts of the budget or of the government more generally? My understanding is yes, but please answer otherwise if it is incorrect.


Fourth: is this direct access unencumbered by any ministerial oversight, providing another critical check and balance for this parliament? My understanding is yes.


Fifth: under these arrangements would it quickly become obvious, as was a point made by the member for North Sydney last week, if there were any fudging of the figures along the lines that were implied last week? My understanding is the PBO would actually add to this parliament and a shadow Treasurer's ability to pick up whether the Treasurer was fudging anything that the Treasury was actually doing.


Sixth: can the PBO inform their analysis by drawing on other sources of information such as the RBA, the IMF, the OECD, whatever? My understanding is yes.


Finally: is the use of forecasts and estimates prepared by Treasury and Finance about providing a more sensible basis for comparison of policy costings, reducing an expensive and unnecessary duplication of effort? Anyone in business understands double-handling is bad. We have got to have a common set of rules from somewhere. I would have thought an undisputed independent Treasury was the place for macroforecasting to be done, and then the politics can go its hardest on the back of that. Can you answer those seven questions to assist the debate?

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:43):  The answer to those questions is yes. In relation to the first one, the PBO does have full and unfettered access to the Department of the Treasury. In relation to whether that access is direct or not, that is correct. In relation to whether or not the PBO has the ability to test that advice, there is nothing in the act to preclude them from being able to test that advice. In relation to whether or not there is the ability for that to occur unencumbered by ministerial interference, the answer to that is yes. In relation to whether or not it would become obvious if there were any fudging, for the reasons I set out earlier in terms of the robust processes that exist to test these forecasts, the answer to that would be yes as well. In relation to whether or not the PBO can inform their analysis by drawing upon forecasts from others, certainly that is an option that is available to them, with exception of course being in relation to the basis upon which costings are to be formed. When it comes to the question of the preparation of costings in relation to particular proposals, that is to be based upon the forecasts that are to be obtained from Treasury.


That goes to the final question that the member for Lyne has asked in relation to a more sensible basis for comparison. That is the very heart of this debate. We need to ensure that, when the public is being given the opportunity to compare one particular set of election commitments with another, they are able to compare apples with apples. It is important that the set of forecasts upon which those costings are to be made is a comparable set of forecasts. That is the key consideration in this whole debate. So the answer to that question of course is yes.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Mayo is warned!




Mr BRADBURY:
  That is why the elements that have been set out in the bill and debated and supported by the government go to the very heart of making sure that there is some integrity in the process.


I do not want to speak at great length, but I will make the point that, if this bill is passed and becomes legislation, for the first time oppositions will have the opportunity to test polices and cost those policies on an ongoing and iterative basis. That is something that is not currently available. That will be a major advancement in allowing a more level playing field when it comes to costing policies, particularly throughout the non-election period, and that will assist oppositions in a way that they do not currently have assistance under the Charter of Budget Honesty.


In relation to the importance of that point and the question that goes to this amendment regarding forecasts, I simply make the point that it is essential that, when the public is being given an opportunity to test the value of the proposals that have been put forward by the respective parties, they can have some confidence that the parameters and the forecasts upon which those costings have been based are comparable. If that were not the case, that would lead to a very destructive and very wasteful discussion, particularly in the course of election campaigns, around parameters and assumptions rather than where that debate should be focused, which is on the question of the actual costs of the proposals that have been put forward by the respective parties, so that the electors, the people of Australia, can go to that election in full confidence that the policies of the respective parties have been properly and comparably costed so that they can make their judgments. It is on that basis that we are opposed to the amendment that the member for North Sydney has brought forward.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:47):  I rise in support of the amendment brought forward by the shadow Treasurer to strengthen the independence of the Parliamentary Budget Office. We on this side of the chamber are the only people interested in a rigorous analysis on the economic and fiscal impacts of policy proposals, which is why we brought forward our very own bill. Let us not forget that it was actually this side of the chamber that brought forward, before the last election, a policy to initiate a parliamentary budget office. That is why we are having this debate in the chamber today—not because of any agreement with the Independents but because the coalition brought forward this policy before the last election.


This has not been a longstanding commitment of the government. They rushed in legislation in response to our policy proposal, and their legislation is deficient. That is why the shadow Treasurer has needed to bring forward an amendment, which he has done so very ably. What he has brought forward is an amendment to make sure that the Parliamentary Budget Office, when it is brought into effect, will be an independent parliamentary budget office, that it will not be unduly restricted in what it can look at and what it can do in the performance of its role and function. Critical to that, of course, is the fact that it should be able to have regard to its own ability to perform economic forecasts and budget estimates. It can of course have regard to Treasury's economic forecasts and budget estimates, but it also should be able to initiate its own if in fact it believes it is required.


The government's bill restricts the ability of the Parliamentary Budget Office to look at only Treasury and Finance figures, and this of course goes to the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its own functions. We believe that this will, unfortunately, make a of the eunuch parliamentary budget office. Unlike the US Congressional Budget Office or the Canadian Parliamentary Office, it will be a parliamentary budget office which is a parliamentary budget office in name only.


I was on the joint committee that recommended that a parliamentary budget office be initiated. I, along with the Independents, agreed that we needed to have a parliamentary budget office that had the power to gather information, a parliamentary budget office that would be independent and would not be unduly restricted. Unfortunately, though, I think the bill before us today will in fact restrict the ability of the Parliamentary Budget Office to perform its role and function, which is why we have needed to bring forward the amendment that we have.


I notice that the government has not been able to respond to the amendment that has been brought forward. It has not been able to provide one sensible reason as to why it cannot accept the amendment. Instead, I notice that, on the weekend, the Treasurer put out a media release that attacked our amendment by saying that it went to our economic competence. It said, in fact, that we were economically incompetent. That is a little bit like Silvio Berlusconi giving a critique on the virtues of celibacy. It is a little bit like the member for Dobell telling us about the importance of good governance and financial accounting.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Higgins is straying.




Ms O'DWYER:
  It is not something that is remotely credible for the government to say. We believe, as I have just said—and which has been said by all of my colleagues—that a transparent, independent budget office that is not restricted in the performance of its role and function is the most critical thing that we can achieve here today. If we get this wrong today, we will be getting it wrong for the future. That is why it is so critical that the government actually answer the question that has been brought forward by the amendments that the shadow Treasurer has put on the table today. They cannot provide one reason why we should not be able to accept the amendments brought forward by the shadow Treasurer. I think they should simply accept that our amendments will improve their bill, and they should support them.

It has been a bit of a rocky start, but I have shown that I am willing to support the opposition when they have a good initiative. I have to say that on this particular issue I do believe the opposition has lost its way.


I pose three questions to the member for North Sydney. My first question is: will the member for North Sydney now withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on the Treasury and the claim that it is politicised? My second question is: why won't you now support an initiative which the opposition supported unanimously in committee—did someone belatedly realise that there had been an inadvertent episode of being constructive? My third question is: why all the focus in here this afternoon on the need for confidentiality during an election campaign, when, if the opposition stopped saying no to everything and instead did some good policy development work now, they could get everything they want costed in confidence before the next election campaign?

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:54):  In answer to question 1: no. In relation to question 2: you clearly have not even read the report that has come before this parliament on this bill, because in fact the specific amendment I am moving at the moment is not even a recommendation in the report.




Mr Bradbury:
  It is dealt with under the report.




Mr HOCKEY:
  It is not a recommendation of the report. Have you read the report? I would urge you to read the report that you are referring to. In response to the third question, relating to constructive analysis: we have not said that we will not reveal all of our costings before the next election. We have said we will but we are not going to submit our costings to a parliamentary budget office or a Treasury that is an arm of the government and is using government data. Full stop.


If the member for Denison had looked at all the other amendments when I endeavoured to engage in conversation about this bill, he would see that in fact what we are doing through these amendments is making the PBO more independent and more accountable to the parliament. That is why I said this is the chance; there may not be a second chance in the next parliament. And I would say to the member for Denison: look carefully at our amendments, have a good think about them and ask yourself whether these would enhance the power of the Parliamentary Budget Office and not reduce it.


I do not understand why the Independents—and I say this very genuinely—are so hogtied to the government on this bill. It is not a bill that goes to good government; it is a bill that goes to the integrity of the parliament and to the independence of the chamber. We were the ones who initiated a parliamentary budget office policy. Malcolm Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition did that, and it was carried on by the current Leader of the Opposition. We went to the last election promising to introduce a parliamentary budget office. Senator Guy Barnett in the other place had worked on this initiative for an extended period of time. This is not anything new. We are the ones who actually put forward the initiative. We were the ones who introduced a bill.




Mr Briggs:
  We introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Exactly right. We are the ones who introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty. And we are the ones now who are introducing a bill for a PBO. The government only reacts when it is forced to do so. Obviously the Independents feel that they have done a deal with the government—they have made their decisions even though they do not even know what they are talking about—so be it. That is the way it is; let it be on their heads.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:57):  I have some questions for the parliamentary secretary. Firstly, I would be grateful if he could confirm or otherwise that Canada and its parliamentary budget office now carry out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends. Secondly, I would like the parliamentary secretary to confirm that in the United States the Congressional Budget Office carries out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends. Thirdly, I would ask the parliamentary secretary to explain why in Australia the Parliamentary Budget Office, as pronounced in this bill, will not allow that authority to carry out independent analysis on the state of the nation's finances and trends?


The next question relates to the issue of access to Treasury data. The member for Lyne asserted and then asked a question about the PBO. He said that the Parliamentary Budget Office would get private access to Treasury data and analysis and would have the ability to make their own assessment of Treasury data and analysis on a confidential basis. The parliamentary secretary confirmed; he said yes to all of those propositions. So I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary: if the government's Parliamentary Budget Office is put into place, would the Parliamentary Budget Office get access to things such as the modelling to do with the carbon tax, which has been carried out extensively? Will the Parliamentary Budget Office get access to the variables and all of the assumptions embodied in that analysis? Do you want to take some notes, or have you got all this in your head? I am just getting a bit worried. I am onto question 11—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Goldstein has the call and the member for Mayo should remember that he has been warned.




Mr Bradbury:
  When you say 'you', are you referring to me?




Mr ROBB:
  I said 'the parliamentary secretary', thanks very much.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary is not assisting and my patience is being worn down by everybody.




Mr ROBB:
  It would be better if the parliamentary secretary were to take notes rather than putting cheap shots across the chamber. I am very worried that I am not going to get answers to any of this, and it is quite relevant to the two Independents up here—and I am going to disregard the patronising cheap shots from the member for Denison in all of that. I ask: would the Parliamentary Budget Office be able to get access to Treasury modelling of, say, the education rebate? It is modelling that we were denied in the 3½ hours that we met with the Treasury officials. We got told to pull our heads in, effectively, and to take what they had to say—even though we had commissioned modelling from NATSEM, which Treasury uses. But they said there is a $900 million black hole, and we were told, 'You cop it.' That is what we were told, and you call that not interference. That was no cooperation whatsoever, and you have got the hide to stand up there and say that we are playing games. This is very serious business. They are in government because of the way in which that material was mishandled by Treasury and then by the government, and how you lapped it up! How those members lapped it up!


The next question I would like to ask is quite critical. In fact, I might come back to it in a minute, because I am running out of time. According to this bill as I read it: in the caretaker period if you present any proposal, automatically the costing of that is released immediately. I reserve the right to come back and finish that proposition. (Extension of time granted) The critical point in all of this, the thing that has really got our back up, is the proposition—and one of our own members of the committee has confirmed this—that unanimous agreements are not being delivered upon in this bill. The thing that is really getting up our nose is the fact that if we present a proposal, or two alternative proposals, to the Parliamentary Budget Office in the caretaker period, where we are trying to explore the relative merits of that proposal, or some competing proposals, we are trying to compare the relative merits. We are trying to come up with an answer which is economically responsible, economically doable, robust and independently assessed. If we present those two alternatives, over which we have taken no final decision, is it true that the analysis and costing of those two proposals—over which we have taken no final decision but we are in the caretaker period—will be automatically released? That is how we read this bill, and the shadow Treasurer's amendments go to making it absolutely crystal clear that that is not the case and that in fact we could test some proposals that we are looking at the relative merits of before we have made a final decision and keep in confidence the costings of those two proposals. If you say that it is true that those costings have to be released, no-one can form any other conclusion than that this is an act of politicising this whole Parliamentary Budget Office.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:05):  I would cede to the parliamentary secretary to answer the questions, but he was not making any movement to rise to answer them. I have in front of me a 'note for file: post-briefing feedback for the opposition; meetings of Independent MPs with departmental secretaries.' As I read through it, I see that follow-up question No. 1 was to have some, but every other question says, 'no follow-up'. On the questions where our costings were challenged by Treasury, I went through earlier, chapter and verse—before the member for Denison came into the chamber but the member for Lyne was here—why the disallowing of a legitimate saving of $2.5 billion with regard to our conservative bias allowance savings was knocked out by Treasury. I went through why the $3.3 billion of expenditure savings against the Health and Hospital Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund were knocked out by Treasury and why the $2.4 billion saving that was put in place with regard to the NBN was knocked out. We had assessed that the savings that would be made on interest payable was 5.5 per cent, which was the average of the 10-year bond rate for six months leading up to the election, and Treasury said, 'No, we've decided it's 4.9 per cent,' and I said that I had taken out the figures today showing that, in fact, the bond rate from July 2010 to August 2011 is 5.23 per cent. And yet that was knocked out. Why were the $600,000 of savings from putting people back into the workforce—people over 50 and under 30—knocked out by Treasury, because they called it 'a second-round effect', whereas in fact they allowed it for the government in their own budget papers, as they had indeed allowed other things for the government and denied them for the opposition.


Then there was a further $1.5 billion knocked out by Treasury with regard to the savings that could be made on the PBS, whereas the forecast was that 40 per cent could be saved and the government's legislative base was 23 per cent. A further 17 per cent in savings was available, which was accounted for in the $1.15 billion.


That totals $9.95 billion knocked out by Treasury, and you accepted it according to these minutes. When the question was asked about the bottom line impact of the department's costings, that was when you decided that you would go with this lot, the government of the day and not us. The answer came back from Mr Henry, who, as I said, has been rewarded by the new appointment in the Prime Minister's office.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (17:10):  I wanted to just address a couple of issues which were raised earlier, particularly one raised by the member for Denison who said, in one of his cheap shots, as the member for Goldstein described, about doing work now in preparation for the next election campaign to avoid the release of confidential information which you would be familiar with. Budgets change. Numbers change quite substantially over a period of time, so much so that the government of the day's numbers change between the mid-year budget review and the final outcome. In fact, we do not know what the final outcome of the budget was last year, because the revenue numbers change and the parameters you work with change.


If you understood the Commonwealth budget and how budgeting works, member for Denison, you would understand that you cannot do a costing now for a tax cut you might want in two years time for an election campaign. Guess who does not do that themselves? The executive. So, in your view, it is okay for the executive to have that right to test their policies to get it right but not for the opposition or in fact yourself. That is completely illogical, but we should not be surprised, I guess. It is as logical as attacking any public servant appointed by John Howard but then getting outraged if anyone raises questions about current public servants. It is a completely illogical position. It is all right to slander the former Prime Minister, but if it is anyone in this place it is a great outrage. Hypocrite—absolute hypocrite.


I go back to the issues raised by the member for Lyne. I point this out to him: in the questions he raised to the parliamentary secretary, who did not answer those questions, he did not point to the sections but said, 'There is nothing which will stop it.' I thought that was a fascinating answer for the third question you raised. I put this to you, member for Lyne: 64B of the bill says:


Purpose of Parliamentary Budget Office


The purpose of the Parliamentary Budget Office—


I am reading from the bill—


is to inform the Parliament by providing, in accordance with this Division, independent and non-partisan analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of proposals.


It then directly rules that out when in 64E2 it says:


The Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions under subsection (1) do not include:


(a) preparing economic forecasts; or


(b) preparing budget estimates


Give me a break. This is an absolute sell-out of this policy. If you want to go through the history, you do not own this. In fact, this was owned by the coalition who proposed this in the budget in reply, but that is not the point. If we want good outcomes in this place, if you want the parliament to work properly, as you say—and I take you at your word on that—this is a really good reform if you make some changes. What they are proposing is a halfway house.


It is the same as when the Labor Party opposed the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1996. We do not take these people on trust. They opposed the Charter of Budget Honesty in 1996 because they completely politicised the process in 1995 and 1996. The member for Denison probably forgets that. It might have been one of his hazy periods. They completely politicised the budget process in that time, and that is why, when the Howard government came to power, there was a $10 billion black hole in the budget. That is how the Charter of Budget Honesty came about.


This is our proposal from when the member for Wentworth was the Leader of the Opposition. It is a good proposal, with some improvements, including making it genuinely independent to give it the power to make its own forecasts. You know what: the Treasury is not always right. They would say to you themselves that they are not always right. It is economic forecasting. Access Economics does it. Lots of people do it. Lots of people on the internet do it these days. It should be a contested thing. We should have the right to improve policies in this place and get decent and genuinely independent access to information, including forecasts. This is a good amendment. It is not about playing politics; it is improving what is decent reform in this place.

The assertion that was being raised by the member for Lyne was around our concern about the inability to obtain confidential independent advice, weigh policy options and even analyse announcements made by others to see where they might be improved through calibration and policy settings. The opportunity to do that confidentially is denied to the opposition and to all Independents during the caretaker period. As I sought to do before, I draw his attention to section 64L of the bill, which makes that quite explicit. If he wants a rewritten account of that, page 10 of the explanatory memorandum emphasises that point quite clearly.


To draw connections between why that should be of concern to Independent members and all members in this place and why it should be of concern to the broader Australian public, my friend and colleague the member for Mayo points to a very excellent example. In 1996, we were all told the budget was in surplus by the then Labor government, only to find a $10.4 billion black hole that took considerable expertise and adultness to work through to put the budget back into surplus. That leads to the point that, under the construct that the Independents seem to be shackled to, they seem to overlook the consequences of some of the settings within this bill. One is the caretaker period. There is no opportunity for private consideration and discourse, recalibration, weighing up of options or even examining other proposals that might come forward, even from the member for Lyne. There is no chance to look at that or at whether there may be some opportunity for improvement, dare that be conceivable.


Going back to 1996, the other point is that that is the only point in time when the Treasury's figures were available. If the member for Lyne and the member for Denison have such love and affection for the Treasury figures and point to them as such a credible and solid foundation for analysis, why then deny the parliament and all the members in this place the chance to have policy ideas costed against those figures?


The member for Denison was quite right and very insightful: policy work is an ongoing process. Even in my portfolio area of small business, there is some policy that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet blue book said would boost productivity. I am happy to have that work outsourced so the government could actually do something about small business. That work is an ongoing process, but the member and others would rightly criticise the opposition if we were not using the most up-to-date data for our costings. In the entire period between elections and the issuing of writs, we are beholden—we are hogtied—to the Treasurer's numbers, which in case after case have been illustrated as not as reliable and robust as they can be, because the Treasurer can influence them and, dare I say, adulterate them from what the Treasury may have provided and inject new assumptions. The only time there is purity in those numbers is during the election period. You would expect us to go back to those numbers to make sure they are up to date and as reliable as possible on the least adulterated data available, the Treasury figures, and that only happens during the caretaker period. There is an obligation under this bill that that work gets released publicly.


Please join up the dots. This is not that hard. It is PBO, pretty bleeding obvious, that what the government is trying to do here is nobble this process so we are all shackled and handcuffed to whatever the Treasurer expects to be the starting point for this analysis, and the only time we can get away from that and have pure Treasury figures as the starting point is during the election period, when there is no confidentiality. This is not that complicated.


I urge you to look at those points. I take you at your word that those things matter. If they matter, I am finding it hard to work out why you are not actually connecting the facts that are in these bills with that concern and the reason that the opposition's amendments are so important. I take you at your word, but you are all backswing at the moment and no follow-through. The follow-through would see you back the opposition's amendments if you are genuinely concerned about those points. Nice backswing; we are looking for a bit of follow-through, gentlemen.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:19):  I would like to address some of the questions that were asked in this debate by the member for Goldstein. The questions broadly fit into the following categories. The first one was in relation to other models of parliamentary budget office and the extent to which some of those models may be empowered to create their own forecasts. I can confirm that there are other parliamentary budget offices across the world that do have the capacity to generate their own forecasts, but that is not the model that the government has decided to go with. In fact, we are not going with that model because we happen to agree with the recommendations and, indeed, the content of the report that was handed down by the joint select committee.


I know that the member for North Sydney has made much of the fact that he says there is no finding or recommendation in the committee report. The committee report, at item 3.100, reads:


Given the resource intensive nature of the work and the need to minimise the duplication of work produced elsewhere, the PBO should not be required to produce its own fiscal forecasts. Rather, it should provide analysis of the Government's fiscal forecasts, commenting on the assumptions, judgements and overall reliability of Government assessments.


That is what was in the report and that is why the government has gone down the path it has.


The report indicated that this is a very resource-intensive exercise. It might be worth putting on the record the fact that Treasury currently has 30 officers engaged in economic forecasting and a further 50 engaged in revenue forecasting, and Finance's budget group has around 250 officers, all of whom are engaged in preparing the budget forecasts. I think we can see that, apart from it being a waste of time to duplicate those functions in a new entity, it would be a waste of resources—a waste of money. That is why the government has not opted to go that way. But the most significant reason why we have not opted to create an alternative set of forecasts and assumptions in the PBO is comparability of the costings. I note that in today's Herald Ross Gittins made the very point that the government relies upon. He said:


It is infinitely preferable that all parties' costings be prepared on the same basis—


rather than allowing oppositions to choose different economic forecasts or different budget parameters and costing conventions. Exactly. The second set of questions which the member for Goldstein asked was about the free flow of information. I can confirm that there will be unfettered and free access, subject to privacy provisions and the usual FOI requirements that operate outside the regime that is envisaged here. But that will occur, and that is contained within the bill.




Mr Hockey:
  Where's that?




Mr BRADBURY:
  Section 64F.



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  It refers to a memorandum of understanding type arrangement, and that will put in place as the mechanism for the free flow of information. The third—and, I think, the most significant—set of questions raised by the member for Goldstein was about the confidentiality of costings during the caretaker period. These questions go to the nub of why the opposition, who unanimously supported these propositions in the committee process, have come forward now and opposed them. Why are they opposed to them? They are opposed to them because they know that under these arrangements their election commitments will be subjected to the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Budget Office. It is true that a matter which is publicly announced—and that is the key; what the legislation refers to is 'publicly announced'—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
 The opposition has two years and 11 months of the parliamentary term to do the hard yards on policy. If the opposition cannot do the hard yards on policy throughout the two years and 11 months and instead have to rely upon the possibility of putting in election costings during the election campaign, it shows just how lazy the current opposition is.



Let us call this what it is, because this is all about one thing, and it is a very simple proposition: the coalition, now that they have stumbled across the fact that they have the huge challenge of a $70 billion black hole, have discovered that they need to construct an alibi so that they can avoid being held to account for the fiscal atrocities that they are about to commit. We know that these fiscal atrocities are going to be grievous. There is a $70 black hole, and they know how difficult a job that is. If casting aspersions, denying the importance of this reform and challenging the credibility of the PBO is what they need to do to avoid any scrutiny when it comes to the next election, that is exactly what they will do. They will try to talk down this body, because to do that is to deny— (Time expired)

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (17:24):  I am deeply troubled by the lingering accusation in this place that the Treasury is politicised. I applaud some members of the opposition, who have trod around this issue much more carefully than some of their colleagues, but as it is at the moment the member for North Sydney has refused to withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on Treasury through the claim that it is politicised, and the member for Mackellar, by refusing to withdraw her comment, has not helped things at all.


For the public record, so it is absolutely clear to everyone in this country, I ask the member for North Sydney: will you now withdraw and apologise for the opposition's attack on the Treasury and the claim that it is politicised?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  I gave latitude to the member for Denison before, but I say now that this is the consideration in detail stage and that we should actually be addressing the amendments before us. Does he have anything else he wants to add, or has he concluded?

  No—thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:26):  The concerns of the member for Denison will be addressed if the amendments proposed by the member for North Sydney are adopted. The parliamentary secretary sought to answer some of the questions I asked, but in doing so he exposed the motivation of the government in the way in which they have interpreted the committee's recommendations.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  The fact of the matter is that the only time that we see Treasury data in its rawest form, so the member for Denison can be satisfied that we are working with Treasury data unadulterated, is when PEFO is released. PEFO is not released until 10 days after the issuing of the writs—is that correct?



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  Right?




Mr Bradbury:
  You're telling the story.




Mr ROBB:
  Yes, right. Let us say that we had obtained access 10 days into the caretaker period, and we wished to see whether the policy proposals that we had been preparing for three years—




Mr Bradbury:
  What have you got at the moment?




Mr ROBB:
  The reason your government is in such trouble is that you did not prepare any policy in three years—that is the reason. We would want to wait for PEFO, despite having prepared a raft of policy, so that we got the latest statistics on costings when we released our documents publicly. Let us say that the government released a policy in the second week of the campaign and that we wanted to prepare and release a variation on that; or that we were preparing to release something, but it was partly covered by the government's policy. If you wanted to assess the merits of the policy, you are telling me, Parliamentary Secretary, that, if we put it into the office, the detail of that would be automatically released. We would not have the opportunity to make a considered assessment of whether that was affordable—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, do I have to put up with these cheap shots?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary will stop interrupting.




Mr ROBB:
  The Treasurer has sent a boy on a man's errand here—that is what we have found out tonight. Why doesn't he have the courage to come in here and answer these questions? The only way you are answering any questions is with the help of the advisers over there; you have no idea yourself, Parliamentary Secretary. Why isn't the Treasurer here to answer these accusations? This is a very important issue. An election swung on it last time, and now we are sitting here with the parliamentary secretary grinning over at his advisers to see if they will give him another piece of advice that he can come up to the box with.


On the free flow of information, which the member for Lyne quite appropriately asked a question about, you have just confirmed, Parliamentary Secretary, that if the Parliamentary Budget Office is set up as you have described it and as it is embodied in the bill and if the office went confidentially they could get access to the assumptions, the variables and the modelling for such things as the education rebate and the carbon tax. I would be grateful if you could properly and directly answer the following questions. Would the Parliamentary Budget Office get private and confidential access to the modelling of such things as the education rebate and the carbon tax—not only to the outcomes but also to the hundreds of assumptions and to the way in which that model was written? Would it have the ability to get an assessment of what would happen if some of those variables were changed?


If you are true to the broad statement you made before, you will answer yes to that. If you cannot answer yes to that, the member for Lyne and the member for Denison and every other person in this chamber should be deeply concerned about the motive, the veracity, the credibility and the integrity of this process. On two counts now—firstly, on the access to private information and, secondly, on the presentation of policies before an election in the caretaker period—you have created great doubt. (Time expired)

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (17:31):  I think the parliamentary secretary really summed up the government's position. He said that other parliamentary budget offices have the capacity for independent analysis but the government has chosen not to have it with this.




Mr Bradbury:
  I said some.




Mr Briggs:
  Just the big ones!




Mr HOCKEY:
  Well, some. The big ones, like the Canadian budget office and the United States Congressional Budget Office. But that is okay, because now the Independents are about to support a lesser model, in the words of the parliamentary secretary. He said: 'Hang on, guys. We decided—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  You did that! I encourage you to get a copy of the Hansard. It was a telling admission after how many hours of debate? He has now accepted that the government—




Mr Bradbury:
  It was the committee.




Mr HOCKEY:
  And now he is blaming the committee! There can never be any difference of opinion between this chamber and a committee! That is impossible to countenance!



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  Keep digging, old china! Now we have a new rule for this chamber. This chamber is not allowed to disagree with a committee, even though the amendment immediately before the House was not a recommendation of the committee. This chamber is not allowed under any circumstances to disagree with a recommendation of a committee. So we are the echo chamber of a parliamentary committee. That is all it is.


What most interested me in this debate is that, after admitting that this is a lesser parliamentary budget office than those of other countries, the parliamentary secretary then went on to say, 'Yes,' in answer to the member for Lyne, who has already made up his mind but who did ask a question about—



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  No, I do not think there is any change coming, mate. Sorry to let you down. I do not think he ever moves on these things. It was quite interesting when the member for Lyne asked the question about access to information from Treasury. The parliamentary secretary just retorted: 'Section 64F. Look at that. That is how you are going to get the information out of Treasury.' Now, I have read section 64F—I do not know if the member for Lyne has—and it says:


The Parliamentary Budget Officer may make an arrangement—


This is the subject of another of my amendments. It says the PBO may make an arrangement. Not 'will', not 'must', not 'shall', but 'may':


in writing, with the Head … of a Commonwealth body … to obtain from the body information and documents relevant to the Parliamentary Budget Officer's functions.


I am prepared to put my wallet on this table and make a bet with the member for Lyne. Here is 20 bucks, right here. I seek leave to table $20.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  The member for North Sydney would be aware that that is not a parliamentary thing to do.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am seeking leave.


Leave not granted.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am prepared to put $20 on the table to have a bet with the member for Lyne that the only source of information this body will have out of the Treasury will be the Treasury forecast in the MYEFO or the budget. I bet that the MOU, if it should ever be agreed between the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Treasury, will never extend to getting any further information out of the Treasury other than that which is published. I am betting my money here because that is what this piece of legislation says. It says you can only use the budget numbers—that is, the Treasurer's numbers—and should you require any further information you need to have an MOU, a memorandum of understanding, with the department from the PBO. What a laugh!



Mr Oakeshott interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am sorry, but I understand the legislation. It is in here. It is going to come as a rude shock, but it is actually in the legislation and I look forward—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. I indicate to members that it is extremely unseemly to be casting bets around in this chamber and I will ask that you desist from doing so.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am happy not to have a bet. I am just using that line. Perhaps we can lay something more significant on the line, like the seat of the member for Lyne. Maybe we could lay his seat on the line and see whether this turns out to be the case.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:36):  To reiterate a point the shadow Treasurer made, the saviour that the parliamentary secretary sought to offer was the prospect of an elusive MOU. We have established that we are handcuffed to the Treasurer's numbers. The only time we get a clear run at Treasury numbers is during the election period, when there is no confidentiality. I am grateful that it was not necessary for me to hand over the bill, but now we are relying on the provision that relates to the memorandum. I can just imagine a department secretary saying: 'Look, I've had this approach from the Parliamentary Budget Office. It's been so hollowed out by the parliament because the executive doesn't want it actually doing what parliamentary budget offices do in other jurisdictions, and now there's a memorandum of understanding.' Does anyone—particularly the Independents—think for one minute that an MOU will trump the legislation of the parliament? Does anyone think that will happen? Does anyone think that the department—the Treasury officials—will sit there and say, 'Look, I know there's been this express wish of the parliament, as reflected in the legislation.'


The parliamentary secretary has rolled out all of these spurious and incredibly unpersuasive arguments about why it is in the national interest to nobble the Parliamentary Budget Office before it even starts. Then Treasury officials say, 'Well, there is scope for us to enter into an MOU.' Do you think for one minute that that MOU will go anywhere further? Of course it will not. It may even be more restrictive than what the parliament said. It might even say: 'Now that you're nobbled to the Treasurer's numbers and PEFO, we don't even want you to be critical of those; that's under the MOU.' The MOU might say, 'You can't criticise any of the pre-election data or challenge any of the economic foundations in the forecasts, so, on the basis of the MOU, we will provide you with that material only so long as you are completely respectful and not in any way contradicting what the Treasury—or in this case the Treasurer—has had to say,' or the MOU might simply go down to: 'Would you like it on an Excel spreadsheet? Can we send it electronically? How quickly would you like it? If it happens to be late on a Friday night, is Monday okay?' Come on, Parliamentary Secretary! We know you are a lightweight in the Treasury portfolio, but do not tell the parliament or try to reassure the Independents that this completely empty, vacuous argument you put up has anything to do with the substantive issues that we are debating here.


The MOU will add nothing to this debate. It risks actually constraining further the information that is available. If it goes to information at all, it will not touch on any of the assumptions, any of the modelling or any of the various parameters that have been set and selected. It will not go to that; it will actually be more focused on the process of obtaining the already constrained information. The executive is hell-bent on making sure that only its view of the economic world and forecast ever sees the light of day.


I go back to where this started, the PBO—pretty bleeding obvious! They are trying to take the heart out of this, deny it to the Independents and deny it the respect that the Parliamentary Budget Officer deserves—and that is to satisfy himself or herself on what should be the basis of calculations that he or she is undertaking. That should be what is available here, and for the parliamentary secretary to come up and say, 'Hey, the MOU's the answer for everything,' is just utter, utter nonsense.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:39):  I am just concerned that I get an answer to the last two questions that I put to the parliamentary secretary. I will reiterate. As I understand it, Parliamentary Secretary, you confirmed to the member for Lyne—




Mr Oakeshott:
  To the House.




Mr ROBB:
  In response to the member for Lyne's question.




Mr Oakeshott:
  Yes—to the House.




Mr ROBB:
  Either way, I am happy. You confirmed to the House in response to the member for Lyne's question that if the Parliamentary Budget Office as embodied in your bill wants to see, privately and confidentially, the modelling of the carbon tax, the education rebate or any other modelling for that matter—if it wants to see the assumptions that have been made, the variables that have been included, the code that has been written and the impact of changing certain assumptions on the outcomes—then that is in fact embodied in this legislation. If that is true, that is a huge step forward. I would be grateful if you could confirm whether that is true or not.


Secondly, I would be grateful if you could also confirm that, under this Parliamentary Budget Office as espoused by the government, if we as an opposition, in the third week of the caretaker period of the next legislation, present two competing proposals which we are looking to get costed so that we can make—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  You have your chance to answer the question; let me just put it first so that people can understand what I am getting at. Suppose that we in the third week of the caretaker period of the forthcoming campaign, from opposition, have two competing proposals to achieve a similar objective and we wish to have those costed so that we can find out which is the proposal which has most merit, which is economically the best, which one may be robust and which one may be less affected by changes in the economic environment. If we wish to have that analysis done, are you saying, Parliamentary Secretary, that this bill requires that material to be made public on both of those considerations before we have made a decision?

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (17:43):  I will address those two points. As I indicated earlier, in relation to the ability to access information, proposed section 64F provides the mechanism through which a memorandum of understanding can be brought into effect, and that would provide sufficient opportunity for access to that information.


In relation to the second question that the member for Goldstein has asked, on the provision of materials for costing during the caretaker period, I draw the member's attention to proposed section 64J of the bill, which provides the direction in relation to matters that might be brought forward for costing during the caretaker period. At proposed section 64J(2), the bill reads:


An authorised member of a Parliamentary party may request the Parliamentary Budget Officer to prepare a costing of a publicly announced policy of the Parliamentary party.


That, in effect, is no different to the way in which the Charter of Budget Honesty occurs in relation to the caretaker period.




Mr Hockey:
  It is just a duplication of the Charter of Budget Honesty.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I find that amusing because, for all of the time I observed those within the Howard government, they held up the Charter of Budget Honesty as though it were some particular beacon for good governance. 



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  The member for Mayo will withdraw!




Mr Briggs:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a bit befuddled about what I am withdrawing but, whatever it is, I will withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Mr BRADBURY:
  I am equally as befuddled about this suggestion that, somehow, the opposition is now not holding up the Charter of Budget Honesty as some beacon of good governance. The committee inquiry in its report did indicate that there were some deficiencies in the Charter of Budget Honesty Act, in particular, in relation to the uneven way in which those provisions treat governments and oppositions.


The proposals contained within this bill are significant and they are a significant step forward that will assist oppositions. It is not often you see a government come forward and support a set of proposals that in fact do provide assistance to oppositions in carrying out their functions. In fact, when the coalition introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, they were single-minded in their attempt to make it as difficult as possible for oppositions then and into the future. And, having now come into opposition, they have seen just how hard that is. I will not restate the debacle that was the $11 billion black hole, other than to make this point, and that is that the provisions that the member for Goldstein is referring to essentially represent the way in which the Charter of Budget Honesty currently operates. Collectively, the amendments that the opposition are bringing forward represent a very desperate attempt to weaken the Charter of Budget Honesty. In fact, I will conclude by making this point in relation to the confidentiality provisions to which the member for Goldstein is referring.


Under the proposals that are being put forward in these amendments by the opposition, it would be possible for the opposition in the caretaker period to bring forward a set of policies that may be publicly announced, to have them costed but, in the event that their confidentiality provisions were allowed to prevail, then there would not be a requirement for the PBO to release those details. Under your proposals, that is what you have suggested. The other amendment that you are moving would suggest—



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr BRADBURY:
  With great respect, this has been a wide-ranging debate and the question I have been asked does not go to this amendment either; it goes to the amendment to which I am referring. I make the point that, under the amendments that have been brought forward by the opposition, you could have a situation where they publicly announce a policy, they take it to the PBO, they do not like the answer that they get from the PBO, they go off to one of their accounting firms—one of their mates—and they get alternative costings and then they shop around for the one they want. We do not want that. We want a comparable set of benchmarks and that is why we are proposing this system. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:48):  This has taken us about 2½ hours, but the parliamentary secretary has finally confirmed that the caretaker period under the proposal that is embodied in this government's Parliamentary Budget Office is absolutely no different to the situation we confronted at the last election and the election before that. We have a choice: we can use non-current Treasury data before the caretaker period or we can wait for PEFO—PEFO is very important data—and get accurate assessments of alternative policies, some of which we have not yet made a decision on because it depends on what data the PEFO comes up with. Those will be used and abused by the government. This is a total stitch-up and you have confirmed it. You have confirmed today that the only thing this does is give us access to costings well ahead of an election. That is what you have confirmed.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  Can I just ask the member for Goldstein to make it clear that it is not me who is doing that. You were speaking through the chair.




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I apologise for that. The second thing is that we have heard great defences of Treasury here from the member for Denison, the member for Lyne and others, but both they and the parliamentary secretary have continued to cast imputations on me and the member for North Sydney. That is against standing orders. However, it is not against standing orders to cast imputations against others other than members.

Mr ROBB:
  None of the people here, including the member for Hunter—was that you just throwing in your two-penneth? You have not been here for 2½ hours.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Hunter is out of his seat, so he will not be intervening at all.




Mr ROBB:
  Now that we have confirmed that nothing has changed and that, as far as the caretaker period is concerned, this is a total stitch-up, why are we wasting our time on this bill in this place? If you are going to use and abuse the office of government to misrepresent the findings of a committee, why are we wasting our time here when we will end up in the same dogfight again next time? Why not have a process where we can get rid of the calculations at a point of contention and then we can debate the merit of policy during the campaign. No, you are not prepared to do that. You just want to get down in the gutter again at the next election and spend 33 days casting aspersions on our ability to make assessments of the costings, when we would like to have an independent office which makes its own judgment of your policies and our policies so that we can take this costing process out of the public arena and we can debate policy. That is the root of the problem. The second thing is that the parliamentary secretary has again, in a very—

Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, do you have several debates going on here or not?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  I might have the call but I am having trouble hearing myself because of the Leader of the House. 



A government member:  You're not missing much!




Mr ROBB:
  That is true. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We will all stop interjecting and the member for Goldstein will continue his remarks through the chair and not refer to 'you' as often as he has been.




Mr ROBB:
  I will forget 'you'. The parliamentary secretary very craftily slipped around the second issue. I did ask him very explicitly whether, if the Parliamentary Budget Office wanted to get access to the carbon tax modelling and the assumptions—to all of the variables—and the impact of changes in those assumptions—



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  I am asking a question. Do you want to listen or do you just want to prattle on over there?



Government members interjecting—




Mr ROBB:
  You are not in this debate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein will resume his seat for a moment. I indicate that there has been a great deal of interjection, including interjections by members on their own speakers. The debate has been robust and I have allowed it to run but it is now my feeling that it is getting out of hand. The member for Goldstein will not respond to other conversations in the room. Those having other conversations will take them outside. The member for Goldstein has the call but his time is up. Is the member for Goldstein seeking the call a second time?




Mr ROBB:
  I am. (extension of time granted) Thank you for that privilege. The second point I would like to raise is the fact that I asked, quite specifically and directly, of the parliamentary secretary whether the Parliamentary Budget Office would have access to the variables and the modelling and the opportunity to change assumptions in that modelling and assess the outcome of that modelling—and any other modelling, for that matter. In a very obtuse way he said that the Parliamentary Budget Office could seek to strike a memorandum of understanding. The question I have to the parliamentary secretary is: does that mean that if a particular department—pick any one of 30—feels, on a day that they are requested by the Parliamentary Budget Office, that they do not want the department or the modelling that they have used and developed to be put under any scrutiny, they can just refuse to agree to a memorandum of understanding which gives the Parliamentary Budget Office that sort of access? If that is the case this is like the FOI process, where you are denied anything of any consequence.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (17:55):  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have sought the call because the member for Grayndler came in and told the member at the table not to answer any questions. It is just part of the ongoing transparency of the government, I suppose! And the Independents are voting for it, I might add, but so be it. If you think we are using the filibuster I will speak on this in summary—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney, I do not think anything.




Mr HOCKEY:
  on behalf of the opposition, because the government are not going to answer any further questions at the instruction of the member for Grayndler. First, the parliamentary secretary has now admitted that this is a lesser model than that which is applying in other countries. He would say that because, as he failed to note, the Parliamentary Library's pre-election policy unit identified that the PBO 'should include the provision of the kinds of assistance offered by the PBO such as costing and economic modelling'. So the Parliamentary Library says the PBO should be able to do its own independent modelling.


And the Clerk of the House of Representatives, in the submission to the committee that the member for Lyne boasts of being a part of, says: 


... discussion may be more comprehensive if Members had access to some additional quantitative analysis on how government projections had been arrived at and their sensitivity to assumptions.


That is the point the member for Goldstein raised. 


We now know that the government's justification for having the Treasurer and the minister for finance as the sole contributors of economic data, economic modelling and fiscal data to the PBO is cost. That is what he said before. This is a government that is now concerned about cost. After four years it has suddenly grown concerned about cost. What a revelation! Forget the billions of dollars that were handed out, the $900 cheques, now is the time to draw a line: 'We don't want it to go from $6 million to $7 million a year; we are going to be prudent as a government and we are going to hold back.' 




Mr Briggs:
  Return to surplus!




Mr HOCKEY:
  This will be the path to surplus! My second point, in summary, is that the parliamentary secretary has admitted that now there will be no additional access to information out of the Treasury or the department of finance or any other department without a memorandum of understanding. It will be a memorandum of understanding that this Parliamentary Budget Office is going to have signed with 30 different departments by the next election—yeah, right! They are going to have unfettered access under those MOUs, but that is the subject of another of my amendments.


The first of my amendments seeks, after all these hours of debate, to prove the case that this government, in partnership with the Independents, is just not serious about having a fully independent parliamentary budget office. By the words of the parliamentary secretary and the admissions in the very drafting of this bill, it is now clear that the government itself, in partnership with the Independents, is de-fanging the Parliamentary Budget Office. In the words of the parliamentary secretary himself: 'It is a lesser parliamentary budget office than that which exists in some other jurisdictions.' Question put:


That the amendment (Mr Hockey's) be agreed to.


The House divided. [18:03]


(The Speaker—Mr Harry Jenkins)


Question negatived.


Debate adjourned.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (20:03):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 119: Treaty tabled on 5 July 2011.


In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms PARKE:
  by leave—Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report No. 119, which contains the committee's views on the Instrument Amending the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union and the Instrument Amending the Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, which were tabled in the Commonwealth parliament on 5 July 2011.


The work of the International Telecommunication Union is technically complicated and not widely understood. However, its work does materially improve telecommunications services for the general public. Probably the best known example of this is the 2000 agreement establishing an international standard for third-generation mobile telephony. The 2000 agreement replaced a diversity of country based mobile telephony standards with a single international standard, enabling third-generation mobile devices to operate anywhere in the world, laying the framework for international mobile roaming.


The ITU funds its activities through contributions from member states. Unlike other United Nations agencies, member states decide their own level of contribution. Although Australia's contribution to the ITU is SwF4.725 million, or approximately $5.1 million, this sum is entirely recouped through industry contributions. Consequently, the Australian government has no net costs.


The proposed treaty action amends the ITU's constitution and convention in relation to the class of contribution member states may make to the ITU. Both of the amending instruments will enter into force generally on 1 January 2012. The amendments comprise a provision which allows member states to reduce their contribution at any one time by not more than 15 per cent of their prior level of contribution and a provision which increases the number of levels of contributory units from which member states can choose their class of contribution.


The greatest impact of the amendment will be to reduce the amount by which the largest financial contributors to the ITU can decrease their level of contribution at any one time. Although the ITU is not financially unstable, the adoption of this amendment would contribute towards improving the ITU's financial stability. Aside from the above provisions, the obligations of ITU member states will not change.


The treaties committee supports the adoption of the proposed amendments as they will provide stability to ITU funding. The committee understands that the telecommunications industry supports the changes and that there will be no net cost to the Australian government. For these reasons, the committee concludes that these amendments should be supported with binding treaty action. I thank my fellow committee members and take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hardworking treaties committee secretariat. I commend the report to the House.

(b) Australia has a strong innovation framework, and some of the best research and development


and skilled workers in the world, but industry and government support is needed to turn that


capacity into goods manufactured in Australia;





(c) the Australian Government has an agenda for nation building, innovation and improving the


productive performance of business and industry, but that more can be done in this area;

that the mining boom does not crowd-out every other area of the economy; and





(e) the Government has already made a substantial contribution to the development of this agenda;





(2) reaffirms its belief in a modern, cohesive and comprehensive industry policy for Australian


manufacturing which links these elements of the Australian economy;





(3) supports policies to spread the benefits of the mining boom to local manufacturers and the


development of a skilled workforce by;





(a) ensuring that the mining industry invests in apprenticeships and training to ensure Australia


continues to renew and develop a high-skilled workforce; and





(b) requiring:





   
(i) all new major resource projects have an Australian Industry Participation Plan (AIPP)


which provides details of the Australian manufactured materials and services to be used on


all major resource developments; and





   
(ii) open and transparent tendering arrangements which permit Australian industry to compete


on an equal basis with international companies for sub-contracts associated with major


resource projects;





(4) supports policies that require Australian Government infrastructure and defence industry projects to


produce and publish an AIPP detailing Australian manufactured materials and services; and





(5) in the interests of accountability and transparency, insists that all AIPPs be published and regularly


updated as projects progress.





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Is the motion seconded?




Ms Bird:
  I second the motion.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  Australia is going through unprecedented economic change. This change is driven by our place in the world and the demand for our natural resources. Despite what some say, our economic outlook is one of fundamental strength and resilience. The economic transformation of Asia is bringing tremendous benefits to this region. Our economy is strong. Our mining and resources sector is strong and revenue is flowing from this to both state and federal governments. Our terms of trade are high and the high Australian dollar means that everything from petrol, TVs, T-shirts and overseas holidays are cheaper than they have ever been before.


But the sustained high Australian dollar is driving structural change in our economy. Different sectors and regions within the Australian economy are growing at different speeds. It is clear that the manufacturing sector is struggling, and there are many examples in my region and the region of my colleague who joins me in the chamber, the member for Cunningham. In our area of Illawarra this is very prevalent.


I believe that manufacturing matters. Manufacturing is critical not only to our economy but to the sort of country that we want to live in. This is because a country that makes stuff knows stuff. Manufacturing and the engineering trades create the ecosystems of knowledge that are critical to being a clever country, and you can measure it. While manufacturing makes up only about 8.3 per cent of all employment and about 8.6 per cent of gross domestic product, it contributes to more than 25 per cent of all business investment in research and development. Put simply, the manufacturing sector is boxing well above its weight when it comes to investing in our future know-how and technological capacity.


The government is implementing many reforms to deal with the pressure that is now being faced by the manufacturing sector in a changing economy. We are investing in skills in record amounts. We have a record investment of over $36 billion in infrastructure projects around the country to support our economy. We are building important new infrastructure like the National Broadband Network, and we are pushing for better taxation on the mining sector and for improved research and development tax incentives for manufacturing and other industries. We have created over 130,000 new training places and we are investing heavily in skills and training measures. These are all important measures to keep our economy strong, but many of them have been opposed by those opposite.


We believe that there is an important role for government. It is not just a matter of letting the market rip. We believe that we need a policy mix to create a diverse economy. A broad range of programs are already in place to support our manufacturing industries and include the Australian Industry Participation measures, which are encouraging full, fair and reasonable opportunities for the manufacturing industry in many major projects; a range of investment and co-investment vehicles through our Clean Energy Future initiatives; and programs such as Enterprise Connect which are providing assistance to small and medium sized enterprises and encouraging innovation and investment in new technology and projects. These programs are targeted at enhancing productivity through innovation across the economy because we recognise that the Australian economy needs to be self-sustaining beyond the resources boom. In June this year, the Minister for Defence Materiel strengthened our program to reduce the threshold for mandatory AICPs from $50 million to $20 million, and put new conditions for tender, which exclude any company that has failed to meet their Australian industry participation plan obligations. A number of these measures have already been put in place but the motion before the House today quite simply calls for more action. It calls for policies which will spread the benefits of the mining boom to local manufacturers and the development of a skilled workforce by ensuring that the mining industry invests in apprenticeships and training. It calls for policies to ensure that all new major resource projects have an Australian Industry Participation Plan which provides details of the Australian manufactured materials and services to be used in all those major projects and policies, which would require open and transparent tendering arrangements which permit Australian industry to compete on an equal basis with international companies for subcontracts associated with major resource projects.


I am moving this motion before the House because, from conversations I have had with many manufacturers in my electorate, I can see that we are playing on a far from even playing field. According to the Australian Steel Institute, out of a $400 billion investment over the next five to 10 years, Australian steel is currently getting only around a 10 per cent share of the market. And this is at a time when our steel fabrication sector is running below capacity and many firms are laying off staff. 


I have heard too many examples lately of mining and resource companies effectively locking Australian companies out of being able to tender for major projects. Companies like Chevron, Fortescue Metals, Pacific Sino and Rio Tinto are making billions from developing Australia's natural resources, and Australian manufactured products, particular Australian steel, are not getting a fair shake in those contracts. I will cite a number of examples. One example that has been brought to my attention is of the Chevron project at Barrow Island—a large LNG project. The Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island is Australia's largest ever project but, unfortunately, the LNG plant has been designed in London to use Japanese standards and Asian steel and will be fabricated completely in Asian yards and then transported to the site.


A second example which has been brought to my attention involves Rio Tinto in the iron ore expansion in the Pilbara. The specifications for that project clearly say that all steel plate will be welded and that the welded sections and floor plate to be used will be of Chinese standard and specifications—effectively precluding Australian companies from bidding in those projects.


Another example is of the Fortescue Metals Group. Earlier this year Fortescue Metals Group announced it had struck a deal to buy 260 40-tonne iron ore rail cars from China's CNR Corp as part of Twiggy Forrest's $US8.4 billion Pilbara expansion ambitions. Another example involves CITIC Pacific Mining's Sino Iron Ore project at Cape Preston—probably the most extreme example I have seen. In that project all the steel that is used was imported from Shanghai steel yards. That is around 100,000 tonnes of steel that could have been supplied locally but which was imported for this project. Not only that—and to illustrate the problems facing Australian manufacturing—CITIC Pacific imported entirely ready-made concrete footpaths from China. Concrete is a simple commodity and this work could, and I say should, have been done locally.


These examples show clearly that Australian manufacturing industries like steel, engineering and concrete are effectively being excluded from the benefits of these major resource projects. And this is occurring at a time when the manufacturing sector, as I have said, is shedding jobs. It is clear that greater transparency and accountability is required in the contracts being awarded in this sector, and the motion that I have put before the House calls for exactly that. We need transparency and accountability at a federal level, but there is clearly more that state governments can and should be doing. There is clearly a role for national leadership in this regard, and I will be seeking a coordinated approach—and I ask for a bipartisan approach—to be progressed through COAG as a matter of priority. The government will work to ensure that manufacturing will continue to be a source of well-paid, high-skill jobs for Australian workers, but this will not happen by accident. The best way that we can spread the benefits of the mining boom is to ensure that Australian manufacturing industries get greater access—at least on an equal basis—to the over $400 billion worth of investment that is going into our mining sector over the next 4½ years. 


While I am at it, I believe that greater access to a number of the infrastructure projects of a number of governments, at state and federal level, would greatly benefit local manufacturing industries, because if the purpose of many of these projects is to stimulate employment and local jobs then one of the most direct and effective ways that this can be done is to ensure that local manufacturers and local workers such as those who are employed in electorates like mine and the electorate of the member for Cunningham can get access to fulfilling, high-paying, good, skilled jobs for now and well into the future. I commend the motion to the House.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (20:13):  In rising to speak on this item of private members' business I welcome the opportunity to train a spotlight on the ruinous state of industry and innovation policy under this government. We have heard from the previous speaker, the member for Throsby, about what was not working in the industry sector, what barriers local businesses were up against, but there was no understanding of what policy prescriptions should follow. There were no answers; there were just repetitions of stories of the problems—very real problems—facing industry in accessing work in Australia. 


There was a dizzying set of contradictions by the member for Throsby, who continues to walk both sides of the street but does so ever more unconvincingly and unsuccessfully. I do admit that he has a very difficult job because of the relevant ministers that he is lumped with as part of the current government. There is no argument from the coalition with the sentiments outlined in paragraphs (1)(a), (1)(b) and (2) that Australia needs a broad based economy, a better harnessing of our innovative capabilities and more effective industry policies. These points are entirely self-evident and I am glad that at least one Labor member is finally prepared to say so and to repudiate Labor's pursuit of what BlueScope Steel's CEO, Paul O'Malley, has described as an almost anti-manufacturing philosophy.


As for paragraphs (1)(d), (3), (4) and (5), we are also broadly in agreeance with them, but we naturally need to be careful about precisely how governments in Australia intervene in these areas. Ultimately, there can be as many guidelines around industry policies as you like, but they count for little if the government responsible for administering them does not exhibit common sense and exercise political will to implement them effectively.


It appears from the motion that the member for Throsby needs to be somewhat educated about the government's atrocious record on defence procurement. Is he seriously not aware that his own party has tried to send the manufacturing of Australian camouflage fabric to China and that it broke commitments to upgrade body armour and weapons for frontline troops? We even have another story in the Telegraph today revealing that our diggers' American-made camouflage pants are falling apart while they are on patrol. And how much did Australian taxpayers pay to an American company for this privilege? They paid $7.8 million. I would be very interested to hear from some of our domestic manufacturers about the tender process for that $7.8 million contract that found itself in the US. I am no stranger to these issues, having very strong manufacturing in my electorate in north-east Victoria and a very strong competitive and innovative defence manufacturing sector as well.


As for paragraphs (1)(c) and (1)(e), the government has never had an agenda for industry and innovation policy and national productivity other than to embark on its familiar mission of destroying successful Howard government initiatives. Instead, it has not only slashed funding in critical areas such as commercialisation and R&D but also has stood back and expected our manufacturers to absorb ever-increasing regulations and costs.


It claims it has increased spending in that portfolio by many billions of dollars but, sadly, it has failed to comprehend there is never an automatic connection between spending more government money and getting better outcomes. Indeed, even Ms Gillard and Senator Carr battled to nominate a single practical achievement from all this spending. And just to confirm its stunning incompetence, the government now wants to whack Australian manufacturing with a punitive carbon tax that we know, from research out today, will fully impact on nine out of 10 manufacturing workers. The 10 per cent that will not be impacted fully by it will be impacted in some way.


He does not go far enough but there is essentially a shamefaced admission from the member for Throsby in paragraph (1)(c) of his motion about the abject lack of common sense and direction the government has exhibited because he uses the words 'more can be done in this portfolio area'. Indeed, it can. We on this side of the House do agree very strongly with this sentiment: a lot more can be done. Last Wednesday at the National Press Club we invited the government to work with us to immediately adopt and implement eight key policy changes in relation to manufacturing. I note that the member for Throsby asked for a bipartisan approach. Well, there it was. They were very easy steps, from one to eight. We agree with him that there are sectors such as steel and cement that are locked out of contracts. There are very simple things that can be done immediately—but, sadly, no response.


At a time when Australia is facing its greatest crisis in manufacturing—as one union leader said, the greatest crisis since the Great Depression—I had hoped for a slightly better response. But as the government continues to be paralysed and obsessed with self-preservation it has failed to focus on industry policy and at least make some attempt to reverse its failed vision. The Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, used to hyperventilate any time there were job losses under the Howard government. Ironically, that was during a period of government when manufacturing jobs actually rose, yet his own legacy will be that he presided over the worst rate of job losses in the history of Australian manufacturing. It is a statistic he could not dispute in the Senate a few weeks ago and it will be the one that, more than any other, will define his time as a minister.


Over the past quarter, jobs have been lost at a rate of more than 2½-thousand every week. That is one gone very four minutes. The situation is such as to discredit even the words some of their own advisers have given them. Let us have a look at Terry Cutler, who Labor hand-picked back in 2008 to advise it on what it should do with its policies in this portfolio. He has said that the government essentially has no idea what it is doing.


I welcome the member for Throsby's newfound and in some ways sudden rhetorical interest in manufacturing, innovation and industry participation plans. I would counsel him that it is one thing to wax lyrical on the floor of the parliament and in press conferences but it is quite another to practically force change to Labor's industry policies. I would also remind him that the most fundamental responsibility of being a member of parliament is to stand up for the interests and wishes of your local constituents. This motion is no substitute for opposing the single greatest threat to the viability of manufacturing in this country—and that means voting against the carbon tax.


Labor's spin and blind loyalty to an out-of-touch Prime Minister, industry minister and climate change minister on policies like the carbon tax simply does not wash with anyone anymore. No member representing a great Australian manufacturing heartland should be substituting parliamentary motions like this for real work and placing real pressure on their party's power brokers to make policies that will make a fundamental difference, that will make a change and stop the rot. I find it sad that members from the Illawarra have so little clout in the ALP anymore and that all of us have been forced to endure the sight of the member for Throsby changing his language on the carbon tax so often for different audiences. He has performed more contortions than a circus acrobat to try to please both his political masters and local workers. It is not convincing either way. Instead of sinking into the comfortable green leather of the House of Representatives, people like the member for Throsby should have been wearing out their shoe leather visiting local businesses, listening to their concerns and then pounding on the doors of senior colleagues to urge them to stop penalising the millions of hard-working Australians who are being crushed by this government and its policy initiatives, including the carbon tax. So far there has been none of that from him—a point admitted by Ms Gillard in June when she hung him out to dry by effectively conceding he had made no representations to her about the toxicity for his electorate of the carbon tax. No amount of parliamentary motions like this one can obscure the reality that the member for Throsby has let his electorate down and has failed the most basic test of political representation.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (20:23):  It is a very special level of punishment to have to follow the member for Indi in any debate. Her capacity to spend 15 minutes criticising, spewing vitriol, misrepresenting people's positions and failing to put forward any alternative has a special level of achievement in parliamentary debates. I would simply say to her that I cannot even be bothered responding to most of her arguments because they are so lacking in foundation anyway. I would be interested to know whether the member for Casey has a particular view on the member for Indi's approach to manufacturing and whether there is an interest in a more market interventionist approach more generally on the benches on the other side.


Quite contrary to the member for Indi's complete misrepresentation, the member for Throsby and I do visit many of our local manufacturing businesses and talk to them on a regular basis. Indeed, I have done so for all the years I have been in parliament and my colleague the member for Throsby has done so since he was elected. I could hardly think of a more inaccurate criticism to be made of the member for Throsby for bringing this motion forward to the House.


It is indeed an important recognition that the Wollongong and Illawarra area more broadly does make a substantial contribution to the Australian economy. Like the member for Ballarat at the table, our region makes things, it exports things and it provides services. Over the last 30 years our region, however, has been diversifying its economic base. The Illawarra region used to be based around two major employers: steelmaking and coal producing. One fed the other. I come from five generations of coalminers and certainly am well aware in my own family of the close relationship between those two industries.


Although steelmaking and coal production are still very important to the Illawarra, the region has diversified to include a world-class and nationally significant research university and TAFE institute, a growing health and community sector, and a property and financial services sector. Our big employers were once BHP and coal companies. Today that is shared between the University of Wollongong and our TAFE campuses, our hospitals and aged-care facilities, our banking and superannuation fund administrators.


Our region has been through tough economic times before. In 1982-83 the then 'Big Australian', BHP, threatened to walk away from steelmaking. BHP threatened to close its works at Port Kembla. It took a Labor government then, the Hawke government, to design what came to be known as the Button steel plan to save the steel industry in Australia. During the implementation of the Button steel plan, which began in 1984, both the company and combined unions went through a process of modernisation, work practice improvements, capital investment and an investment in people. BlueScope Steel today—today's incarnation of BHP—operated a world-class, low-cost and competitive, modernised steel plant. The Port Kembla steel plant located in our area is a product of that Labor government's steel plan.


On 22 August this year BlueScope Steel announced that it needed to restructure its operations because of the higher exchange rate, the higher cost inputs from iron ore and coking coal, and the sluggish steel demand across the globe. Unfortunately, that decision involves substantial job losses in the Illawarra—not only for BlueScope Steel workers but also the company's supplier-contractors. The very same day of the announcement, the Prime Minister and other senior cabinet ministers announced a $140 million assistance package for the Illawarra region. This is one of the largest regional structural adjustment packages introduced by a Commonwealth government to assist in the economic transitioning for a region.


It is important to place on record the difference in assistance provided to Wollongong and to Newcastle, when its steel industry was affected in 1997. The Howard government at that time provided $10 million in adjustment assistance for BHP workers. This was matched by the then Carr Labor government. I do not criticise the assistance provided by the Howard government or the Carr government, but I think it is important to recognise that this Labor government did provide an important and significant assistance package to the Illawarra.


The package has three elements. First, the bringing forward of $100 million under the Steel Transformation Fund, which will help BlueScope Steel implement a new business model and help it to produce new products. It should be emphasised at this point that the opposition has indicated, even prior to the BlueScope Steel decision on 22 August, that it intends to oppose the Steel Transformation Plan. As I said in my contribution to the carbon bill debate, I believe that is hypocrisy at its most flagrant. They are weasel words from the opposition—to express concern about the BlueScope Steel situation but not indicate they will support the Steel Transformation Plan. 


It is not only the importance of supporting the steel industry because steel is so important to our region, but it should be acknowledged that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for industry have told us that they will oppose the $300 million fund to help the steel industry transition to a low-carbon economy. I note my colleague the member for Gilmore is in the House and I would hope that she and perhaps Senator Fierravanti-Wells will, in arguing to their own side, convince them to support the steel bill because it is important support to our local region. This is no longer a theoretical or conceptual debate; it is real time and the workers in the Illawarra depend on this fund, BlueScope Steel depends on the fund. We should stop playing politics, be responsible and support the bill. Secondly, the government has announced a $10 million employment assistance package to help displaced workers find other jobs, to retrain for other industries, to up-skill and to relocate if they need to. Later this week, a jobs market—a Commonwealth government funded initiative—will be held at Unanderra where under one roof over two days affected workers from BlueScope and their supplier-contractors will be able to obtain advice and assistance, including meeting potential employers in the mining, resource and engineering sectors.


Thirdly, the government has established a $30 million Investment and Innovation Fund to help local businesses innovate and expand their operations in the region. This fund is a co-investment fund. At the conclusion, we should have been able to secure a doubling of the Commonwealth's investment to create a $60 million injection in the region's economy. At the same time, the Prime Minister has announced the establishment of the Illawarra Stakeholders Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Dr Don Russell, to co-ordinate that response.


In the few minutes left to me, I just want to mention some other Commonwealth investments in our region that have proved significant to manufacturing. We have contributed $43.8 million to build the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials at the University of Wollongong's innovation campus. This was showcased on 29 August at an Illawarra manufacturing expo following the visit to Wollongong by the Prime Minister. Senator Kim Carr, the minister, opened the expo, which brought together a range of Commonwealth agencies to assist manufacturing companies innovate, demonstrate their capability to be involved in big investment projects—such as those outlined by my colleague, the member for Throsby—and to export. Over 100 manufacturing representatives met with these Commonwealth officials and, importantly, researchers from the institute to foster new relationships. Given the new Research and Development Tax Credit program introduced by this government and targeted at smaller businesses, the institute will become a very important partner for the manufacturing sector in Wollongong.


I also highlight the Commonwealth's investment of $25 million to build the new Sustainable Building Research Centre, located next to the institute I have just discussed at the innovation campus. This new research centre has a fantastic partnership with the Illawarra Institute of TAFE and BlueScope Steel to introduce innovative building materials and building skills for clean energy workers into the future. They will design and create new products and services dedicated to improving the existing built environment. It will be the first in Australia to be assessed under the Living Building Challenge initiative.


The future of manufacturing can at times appear gloomy in Australia, particularly at times when the dollar is at the level that is at, but I am and remain an optimist about the future of the sector. Around one million Australians are employed in the sector. This has been consistent across the last decade. Treasury modelling suggests that manufacturing output is projected to grow by 70 per cent to 2050. The latest national count shows that manufacturing in general is actually growing in Australia. Metal products rose 14 per cent for the quarter and 16 per cent to June. However, we acknowledge that the manufacturing sector does face challenges. But it is resilient and one of the most creative of our economic sectors.



The government has already introduced a number of initiatives to help in this transition. All of the programs that we have introduced will be cut by the opposition. Importantly, we have introduced and approved the Australian Industry Participation Plan for all new Australian government contracts worth more than $20 million. Indeed, as the Prime Minister has indicated, we are considering publishing plans and outcomes for the AIP. I commend the fact that my colleague has introduced this motion to the House and reaffirm our ongoing commitment to the manufacturing sector. (Time expired)

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (20:33):  I rise today to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Throsby and to speak specifically on the need to develop and maintain a diverse economy and to support local manufacturers. For many years now the Gold Coast economy has been very dependent on tourism and construction, as these industries have been our strongest and most prosperous. However, in recent years, there has been a downturn in both sectors, resulting in higher than average unemployment levels, particularly on the southern Gold Coast. The Gold Coast is well placed though to diversify and broaden its economic base, particularly in manufacturing.


It is fair to say that manufacturers throughout Australia are doing it tough now and have for some time. More than 136,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost over the last 3½ years. This downward trend needs to be stopped and preferably reversed so that we are creating manufacturing jobs. I recently held a manufacturing roundtable with the member for Indi and a number of manufacturers from the southern Gold Coast. Many of these businesses are facing an uncertain time due to various factors, including the high Australian dollar and reduced spending patterns as Australians continue to tighten their belts. Many are also struggling to find the skilled workers needed to produce high-quality products. I believe that one of the issues that we must address is the way that trade training, in particular, is undertaken in Australia at this point in time. We know that there is a relatively low completion rate for apprenticeships, with the national completion rate of approximately 55 per cent when factors such as the apprentice changing their employer are taken into account.


On the southern Gold Coast we have the Australian Industry Trade College, the AITC, which is dedicated to preparing year 11 and 12 students for a career in industry. The college has been successful in achieving over 530 school based apprenticeships in over 50 different trade qualifications. The unique program and flexible learning pathway provided by the AITC allow students to graduate with a Queensland Certificate of Education as well as significant work experience, knowledge and skills in their chosen field. Currently, there are around 300 students enrolled at the college and half of these students will be on campus at any one time attending classes in a custom-designed curriculum that includes English communication, mathematics A—or prevocational maths—business, information technology and physical wellness. All students must also engage in community service. Other fields of study include a certificate III Australian school based apprenticeship, delivered offsite at a registered training organisation. The work experience component is run consecutively, and students swap from their classroom to the workplace every four weeks, alternating as two groups. At the AITC, students are assigned case managers to offer advice and support during the two years that they are enrolled at the college. Through this customised learning approach and support structure, students have the confidence and skill sets to succeed in the workforce as apprentices and trainees. The AITC completion rate for apprenticeships is about 68 per cent, which in turn is about 13 per cent above the national average.


A recent Deloitte Access Economics study found that skill shortages were jeopardising $254 billion worth of mining projects in the planning pipeline. It identified five key trade qualifications—electricians, drillers, production technicians, mechanical fitters and boilermakers—as the most severe skill shortage areas. Three of those trades—electricians, mechanical fitters and boilermakers—are also key to the manufacturing sector. An appropriate trade trading program needs to be implemented.


As I said earlier, the Gold Coast is well placed to further develop its manufacturing base, which I believe is already diverse. To demonstrate this point, I would like to speak about three of our local manufacturing sectors and some of the barriers to their productivity and success that the government should be addressing. Let me start with engineering and speak about one of our local manufacturers, the Rockcrush Group, one of the top engineering manufacturing groups in Australia, with over 100 years combined experience. They are located in Burleigh Heads, in one of the industrial estates in McPherson, and their core business includes the manufacture of marine winches, mining winches, general winches and also dredges.


Rockcrush pride themselves on the export of these dredges, which are designed to be used in a variety of industry applications around the world. Because of its unique market position, Rockcrush is in the enviable position of being able to expand its operations and increase the number of boilermakers it employs. However, there have been issues in finding skilled and experienced boilermakers on the Gold Coast, as many are now attempting to seek employment in regions with major manufacturing industries. Rockcrush will also be affected by the proposed carbon tax and may well be forced to move some of its manufacturing base from Australia to an offshore location. Clearly, if this were to happen, there would be an immediate impact on jobs as well as a loss of local expertise in this specialised area.


I have spoken in this place on a number of occasions about the surfboard manufacturing industry. I wish to again highlight the importance it plays in my electorate. Industry leaders have advised me that the following issues have impacted on them: firstly, the high Australian dollar and increased competition from overseas manufacturers; secondly, cheap, imported boards that are not appropriately labelled so that it is clear to Australian surfers that they are buying a board that was manufactured overseas and not from an Australian shaper; thirdly, keen surfers, who would normally change their boards every six months, are holding onto them for perhaps two years because the rising cost of living has left them with little or no discretionary spending ability; and, fourthly, skilled labour shortages. There is currently no formal traineeship or apprenticeship for surfcraft manufacturing, and this needs to be addressed as a priority.


The third sector I would like to speak about tonight is the textile, clothing and footwear sector. One of the nation's largest listed apparel companies, Billabong, is based in my electorate of McPherson. It employs over 2,000 people locally as part of an international workforce of 8,000. There are also a number of smaller TCF businesses on the southern Gold Coast. We are all well aware in this place that TCF industries have struggled to remain internationally competitive for some time and that the sector has undergone significant changes over recent years.


Having been involved in that sector myself over a number of years, I was very interested to read about the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program. According to the application form:



The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Capability Program is a competitive, merit based grants program. It funds strategic projects that increase innovation across Textile, Clothing and Footwear industries …


That certainly sounds very positive. It then goes on to say: 



Confirming your eligibility first can save you a lot of time and effort.


That prompted me to look at what the eligibility requirements are. One of those requirements, amongst others, is that:



… the entity (if a clothing manufacturer) is accredited in accordance with the Homeworkers' Code of Practice or is seeking accreditation …


A quick call to AusIndustry confirmed that, yes, indeed, a clothing manufacturer had to be accredited or be seeking accreditation through Ethical Clothing Australia to be eligible for the TCF Strategic Capability Program. There are various fees that are applicable for accreditation, based on a number of factors. The Ethical Clothing Australia website indicates that it can cost up to $6,000 for that accreditation.


Businesses that are not accredited or seeking accreditation are not eligible to be considered for funding. There is no opportunity for the manufacturer to demonstrate compliance or adherence to the code. This criteria also completely dismisses membership of independent global ethical standards bodies and compliance with relevant international standards.


In addition, some clothing manufacturers do not engage home workers. It is nonsensical for such manufacturers to have to be accredited or seeking accreditation for a code of conduct that applies to workers that they do not have.


There is a future for the manufacturing industry in Australia and on the southern Gold Coast, but this potential future is in jeopardy due to the actions being taken by this government. There is the capacity to increase manufacturing and workforce participation in this area, with a number of industrial estates in McPherson already available. However, if the Gold Coast and Australian manufacturing industries are allowed to continue to shrink by the Labor government, this opportunity to diversify the local and national economy will pass long before any benefits can be harnessed.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (20:43):  It is a great pleasure to be talking about manufacturing in the House again. We have to thank the member for Throsby, who has been a tireless advocate of his electorate and of manufacturing generally. I think he has been one of the people who has really rammed home and helped to explain, not just to this House but also to the Australian people, some of the challenges that manufacturing now faces. We have heard a lot about the two-speed economy. Last year we had a pretty torrid debate about the mining sector and whether or not they should be taxed. We are now starting to see, I think, the effects of a high currency, a currency that is a reflection of our economic success—let us not hide from that. Having a high currency does bring us benefits in higher prices for our exports. It lowers import costs and input costs. It is an important thing. It is a sign of the world's confidence in this country and its future, so we should acknowledge the benefits of the high currency and not be shy about that. 


We should also understand that the economy has been growing and jobs have been growing throughout this period. Despite a global financial crisis, despite the two-speed economy, despite a high currency, jobs continue to grow. We heard that from the previous speaker, the member for McPherson, who talked about manufacturing companies in her electorate which were continuing to put on employees and, indeed, could not find skilled labour. It is interesting to hear some of the more balanced contributions from some of those opposite—those who say that we do have a lot to be happy about and to celebrate in this country.


There is no doubt that this period does bring some challenges for manufacturing. We face a situation where a high dollar is putting pressure on our industries. That is not something that is unique to Australia. If you look at Brazil, they have got problems with currency appreciation, and, most recently, the Swiss have had problems with the franc rapidly appreciating. So this is a problem that is present around the world. We have heard a lot about Dutch disease and the perils of that, and that is one of the reasons the government is bringing the budget back into surplus. It is one of the reasons we are introducing a minerals resource rent tax, and it is one of the reasons why we have got a big investment into skills in this country. It is interesting to hear those opposite talk about skills.


I do think that this issue needs a long-term discussion and I think we do need a bit of goodwill on both sides. Just simply slinging insults at one another will not help. We should, where possible, seek out areas of common interest in the national interest, and I do think skills might be one of those.



Opposition members interjecting





Mr CHAMPION:
  Peace in our time! Don't worry, I'll get stuck into you later on. I think we have probably always got more in common than we have differences. I think the country basically faces a choice between co-investment and capitulation. We either capitulate to these market forces, run up the white flag and let jobs move offshore and say that manufacturing is dead, and maybe just accept that that is part of the process of a strong currency and high prices for our minerals, or we have co-investment. I have seen this co-investment in my own electorate with Holden and an investment of $149 million to develop the Cruze, now the No. 3 selling car in Australia, and an extra 265 jobs at Holden. This is a product which is selling, and you can tell it is selling, because wherever you go, in the supermarket car parks of this country, there are Cruzes driving around. I would urge those opposite to look at that. We now see it with the Commodore and $40 million invested in developing the Commodore with new lightweight panels and new technology to make them more efficient. Again, we have got more secure jobs. 


We saw it at Holden with our big investments during the global financial crisis where the company did have some difficulties with demand, and so the government and the company had a co-investment in training the workforce. During that down time, rather than people being off work they were in training, preparing for the launch of the Cruze. So we see that where co-investments are made we can have productive, profitable companies and we can have companies that are domestically successful. I have every confidence that in the future they will be successful with exporting police cars to the United States.


We are not alone in this. The United Kingdom have recently invested £200 million. They had one particular plant with Nissan—a battery plant where they co-invested £20 million to get that in place. This is something that is happening all over in other countries. Other countries help by tariffs. India has got a tariff of 105 per cent—to give people some understanding of the international environment. We see that where we have co-investment we have success.


While some of those opposite, like the member for Mayo, the Marty McFly of the parliament—he has a great love of Back to the Future—focuses on places like Mitsubishi and the hard-luck stories, I prefer to focus on the success stories that we have had in the last few years under this government's program. We know that the Liberal Party oscillate between reassurance on one side of it—they have got all these vague reassurances on one hand and not really talking about their policies; some of them come in here very reassuringly about jobs and then they rattle on about the carbon tax for a while—and the other side of it is pretty significant. We have the member for Mayo perhaps sending messages more to his own party than to this side of parliament about co-investment. He talks about the enormous markets of the flat world. You might want to tell that to the Indians, with the 105 per cent tariff, or Thailand, where they have about 80 per cent tariff on Commodores.


When we first introduced these assistance measures to the car industry, Tony Abbott said: 'There have been a lot of assistance packages for the car industry, and the real issue for any future package is: just how long is this going to last? Will the car industry in this country ever be able to stand on its own two feet? Will Kevin Rudd be able to give a guarantee that any new package of assistance really will be the last package?' We have that undermining. Before Tony Abbott was Leader of the Opposition he would maybe have told a different story today to car workers in South Australia; maybe he would not. We had Joe Hockey say: 'I don't know that it is necessarily the right thing to hand money immediately to the motor vehicle industry in Australia without knowing whether those key companies are going to be merging or won't even exist in 12 months.' That is what he said in 2007, when we put in place our co-investment plan.


The opposition are very clear about what they will do, in many respects. They talk in circles, there are lots of reassurances and lots of banging on about the carbon tax, but, when you get right down to it, they will cut $500 million out of the Automotive Transformation Scheme. That is what they will do. They will put the sledgehammer to jobs in South Australia and Victoria and manufacturing jobs in New South Wales. We hear the member for Mayo talking about Mitsubishi. That is what he wants to talk about all the time. He wants to talk about the stories of job losses. That is what they want to talk about; they do not want to talk about the successes.


This country does have a choice. We have a choice between co-investment, which is the Labor way, which is investing in research, high technology, exports that are going to sell and having a manufacturing sector at the end of this whole process of our terms of trade; or the Liberal Party way, which will be capitulation, which will be to run up the white flag to say we cannot compete and to simply rely on an unrestrained, untaxed mining sector which will simply run rampant. When they have finished digging, they will be off and that will be the end of it. The Labor way is to provide jobs and a stable and diverse economy for the long term.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (20:53):  Whilst I certainly support some parts of the member's motion, I rise to speak against the subtle thrust of other parts of his motion and remind the House that last Thursday the Member for Throsby made a statement in an MPI on the impact of the carbon tax on Australian industry. I would like to take umbrage over some of his then comments in relation to this motion. My reason for doing so is that he and I share an interest in the economy of the Illawarra. The northern end of the electorate of Gilmore now encompasses parts of the old seat of Throsby, so I cannot allow him to go unchallenged with the rather rosy picture he is trying to paint of conditions there.


The motion he puts forward is constructed on a denial of events affecting his own constituents, constructed on platitudes and not an honest assessment of what is needed. The member seems oblivious to the state of the manufacturing industry, especially in his own backyard. He is oblivious to the fact that BlueScope Steel has just cut 800 jobs from its operations in Port Kembla. He is oblivious to the fact that another 69 jobs have just gone from the Australian Steel Mill Services at Port Kembla, with many others in the pipeline. He is oblivious to the effect this is having on contractors and subcontractors who have lost their livelihoods because of failed government projects. He seems oblivious to the fact that the unemployment rate for the June quarter in Throsby is pushing 7½ per cent and that will rise as the steel works job losses start feeding in.


The Shoalhaven is at 10 per cent and rising, and the government has no answers. He is oblivious to the no-show of trade centres that we were promised. He cleverly ignores the fact that Regional Development Australia gave nothing to the Illawarra even with the solid evidence of dramatic job losses under their noses, even without a carbon tax. Yet there he was last Thursday berating the opposition for being all doom and gloom. We have every reason to be so for next year when the carbon tax kicks in. Is the member suggesting unemployment is going to fall in the Illawarra? Is he suggesting that the manufacturing industry in his backyard will not rationalise some of its operations in response and that part of that rationalisation will mean job losses? As a former union official, he would have tracked the gradual decline of industrial activity in Port Kembla over the years. He would have seen jobs whittled away from a time when the steelworks employed 23,000 people, through the recession we had to have, to a figure of about 10 per cent of that. If he was any sort of trade union leader, he would know that the figures he spruiked on Thursday relied heavily on the mining industry.


In his motion he is warning that we should not let the performance of the mining industry eclipse the poor performance of the rest of the economy. My question to the member is: if that is the case, and you are fully aware, why aren't you doing something about it? Take mining out of the equation and what would be left? Surely he must be now aware of an article in Friday's Australian Financial Review which reports that, and I quote from a comment by Commsec economist, Savanth Sebastian, who said:


The prospects for the manufacturing industry are not good.


This is a highly professional economist who did not just pluck that statement out of thin air. He has been watching industry for some considerable time, analysing data, assessing, forecasting, and working the figures. The only thing the member for Throsby has been working on is the desperate regurgitation of spin in the face of all the evidence to the contrary.


Mr Jones says the government's economic modelling is predicting 1.6 million new jobs will be created by 2020. The question is: are these actual extra jobs, on top of what we have now, or are they going to be the mickey mouse green jobs this government is going to fabricate to save face? A recent study in the United Kingdom shows that, for every green job that is created, almost four real jobs were lost. I put that observation to the Prime Minister, but she refused to directly answer the question.


The Australian Financial Review reported that for the three months to August, the economy shed 14,000 jobs—the biggest quarterly decline in seven years. Over the past 3½ years, 136,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia; yet the motion calls for training. Great—if you have a job or you can get a job. Yet in his motion, the member for Throsby states that Australia should have open and transparent tendering arrangements so that Australian industry can compete on an equal basis with international companies for major resource projects. What a joke!


How can Australia be competitive when most of our competitor countries do not impose or will not impose this carbon tax on production costs? Over the past year alone, 53,800 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia. Over the past six months, the period that coincides with the time during which Australia has been under the threat of the introduction of the carbon tax, 49,400 manufacturing jobs have been lost and, overall, the total number of manufacturing jobs is now down to 945,600. These are verifiable Bureau of Statistics figures.


Westpac has noted that household unemployment expectations have risen 8.5 per cent this month. People think things are going to get worse. Their economist, Justin Smirk, says that 'the reading was consistent with other measures of a deteriorating labour market.' Hardly a rosy picture being painted by the experts and certainly totally opposite to the yarn the Member for Throsby was trying so hard to push.


It is also reported that the government has resisted growing pressure to conduct an inquiry into the future of manufacturing. Can they be afraid of what might be revealed? But apparently it has scheduled another one-day talkfest on jobs for October 6th. One day! The member is either deluding himself, his electorate or is just panicking and grasping at straws. Yet his colleagues in the trade union movement are worried and have been calling on government intervention in the manufacturing industry.


If the farce of the hastily convened joint select committee on the energy bills is any guide, then the government is going to resist any inquiry that is bound to cast even more doubt over this ill-conceived carbon tax. But the Member for Throsby is not worried. It is not his job on the line. The previous day, the member was also waxing lyrical about what fantastic things were happening at Port Kembla—but again made no mention of the job losses that were happening at the same time all around him. He is still prattling on about how Australia was set to achieve a five per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. Yet this government's own modelling shows that emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes in 2012 to 621 million tonnes in 2020, despite the carbon tax. Apparently this minor inconsistency should not stand in the way of a good story. He said in his Wednesday statement that it was no secret that he has a lot to say about the manufacturing industry, but he omitted to share with us the details of his government's plan to fix the problem. His motion calls for policies. Well, Member for Throsby, where are they? You are in government after all. All words and no action. It is just unfortunate that what he is saying seems to have little bearing on the unfolding reality.


Make no mistake: the manufacturing industry in the Illawarra is in decline, and it has much to do with the self-serving spin of Labor politicians like the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham, who prefer to sweep problems under the carpet so that issues are not realistically confronted until it is too late. It is a far cry from what his predecessor and former colleague, Jennie George, had to say and also a far cry from the brutal assessment of the former state Labor member for Kiama and former Mayor of Shellharbour, Bob Harrison. Neither was afraid to put the needs of their constituents ahead of party politics, because they understood what was really happening at the grassroots level and actually listened to what was being said.


Our rate of manufacturing production has not only begun to stall; it has gone backwards. In a listing of industrial production for 42 countries in the most recent issue of the Economist, we were ranked 41st, only in front of Greece. One of my constituents has just returned from Germany and says that nearly everything you buy there—clothes, food, hardware—is made in Germany. If you see two Japanese cars, it is a rarity. How do we compare in Australia?


This rather cleverly constructed motion pretends to be doing something when really nothing practical or timely is being done. They are an inept and incompetent government and no amount of their grandiose statements will change the fact. The member's motion is deliberately loaded to give the impression that they care. They do not. Take part 1(c) of the motion, which says:


the Australian Government has an agenda for nation building, innovation and improving the productive performance of business and industry, but … more can be done in this area;


Sorry, but I have to disagree with that observation. I would have to say that the only positive initiative would be to have the guts to call an early election. The government's policies are about nothing more than desperately preserving the status quo of power. What good, Member for Throsby, is compensation if you do not have a job?

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (21:02):  I congratulate the members for Cunningham and—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  I beg your pardon?




Mr Briggs:
  I thought you were more of a CFMEU man.




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  I congratulate the members for Cunningham and Throsby on bringing this resolution forward. Indisputably, even their worst detractors over there would concede that they have very close associations with industry in the Illawarra. I particularly noted the point made by the member for Cunningham concerning the contrast between what the previous government did in Newcastle and the swift action that has followed the terminations at BlueScope. All we are hearing from the opposition is their opposition to measures within that package.


One of the most interesting parts of this debate so far has been the contrast between the contributions of two members on the opposite side. The member for McPherson, who has an industrial relations background, obviously has a close knowledge of industry in her electorate. She gave examples of what is happening with industries in her electorate and saw the problems that this country faces as extremely broad: the Australian dollar and skills, as well as the spending patterns that are apparent in Australia at the moment.


In contrast, the opposition's spokesperson, who put on quite a performance at the Press Club recently, came in here with the usual diatribe against various individuals in the government. It was the end of Western civilisation, according to the member for Indi, but she offered no answers whatsoever. As I said, she was at the Press Club and there we saw her call for more collaboration between researchers and industry, simultaneously saying that we should abolish innovation councils, where that collaboration actually happens. We saw her praising greenhouse gas reductions in this country by manufacturers but claiming that manufacturing had no place in the clean energy future. We heard her say that her major contribution to industry in this country would be to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and get rid of the $4.8 billion industry investment in technology and development.


It is interesting to note figures from Dave Oliver from the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union about the realities of what is happening internationally. The size of the global clean energy economy is $6 trillion. Today the opposition spokesperson, as last week at the Press Club, did not come forward with any real initiatives. As I say, her contribution is to abolish initiatives in this area, not to assist industry to develop, expand and go into new areas. I noted Oliver's comment:


… we are now facing a wave of hostility to this record investment.


Instead of welcoming the opportunity … we hear all kinds of arguments … bemoaning the package.


Those comments, made in the Drum on 14 July, are the reality.


This motion calls for a diverse industry. It is important to electorates like my own. We still have agriculture and the University of Western Sydney, which has an expanding presence. We have high rates of government employment in the state and, of course, a manufacturing base which is structured around two circumstances: the fact that there are a lot of greenfield sites in Werriwa and the fact that it is in close proximity to important networks.


As the member for McPherson pointed out, the situation that we face in this country is complex. It is not simple, as the member for Indi would suggest. We are in a situation where the Australian dollar has made it very difficult for companies to compete. The member who spoke before me talked about what we face with regard to import barriers in other countries. It is preposterous to say that we can actually counter that, but, as I say, the situation with the dollar is not a simple one. It means that some of our imports are cheaper for other parts of our sector. It means that our export products can make enhanced profits.


This motion displays the government's determination to make sure that the manufacturing industry is preserved in this country. I congratulate the mover of the motion.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (21:07):  The essence of this motion is to recommend a new layer of bureaucracy which is supposedly going to be the magic potion to protect and stimulate manufacturing. In the member's dream world, there is a requirement that all major resource projects have an Australian Industry Participation Plan. This is a bad idea which goes in the wrong direction. What we need in Australia are policies which stimulate economic activity in the private sector rather than try to pick winners in any particular industry or sector. What is the first thing that any sensible government should do to achieve this objective? It is to do no harm. Yet we have seen the precise opposite of that from the Rudd-Gillard government. We have seen a determination to impose a cost burden on Australian industry which, through the imposition of a carbon tax, makes it uncompetitive with competitors based in other nations around the world. What have people in the manufacturing sector to say about this carbon tax? Mr Lindsay Partridge, the managing director of Brickworks, had this to say:


The end result will be an exodus of manufacturing industries and investment offshore, jobs will be lost, the cost of housing will increase and there will be no change to carbon emissions.


We have also seen increasing rigidities in the labour market under this government's legislation, which bears the Orwellian title of Fair Work Act. 'Do no harm' should be the first principle of government, but this government has been enthusiastically doing everything it can to interfere with the productive operation of Australian industry. What are they now suggesting? They are suggesting Australian Industry Participation Plans. What a useless piece of window dressing! I speak with some direct experience, because in the telecommunications sector in 1997 a requirement was imposed for carrier industry development plans. This emerged from the very same worthy impulse that government can make things better by imposing the requirement for a plan. I was a senior executive at Optus for eight years. I had accountability for the production of the industry development plan, and I assure you that it was a useless waste of time. It was time-consuming, costly and cumbersome and made not one bit of difference to the very considerable contributions made to industry development by Optus and other companies in the telecommunications sector.


So, despite the best instincts of the member for Throsby to engage in well-meaning government intervention—nice pieces of paper to be filled out in an earnest and worthy way—the experience is that these kinds of measures make absolutely no difference. This point was accepted by the Productivity Commission when in 2001 it recommended repeal of the completely useless industry development plan regime. One can only imagine the horror with which the Productivity Commission would view the recommendation contained in this motion by the member for Throsby.


What would be a more sensible direction for us to pursue in order to promote economic activity and ensure that the benefits of the resources boom are captured as widely as possible? Being charitable, I am prepared to concede that this intention underlies this manifestly ill-conceived motion brought forward this evening by the member for Throsby. An excellent recent report by Port Jackson Partners entitled Earth, fire, wind and water: economic opportunities and the Australian commodities cycle says:


… the opportunities and benefits of the commodities boom can accrue more broadly than is commonly understood.


They recommend an approach which is focused on building capacity and enabling growth by:


accelerating and streamlining development processes and enacting other supportive policies—


such as a—


less expansive fiscal policy—


I do not hear much support for that from the government benches—and by appropriate tax policies and by the:


encouragement of foreign investment …


Let us do sensible things to encourage manufacturing rather than implement another earnest and useless bureaucratic measure.

Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (21:12):  I welcome the motion moved by the member for Throsby because it goes to the heart of a matter of great concern to many in my electorate of Chisholm: the decline in manufacturing jobs. Unlike the previous speaker, I have seen where Australian industry partnership agreements have worked in practice in a range of cases rather than been forced down the throats of companies or individuals. People have seen the benefits of having long-term, stable relationships with their suppliers. For an example I only need look to Toyota and its relationships with many of its suppliers—in particular, in my electorate, its relationship with Unidrive. Unidrive has 300 employees, and they are guaranteed ongoing work because the company has developed a long-term, stable relationship with their major deliverer of component parts. Toyota comes on a yearly basis and trains up people at Unidrive in their skills and techniques; they also send staff from Unidrive to Japan on a very regular basis so that they can see how quality control is implemented there. Half the staff now refer to many of their processes in Japanese lingo, because that is how it is done in Japan. So relationship building is really important, and that is what we are talking about.


We also need to look at why Australia's economic credentials remain strong. The federal government's action during the global financial crisis and the resilience of the Australian economy mean that our economy continues to outperform other advanced economies. Australia's unemployment rate is incredibly low regardless of what those on the other side are saying. Recent national accounts figures said that jobs in manufacturing had increased, not declined. We also have low government debt and record terms of trade that show that our fundamentals are strong and our economic prospects are bright. We are indeed the envy of the developed world. In light of the potentially difficult global economic climate, this government understands that high-skilled, high-wage jobs ensure diversity and adaptability and prepare us for an uncertain future. We know that we cannot afford to put all our eggs in one basket, and that diversity ensures that economic benefits spread to all Australians. We also need to realise that there are more jobs in manufacturing in Australia than there are in the mining sector. We need to realise where the jobs actually are. There are also more jobs in the service sector, and we need to remember the decline in the service sector and where we need to put money.


We are looking at innovation representing a key element of building upon our current and future economic prosperity. Nowhere is this more evident than in my electorate of Chisholm, which features highly-skilled innovative research and development work. I recently had the opportunity to visit the polymers CRC in my electorate, which has been in operation since 1992. You only need to look at the joint venture between its current participants, which includes nine universities, government research organisations, CSIRO and ANSTO and its commercial arm with many businesses. It draws on world-competitive teams, comprising leading researchers from its industry participants and the best researchers in Australia, drawn from across universities and government laboratories, for delivering its planned research outcomes. Their major emphasis is on developing technologies and products to improve health, to enable greater food and water security and for producing low-cost solar energy. The use of products based on CRC technology has provided a range of benefits including productivity gains and the creation of high skilled, high-value manufacturing jobs.


I also recently visited CSIRO, which has one of its largest headquarters in my seat of Chisholm. It is also the key precinct in Clayton, which is my electorate, for materials and manufacturing science. We need to look at science and research as leading to greater industry and greater development, not with this complete negativity. At CSIRO in my electorate one of the things they are working on is titanium alloys—they are light and strong and the current production methods are too costly to expand their use beyond the aerospace market. Leading researchers from the US have been attracted to CSIRO to work on this titanium product. There is market capitalisation going on that will lead to many jobs, and we need to look at this as the way forward.


Part of the motion tonight looks at how to develop all these things together. We are doing many things in this sector that we need to be proud of instead of talking it down all the time. We need to talk up the Australian economy. We need to talk about where the jobs are, how to develop them and how to create them. Tragically I, like others before, have seen manufacturing jobs lost from my electorate. The recent announcement by Bosch that 360 jobs are going to go by the end of the year is a crying shame. They do not actually need to be going. The recent closure of Australian Envelopes, which was a money grab by the company, did not need to happen. We also need to look at what manufacturing employers do to their own staff.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (21:20):  I am not sure whether the member for Chisholm was speaking for the motion or against it given the positive outlook she had for manufacturing in Australia. I support what she said; Australia has got a very strong and diversified manufacturing sector. Some parts are performing very well at the moment while some parts are struggling under the counterweight. Pressure has been put on it by a strongly performing resource sector, and I notice the member for Wakefield, when he was walking away from his position in the Labor Party as a disciple of Paul Keating, was saying towards the end of his contribution that the success of the resource sector is apparently now a terrible thing. 'We're going to dig it all up and they're just going to leave,' was, I think, the direct quote from the member for Wakefield.


The motion moved by the member for Throsby was in part a good motion. In other parts it is an appalling step back to the future for some members of the Labor Party who are trying to send a signal of false hope to people who are going through difficult times, and they should be ashamed of themselves. They have walked away from their great Hawke-Keating traditions that we hear about so often in this place—about the reformist, the open economist, the move to a competitive global environment—and moved back to providing industry plans, as the member for Bradfield put it so well in his contribution to this debate.


With nearly one million people employed in it, the manufacturing sector is important to our economy. We will always have a manufacturing sector, and we should have one, but we will not have a manufacturing sector which is subsidised by government because we know that government subsidies do not work. The member for Wakefield can call it whatever he likes—he can call it co-investment. If the Labor Party is so desperate to run businesses it should go and try to run a business. Co-investment is the new way of describing it. It is sophistry at its finest from the member for Wakefield.


But so hypocritical are those in the government and their friends on this side that, at a time when car manufacturers are under the greatest pressure we have seen because of the dollar and other competitiveness pressures internationally, what do the Toyota workers do under their leadership of the AMWU? They walk off the job. What a shock! We have absolute pressure, we are hearing from them day in, day out; we have a motion before the parliament saying that the industry is going to fall over if we do not intervene and have co-investment, as the member for Wakefield put it. And what do the Toyota workers do? 'We'll go off the job! We may as well. Why wouldn't we?' Come on, give me a break! This highlights an utter hypocrisy. As the member for Gilmore and the member for Indi said so well regarding this Labor Party: its members talk in this chamber from the green leather of that side, but when they are out there with their mates in the AMWU they walk everyone off the job when workers are under great pressure, and they expect the taxpayer to co-invest to keep the industry going. That is the great hypocrisy of the modern Labor Party. Paul Keating will be at home tonight with his head hung in shame that one of his disciples, sitting there, refuses to continue along the path that he knows Australia should continue on. As I said before: go forwards, not backwards; let us keep moving forward. The member for Wakefield is a good example.


The modern Labor Party reminds me of Ronald Reagan's most famous contribution to American public life, where he said, describing the government:


If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidise it.


That is what this motion is about. This motion is the confirmation of what Ronald Reagan said so famously in the 1980s about a Democrat government. This is exactly what you could say about a Labor government these days. At a time when it knows parts of the manufacturing sector are under genuine pressure—and we agree that they are under genuine pressure—what does it do? It goes and puts the world's biggest carbon tax on them, putting them under more pressure. The second thing they will do is have their mates at the AMWU walk off the job at Toyota in Melbourne in the middle of the greatest pressure on the vehicle industry we have seen, but they will still come cap in hand for co-investment. Finally what you will have is the great re-regulation of the labour market to make it more difficult for these manufacturing employers to compete or to ensure that they are competitive going forward.


I think that today the chairman of the congressional House of Representatives Committee on the Budget in the United States, Mr Paul Ryan, put it perfectly. He said, 'Governments shouldn't try and pick winners and losers in the marketplace; they should focus on the conditions for economic growth and let the private sector create jobs.'

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (21:22):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Mayo, who I understand is a member of this society that they have formed, the Modest Members. They are so modest you never hear an idea out of them. That is modesty in the extreme—never having a positive idea to contribute to public debate. We saw more evidence of it tonight.


This resolution and what has been put forward by the member for Throsby—and the member for Cunningham spoke on this earlier—is critical in terms of being able to recognise that this is a sector that contributes a great deal to the Australian economy and is going through one of its roughest patches, brought on by movements in currency—45 per cent in two years. We need to look at what can be done to assist the industry through this difficult period. Overall, manufacturing itself accounts for 34 per cent of all goods exported and generates about $84 billion of income for our country. Output is still growing in the face of pretty challenging times—about one per cent in the past year—and manufacturing creates close to a million jobs. In my neck of the woods, in Chifley, manufacturing generates about 10,000 jobs and 16½ per cent of all jobs in the electorate are as a result of manufacturing activity, probably the 10th highest of the seats across the country. The contribution of manufacturing to parts of Western Sydney is huge, and I think Fowler is the other seat that benefits greatly from the contribution of manufacturing in Western Sydney.


But, as I mentioned before, currency pressures, with the Australian dollar moving 45 per cent in two years and on top of that the Chinese currency being deliberately undervalued to the tune of about 40 per cent, mean that there are huge impacts on our sector. The motion itself talks about the way that we can assist industry through greater industry participation, and it certainly attempts to find ways to help a sector that is under pressure.


Much has been made of the impact of mining in crowding out other sectors, and I wanted to see what some people in authoritative positions would be able to bring to this debate to assist us. I have to say that the Reserve Bank of Australia has made a few statements that have been real eyebrow raisers to me. We have had a lot to say about two-speed economies. While many look at the heat being generated by mining, we do need to look at other sectors of the economy and see what is happening there. It is certainly well documented in retail, for example, that they are concerned about flat retail output and concerned to see what can happen to induce greater growth there in the face of what is happening in the mining sector. Manufacturing is the other sector that has been very concerned about the growth of mining.


When we looked recently at what Ric Battellino, the deputy Reserve Bank governor, had to say, I was quite astounded at what happened when we were looking for answers from someone in a position like that. He said:


The structure of the economy is changing very dramatically and, one way or another, that is going to happen while the demand for resources is so strong—


a pretty straightforward statement, but then he said:


The manufacturing sector is finding life more difficult with this exchange rate, and we've seen the result of that in recent days. But I don't think anybody can really work out what can be done about that—


this from the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank if you are looking for answers, and on top of that—




Mr Briggs:
  Oh, attacking the Reserve Bank now?




Mr HUSIC:
  Well, they are independent, but they are supposed to be able to provide some sort of input as to where we might head, particularly in these rough times. Only adding to the position was the governor himself when he appeared on Friday, 26 August before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. He then went on to make an interesting series of comments about issues regarding individual businesses and negotiating flexibility in agreements—but, at the same time, ignoring fact. He said:


What people say to me, I cannot verify it obviously, from their individual businesses is that they find it harder to negotiate flexibility. That is something that is said. If that is true that I think is a matter for concern—


an astounding comment, particularly when he says, 'I cannot verify it obviously.' Secondly, he said:


What we do not do is get into political debates over particular policies.


He ignores the fact that 64 per cent of awards and agreements have flexibility clauses in them. On top of that, it is a slap in the face for employees and unions who worked with employers through the GFC to ensure that there was flexibility through the difficulties of the GFC. If he wants to listen to business, why doesn't he talk up, for example, the need to tackle currency differentials in the broader international economy or listen to businesses who are keen to see what he might do on interest rates?


Debate adjourned.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (21:28):  Tonight I want to acknowledge the great work of one of the country's most renowned private hospitals, the Mater hospital in Crows Nest in Sydney. As many of you know, having a child is one of the most rewarding and exciting times of our lives. Admittedly it is also one of the most stressful periods—I suspect more for the mum than for the father. I am sure my colleagues in the chamber, both mothers and fathers, would be able to empathise. It is at this stressful and joyous time that we want the best environment for our children to enter the world and for our wives, in my case, to be cared for and looked after in such a way that they will be able to focus on the challenges and to go through the birthing pangs in a compassionate and supportive environment. For me and my wife, Melissa, the Mater hospital in North Sydney provided exactly that throughout the births of our three children: Xavier, Adelaide and Ignatius. I cannot speak highly enough of the quality of care and compassion given to us and so, too, to the parents of some 40,000 babies born at the Mater since the opening of its maternity unit in 1991.


The Mater hospital maternity unit had its 20th reunion celebration last month, on 9 August, at the Crystal Ball venue in Luna Park. I was very privileged to be invited, along with, amongst others, Sarah Murdoch and Karl Stefanovic, as one of the many special guests and as a parent to attend the reunion. Like many of the parents and children who attended the 20th reunion, we were there to acknowledge and thank the staff and people who helped make the Mater hospital the unique place that it is, second to none, for their great work.


Even though I was actually born at that hospital 46 years ago, it was a 20th reunion for the maternity unit. For over 105 years the Mater hospital has worked in partnership with patients and their families. Its holistic approach to health care and its unique patient care have to be commended. They are not just doctors and nurses and staff but care givers, who work together to ensure our safety, our wellbeing and our swift recovery. Once again, I would like to thank all the staff, especially the executive director, Robert Cusack, for his leadership and his commitment to seeing that the Mater excels in its performance.


I would also like to pay tribute to a late friend of mine and an Australian icon, Harry Seidler. The late Harry Seidler is well known to many in this place for his outstanding architectural contribution not just here in Australia but around the world. He was more than an architect to me; he was a mate. Even though I disagreed with him from time to time and even had the odd political disagreement with his wife, Penelope, it is a great honour to have been asked to open Harry's Park, which is a public and cultural park currently under construction that will be a reminder of the significant contribution this man has made to our nation. The park is located in my electorate, on the corner of Glen Street and Dind Street in Milsons Point.


Let me first acknowledge his great architectural skills. Often referred to as one of the greatest and most influential architects ever to work in the Southern Hemisphere, Harry started his architectural study in Canada, before winning a scholarship to Harvard University. Arriving in Australia to commission the Rose Seidler House for his mother, his new and innovative style of architecture, which incorporated open-plan living and natural light, won him instant acclaim. He went on to design iconic buildings in Sydney such as the Australia Square tower, the MLC Centre and, I might add, Blues Point Tower, which I lived in and am very fond of. They changed the Australian landscape. Harry earned a special place in the history of modern architecture.


He was born in Vienna in 1923 and his family left for England, when Harry was just 15, to escape Nazi occupation. Soon after, the English authorities interned his family and sent the Seidlers to Canada as 'enemy aliens'. Harry was eventually permitted to study architecture and structural engineering at the University of Manitoba. He graduated with first-class honours in 1944 and, in the following year, won a scholarship to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he studied under architect Walter Gropius, formerly director of the famed Bauhaus in Germany.


For me, part of the honour of being a member of parliament is to have opportunities like this to highlight the work of and pay tribute to people such as Harry Seidler who have helped transform our society and the nation in which we live. I am proud to be able to represent his interests here in this parliament.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (10:30):  I rise today to speak on the issue of the red tape and compliance burden being imposed on employers by the Gillard Labor government with regard to paid parental leave—PPL—payments. The red tape affects many businesses in my electorate, particularly small businesses.


Mr Don Pember, the CEO of the Mandurah Retirement Village, tells me that the Labor government's way of handling these payments is significantly affecting his business. Mr Pember has expressed his concerns with regard to the additional administrative work his organisation must undertake to make these payments. This is because the Labor government has chosen to dump the responsibility for making the paid parental leave payments on the employer. The extra administrative work is gained through the double handling of payments by both Centrelink and the employer.


When the Labor government decided that, from July this year, employers were to be responsible for processing the PPL payments and also having to deal with Centrelink to gain the initial funds to do so, they effectively forced employers to become PPL pay clerks. The coalition believes that the government expenditure incurred to establish the Centrelink-administered PPL system should have continued to deliver benefits to the Australian people beyond the six-month shelf-life the Gillard government determined.


Mandurah Retirement Village employs more than 100 female employees and at least five per cent of the workforce could be on maternity leave at any one time. This means more of the village's resources are being dedicated to administering these payments. This includes familiarising the PPL pay clerks with their obligations and responsibilities; changes to payroll and accounting systems and software; the processing of payments; and compliance, verification and reporting requirements.


On top of this, there are significant fines that can be issued to employers who fail to comply with the various obligations under the scheme. I would add that the coalition, through the shadow Minister for Small Business, Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Bruce Billson, actually attempted to remove the unnecessary administrative compliance burden via the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010. Unfortunately, those on the Labor side voted it down, and the burden continues for the Mandurah Retirement Village and other small businesses like it.


This is a disgrace. It just demonstrates that the Labor Party has no sympathy for small businesses on this compliance double handling. In fact they are not interested in small business at all; they are interested in red tape rather than in seeing a properly administered scheme that saves small businesses the extra time in compliance that this initiative has put on them.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (11:04):  This motion seeks to contribute to the growing success, usability and uptake of one of Australia's emerging sustainable industries—the industry for compost, soil conditioners and mulches. The motion extends to all fertiliser products sold for private or domestic use, including the use of compost, soil conditioners and mulches as forms of fertiliser products. The motion calls on the government to work with state authorities towards standardising the labelling of compost products and prescribing the acceptable range of ingredient levels to be included in compost made available for sale for private or domestic use.


This is an important matter that was brought to my attention by Desmond Kerr in my electorate. Mr Kerr has experienced firsthand the consequences of not having proper industry standardisation and labelling in place. When we think about the benefits that compost can have in gardens for private and domestic use, Mr Kerr's story is particularly relevant to understanding the risks dedicated gardeners face in purchasing compost without proper labelling and standards. Mr Kerr purchased compost from a local distributer that had a pH level that was dramatically higher than the neutral level of seven, where I am advised compost pH should roughly sit. Rather than aiding Mr Kerr's plants to grow, by having the incorrect ingredient mix this compost was not fit for purpose and began suffocating his plants by preventing them from receiving the nutrients they required.


Purchasing plants and maintaining a garden can be a very expensive pastime. Australians who understand the benefits of compost should be able to purchase it knowing that what they are buying will in fact help their plants and not kill them. Like Mr Kerr, all gardeners should know what is in the compost we are buying, what the pH level of the compost is and what other ingredients it may contain. I understand there are a range of factors influencing the optimal growing potential of compost. Some compost may be more appropriate in certain conditions than others. Some compost products currently being sold, such as the one purchased by Mr Kerr with a pH that was drastically inappropriate for the growing conditions of the area and without proper labelling or standards, create a confidence crisis among gardeners who understand the benefits of purchasing compost and have an impact on the industry.


According to key findings published by Nursery and Garden Industry Australia, 86 per cent of Australians have a lawn, implying some form of garden where compost could have an affect either on the growth potential or on the amount of water consumed to maintain their garden. Data reveals that over 57 per cent of Australians and over 62 per cent of married couples grow their own vegetables, herbs and fruit plants. Noting the increasing cost-of-living pressures that face families under this Labor government and the benefits gained by growing vegetables, herbs and fruit plants at home, these statistics reinforce the importance of supporting a viable compost industry.




Mr Husic:
  I am staggered that you can make a political point out of this.




Mr PYNE:
  The member from the Labor Party thinks this is tremendously amusing. It is far too practical, common sense and man-on-the-Clapham-bus for the Labor Party to take any interest in these matters these days. What happened to the old Labor Party, who actually cared? What happened to the old Labor Party who used to care about people in their electorates?


With over 72 per cent of Australians intending to purchase plants for their garden during spring, this motion seeks to ensure that these Australians are provided with information on the quality of the compost they intend to buy, creating greater consumer confidence that increases demand for compost across the country. The compost industry in Australia has a turnover of more than $600 million per annum, employs more than 1,900 full-time employees and has an investment in capital of over half a billion dollars. It is growing increasingly larger and developing intellectual property with huge environmental potential. This motion, which seeks to encourage the uptake of compost for private and domestic use, would contribute to the future growth of this important Australian industry. The initiative would contribute to better nourishment of plants and gardens and would have a real impact on the environment by diverting landfill to create quality compost.


The compost industry recycles more than 5.8 million tonnes of organic material each year and has the potential to recycle an additional 13 million tonnes from landfill. Given this extra potential, if the industry's long-run supply curve could shift rightward, reducing landfill, methane and CO2 emissions, then we as policy makers must consider what factors would need to change to increase the demand for compost. This motion recognises the good work that the industry is already doing to rewrite AS 4454, and calls on the government to bring their political will to fast-track this work to ensure the future of this important Australian industry.


Concepts of compost quality and labelling were essentially unknown worldwide as recently as 1985 when governments began understanding the importance of establishing an acceptable framework for the industry to operate in. In 1992 the compost quality seal was established by the German Compost Quality Association. It is suggested that this quality seal provided a good starting point for recognition of quality in the industry and has now been adopted by the European Commission in developing the European Ecolabel seal for soil improvers. Globally, countries are recognising the significant developments that are occurring in the compost industry and are implementing processes for quality control and labelling, including by statutory means, to ensure this emerging sustainable industry is able to flourish.


This motion seeks to support the good work already occurring at an industry level and to maintain Australia's high standards and commitment to composting. I am aware that AS 4454, the Australian Standard on composts, soil conditioners and mulches, is currently being reviewed by industry and that industry are taking steps to ensure labelling and product consistency between jurisdictions in Australia. The industry, and in particular industry bodies such as Compost Australia, should be commended for their significant contribution to the standardisation of procedures in this area, particularly with respect to required markings and health and hazard warning labels, which I am advised are some of the most robust hazard warning labels in the world.


Notwithstanding the good work of the industry to date, it appears that one of the factors that is recognised as presenting a barrier to broader market acceptance of compost has been uncertainty about the consistency of compost. I am aware that this has been recognised in the discussion paper Does AS 4454 adequately benchmark compost quality?—required reading for anybody interested in this subject. I am sure the member for Chifley has read this paper. This discussion paper went on to report that:




Analysis of 52 different garden organics end-products showed that the Victorian limit for copper was exceeded on 46% of occasions, 63% of occasions for zinc and 50% of occasions for chromium. These data support the need for a revision of the heavy metal limits used in the Australian Standard for composts, soil conditioners and mulches …



Further, and as members of this House may recall, the first recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries in their report on Pricing and supply arrangements in the Australian and global fertiliser market, a catchy title, was that:


… the states and territories should consider, as a matter of priority, adopting uniform description and labelling of fertiliser products to ensure consistency between jurisdictions.


While the compost industry should be applauded for taking steps to standardise the labelling and ingredient requirements of compost products in Australia, the government must also take responsibility. To drive investment in this industry and to support the uptake of compost technologies with lasting environmental benefits, the government must be prepared to roll up its sleeves, to adopt the recommendations of the senate committee's report and to work with the states in developing these compost standards that will see lasting environmental and productivity benefits for Australia. The government must be prepared to stand up for recreational gardeners like my constituent Des Kerr and to ensure that the quality of compost made available for private and domestic use is fit for purpose, with the appropriate ingredient mix and compost labelling. I thank my colleagues who intend to take part in this debate for their support on this motion—the member for Longman and the member for Riverina, and also the Labor members of parliament, who will make inadequate contributions but will do their best. I commend the motion to the House.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (11:10):  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion. I also welcome it on the basis that it presents a diversity of issues that need to be considered by us all. I think it is timely, particularly given that there is a lot of interest in these issues within households. You only need to turn on a TV to see the different lifestyle programs that talk about what people can do in their homes and about installing and maintaining gardens. Also people's interest in sustainability issues is something that is continuing to grow. People are wanting to grow their own vegetables and herbs—and, as the member for Sturt indicated, between 67 and 52 per cent of people, depending on what demographic you pick, are doing so.


As much as I was supportive of the member for Sturt raising this matter today, I could not help a wry smile when he managed to insert political points in a debate that I think is worthy of having in this place. He gave me cause for reflection on some of the issues he sought to have a go at on the way through his speech. Nonetheless the matter is worthy of consideration. The member for Sturt referred to his constituent, Des Kerr, who has serious concerns about what he perceived to be a misrepresentation about pH levels in the fertiliser that he had purchased and was using on his property, that the PH levels were much higher than stated on the product packaging.


It is worth reminding all consumers to make inquiries of merchants about whether a product is fit for purpose, and that certainly includes fertiliser products. If consumers are not sure about a product, obviously the golden rule is to ask and to test the representations that are made. Fortunately, consumers have protections under Australian Consumer Law—ACL. This government has taken steps to strengthen the ACL and those took effect in January this year. Consumer guarantees under the ACL cover any type of goods or services costing up to $40,000 sold in trade or commerce. The big message here is that for people concerned about representations made about what is in fertilisers or composted products—though more often than not it is fertilisers; a lot of people are taking up the opportunity to compost on their own property using waste products—the ACL provides a range of protections for any product under $40,000. People should definitely avail themselves of those protections. Consumer guarantees also allow consumers to seek redress if the goods they buy are not fit for the purpose specified by the people selling the product.


It is worth noting that the ACL consolidates up to 20 Commonwealth, state and territory laws into one single harmonised law. The member for Sturt said that we need to take a national approach on this issue and the government are seeking to do just that in terms of Consumer Law. For consumers seeking to purchase fertilisers for home or business use there is some sort of protection regardless of where they live. Consumers will also be interested to know, especially businesses that operate in more than one state or territory, that the benefit of having a single consumer law generates commercial and consumer benefit. The Productivity Commission believe that about $4.5 billion of benefit to the Australian economy flows as a result of having a unified Consumer Law. As I mentioned earlier, there are about nine guarantees for products. These include suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that goods are of acceptable quality; secondly suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that the goods will be reasonably fit for any purpose the consumer or supplier specifies, especially in terms of the matters that are brought here before the Main Committee; suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that the description of goods is accurate; suppliers guaranteeing that goods will match any sample or demonstration model; suppliers and manufacturers guaranteeing that goods will satisfy any extra promises made about them in the form of express warranties; suppliers guaranteeing that they have the right to sell the goods being supplied or that no-one will try to repossess or take back those goods; suppliers guaranteeing that the goods being supplied are free from hidden securities or charges; and, finally, manufacturers or importers guaranteeing that they will take reasonable steps to provide spare parts or repair facilities for a reasonable time after purchase. Not all of those guarantees, obviously, relate to the matters at hand, but the guarantee regarding the accuracy of the description of the goods and the guarantee that the goods themselves be reasonably fit are certainly important protections, particularly in reference to the matter that the member for Sturt raised about whether or not pH levels were matching the representations made to the consumer on the packaging.


As the member for Sturt referred to, there has also been a voluntary product safety standard in place since 2003, AS 4454, covering compost, soil conditioners and mulches, which includes guidance on required pH levels. Any products that purport to meet the voluntary standard but which are found not to, in fact, meet that standard, risk breaching the misleading representation provisions of ACL, some of which I mentioned earlier, and they could face significant penalties. While we would acknowledge that individual members of the public have, from time to time, expressed concern about labelling requirements for fertiliser products, the government is not aware of a wider community concern about excessive pH levels in these products.


Coming back to the point I made at the start of my contribution today, the raising, particularly within parliament, of these types of issues gives us an opportunity to take note of the fact that there is a concern out there. While the member for Sturt has raised this issue on behalf of his constituent, it is obviously incumbent upon us all to take steps to monitor whether there is a wider concern—and to act accordingly if there is. However, at this point calls for a mandatory standard would definitely increase the regulatory burden and on-costs for business, and any additional cost would ultimately be passed on to consumers. We have to be certain that there is widespread concern to justify consumers paying more.


We have undertaken significant regulatory reform to lift those burdens on businesses. One critical step we have taken has been the bringing in of harmonised consumer laws, but we have also brought in reforms in a range of other important areas, such as standard business reporting, trade licensing, consumer credit and national construction codes. While not related to this matter, these reforms demonstrate that we are trying to take steps on a number of fronts to reduce those burdens on businesses, especially small businesses. 


While there are concerns, as have been expressed so far in the debate, we need to be balanced in deciding at what point we take action and whether or not that action would be disproportionate to the issue raised. If there is evidence of a widespread problem, the government will certainly consult further with states and territories. I would certainly encourage them to do that and I think that is part of the call being made here today. 


One of the other points raised by the member for Sturt was the fact that, while at the moment 5.8 million tonnes of compost are being recycled, by extracting out of landfill there is the potential for another 13 million. At that point, depending on whether or not the concerns are as widespread as may be suggested, then, given the size of that potential, we need to look at what the standards need to be. But at this point, while the issue is definitely one that needs to be taken on board, there is a matter of whether or not the response needs to be as widespread or as definite as what has been outlined so far. But I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate and to learn more about an issue that has obviously sparked some concern in the member for Sturt's electorate.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (11:20):  I rise to support and second the member for Sturt's motion, which calls for uniform guidelines for the labelling and regulation of fertiliser products for private and domestic use in Australia. This motion rightly recognises that the information currently available to individuals purchasing fertiliser products is limited and that, in many cases, consumers are not being provided with information sufficient to determine whether a product is appropriate for the purpose they require it, including if a product might be damaging to some plants or hazardous to health. The current system of voluntary regulation for labelling and composition of fertilisers varies across all states and territories and ultimately impacts consumers' ability to make an informed purchase decision.


The Senate Select Committee on Agriculture and Related Industries reported in its report Pricing and supply arrangements in the Australian and global fertiliser market that the fertiliser product industry has been largely left without any regulation in the area of product labelling. The report highlighted that the industry itself has been calling for uniformity in compost standards to ensure that fertiliser products are of a high standard. The report's first recommendation was that the states and territories should consider, as a matter of priority, adopting uniform description and labelling of fertiliser products to ensure consistency between jurisdictions. It is clear that there is an urgent need for regulation of labelling of this industry in the form of a national standard for labelling of fertiliser products, which is actually what this motion proposes.


As it currently stands, the industry is without accountability to consumers, most obviously with residential consumers, who rely completely on information available on the packaging of the product and on anecdotal evidence available to them. The percentages of the three active ingredients in fertiliser products—phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen—are not currently required to be defined on labelling. However, the percentages of these ingredients, when combined with the factors of soil pH and the type of plant, require varying amounts of these active ingredients to prosper. Without detailed labelling consumers are simply not in a position to effectively determine what is appropriate for their specific requirements. These choices often turn into a trial and error process in determining what products will be effective for their prize roses, backyard lawns or veggie gardens.


Consumers should not have to risk using a fertiliser product that is so completely unsuited to their needs and risk damaging their plants in the process. Information about the composition of the fertiliser, the pH levels and the types of plants it is suited to should all be provided to the consumer through detailed labelling on the product itself. As a country, we have a national regulation requirement for products in many categories. Why should fertiliser products be different or have any less uniform labelling than these?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The honourable member's time has expired, as I understand it. In fact, I do apologise to the member for Longman. There has been a malfunction in the clock. The honourable member for Longman continues to have the call.




WYATT ROY:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would always respect your ruling, but I will continue.


I freely admit that I do not have a strong personal understanding of the complex and varied nuances of soil balances and fertiliser composition. However, coming from a farming family, I do understand the importance of maintaining excellent soil quality and using all means necessary to achieve and maintain high soil quality. I also understand that, unlike residential consumers, farmers have access to extensive advice from government departments, agricultural consultants and professional soil testing, all of which guide farmers on their choice of fertilisers according to the specific needs of their local environment.


Residential gardeners, local small business landscapers and gardeners themselves do not have access to any of this detailed information. Rather, their advice comes from the hardware sales assistant or perhaps a neighbour or a friend. Detailed labelling for these products is then, for obvious reasons, very significant. The call for a national standard and more detailed labelling on these products goes beyond providing consumers with adequate information. These products are purchased by and large by individuals who are recreational gardeners with little understanding and experience of using hazardous chemicals and composting materials. Detailed and consistent information is essential to ensure the personal health and safety of these consumers when using fertiliser products. 


As a community, we are striving for sustainable and healthy living and we endeavour to make positive changes in our lives to achieve these qualities. Organic fertilisers are considered to be environmentally and ecologically safe, and their use should be encouraged. All fertilisers need to be handled with caution. All individuals who handle these products need to be made aware of the possible risks and hazards involved with these products in order to make appropriate decisions and take appropriate precautions—for instance, using masks and gloves. These conditions may be particularly dangerous for the health of those individuals with pre-existing lung conditions or immunodeficiencies as they are particularly susceptible to contracting bacterial infections from strains of nocardia or similar bacteria.


Consumers need to be informed about the risk of these products, which is only possible through the employment of consistent and detailed labelling—labelling which identifies what safety precautions need to be taken before, during and after the handling of these products. It is interesting to note that Australians on average spend over 20 minutes each day caring for their pets and gardens. Clearly this is a significant Australian recreational activity, and every effort should be made to provide clarity and consistency of information. This is why I support this motion, a motion that is calling for a uniform national standard for the labelling of fertiliser products and prescribing the appropriate composition of active ingredients in fertiliser products.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:26):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this motion concerning a national standard for fertiliser products. It is interesting that the opposition, who always argue against mandatory standards, are bringing a motion before this parliament requesting that mandatory standards be put in place. The opposition are supposed to be friends of business, but if they were the friends of business they should be aware that by putting this regulatory burden on business they would be increasing the cost of doing business and making it harder for business. I question whether they are really the friends of business. This motion shows that the people who really listen to the needs of business are on this side of the parliament.


I am fresh from being back in my electorate. My husband did gardening at the weekend and part of that gardening involved fertilising plants. I was not in the garden with him as the lifestyle of a member of parliament means that we do not get too much time to enjoy being outdoors looking after our plants. The reason I am talking about his contribution to our garden is that he approaches it in the way that I think all people approach gardening. He knew that he needed to put some fertiliser on the lawn so he went to the local store to purchase the required fertiliser. He talked about what he needed to fertilise with the shop assistant working there. He was given a breakdown of the types of fertiliser that were included and he took the advice of a well-trained sales assistant who knew the right kind of fertiliser to use on the lawn, the plants and the vegetables. He walked away with a few bags of fertiliser and was ready to work in the garden. I know that in a couple of months we will see the reward of his finding out about the right kind of fertiliser to use. The member for Longman talked about using masks and gloves. I think any sensible gardener uses masks and gloves. My husband was in the garden wearing a mask and his gloves. So I would encourage all consumers to do what Lindsay did: make inquiries of the merchant about whether a product is fit for the purpose for which it is to be used.


This does not apply only to fertiliser products. We use many commodities in our daily lives. If you have a doubt about anything, check to see whether it will be appropriate for the intended use. I am very careful about what I eat. A number of people have allergies to food—for example, to peanuts. We, as consumers, go out of our way to work out what is in those products. If a person is not sure about the product—this goes to every product we use, not only fertilisers—then the golden rule is to ask. If you cannot find out, do not use it. If you are not comfortable with it, do not use it.


Under the Australian Consumer Law, the ACL, consumers have protection. Under the ACL, consumer guarantees cover any types of goods and services costing up to $40,000 sold in trade and commerce. As members of parliament, it is our role to ensure that consumers are aware of this guarantee. This provides a safety net to all consumers. Consumer guarantees allow consumers to seek redress if the goods they are provided with are not fit for the purpose specified by the consumer. There is also a voluntary product safety standard in place; that is AS4454-2003—the Australian standard for composts, soil conditioners and mulches—which includes guidance on a required PH level. This motion calls for us to move away from voluntary standards—the voluntary standards that those on the other side of this parliament always argue in favour of—to mandatory standards. Any product that purports to meet the voluntary standard but is found not to meet the standard risks breaching the misleading representation provision of the Australian Consumer Law and people could face significant penalties.


I have been involved in the voluntary standards that relate to breastfeeding, which is quite a different area. Members on the other side of this parliament argued very strongly against mandatory standards in that area. Members on the other side of this parliament also argued very strongly against mandatory standards in relation to food labelling. They argued that the best way to achieve it is by a voluntary industry standard. But in relation to the motion before us today, the opposition is arguing that the government should move away from voluntary standards in the area of fertilisers whilst keeping in place voluntary standards in those other areas—areas which are very important to the health and safety of our community. So there are double standards involved in today's motion. The reason for the member moving this motion in parliament is not apparent to me. I have heard him argue against mandatory standards in other areas. His colleagues on the other side of this parliament argue against mandatory standards. As I said in the beginning, a call for mandatory standards would increase the regulatory burden and the cost for business, something that those on the other side of the House obviously have no qualms about doing. Again, they would have to go out and explain to their business constituency how they can justify this increased cost to and regulatory burden on them. Any additional increase in cost ultimately increases the cost to consumers. We need to be certain that there is widespread concern that would justify making consumers pay more. This motion is really about increasing the cost to business, increasing the cost to consumers and therefore increasing daily living expenses—something that those on the other side of this parliament do not mind doing. If there is evidence that there is a widespread problem then I urge the members on the other side to consult with the government and, further, with the states and territories and the fair trading regulators to determine whether or not further regulation is needed.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-09-19,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:36):  An urgent need exists to address inconsistencies between all compost standards and the government regulations which override them. A review completed by Robyn Neesen of Yanco in the Riverina highlights anomalies between compost standards in federal and state regulations. The report refers particularly to contaminant levels and the need for action to ensure a high-standard product which will improve soil health and productivity. There are currently no compulsory guidelines prescribing the quality of compost sold to recreational gardeners for private and domestic use. Many gardeners, be gardening their livelihood or just a hobby, have no way of knowing if the fertiliser they are purchasing will do more damage than good to their plants.


In the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries winter edition newsletter, the main article was headed 'When compost ain't compost'. It was a telling heading and an interesting piece. When it comes to compost, things are not always as they ought to be.




Mrs Griggs:
  Really?




Mr McCORMACK:
  Yes, really, Member for Solomon, and I will continue, because this is an absolutely interesting subject and one that is very important. While this might not seem important in the overall scheme of issues on the national agenda at present, it is something which, if passed, will ensure consistency and uniformity in an area in which many people participate.


Gardening is one of Australia's most popular pastimes. I am sure the member for Solomon probably spent the weekend in the garden when she was not busy taking care of her constituents—as she does, because she is a very good local member. A nice garden shows that people take pride in their most important investment: their home. I am sure the member for Bendigo probably spent his weekend in the garden, too. A working garden produces fresh fruit and vegetables—so crucial to healthy living.


Australians love gardening. From the very enthusiastic gardener who spends every waking moment either thinking about or actually mulching and tilling their back yard, to the very casual fellow who phoned in his thoughts about rugby league to Sydney radio station 2GB's continuous call team yesterday while enjoying a quiet drink and pulling out a weed or two to make out he was working hard in the garden, Aussies love working with plants in the great outdoors. You also only have to look at the number of gardening shows and 'do-it-yourself' programs that are so popular on television and radio to realise the emphasis Australians put on gardening.


On average, Australians spend 22 minutes per day on grounds and animal care, which includes the work of many conscientious gardeners. That equates to about 134 hours per year that the average Australian may be spending tending to their garden, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Those are 2006 figures, I might add; the statistics, I feel, would actually be increased in 2011 and will increase beyond that. Gardening is enjoyed greatly by Australia's seniors, and so it becomes even more important given that we have an ageing population. With no standard or requirement to prescribe the ingredient levels of fertilisers made available for private or domestic sale, residential gardeners cannot possibly know if the fertiliser they are purchasing will do more harm than good to their precious plants. Fertiliser is not cheap, so people should know what they are getting. Those who work in gardening stores and compost supply companies are not always aware nor do they have the time on all occasions to explain all the details about the products. Plants are not inexpensive either and gardeners need to know that what they are growing them in or sustaining them with is what will be best for the plants. Robyn Neeson's recent review entitled Compost comparison: organic standards AS 4454: the need for consistent, high quality compost standards and regulations, reported that regulations of consistency are paramount for organic and conventional agriculture. She emphasised what anyone who knows anything about improving soil quality has known all along—that is, that farmers are encouraged to use organic compost to improve soil health and to sequester carbon. However, the inconsistencies make it difficult for users to assess the quality of the product and ensure its suitability for use.


Earlier this year, Ms Neeson exhibited a poster and submitted a paper to an international symposium on compost use in horticulture. She has reviewed the three Australian organic standards for their compost requirements: Organic and Biodynamic Products, AS 6000-2009; Australian Certified Organic Australian Organic Standard 2006; and National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia Organic Standard 2008.


All organic standards reviewed concurred that organic certification standards should restrict compost inputs to natural materials such as animal and plant wastes, and naturally mined minerals and trace elements. Both the Australian Certified Organic standard and the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia standard prohibit the use of biosolids on food crops, but AS 6000-2009 made no reference to biosolids.


It is a requirement of all organic standards that they also comply with relevant government regulations. Ms Neeson found that the levels of contaminants acceptable in organic farming standards varied between standards. She reported compost is a primary source of nutrients in organic farming systems and the higher levels permitted by some organic standards for elements such as zinc presumably aim to reflect this requirement. In some instances, ambiguous terms such as 'none or low level', AS 6000-2009, and 'not containing synthetic chemicals', ACO, are used in preference to precise limits. This is not about the information on the back of compost packs not being right and not giving quite all the information, and thus being an impost on businesses; this is about giving the correct information to consumers—information that they need and rightly should expect given the fact that they are spending so much money on fertilisers and composts.


Australian Standard Composts, soil conditioners and mulches, AS 4454-2003, specifies physical, chemical, biological and labelling requirements for composts. In addition, all products and their application must comply with federal and state regulations. The standard also details the best-practice guidelines for composting. The AS 4454-2003 permits the use of organic materials, including biosolids as feedstock ingredients. Mixtures of organic waste which contain non-organic materials are permitted—for example, plastic, glass and metal from household waste—but restrictions are placed on the proportion and size of these contaminants.


All compost standards, organic and AS, defer to federal or state regulations with regard to minimum standards in feedstock material, application techniques and contaminant levels—heavy metals, organic contaminants and pathogens. The review also found that these regulations varied across state jurisdictions. It is time to get this sorted. We need a national standard for fertiliser products. This motion will enable that.


We heard only last week in parliament of the importance of precious petals. The Prime Minister must be a keen gardener for she is obviously aware of the need to take care of our precious petals because she raised it during Tuesday's proceedings. This motion will take care of precious petals as well as all other plants which benefit from compost and fertiliser. Moreover, it will put in place safeguards for gardeners and heighten their knowledge of the product they are buying and using, something which should be stated consumer information. I implore the government to help pass this legislation.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:44):  It is with great pride that I stand to talk about this important matter before the chamber which has been put forward by the member for Sturt. This motion comes in good time as spring is almost upon us, when it is a nice warm day here in Canberra and when it was certainly a warm weekend in Brisbane. This is the time when we should be applying 'Weed and Feed' to our lawns and fertilising our gardens in preparation for the growing seasons. Unfortunately, one of the downsides of this job is that my garden does not always get the attention it deserves. But this motion has, at the very least, prompted me to turn some attention to my garden in the coming weeks. The member for Sturt is right. Like most products, fertilisers can be used in the wrong way and occasionally with damaging results. I once heard a story of a bloke—I am pretty sure he was a constituent—who was gifted a square of grass from the Gabba cricket ground, because now they drop in ovals and the like and they do resurfacing. And so precious was this grass, especially in Queensland, that he took it home, planted it in his backyard, nurtured it, watered it and, for those cricket and Aussie Rules fans, developed his own piece of the Gabba or his own slice of history.


When he moved house years later, he dug up a sample of the grass so that he could take it to his new property so that he had a little slice of the Gabba at his new home. However, the next year he went to fertilise his precious lawn that he had taken with him as he moved house but, instead of applying fertiliser, he poisoned it with something like Roundup. Therefore, he ended up killing his own backyard piece of the Gabba forever. It just goes to show that you can make mistakes in applying simple fertilisers. It makes me wonder what has prompted this motion from the member for Sturt. Has he had a strange or a bad experience in his garden? Has he been exposed to too much manure?




Mr Gibbons:
  Or is he a precious petal?




Mr PERRETT:
  I take that interjection, but I am talking garden wise not policy wise, Member for Bendigo. Has he applied the wrong fertiliser and inadvertently killed his hydrangeas? Who knows? I hope not, for his sake. Nevertheless, Australia certainly uses a lot of fertiliser. Each year Australians apply between five and six million tonnes, obviously, mostly in farming but a lot is still applied to domestic gardens. We export up to 400,000 tonnes of fertiliser a year. Any fertilisers imported into Australia must meet strict quarantine requirements for maximum permissible concentrations of certain impurities.


All states already have rules regarding the labelling of fertilisers and that is obviously appropriate. These labels concern appropriate use and application guidelines. Fertiliser labels generally must include the name of the fertiliser, the quantity by weight or by volume, the name and full business address of the wholesaler and all the relevant warnings, particularly about safe handling and all those other occupational health and safety requirements that we need to be aware of. 


The gentleman I mentioned earlier, who perhaps could have saved his Gabba turf had he simply read the label or asked for advice from the staff at his local hardware store, particularly if it is a small hardware store rather than one of those big megastores. If in doubt, consumers need to make inquires at the place of purchase about the best product for their desired purpose. If a customer is given the wrong advice, then obviously they are protected under normal consumer law protections. All consumers are able to seek redress if the goods they buy are not suitable for the purpose that was advertised. In Queensland, this would be as per the Sale of Goods Act, and there is similar legislation throughout Australia.


I understand that these consumer guarantees cover goods and services up to the value of $40,000. It would be hard, though, to compensate or replace the original Gabba turf—it is not the sort of thing that you would go to court to receive recompense for—or, if you are a Victorian, a piece of the MCG or whatever your particular piece of special grass. 


I do appreciate the concerns of the member for Sturt. However, I think there is a little bit of hypocrisy here. He does not come in here and talk about a national curriculum to drive improvement to our children's education. He does not believe in national education standards for our children but, through this motion that he has introduced, he has shown that he is very passionate about establishing a national standard for fertiliser and compost products. I guess that, sometimes in politics, you just have to follow your heart. Australia already has a voluntary safety standard in place: AS4454. The Australian standards for compost, soil conditioners and mulches include guidance on the required pH levels so that you can guide even a novice gardener like me through to what is required. Significant penalties can apply where a product that claims to meet Australian Standard 4454 yet does not. This may breach the misleading representations provisions of the Australian consumer law. Obviously it is difficult to enforce these things, especially if you are just a normal suburban gardener—it is not the sort of thing you would probably rush off to the courts to enforce but there still are those protections there. 


The member for Sturt may have more people going through his electorate door who are keen to talk about compost. However, I have only been in parliament for about four years and I think I could say that I have not had anyone come to my office, write to me, email me or make contact in any way to talk about fertiliser labelling or excessive pH levels in these products. Lots of people have come to talk to me about carbon levels, but never about the pH levels in the products. They are concerned about the impact if the opposition votes against the Carbon Farming Initiative—a lot of people have spoken to me about that but never about pH levels, but I live and wait. I do understand that when government increases regulation the compliance costs will in turn increase for business, and obviously consumers will lose out in the end through increased product costs.


As there is currently no widespread community concern, we simply cannot justify making consumers foot the bill for what, on the surface, would appear to be quite an unnecessary government regulation. However, if the member for Sturt does have evidence of a widespread problem in the fertiliser and compost industry, the government will talk to the state and territory fair trading regulators. That would be the more appropriate body to regulate this because, as I said, there is already an established process.


We have paid a lot of attention to fertiliser over the years after we saw the amazing situation a few years back in the United States where a building was blown up by people inappropriately using fertiliser so now it is much more controlled. There is a much healthier approach to what fertiliser should be sold and where it should be sold. I would suggest to the member for Sturt—and I am not sure if he is the best gardener in the world or not, if he has time for that—that he turn instead to the state and territory fair trading regulators and the approaches they have to controlling the fertiliser industry. 


As I said earlier, now is the time—with September upon us and the equinox this week—when people will be turning to their gardens in the school holidays or in their spare time and they will be able to decide how best to use their fertiliser to improve their gardens. Obviously it would be much more appropriate to do that by consultation with the person who sells them the fertiliser rather than by being concerned with the motion put forward by the member for Sturt. I have a lot more faith in our state and territory fair trading regulators and I am sure that they will be able to work out what is needed to be done in this area, and they are best placed to assess any need for further labelling regulations.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (16:01):  Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, when I was interrupted last week shortly following your remarks I was about to compliment you on the very fine account you gave of the scale of the attack and the consequences of it in New York. It was one of those extraordinary moments in world history. I have no doubt all people who were alive at the time can remember where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news, just as many of us can remember quite precisely where we were and what we were doing at the moment we learned that John Kennedy had been assassinated.


On the occasion of the attack on the World Trade Centre my wife and I had come home. It was late in the evening. We were rung by her brother who told us that he had seen pictures on the television of one of the towers being hit. We were horrified. We were particularly anxious, not least because our own son had just recently travelled to the United States to go to college in Boston, and we were not sure whether he was still in New York or not. He had, in fact, left shortly before, so he was in Boston at the time, but we were not sure of that when her brother rang. So we turned on the television and saw one tower burning and smouldering, then saw the second plane hit. It was an extraordinary moment. 


Those towers—probably more than any other buildings in the world—symbolised the triumph of American capitalism, the triumph of New York as the great global city. They were symbols of modernity, symbols of modern civilisation, and they were brought down before our eyes and the eyes of millions of other people watching at the time.


The tragedy of the attack is indescribable. Who will ever forget the pictures of people leaping out of the building? Why were they leaping? Were they leaping hoping for a miracle, hoping that perhaps they might fall on something that could save their lives or had they given up all hope and felt that anything was better than being burnt alive in that inferno? It is very hard to say. But it was a day of indescribable tragedy and a day also of great courage. Who will ever forget the heroism of the firefighters who battled their way into those buildings to bring people out, so many of them losing their lives in the process? Who will forget the courage of the passengers on United Airlines 93 which, so we believe, was headed for the US Capitol?


Those passengers, becoming aware of what was going on through their cell phones, took the self-sacrificing step, clearly, of breaking into the cockpit and overpowering the pilot with the consequence that it fell, crashing into a field in Pennsylvania and killing everybody on board but saving the US Capitol from that attack.


We can only imagine what the impact of 9-11 would have been if, in addition to bringing down the Twin Towers and attacking and destroying a wing of the Pentagon—the symbol of American military might—that the home, the symbol, the place of American parliamentary democracy in the United States were turned into a smouldering wreck like the Twin Towers by that plane. It would have been an even more extraordinary day than we witnessed. There were many things to be appalled by and there were many great things to remember. As always on these occasions these tragedies seem to bring out the worst but also the best of the human spirit.


On 11 September this year the US Consul-General in Sydney, Mr Niels Marquardt, and the former Australian Consul-General in New York, Ken Allen, and their wives, Judy Marquardt and Jill Allen, organised an interdenominational ecumenical memorial service, which was held in St Mary's Cathedral. There was present, of course, the host, Cardinal George Pell, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney. There were also present the Imam of the Zetland mosque, Sheik Dr Mohammed Anas, and many other clergyman and religious and community leaders.


Among the faith leaders there was the senior rabbi of the Great Synagogue in Sydney, Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence. In the midst of that enormous congregation, and in the midst of some outstanding speeches by the two diplomats and by the other clergyman, Jeremy Lawrence gave a most remarkable speech. I want to read a portion of it into the record today. He asked:


How do we respond to the evil destruction of an iconic landmark and symbol, thousands dead, thousands more lives ruined?


He said:


This very question was posed by the rabbis of the Talmud writing of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the magnificent home of monotheistic belief.


—the home of the Abrahamic faiths, the three largest faiths in the world: the original Jewish religion and then the two faiths derived from it, Christianity and Islam. Of the three remarkable faiths, two, Christianity and Islam, are the largest faith communities in the world. He said:


When the Rabbis of the Talmud posed the question after the fall of the Temple, one school, the Mourners of Zion decreed that there could be no further happiness. Jerusalem should remain without music and celebration until it was blessed with messianic redemption. In Hebrew, the expression ""Zecher LeChurban"" means remembrance of destruction. Within Jewish practice today every home is supposed to have a ""Zecher LeChurban"" a remembrance of the destruction with a prominent area left unpainted or undecorated. We should have a constant reminder that our lives have lost some of their lustre. At every Jewish wedding we shatter a glass, Zecher LeChurban. However great our joy at the occasion, we remember the Temple with solemnity and sadness. All joy is incomplete and fragmented in the remembrance of what has been lost. Another school—


Rabbi Lawrence notes—


remembered the Temple with a different slant.  ""Zecher LeMikdash"" means a remembrance of the sanctuary.  Every Passover we eat unleavened bread in a sandwich that the sage Hillel recalled as a Temple practice.  On the feast of Tabernacles today we process for seven days with the palm, which used to be done only in the Temple.  ""Zecher LeMikdash"" exhort the rabbis.  We should celebrate and honour the buildings and the lives lost by incorporating their memories, their virtues and their values into our ongoing lives.


How must we respond to tragedy?  Do we focus on the churban, the destruction or the mikdash, the sanctuary and its vibrancy.  For sure, we do not forget.  We do not abandon.  Nor do we lose ourselves and augment the ruin.


With twin responses we confront the ambivalence of our psyche expressing on the one hand our profound grief that our world is damaged and that we are bereft.  But we express on the other, defiance and ongoing struggle; a striving to renew and rebuild.  The physical may crumble but the spirit endures.


We must not let ourselves be defeated by acts of destruction; nor may we lose hope that we shall see reconstruction and redemption; nor ought we dishonour those who showed faith and resilience in the face of adversity through our own hesitation.  We respond by living better lives, through celebrating life and imbuing it with meaning.


Rabbi Lawrence there, reaching back to the destruction of another great building, beautifully describes the two emotions, the two approaches that we have to the destruction of the World Trade Centre. We remember the disaster but we also remember the values for which those towers stood—values of freedom—and our commitment to defend those values now and in all the years to come.


And a very costly battle it has been. The wars that 9-11 spawned have spanned the world. There is a war that goes on in our own midst: the war against Islamist fundamentalist terrorism. It is a war that is being fought by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. It is a war that has been fought by Australian soldiers in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands have died in the course of these battles, and they are not yet over.


Are we winning in Afghanistan? We believe we are winning, but it is a war, as General Petraeus said, that cannot be won in the sense of a complete military victory. Any victory inevitably will be a negotiated one; any outcome will be one negotiated with the Taliban. Already, we can see that there are considerable steps being taken by the Americans towards achieving that.


In the battle in Afghanistan, the counterinsurgency has been undermined or weakened by the fact that the Afghan government itself, the official government headed by President Karzai, is, in many parts of the country, corrupt and inefficient. So persuading the local people that they should abandon their ties with the Taliban and cleave instead to the new government will be unconvincing if that government itself lacks appeal, legitimacy and authority or is seen as not acting in their interests.


The whole objective of counterinsurgency of course is to suppress the insurgents for long enough for the legitimate government to take charge, but if that government we regard as legitimate is not an appealing and attractive one, a government that can obtain and secure the support of the people, then all of the counterinsurgency efforts will be for nought. So, while there are many people who criticise the business of nation building and disregard it, the fact is that without effective nation building the counterinsurgency cannot succeed.


We are also faced in that arena with a very dangerous combination of elements in Pakistan. We have there a country which is unstable, which has nuclear weapons, and which has, or has through the operation of certain individuals in Pakistan, in the past shared nuclear weapons secrets with other states, notably North Korea. We have a situation in Pakistan, if you note Anatol Lieven's recent, excellent book Pakistan: A Hard Country, where a majority of the population, in Mr Lieven's view, regard the 9/11 attacks as having been an event staged by the Americans to justify their invasion of Iraq. That seems incredible. If someone stopped you on a bus or a train, as people have occasionally stopped me, and told you that 9/11 was essentially a fraud perpetrated by the Americans to justify an attack on the Islamic world you would regard that almost as the utterings of a madman, but it has very wide currency in Pakistan.


We also recognise that the Taliban in Afghanistan are now regarded in Pakistan as a group worthy of support because, firstly, they are seen as the group that will be there after the Americans inevitably leave. Of course, after the Americans leave, the Pakistanis will still be in Pakistan. The Americans and Australians may have gone but the inhabitants of the countries in that region will still be there. Secondly, the Taliban are seen as being a counterweight to the power of India asserting itself in Afghanistan. From a Pakistani point of view, focused always on the rivalry with India, more strength is given to the Pashtun Taliban in Afghanistan as that counterweight.


There are no easy solutions in sight, nor is there an easy end in sight to the wars that 9/11 began. Nonetheless, we have no choice but to continue waging them, perhaps in different ways and perhaps more effectively—we should always aim to do that. But the thread that ties all of our efforts—some more successful than others—together is the thread of freedom. It is the thread of those values of economic freedom, political freedom, modernity and liberalism, in the truest sense of the word, that were symbolised by the World Trade Centre, which was attacked by al-Qaeda because of the values it symbolised just as the Capitol would have been attacked, had it not been for the heroism of the passengers of United Airlines 93, because of what it symbolised.


We mourn the events of 9/11. We honour those who lost their lives on that day and those who have lost their lives defending freedom ever since. The words of the rabbi were profound, reminding us that in the midst of grieving we must also celebrate the values which we have stood for and which were represented by the structures we have lost. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the speech of the senior rabbi.


Leave granted.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:18):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. A decade has passed since the September 11 attacks on the US, yet for me the images of planes flying into the Twin Towers, the attacks on the Pentagon and the panicked rescue scenes immediately after remain vivid in my mind. The scenes of aircraft flying into the Twin Towers and the towers crumbling were surreal—it was like watching fiction. But they were real and they heralded the dawn of a new era in global affairs. Sadly, it was not a turn for the better, and 10 years later, for all our efforts, insecurity caused by those events still haunts people around the world. The way we go about daily life is no longer the same, and the additional costs associated with the way we now live are probably unquantifiable. Those additional costs have in my view contributed to the global financial crisis. In the light of the ongoing global financial insecurity, some would say that the September 11 attacks, therefore, were successful in bringing down the USA and the Western world. There is little doubt that the counterterrorism efforts and security costs incurred by governments around the world since September 11, 2001 have skyrocketed. In addition, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have each had their own human and financial tolls.


The harsh reality is that, as is the case with all crime, as detection prevention techniques become more sophisticated, so too do the methods of the terrorists. Furthermore, as with all criminal behaviour, new individuals and new cells emerge as others are contained or eliminated. It is a never-ending problem. The changes to airport security alone have been profound, yet I for one hardly feel safer because of them. The killings in Norway in July this year showed just how quickly and how easily it is still possible to bring about the mass killings of innocent lives. The prevention of terrorist acts in all places at all times is simply not possible. The most effective strategy would be to address the underlying motive for such attacks, but even then that would not rule out the actions of fanatics such as those of the recent extremist in Norway.


For me September 11, 2001 has a very personal relevance. Andrew Knox, who was killed in the Twin Towers attack and whom I have spoken about in this place on previous occasions, was a Labor Party colleague and a friend. I recall that in my last telephone conversation with him before he left for New York he spoke optimistically of my election to federal parliament as the member for Makin. As it turned out, it was not to be until some years later. For me, however, Andrew Knox's death is a constant reminder of September 11, as is the death of Angela Golotta, whom I have also spoken about in this place and who was subsequently killed in the Bali bombings. Andrew and Angela were both young people with their lives ahead of them. Both were taken without warning as they went about their lives as any of us do each and every day. They had done nothing wrong and had not provoked in any way the attacks on them. It is that senseless killing of innocent lives that makes the attacks even more abhorrent.


I recall being called by Tabitha Lean, a mutual friend who had remained in regular contact with Andrew after he relocated to New York, to be told that Andrew had been killed in the Twin Towers attack. I was told that Andrew had been on his mobile phone relaying what was happening when he had to abruptly end the conversation. I can only imagine what it must be like for Andrew's mother, father and brother or for Angela's mother, father and brother. Of course we focus on September 11 or the Bali bombings, but the reality is that all too often innocent lives are lost in terrorist attacks. For many of those losses there is no public recognition, no public memorials, no public sympathy, yet each of those lives was just as precious.


Extreme views in society are nothing new. There have always been people who have held extreme views on matters. We are seeing it right now in relation to the climate change debate. The problem arises when those views culminate in acts of violence against those with opposing views or, more often than not, opposing interests. In today's world violent reactions initiated by extreme views can result in catastrophes because of the range of tools and opportunities available to anyone driven to an extreme act of violence. It does not take much to provoke an extremist or deranged person—nor does it take much to provoke a person filled with hate and revenge. It is therefore of concern—and should be of concern—to all responsible people to see the level of provocation and incitement that is creeping into civic life in recent times. Community leaders should remain cognisant of the language and tone they use. They can fuel the fires of hate just as they can calm troubled waters. It troubles me that in recent times I have observed in both public and private discourse a level of hatred between opposing views on a range of matters, including immigration policy, refugee matters, religious and even environmental matters that is neither appropriate nor healthy. Incidents such as the shooting and bombing in Norway and the shooting of US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in January this year occurred at a time when extremist views were becoming regular utterances of community leaders. 


Likewise the level of hate mail, malicious statements and sexist attacks on Australia's Prime Minister should be and would be of concern to all decent, fair-minded people. The derogatory way in which the Prime Minister is treated by some says far more about them than it does about the Prime Minister. Regrettably some of the instigators of that behaviour are public people in civic leadership positions. Of course, it is not unusual for political leaders to be the target of politically motivated acts of violence against them. History is littered with such acts. In 1605 Guy Fawkes unsuccessfully tried to blow up everyone in the British House of Commons. In Australia, on 21 June 1966, Labor leader Arthur Calwell was shot and wounded by Peter Kocan as he was leaving a public function at the Mosman Town Hall. Nineteen-year-old Kocan is quoted as saying that he shot Mr Calwell 'because I do not like his politics'.


It is my hope, and I believe the hope of most people, to lead a peaceful existence in this world with family and friends. My view is that life is much too short for acts of hatred and extremism. All people wherever they are feel the pain, heartache and emotions that we do. I have seen the tears in the eyes of the Bosnian people, the African people and the Sri Lankans as they talk of the atrocities committed in their homelands. I have followed the strain of the families in Chile, China and New Zealand when miners were trapped underground and the elation of their rescue. It was an experience we were familiar with in Australia. I can only begin to imagine the fear in the eyes of the September 11 victims, and the pain and anguish in the hearts of the families and friends of those who lost their lives. For those who survived and for the families and friends of those killed, their lives were deeply scarred and will never be as they could have been. The annual public remembrance of September 11 and other public reminders will not allow them to put the events behind them even if they want to. 


I therefore hope that 11 September becomes a salutary reminder of the devastation that extreme acts of hatred and violence can bring. I also hope that those who are inclined to perpetrate such acts see the futility of such acts in the long term. There may be some temporary gratification from such acts, but ultimately they will amount to very little other than considerable grief, suffering and loss of life for innocent people who are neither the problem nor the solution to the fanaticism of the perpetrators. On the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks we remember those who were killed or injured, the grief and heartache of the families and friends and colleagues of those killed or injured and the rescue efforts of all those associated with rescue efforts on the day, as well as the ongoing support that they continue to provide to the victims. We also should take a moment to acknowledge the ongoing daily efforts of our police and security organisations in this country and around the world that do an extraordinary job in helping to keep us safe. Perhaps it is only fitting that today in this place we discussed a motion in recognition of the current serving police officers in Australia.


In closing, it is appropriate that we remember September 11 for all the reasons that I and all other speakers have referred to. As I said in the course of my speech, I hope we and people around the world can learn from September 11 in a way that ensures that we go into the future in a better world.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:29):  I rise to speak on the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. With crime becoming increasingly global, it is vitally important that Australia has high levels of international cooperation to ensure that criminals are not able to evade justice by simply crossing borders. This necessitates a working extradition regime that includes appropriate safeguards. Australia's extradition relationships with other countries exist to allow Australia to ensure the effective administration of criminal justice here in this country. Our extradition relationships also allow us to cooperate with partner countries to fight crime and to prevent Australia from becoming a safe haven for people who have been accused of serious crimes in other countries.


Australia also needs to ensure that criminals cannot evade investigation, prosecution and asset confiscation action simply because the evidence or proceeds of their crime are in different countries. The coalition strongly believes this requires a responsive mutual assistance system to combat domestic and transnational crime, again, with appropriate safeguards built into that system. In relation to mutual assistance, the bill will increase the range of law enforcement tools that Australia is able to offer to other countries—for example, allowing surveillance device warrants to be obtained at the request of a foreign country.


I turn now to extradition, which is the process that allows one country to apprehend and send a person to another country to face criminal charges or serve a sentence. As was pointed out in the Bills Digest, extradition is not actually an obligation under international law. Rather, it is a favour accorded by one country to another. Extradition obligations between countries therefore arise principally from reciprocal treaty arrangements between states. The extradition treaties to which Australia is party are given effect by the Extradition Act. Separate extradition is mutual assistance, which is the process countries use to provide and obtain formal government-to-government assistance in criminal investigations and prosecutions.


As was the subject of an earlier bill debated in the House, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Amendment (Registration of Foreign Proceeds Crime Orders) Bill 2011, mutual assistance is also used to recover the proceeds of crime, which is integral to the fight against serious and organised crime. It was also pointed out in the Bills Digest that, although a number of treaties exist between Australia and other countries about mutual assistance in criminal matters, the Mutual Assistance Act does not depend on the existence of a treaty with the relevant overseas country. As our current laws relating to extradition and mutual assistance and criminal matters were passed over 20 years ago, it is important to ensure our measures are responsive and effective. A number of reviews have been conducted since then of the Extradition Act and the Mutual Assistance Act, including a 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report, a government review in 2006 and, more recently, discussion papers on both acts in 2009 and in January 2011.


It is well known that there have been significant changes in the nature and scale of global crime since that time, attributable to globalisation and changes in technology. The Australian Federal Police have expressed concerns that the legislation as it stands has not kept pace with the advancements in technology, including the pervasiveness of technology as it exists today. In a public hearing held by the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs the AFP voiced concerns about the fact that it is possible to make phone calls that do not go through Australian exchanges and it is possible to store data on devices and servers that are not in our jurisdiction. The AFP stressed that in order to be successful in the fight against organised crime and in protecting national security this must be addressed. The coalition strongly supports giving the AFP the tools they need to protect Australia's national security.


Turning now to the specific measures contained within the bill: notably, it makes amendments in a number of areas. In particular, it amends the following features of our extradition and mutual assistance regimes:


Expansion of the existing grounds for refusing an extradition request to include discrimination on the basis of a person's sex or sexual orientation;


Expansion of the existing grounds for refusing a mutual assistance request to include discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual orientation;


Extension of the availability of bail in extradition proceedings;


Expansion of the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted in Australia in lieu of extradition;


Inclusion of an express prohibition on providing mutual assistance where it may expose a person to torture, as well as improvements in how the risk of torture is considered in extradition determinations;


Expansion of the death penalty grounds for refusal in mutual assistance requests to cover situations where a suspect has been arrested and detained but not charged; and


Expansion of the grounds for refusal to cover mutual assistance requests which relate to all stages of the investigation, prosecution and sentencing of a person.


The coalition support in principle the amendments made in these areas. However, we believe it is important to ensure that the extradition and mutual assistance regimes keep pace with changes in technology and global crime syndicates.


The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs inquired into this bill and tabled their report in the House last week. I wish to thank the honourable member for Pearce, who was the deputy chair of the committee, and the honourable member for Murray, who was the acting deputy chair for the second half of the inquiry. The committee made four recommendations on the bill. Recommendation 1 states that the committee recommends that the bill be passed by the House. Recommendation 3 states that:


… the Attorney-General's Department be required to provide in its annual report a record of any substantive breach of an undertaking given by a foreign country in relation to extradition or mutual assistance processes.


Recommendation 4 proposes:


… that, within three years of its enactment, the Attorney-General's Department conduct a review of the operations of the amendments contained in the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011.


The coalition supports recommendations 1, 3, and 4. However, we do not support recommendation 2 as it proposes:


… that the Australian Government give consideration to removing the presumption against bail which operates in the Extradition Act 1988 by allowing individuals to be granted bail only in special circumstances.


The status quo on the presumption against bail is appropriate as there are significant risks in granting bail to people suspected of serious criminal offences who could potentially attempt to evade justice. Take, for example, the recent case of accused Serbian war criminal Dragan Vasiljkovic, also known as Daniel Snedden, and his disappearance from the High Court in Canberra just one day before it ruled against him in an extradition request from Croatia, resulting in a subsequent 43-day man-hunt. The man-hunt to find Vasiljkovic involved up to 40 police and a four-day covert surveillance operation by the AFP, which eventually led to his arrest. The coalition agrees with the position of the Attorney-General's Department:


The current presumption against bail for persons sought for extradition is appropriate given the serious flight risk posed by the person in extradition matters, and Australia's international obligations to secure the return of alleged offenders to face justice in the requesting country. The High Court in United Mexican States v Cabal has previously observed that to grant bail where a risk of flight exists would jeopardise Australia's relationship with the country seeking extradition and jeopardise our standing in the international community.


Evidence given to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties during their inquiry indicated that the presumption against bail was included in the legislation on the basis that there was a very high risk of a person escaping, particularly since in many cases the person had fled the jurisdiction for Australia to evade justice. Other like-minded countries, such as the United States, also uphold the presumption against bail, only allowing suspected criminals to be granted bail in special circumstances.


The coalition supports the passage of the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. We support measures that ensure Australia is not seen as a safe haven for criminals and the profits of their crimes. We also support measures that contribute to improving Australia's international crime cooperation legislation. We believe this bill does that and that is why it will receive the opposition's support.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (16:39):  Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are probably aware, today is a very significant occasion with respect to law enforcement. Today the Prime Minister handed out the first of the 16 National Police Service Medals. It was very good to see the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and a number of ministers there to show their support for people who are on our thin blue line in such a tangible way. By the end of this week we will move to Police Remembrance Day. On the weekend I rode the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance from Sydney to Canberra with over 1,200 police officers and their supporters as a fund raising activity for policy charity but also recognising the 749 police officers who have died since the formation of Australian policing. The first person killed in 1803 was Constable Joseph Luker. It is a salient exercise to stop and think that we have lost so many police in the line of duty. One of the things we do is try to do our best for law enforcement officers, equipping our police as best we can, not only with the technologies they need to go about their day-to-day role but also the regular regime they need through the justice system to bring criminals to heel.


One of the facts often quoted in this place is that organised crime costs this country about $31 billion per year—an extraordinary reach by criminal activity—and flowing from that the global reach from crime in this country is huge. We might be a very big island and we might be surrounded by sea but with technology as it is now available, the commissioning of criminal enterprise does not have to occur on our shores to necessarily have an impact on us. Things can be commissioned elsewhere and also the movement of criminals has certainly changed the shape of law enforcement. Hence extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters becomes so important.  We cannot just look at these things here and now in Australia; we have to make provisions so that we have the right suite of laws to protect our citizens and the right regulatory regime for when we need to extradite people, sometimes from foreign regimes, for the purpose of prosecuting criminal acts.


This legislation has not really been adjusted for the last 20-odd years.   A very comprehensive review took place, as I understand, in 2006 when discussion papers were released and public consultation occurred. As a consequence, there have been 40-odd submissions made to the public consultation since 2009. The intent of this legislation is to ensure fairness is maintained. It also looks at the global reach in the commissioning and committing of crimes and, in addition, realises the fact that we are part of a world that needs to work together if we are going to ameliorate the effect of crime and criminal activity. We cannot treat ourselves as an island to that extent; we have to become part of the world agenda. 


The Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 does a range of things. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 is amended to increase the range of law enforcement tools available to foreign countries with their investigations and prosecutions. The bill will strengthen the protection against providing assistance where either the death penalty or torture concerns exist within the country making the request. It will streamline the existing processes for providing forms of assistance. Amendments will also be made to the Extradition Act 1988 to streamline the early stages of extradition and reduce delays, extend the availability of bail at later stages in the extradition process and extend the circumstances in which a person may be prosecuted in Australia as an alternative to extradition if a person is an Australian citizen or should the extradition process be waived for various reasons.


The bill therefore has two main objectives: to update and modernise the process of extradition to ensure that Australian authorities can offer a comprehensive range of assistance to our international criminal justice partners; and to increase international cooperation, which is essential to ensure that we address the challenges posed by the effects of globalisation. It is clear that the world is becoming so interconnected, whether it be via technology, communication, travel or whatever. While that is all highly beneficial, particularly to us in an economic sense as well as culturally and socially, it does present challenges to which we need to respond to ensure that perpetrators of crime do not escape justice as a consequence of being able to move from one country to another. Australia's current extradition laws are, quite frankly, dated. They have not kept up with the rapid advancements in technology or the movements across borders. These are things that we need to take heed of as we move these bills through the House. This bill represents a very timely and appropriate answer to those discussions I mentioned in 2006 that called for a fundamental review and reform of Australia's international crime cooperation laws and procedures, including the area of extradition and mutual assistance.


The bill will also ensure that Australia does not become a safe haven for criminals. Currently, a person can be prosecuted in Australia in lieu of extradition where extradition has been refused on the basis that the person is an Australian citizen. This bill will extend that arrangement in that it will now be able to be applied to any person to be prosecuted in circumstances where extradition has been refused. Those things are very important; it was not all that long ago that I spent some time with a number of Australian citizens who are currently on death row in Bali. If, for instance, a person committed an offence in Indonesia that attracted the death penalty and they escaped from Indonesia to Australia, we would have difficulty sending that person back. But if we did not do it—if the person was not an Australian citizen and we did not send them back for trial—that would mean that that person could almost evade justice by being over here, making a new life in Australia without any intention of ever going back to face trial in their country of origin. This legislation will allow that person to be tried in our country for the crime that they perpetrated elsewhere. In that way, we would not breach our commitment to not return a person to a country where they might face torture or the death penalty—we would maintain and honour our commitment in that respect—but we would also be doing the right thing in respect of criminal justice. We cannot be a safe haven. We cannot let people slip through the cracks simply by moving across the border.


To that extent, this is certainly an overdue piece of legislation. Something that I have often spoken about in this place when we are talking about criminal justice, whether it is the commission of crime or the way we respond to crime, is that technology is an ever-changing space. It is certainly changing at a very rapid rate. We cannot take the view that simply because the way things were done before—in this case, 20 years ago—was for very good reason at that particular point in time means it should be what applies in perpetuity. We owe it to all our people on the thin blue line, the 55,000 police we have in this country that go out there day after day and risk their own lives to protect our community from the rigours of criminal enterprise itself and to uphold our justice system. We owe it to them, and to everybody else associated with the criminal justice system, to ensure that we do not have loopholes people can escape through.


We also need to recognise that we are part of a wider global community when it comes to the administration of criminal justice. We should not make any apology for being forthright in that respect. We have a role to play. This bill is a timely reminder of our responsibility to ensure that our systems and our suite of laws and regulations are up to date, not simply so they can be reviewed by some other form of judicial committee but so they operate to the extent that is fundamentally required if we are to ensure justice prevails regardless of where crimes are committed.


I support the bill and commend it to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:51):  I commend the member for Werriwa for his contribution and particularly note his mention about the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance: 1,200 motorcycles and no speeding tickets given out the entire ride, I am sure, Member for Werriwa. It is a fine thing to acknowledge the almost 200 years of sacrifice by the police.


The Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 is a piece of legislation I have much familiarity with, having been the Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which conducted a short inquiry into this bill. I see the research officer, Mei-Lin Wang, who was seconded to the committee, in the chamber here this afternoon.


The bill proposes a number of significant reforms to streamline and modernise Australia's laws on extradition and mutual assistance. It is the classic balancing act as represented by Lady Justice, with the scales of justice in her left hand and the sword in her right. I am sure you know that statue, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, from your time in the law and on the legal affairs committee. The history of the statue is from the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Hellenic deities Themis and Dike and represents their ideas about divine order, law and custom et cetera. I have read that Justitia is a combination of several goddesses who embodied the right rule for the Greeks and Romans: there is the blindfolded Roman Fortuna, which is fate; the Hellenistic Greek Tyche, which is luck; and the sword carrying Nemesis, which is vengeance. Justitia carries the scales of justice and a double-edged sword in her right hand, symbolising power. The blindfold represents justice being handed out objectively and without fear or favour, regardless of identity, money, power or weakness.


Balancing justice is obviously what we as a government are trying to do with this legislation, because it represents a balancing act in acting at the appropriate pace but also making sure that there are appropriate checks and balances so that the minister does not rush through any particular process and so that no foreign country railroads the rights of an individual. It is a classic balancing act in making sure that we look after the appropriate criminal investigations, as mentioned by the member for Werriwa, but also safeguard human rights, especially when we are dealing with international people because obviously they have connections with other nations, have passports and might be inclined to flee. So, in looking at decisions about granting bail, the committee looked closely at the statutory presumption against bail in extradition cases. There needed to be some guiding principles when dealing with federal magistrates and the decisions they make as to whether there is a flight risk, and the committee recommended the government take a very close look at that. We need to consider storage of personal information because—as the member for Werriwa touched on—things have changed a lot in the last 20 years. The computers of 1991 were completely different. The internet was a few years off being broadly available to the world yet now the idea of a world without the internet is preposterous. Consequently, criminals have seen the opportunity. The carpetbaggers of today are sitting on laptops all around the world taking people's information and creaming off money in a way that a burglar in the night taking a couple of silver candles could never dream of.


This bill will make important amendments to Australia's laws. It will give the modern law enforcement agencies modern tools so they can work with foreign countries on investigations and prosecutions. We have also strengthened the protections where there are death penalty or torture concerns because as a nation we hold those activities to be abhorrent. Despite the fluctuating talkback radio treatment of such things, we know that as a nation we need protections against such things, so we are streamlining on the one hand yet on the other hand also putting in the safeguards.


There may be circumstances in which a person can be prosecuted in Australia as an alternative to extradition. We have extended that provision to any person, not just Australian citizens. Rather than a person getting off scot free, they might be prosecuted in Australia not sent to their country where they could face the death penalty or torture. Another technique I think has been used recently in the US is giving people the opportunity, if they so wish, to waive the extradition process, subject to certain safeguards, so that they make informed decisions with their rights being looked after and perhaps getting the appropriate legal advice—that is, in the interests of sorting out some charges or pending charges, letting that person waive the extradition process altogether.


The other thing that this bill does is reduce the time it takes to conduct extradition proceedings. These measures are about reducing duplication of decision-making and cutting through some of the associated red tape, not getting rid of due process or natural justice but making sure that it is a tidier process. The amendments relating to extradition are straightforward. They reduce delays. They allow someone to waive the extradition process. They also allow a person to consent to being surrendered for a wider range of offences as long as there are certain safeguards. 


We have modified the definition of 'political offence' to clarify that this ground of refusal does not extend to specified crimes such as terrorism. We all know there will always be arguments as to who is a terrorist. The member for Werriwa commented earlier about some of the police deaths. You only need to look at the various treatments of Ned Kelly. Depending on what side of the law or history people are on, they consign him to either being a brutal murderer or some other sort of character in Australian history.


The legislation changes allow the Attorney-General to give a legally enforceable undertaking to a country as to the maximum sentence that could be imposed on a person if they are extradited to Australia. They strengthen some of the protections against torture concerns and also require Australia to refuse to extradite a person if he or she may be prejudiced by reason of his or her sex or sexual orientation following surrender. This is not something that is a particular issue in Australia, but it is in countries where someone's sex or sexual orientation can cause them to suffer at the hands of the criminal justice system. It is something for us to consider. The amendments relate to mutual assistance. They increase the range of law enforcement tools looking at things like surveillance devices and forensic procedures and make sure there are the appropriate safeguards in place. They also deal with sharing with other countries lawfully obtained telecommunications and make sure that there are protections against death penalty concerns and also the ability to refuse assistance if there are concerns about torture. The bill amends some of the grounds relating to the proceeds of crime actions to make sure that they are more logical. It streamlines the process for authorising the proceeds of crime and allowing registration enforcement of foreign non-conviction based proceeds of crime orders from any country. There is greater sharing between Australia and other appropriately recognised law enforcement agencies around the world. There are also significant changes as transnational crime has changed along with technology, globalisation and the like, and it is important that we respond appropriately. This is a great piece of legislation and I commend the minister for bringing it into the House.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (17:01):  I would like to thank the honourable member for Moreton for his contribution, the honourable member for Fowler for his contribution and indeed the honourable member for Sterling for his support and contribution to this debate on the Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation Amendment Bill 2011.


The government thanks the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which the member for Moreton chairs, for its detailed and comprehensive advisory report on the bill which was tabled in the House on 12 September 2011. In this report the committee noted the rigorous process of public consultations this bill has been through in reaching this point with the exposure draft of the bill released in both 2009 and in January this year. The committee's inquiry is a welcome final stage of scrutiny in the development of this very important legislation.


The committee has made several recommendations which the government accepts are well considered and which we will implement. Firstly, in accordance with recommendation 3 of the report the government agrees in principle to report all breaches of undertakings that come to the attention of the government. Any such breaches will be included in the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department. The appropriate minister or ministers will also be advised of any serious breach of an undertaking to allow the breach to be reported immediately to the parliament. Secondly, in accordance with committee recommendation 4 the government undertakes to initiate a review into the operation of the amendments within three years of the bill's enactment if the amendments are passed by the parliament.


The bill currently before the House is the first major reform to extradition and mutual assistance laws in over 20 years. A review of the amendments would provide a valuable opportunity to examine the extent to which the reforms have achieved the intended goal of streamlining the law while maintaining appropriate human rights safeguards. The government also notes the committee's comments in recommendation 2 regarding the current presumption against bail in extradition matters and has given careful consideration to this matter. Unfortunately, reporting and other bail conditions are not always sufficient to prevent individuals who wish to evade extradition by absconding. In extradition cases there is an increased risk of persons absconding before they can be surrendered to the requesting foreign country. This is particularly the case where there are allegations that the person specifically left the requesting country and came to Australia to evade foreign law enforcement. If a person who has been remanded on bail disappears in the middle of the extradition proceedings it can jeopardise Australia's ability to extradite the person in accordance with Australia's international treaty obligations. Ultimately, it could also lead to a state of impunity where a person can disappear and continue to evade law enforcement authorities. I also note that bail can be granted in special circumstances and the government has shown recently a willingness to not oppose bail when these circumstances arise. For these reasons the government considers the current presumption that bail should only be granted in special circumstances as appropriate and it should be maintained. The bill before the House makes important reforms to Australia's extradition and mutual assistance legislation. The bill will modernise these laws to ensure that Australia's international cooperation activities effectively combat crime in a new era of advanced technology, travel and criminal enterprise. The bill will do this by streamlining the process for extradition so that the time it takes to conduct extradition proceedings will reduce which in turn will reduce the time a person spends in custody.


Importantly while the bill will seek to reduce the time it takes to conduct extradition proceedings, there is no devolution of the existing protections and safeguards afforded under the regime. The bill will, in fact, build upon existing safeguards by allowing a person to seek bail at several stages in the extradition process and extends the grounds for refusing extradition to include instances where the person may be discriminated against on the basis of his or her sex or sexual orientation.


Further, the bill will strengthen measures to ensure criminals do not escape justice by allowing for their prosecution here in Australia where extradition has been refused. In the mutual assistance context, the bill will ensure that Australian authorities can offer a comprehensive range of assistance to our international criminal justice partners subject to the appropriate safeguards. This will include allowing forensic procedures to be carried out and surveillance device warrants to be issued for the purpose of assisting with foreign law enforcement. These new powers will be subject to safeguards which have been modelled on our domestic safeguards to protect privacy and human rights of individuals.


The mutual assistance reforms will also extend existing legislative safeguards and protections relating to the death penalty, torture and discrimination. Ultimately the bill will ensure that Australian law enforcement agencies are able to work effectively and efficiently with their international counterparts to combat crime across the world while also ensuring that accused persons are afforded fair treatments. I commend the bill to the House.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr RUDDOCK

 (
Berowra
) (
17:08
):


I very much want to be associated with this condolence motion. I served with David Jull for all of the time that he was in the parliament, as member for Bowman between 1975 and 1983 and member for Fadden between 1984 and 2007. I saw him last on 28 July this year. It was an occasion when those of us who had served with John Howard in his ministry came together in Brisbane. There were some 20 or more of us present on that occasion. David was not well and that was fairly obvious, but it gave us all an opportunity to share another moment or two with him. He was a person who had served Australia very soundly. I might say it was always obvious that he might do so. I was interested in a piece in 
About the


House


magazine
 in March 1987 because it told us something of David and his personal qualities. He was a journalist. He was the member for Bowman and then the member for Fadden. He spent most of his school life at 'Radcliffe' in Queensland. Then it says:


He left the Church of England Grosvenor School to become a radio cadet with Macquarie News Brisbane, where he was mostly involved with news programs and did the state parliamentary round—


at the age of 14!




Mrs Prentice:
  Nineteen.




Mr RUDDOCK:
  It says '14' here—a typo, in About the House Magazine! I am glad to have it corrected. David then moved to Channel 10—or 'Channel 0'; you'd correct that, too, I am sure—where:


… he was over ten years a newsreader, journalist and Show Host (he even compered ""New Faces"") …


Why do I mention these matters? He had the most resonant voice in the parliament that I have ever heard. Gary Hardgrave's may have come close, but certainly I do not think his had the same quality that David Jull's had.


More importantly—and this will be reflected in some other remarks I make—this journal records:


His attractions to Liberal Party philosophy dates from when as a boarder, he was given leave to steer a campaign speech delivered by Sir Robert Menzies in the Brisbane City Hall. The contrast between ""Ming"" Liberalism and the ideas of … John Gorton led Jull to join the Liberal Party in 1969.


When I went to David's maiden speech, I thought it was important to note some of his observations because they say something of him as a Liberal, and that is something to which I very much related. He said this:


We as a government have a very real responsibility for small businesses throughout Australia, because it was the small businessman, the Australian who was prepared to get out and have a go, who was prepared to work hard, who helped build this nation and who made it great. Even today some 42 per cent of the population is employed by small businesses …


He was saying this in 1976. He spoke about the importance of encouraging the private entrepreneur and noted that, if you were going to keep unemployment at low levels, it was very important to have productivity. This is what you might regard as being the traditional Liberal approach. But he went on to say:


An electorate such as Bowman, because of its nature, has more than its fair share of social problems too.


He was a person with a social conscience, and one of those who reflected, I think, the Liberal view that if you are going to be there to build a bigger Australia it is to ensure that you can bring along with you those people who have needs who cannot necessarily well provide for themselves.


David got involved very early in his public life here in Canberra in tourism. I thought it was of note that he had the opportunity to serve on one of the early committees of review from 1976, the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism. In later years he had a role in the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation between 1983 and 1984—that short time that he was out of the parliament. And he brought all of that experience not only to serve the electorate that he represented but to highlight the needs of tourism in Australia, in a way which I think few have been able to do in the time they have been involved in public life.


I very much relate to David Jull because of the length of his service. There are not many who have had the opportunity to serve as long as he had the opportunity to do. I noted in his last speech he said:


This is … the 371st speech I have made since 1981 … I suppose you could add 100 on to that—so we are probably getting very close to the 500th speech …


What that really tells you about David Jull is that he was a substantial contributor to the public life of this nation. I do not believe I have seen, in a very long time, a list as long as that which is before us of those who will be contributing to this condolence debate today. That says something about David Jull and our friendship and our love for him. In concluding, my leader said that he mourns David's passing and he expressed deepest condolences to David's former wife, Erica, his brother, Peter, his sister, Gwen, and his sons, Stephen and Andrew.



Mrs Prentice interjecting—




Mr RUDDOCK:
  I am being helped by my colleague again. I am not familiar with all the family members. Would you like to speak up? Who have I forgotten?




Mrs Prentice:
  The sons are Michael and Jay. Steve and Andrew are his nephews.




Mr RUDDOCK:
  His nephews. I am glad to be corrected and I hope Hansard will note that.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  I am sure they will note that.




Mr RUDDOCK:
  All of us had a great affection for David for what he stood for. He was a great Liberal and we miss him a great deal.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (17:16):  I rise today on this motion of condolence and commend the member for Berowra for his eloquent comments about his former colleague. I wish too to pay tribute to David, who lost his battle with cancer recently. In reflecting on David's life, we know he was born in Kingaroy, Queensland, and was previously the member for Bowman in this place from 1975 to 1983 and the member for Fadden from 1984 to 2007. We also reflect on his service as Minister for Administrative Services from 1996 to 1997.


I was very fortunate and also very pleased and very honoured to work with David on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for a brief period of time before it became that particular committee and for two years afterwards. David was chair of this parliamentary committee and was also chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation from 1997 to 2002, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD from 2002 to 2005 and its successor, in which I shared the bulk of my time with David, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security between 2005 and 2007.


It is of note that David served as chair on this committee, particularly in that tumultuous period of time and with the introduction of legislation that was introduced to combat the emergence of the terrorist threat. It was at a time when, as a consequence of 9-11 and events afterwards, the intelligence and security services were expanded massively to cope with the threats of and the war on terrorism. David, in his work on that committee, played a key role in terms of the legislation.


What I particularly found about David was that he was always impartial. He acted in a very fair and impartial manner. We served with each other on various committees and various manifestations of committees and I certainly saw the equanimity that David had, and his unflappability, particularly in dealing with some pretty difficult subject matter and sets of circumstances and with some pretty complex pieces of legislation.


The committee itself we cannot really talk terribly much about, but I certainly saw in David's discharging his service as chair of the committee someone who was eminently suited to the task—and it was a substantial task, particularly with some of the reports that he oversaw as chair. Immediately after 09-11 David chaired two important reports, the first being an advisory report on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 and the Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and certain parts of the Cybercrime Bill 2001 in 2001, and the second being an advisory report on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill in 2001. As I said, in reading through a number of the reports that David oversaw in his capacity as chair of that committee in its different manifestations, I was particularly struck with the work that he did on the Intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction report in 2003—an absolutely seminal report which dealt with the realignment of our intelligence agencies and a report that certainly, in terms of its recommendations, resulted in the betterment of our national interest and national security.


As chairman of the parliamentary committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, David also led an important review into the operations effectiveness and implications of ASIO's questioning and detention powers in 2005. This review supported authorities to have expanded powers so they could detain people on reasonable grounds for questioning, in order to obtain intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorist offence. Another important report that he led as chair of the committee was the Review of security and counter terrorism legislation in 2006. This report proposed a series of modest refinements to improve specificity, clarity and fairness in a way which we believe is consistent with Australia's antiterrorism objectives. In particular, a recommendation arose out of that report as to an independent reviewer of terrorist legislation; that is now the National Security Legislation Monitor. The first report that recommended that was the report that David chaired.


I made some inquiries with the staff who had worked with David when he was chair, particularly in my period of time. They were all very deeply saddened to hear of his passing. What they—this was Margaret Swieringa, Jane Hearn, Donna Quintus-Bosz and Cathryn Ollif—wanted to say, particularly to David's family, was how much they had enjoyed working with him and how deeply sad they were to hear of his passing. As I said, this particular committee is not an easy committee to be a member of. It requires a very special person—a person of character, a person of substance.


In closing, can I say, in my remarks to this condolence motion, that, on behalf of the Labor members of the current intelligence and previous intelligence and security committees, I wish to pay my respects to David and his family. They should be very, very proud of what he achieved in this role, as we are, because what he has done has resulted in better terrorist legislation working in the national interest.

"Somlyay, Alexander, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr SOMLYAY
 (Fairfax) (17:23):  I first met David Jull not when I was an MP but when I was a staffer back in 1975 until 1980. There were only three ministers from Queensland at that time and of course Queensland as usual was underrepresented on the front bench. We all got to know each other pretty well. The ministers, ministerial staff and all the members travelled together up and down to Canberra from Brisbane and David was one of the characters of the new set—bearing in mind that after 1975 there was only one Labor member from Queensland. The member for Berowra will remember; I think that was Bill Hayden at the time. We formed a very closely knit club of people who travelled together up and down to Brisbane.


One thing about David Jull, even in those days, was that he had a wicked sense of humour. He could make something serious sound so funny and that was a way of getting his message over. You would never see anger in David Jull but you would see a lot of humour and a lot of seriousness at the same time. I was reunited with him in 1990 when I was elected to parliament in the seat of Fairfax. At the time I was Australia's northernmost Liberal, and David mentored and helped me as a new member of the parliament. He was the shadow minister for tourism and aviation; that was his passion. Sir Frank Moore, who was head of the QTTC and of radio station fame, took David under his wing, and he worked for the QTTC during the period he was out of the parliament. When I came in he made me chairman of the tourism and aviation committee, the backbench committee. So I worked very closely with David for the six opposition years under John Hewson, Alexander Downer and John Howard.


In 1996 David was very happy to become a minister. It is the ambition of everyone who comes to parliament, I think, to have the title of 'The Hon.' and to earn it. It is a great thing to be proud of—the fact that you have played for Australia—and David did a great job as Minister for Administrative Services. It was an absolute tragedy, in my opinion, that circumstances led to David leaving the ministry. It doubly impacted on me, because I replaced David in the ministry when he had to leave. While I was very happy to be elevated, I was not happy that it was at the expense of a great man like David Jull. I served with David until 2007. I was on the ASIO committee with him. He was also a very good member of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee.


David had a passion for Thailand. When I first came to parliament, David Jull used to put out a booklet called A Visitor's Guide to Thailand, so any MP who was visiting Thailand could take Jully's document and find anything in it: how to greet the Thais, what they expect of you, their customs, their laws and a shopping guide. The shopping guide was very valuable. When I walked into a shop he recommended in Thailand with my wife and produced David Jull's card, I was treated like royalty. You have never seen anything like it. The reputation that he had overseas as well as in Australia was second to none.


It was an absolute tragedy when David was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was the same year that I had my second round of open heart surgery, so we used to share stories across the corridor about who felt the worst. When David had his operation and had his lung removed, he had a lot of difficulties but he stayed on in parliament. He would catch the 9.35 plane back to Queensland on Friday mornings, and it was very difficult for him, with only one lung, to actually walk up the aerobridge. It was also difficult for me because a year before that I had been sawn in half as well. We had a lot of young members of parliament then who were very anxious to get off the aeroplane as soon as they could when they got back to Brisbane, and I used to try to get poor old Jully's bags down and we would struggle up the aerobridge and laugh about it.


He will always be remembered by everyone in this House with respect. You cannot sum up 30 years of service and dedication in a few minutes in the Main Committee or in the main chamber. David's funeral is being held on Friday, and I am sure it is going to be one of the biggest that Brisbane has ever seen. I offer my condolences to his family. I, along with the member for Berowra, was at the lunch which we had in Brisbane because we knew that David was extremely ill and that it would probably be the last time that we saw him. That in itself was a memorable occasion. I thank the House.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (17:29):  My first knowledge of David Jull actually preceded my coming into the House. Back in the period when the Australian newspaper was indeed a quality publication with excellent coverage of international affairs and the national election results around the world—you could even find out how many tries Wynnum-Manly scored against Redcliffe in the Queensland rugby league premiership—there was a front-page story in the Australianabout this Liberal member of parliament called David Jull, who I had never heard of up that point. He had taken up the rights of underpaid workers in a sawmill in Queensland. Basically a company there had picked up derelict homeless men, paid them extremely substandard wages and here was this Liberal member of federal parliament campaigning for those workers. It really struck me. I do not want to be too stereotypical in my views of the opposition, but to see somebody from that side of politics campaigning for workers rights really struck me.


I then had the advantage of spending a period in the state parliament where, it being a smaller building, people live on top of each other and friendships across the house more readily arise. Coming here, he was an extremely friendly person on the other side of politics. I cannot recall him saying a bad word about anyone. He was extremely cooperative and helpful to people. On the foreign affairs committee that I participated in with him, he was always a person who worked to get a consensus and see if we could actually come to agreement about any report that we were undertaking. I know that many members do that, but I think he had a particular propensity for it—seeing whether there was a possibility of getting conflicting views on the one line.


People have referred to his interest in tourism. I recall going to Thailand with him on a foreign affairs delegation. I am often assailed for my dress sense, but I recall him taking virtually the whole delegation to a place there and buying suits. He knew were to go in Bangkok to get suits for everyone and arrange it all. I said that despite my image with regard to suits. That was probably one of the better ones I have purchased.




Mr Tony Smith:
  I just said it was probably the last one!




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  Yes, probably! He was always great to have on those delegations. Since the member interrupts, I will recall another foreign affairs delegation. This is something that perhaps the opposition should bear in mind. I was with Bob Halverson, who was later to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Bob was there with us. He was making phone calls to Australia every five minutes. He confessed that he had been a close supporter of John Howard but had actually told him that he should get out of politics because his career was over, that he should go back and become a suburban solicitor again—ironic how things occur in politics in this country.


David was a much-admired and respected person in the House. He was person who, more than most, was able to form friendships across both sides of politics. I think he was essentially a liberal, progressive and fair-minded person. I join with other members in recognising his contribution, particularly in the area of contacts with overseas countries, relationships and knowledge of the world. Perhaps it is more common these days, but back then he was probably at the forefront of people who had an interest in Asia. These days you can do everything on the internet, but in those days he had knowledge of where to get the cheapest fares for every trip around the world. He advised members on both sides of politics in relation to that. I join with other members in wishing the best for his family in this very difficult period and in recognising his contribution to the Australian parliament.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:33):  David Jull was a good friend of mine. Indeed, I knew him for more than 35 years. He was a good principled man who served our country well. 'Jully,' as he was fondly and widely known, will always be remembered for his absolute dedication to his electors. The truly outstanding aspect of his work as a member in his electorate was that he was just as dedicated and just as effective in his final term as he was in first. As has been widely reported, he served in the federal parliament for more than 30 years. When he underwent major lung cancer surgery during his last term between 2004 and 2007, he did not reduce his electorate work, he just restructured it to take account of his reduced capacity to physically get around. Even in his final years here as a member, he would do what he did just about every Saturday morning: drive to one of the shopping centres in his electorate, sit in a prominent place at one of the coffee shops or cafes and talk to his residents. Then he would visit as many shops in the centre as he was physically able to.


When members gained access to modern communication mediums with their electorates, such as email and the internet, David embraced them. But he did not diminish his personal face-to-face contact with his electors or the many schools, churches and community groups within his electorate.


Anyone who is aware of David's upbringing would not be at all surprised at his personal attention to the needs of his electorate and the community. His father, the Reverend Canon Stephen Jull, was a much-loved clergyman in the Anglican church. David was born in Kingaroy, where his father was a rector. His father spent many years as the rector at Redcliffe, where the parish centre is named after him. His mother, Olwyn, was world president of the Anglican Mothers Union, and a trailblazer for women in the church. David often told the story that he was only able to attend the Anglican Church Grammar School in Brisbane because his father's position as a parish priest enabled him to secure a substantial reduction in fees.


Before politics David had a career in radio and television, both on air and in administration; first, in commercial radio and then as the first face seen on the new Channel 0, now Channel 10. What probably sparked his interest in a political career was when at the age of only 19 he became the Queensland state parliamentary roundsman for Macquarie Broadcasting Services when Nicklin was premier. An old friend, Peter Farrell, recalls him as a young publicity manager at Channel 0. Peter was writing the Veritas TV column, and recalls that those were the days of Number 96 and The Box, big publicity budgets, promotional junkets and many long lunches. As Peter says, David was a man of principle, good humour and loyalty.


At the end of his time in parliament, David was back on radio—community radio in Logan City, where David shared his favourite music with the wider community. As part of his arrangements with the station he negotiated the right to play his choice of music, which was of course dominated by Dionne Warwick, Motown and classical music—an eclectic mix.


In his early days David had a commitment to community service that his parents obviously instilled in him. That commitment encouraged David to seek Liberal Party nomination for the seat of Bowman prior to the 1974 election. He was successful in winning nomination and, after losing in 1974, he won the seat in 1975. It was a seat which he held until the 1983 poll. Less than 18 months later he returned to parliament as the member for Fadden, the seat he held for 23 years until his retirement four years ago.


Fadden became a rapidly growing and changing electorate between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. At each redistribution—and they were frequent, given the population growth in South-East Queensland at the time—the boundaries of Fadden changed radically. It began as a seat centred around the south-eastern suburbs of Brisbane, then became a Logan City seat and ended up being a northern Gold Coast seat.


Despite all the boundary changes, David assiduously served his electorates and the organisations within his electorate. I am told he moved his electorate office three times as member for Fadden to ensure it was able to service the changes the redistributions caused. He began in Upper Mount Gravatt in suburban Brisbane, then moved to Springwood in Logan and finally to Coomera in the Gold Coast City Council area. As far as David was concerned the electorate came first. His personal convenience or inconvenience was irrelevant.


The electorate rewarded him with increasing majorities. Appropriately, his last election delivered the strongest majority in his long career. In the 2004 election, David's primary vote in Fadden was 60 per cent—a swing in his favour of more than six per cent when compared with the 2001 election result.


The other hallmark of his long career as an elected member was the loyalty of his electorate office staff, resulting in what must surely be the lowest turnover in an office, especially given the long period he served. Anne Quinlan, or 'Quinno', as David always called her, served as his secretary from 1975 until she retired in 1997. She had previously been his secretary when David was an executive at Channel 0 in Brisbane.


One area David embraced with enthusiasm at every opportunity was tourism, and despite being on the opposition benches he did enjoy his role as shadow Minister for Tourism and Aviation. While not a great fan of our national airline, which he referred to as the 'flying red rat', he nonetheless had an encyclopedic knowledge of every aircraft flown domestically by Qantas and Ansett, and the history of individual planes. He was always generous with his travel advice and assistance. When friends and colleagues were questioned about their travel plans they regularly responded confidently that they had nothing to worry about as they were flying 'Jull Air'. This usually meant that David had either suggested the itinerary or, in many cases, had made the bookings for them. David Jull was also the highly respected chair of the parliamentary committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation 1997 to 2002 and of its successor, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security formerly the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD since 2002. In this capacity he presided over the committees inquiry into the performance of the Australian intelligence services in relation to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in 2003-04.


David was not just loyal to his electors, not just committed to his parliamentary and committee duties he was also loyal to the party that enabled him to seek to represent them in the first place, the Liberal Party. He was a member of the Liberal Party and more recently the LNP for over 40 years. He believed in the Menzies tradition of the Liberal party. He embraced the reasons why Sir Robert Menzies wanted his party to be known as the Liberal Party, not the conservative party. David was a moderate in its proper meaning. He could not tolerate people who stood on the extreme. As an initial instigator and the unofficial moderator of the Liberal Forum known by its members as Black Hand, Joel used all of his influence and humour to ensure that his Liberal colleagues and friends did not become too full of themselves. He did so with the generosity of spirit and with a firm conviction that Liberals were in fact Liberals.


Even when David lost his ministry in circumstances many, myself included, regarded as unfair and unjust, he did not complain. His loyalty to the Liberal party remained unquestioned. When the Liberal and National parties merged in Queensland, he remained loyal to the new entity the LNP. Until his final illness prevented him from doing so, David was helping the LNP candidate in this local state seat Ian Walker with his campaign for the forthcoming state election.


On a personal note, Jully had a wicked sense of humour and was not constrained by any sense of political correctness. He did not need these constraints because his own values and principles were based on common sense and decency. I can still recall, as those members who served with him would recall, his satirical send-ups and of course his iconic bowling set. Simply put, David Jull was a genuinely good bloke. As he said in his final speech to the House four years ago in December 2007, 'some of my good mates in this place come from both sides of the House'. Tragically, the wishes of the Speaker at the time that it was 'the view of all members that the honourable member deserves a very long and healthy retirement' were not to be. I know the state president of the LNP Bruce McIver and the party organisation across Queensland join me in acknowledging David's outstanding service to the nation, his outstanding service to the parliament and his outstanding service to his electors over 32 years as their member and the LNP and the Liberal Party.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr GIBBONS
 (Bendigo) (17:43):  I rise also to pay tribute to the life of David Jull. I first got to know Jully, as everybody called him, as a new member of this place. I got appointed to the then Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and the Arts of which David was a member along with that wonderful old character from Corangamite Stewart McArthur and Paul Neville, who was the chair of the committee. The member for Barker might have turned up occasionally too. That was a great eye-opener for a new MP because I had not set foot in this place prior to being elected so I had little understanding of the processes or the way that it will work. You could not get a better apprenticeship from the other side of politics than from those three blokes. We became good friends and still are. Unfortunately we lost David last week. One of the things I remember most about those three blokes, David in particular, was that they never played any party political games on those committees that I served on with him. I can remember David and the others say on a couple of occasions when we were preparing a report, 'The minister is not going to like this.' Nevertheless, they wanted in the report because that was the evidence we had gathered. That was a great influence on me. I have not tried to play party-political games on committees, have I?



Opposition members:  Never!




Mr GIBBONS:
  That was David Jull's influence—and, I must say, that of a lot of people on my own side too, of course. We had a great time. He was great company, as indeed they all were, and I will never forget him for that.


I also remember quite fondly a trip to the Middle East, when the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade were en route to Afghanistan on a goodwill visit to our troops there. I was participating in an Australian Defence Force parliamentary program that involved being in the Navy, serving on the frigates Melbourne and Arunta on blockade duty. We all flew over on the same piece of equipment, a Russian Aleutian 77, which was altogether a hair-raising experience, and then the other group moved onto Afghanistan. I was with the ex-member for Wannon, David Hawker; the member for Moncrieff; and another good friend of mine, the member for Farrer. I must say I have made a lot of good friends on the other side, more so than on this side, and I think, on that basis, it is probably time I gave this caper away! On the other delegation were Senator Marise Payne, the member for Maranoa and my good mate Graham Edwards. We all met back in Dubai, when the two attachments finished, and it happened to be Senator Payne's birthday so Jully organised a party at one of the restaurants in Dubai. It was a great night and I remember it fondly. In his inevitable style, he got up and compered our little table—we had a separate room—and gave a running commentary on the participants not only on both sides of the houses but also on that delegation, and it was hilarious. He was great company and one of the greatest storytellers I have ever come across.


The last time I saw David was at a Birregurra branch of the Liberal Party dinner in Geelong two years ago—




Mr Tony Smith:
  What were you doing there?



An honourable member:  I ask the same question constantly!




Mr GIBBONS:
  I see that has raised a few eyebrows across the room, but please let me explain; it is all legitimate! As I mentioned before, that wonderful old character the former member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur, was a good mate of mine, and the Birregurra branch of the Liberal Party had organised a testimonial dinner for him. I was invited and more than happy to attend. I was fortunate enough to be seated at David Jull's table. Accompanying David was a bloke named John Crook, who was a Bendigo television identity back in the BCV8 days. He had moved up to Brisbane and had obviously become good friends with Jully. It was really entertaining listening to stories from both men about their early days in broadcasting. Jully told me some wonderful stories about his background in radio. He used to play music—I think it was called being a disc jockey in those days—for one of the big popular music stations in Brisbane, and it was the most popular station. Because of his role there, whenever the big, international rock acts came out to Australia and played in Brisbane, he would inevitably get the job as compere; and, as happened if you got the job of compere at these big rock concerts—I am talking about acts like the Rolling Stones and other really big-name acts—he was always invited to the after-concert parties, and that is where the stories got very, very interesting. I do not propose to go into any of those stories for obvious reasons: a lot of the central characters are still alive, which in itself is a remarkable achievement, given some of the stories that David Jull told us! 


So it was a great night. I remember that, when I walked in and was ushered to Jully's table, I saw the whole room was decked out in green and yellow balloons, and I said to Jully: 'My God, McArthur's jointed the National Party!' He was quick to point out that, no, he had not joined the National Party; the balloons were the colours of the McArthur tartan, hence it was the colour scheme for the evening. It was David, John Crook and a good friend of mine, the former member for Corio, Gavan O'Connor, who was also a good friend of David Jull's, at that dinner, as well as Stewart McArthur, of course. It was a great night and we all had the opportunity to speak. It was great.


I guess that is as good a last meeting as you can get with somebody, being in that environment. I know he was not well, and that was apparent during the night. You all know what it is like when you meet up with people you like, you are friends with and you have not seen them for a while—appointments are made, 'Next time I'm in Brisbane, we'll catch up for lunch,' and all the names and addresses are taken down. I have been to Brisbane once since then and never had time. Now, of course, it is too late and, boy, do I regret that. He was a wonderful man, a wonderful bloke and a great credit to his party. He never had the tunnel vision or the fanaticism of some of the younger and newer members of the other side of politics. He was always a fair man but he was a fierce supporter of his own political side and its philosophy. I think the Libs will certainly miss him and I think the nation will miss him. I think he was a great servant to his country and a great credit to himself. My deepest sympathies go to his family and his friends.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (17:50):  I thank the member for Bendigo for his input to this debate. I think it very well reflects the fact that David Jull made friends wherever he was—not just in parliament. In parliament he made very close friends with some people whom you might have thought would be enemies. I think that was very much David Jull's approach to life.


We all know that he was a long-serving member—11 terms in parliament. I certainly do not wish to emulate 11 terms in parliament, but David Jull liked parliament as an institution—and he was an institution in this parliament. He represented the division of Bowman from 1975 to 1983. Unfortunately, he then lost his seat due to the Hawke landslide, but it was not long before he was back in the parliament in 1984. He started off with a marginal seat and ended up with quite a safe seat. That does not happen unless you are doing your job in the electorate and you have the respect of the people in the electorate. He served until 2007 and indeed when he actually left the parliament he was the fourth longest serving member of parliament ever, out of over 1,000 members of parliament. That is a pretty extraordinary record.


We know that he had lung cancer in 2005. That was a sad time for all of us—the fact that he had it and that he had to have a lung removed. But, true to the spirit, he said, 'I am going to make sure I get back to parliament.' And so he came back. He obviously was not quite as strong, we all knew that—his big, booming voice was not quite so big and booming any more. Like the member for Bendigo, I last met him at David Hawker's 25th year celebration—that was about two years ago, when we were in opposition. It was great to catch up with him. He had not changed. Obviously, though, he was not quite as fit as he had been.


He was a member of the shadow ministry from 1989 to 1994. When we became the government in 1996, he became the Minister for Administrative Services and served in that role from 1996 to 1997. It was often said—and I repeat: often said— that Jully, as we fondly knew him, was the unluckiest MP in parliament and deserved to serve as a minister for much longer than he did. When he no longer served as the Minister for Administrative Services, he became chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation from 1997 to 2002 and of its successor, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—formerly the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—from 2002. So from 1997 to 2007 he served as chair of one of the most important committees. To be the chair of that committee—or even a member of it—you needed to be someone in whom absolute trust could be placed. The fact that he was appointed to that position shows that people respected his abilities. 


In this capacity, he presided over the committee's 2003-04 inquiry into the performance of the Australian intelligence services in relation to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. As the member for Bendigo said, the committee did not pull any punches. The minister may not have liked it, but David Jull was not going to gild the lily. Coming back to him being unlucky, he almost certainly deserved to serve much longer as a minister. I supported him in a vote for the Speaker because I believed he would have served in that role with distinction. I believe he had all the qualities needed for the role of Speaker. He had the experience, there was no doubt about that, and he had the excellence. He had the knowledge of how parliament works—when to use standing orders and, probably more importantly, when not to use standing orders. He had gravitas and he had authority. He had a booming baritone voice. He would not have needed a microphone to rule from the chair.


I had the wonderful experience of sitting directly in front of him for nine years. I do not know if anyone else can claim that. I think it was a blessing to sit in front of him for nine years. I heard every humorous comment that he made. I do not think I ever heard him being warned, because he was clever enough to speak at the right time and just loud enough but not too loud to be called to order by the chair. It was really interesting to hear some of his comments and I will reflect on a few of them. I will not say who they are about because some of these people are still in parliament. He had a comment about every member of parliament. His descriptions included, 'ugly as a robber dog's backside'—that brings up an interesting vision—and 'Bob Hawke's love child'. Another one was 'one of the beagle boys'—as an avid reader of Donald Duck comics in my youth, I knew exactly what he was on about. Others were 'member for Nagger Nagger', 'promoted way beyond his abilities' or 'better as a front-rower than a frontbencher'—I think that was something about rugby. He had many, many more, but they were always very apt. He certainly did have a way with words. 


I might reflect on his wine palate because he had one of the best wine palates in the parliament. One night we went out and somebody bought a bottle of '92 Grange—I would never have been able to afford it—and a bottle of '93 Area Red from Langhorne Creek. Not too many people would have heard of Area Red; it is not one of the great wines. But we all agreed that the '93 Area Red from Langhorne Creek was actually better than the '92 Grange. I happen to know the winemaker because I had played cricket with him. It was part of my electorate and also I spent about 20 of my younger years in that area. I rang the winemaker on the off chance that he had some left. Michael Potts, the winemaker at Bleasdale, had made this wine for Vintage Cellars and Michael said, 'No, I do not have any left, but I will try to find if there is any left in Australia.' True to his word, he rang me the next morning and said: 'There are four dozen left in Australia. Would you like them?' I said yes without even thinking. But I did ask how much per bottle and they were only $28 per bottle—actually a bargain. The first thing I did was to phone Jully and I said, 'Do you want half of these?' Jully said: 'Yes, please. When can you get them to me?' At least I was able to provide some pleasure in his later years with a fantastic wine that we had all enjoyed. David Jull, I drink to your memories and toast a champion. Vale, Jully.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:15):  I rise to join in the remarks of all members who have spoken on this condolence motion for David Jull. He was someone who served in this parliament with distinction for such a long period of time. He was someone, as we have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams—and you know this yourself—who had friends on both sides of the chamber. He was a quintessential character in the parliament. He enriched the Liberal Party and the parliament over what was an incredibly distinguished career. I count myself as fortunate to have gotten to know him not just as a member of parliament from the time of my election in 2001 but prior to that when I was a staff member for the Howard government and even prior to that when we were in opposition between 1990-96. 


David Jull was so many things. As we know from those who have spoken, he was a good bloke. He was a dedicated parliamentarian. He was a dedicated Liberal. All of the previous speakers have made the point about David Jull's essential decency. His parliamentary career of 11 terms, spanning 32 years less 18 months, tells the story of incredible individual achievement. When people look at his parliamentary career, they see what he did for the parliament as well as the Liberal Party in the years to come. I know that David Jull's memory will go on in this place. 


As the member for Ryan said just a few minutes before the suspension, David Jull started as a journalist. When you look at his career—and I took the time to dig out his maiden speech from 1976—he achieved a lot at a young age. He was a cadet radio journalist at the age of 19 and became the state political reporter. He describes this very well in his final speech to parliament back in 2007. That career was critical in so many ways because it introduced him at an early age to political reporting and to covering great political events as they were in the state of Queensland. In his final speech to parliament, he tells the story of how he gradually became more and more drawn to the Liberal Party and that the critical element was the election of the Whitlam government and then the experience of that. He became a candidate in 1974. Like so many of that generation, he was swept into parliament in the landslide election of 1975, and he stayed until the tide went out in 1983. He was out for only 18 months. His dedication to the Liberal cause and his commitment to our party and to this parliament is illustrated so much by his determination to come back just 18 months later. It would have been very easy for an ex-journalist to have served seven or eight years and put that down as a wonderful experience and then move on to another phase of their life. The reason he came back was his commitment to the cause. He said in a profile in the mid-1980s that, once politics got into his blood, it was like malaria: it stayed there and re-emerged. Look at David Jull's maiden speech and his final speech. It is touching to look at his ambition for the country and his Liberal philosophy. In 1976, he very much laid down the markers that he thought were important. His concluding comments in that speech on 2 March 1976 were:


… one should have a passionate devotion to a cause but I am aware that unless the passion is guided by a sense of responsibility it can be wasteful and indeed harmful to society.


He said:


I know that I am young and idealistic—


and he was young; he was only 31—


but I hope that my stay in this House does not breed that cynicism which has become so prevalent of late.


He finished by quoting the words of Winston Churchill condemning socialism. I think, when you look through all those years, three and a bit decades, he did not become cynical, but he had his ups and downs in politics. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking in the House, made the point that David had been a minister—and, we would make the point, for too short a time—and how his passion was to be a tourism minister. The Leader of the Opposition is right. He would have dearly loved to have been a tourism minister. But I think the strength of his character is marked out by the fact that, from 1997 until his retirement in 2007, he became a quintessential parliamentarian, an expert in foreign affairs and intelligence, and he played a critical role in the parliament on those issues.


We have heard from some on the other side about how Jully—and I can call him that—had friends on both sides, and he did. We heard from the member for Bendigo, who said that they were great mates; in fact, David mentioned the member for Bendigo, and the work they did together, in his final speech.


I got to know David better as a colleague after I had entered this place in 2001. As a staff member I had known him, and his friendliness and decency were always there. He had a welcoming smile and a welcoming hand and he was there to be a mentor to anyone on our side who so desired. He was, from all evidence, a very loyal person. One of his closest friends, the member for Sturt, is sitting next to me, and I know that he was a source of great encouragement, strength and advice to the member for Sturt. They lived together here in Canberra.




Mr Pyne:
  For 14 years.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  For 14 years. The member for Sturt entered this place at the very young age of 25, and David Jull was pretty young. The member for Sturt is one of a handful of people whom David Jull counted as very close friends. Despite that, he had many mates in the parliament. When we look back on David Jull we will remember a decent man, a man who came here to make a difference and certainly made a difference.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:25):  I endorse the very eloquent remarks from the many members who have already spoken in this condolence motion. To have given this parliament, and thereby the nation, the service the late David Francis Jull did is a measure of the man, his dedication and the ideals for which he proudly stood. It is said a week is a long time in politics. David Jull experienced more than 30 years of the hurly burly of Canberra and represented the Queensland seats of Bowman and Fadden during that time, 30 plus long years—more than three decades of fine public service.


I wish to place on public record the reminisces of the former member for Riverina, Kay Hull, who was deeply saddened when I told her of David Jull's passing. 'He could be raucous and gruff,' she recalled, 'but he was also kind-hearted and an amazing individual. He was an incredibly good politician who was admired and respected by all who knew him on both sides of the political divide. David Jull was a good mentor, a great friend of the tourism industry and someone who will be sadly missed.' 


May I say the world is poorer for David Jull's death; this parliament is a far better place for the enormous contribution he made. May he rest in peace.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg your indulgence: I know that we are supposed to have this motion until 6.30 but I note that the member for Blair is in the chamber and could potentially begin his debate on his motion. I do not think I will be able to speak on David Jull for two or three minutes and I am wondering whether the government and the chair would give me the indulgence to perhaps start my remarks tomorrow, rather than have them split in two.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:27):  One of the profound privileges of being a member of this parliament is meeting inspiring individuals, individuals who make incredible sacrifices with little or no recognition and who, in doing so, leave a lasting impression in the fabric of our local community. One of those individuals in my community is Carmel James. I mentioned her late father Kev Dwyer in previous speeches, a former deputy mayor of Ipswich, a loyal unionist and Labor Party stalwart and a great community advocate. Carmel's life bears the imprint of her father's life. An assistant principal in curriculum at St Edmonds' College in Ipswich, she has had daily impact on the lives of boys who attend the school, but it is as a mother that she makes the most sacrifices and has the greatest impact but receives the least accolades. Carmel is mum to three children: Ben, Lauren and 11-year-old Andrew, who is profoundly disabled with medical and intellectual disabilities. Carmel exemplifies the contrasting natures of motherhood: grace and love, juxtaposed with ferocity and strength.


Over the past 11 years, Carmel and her husband Tony have become fierce disability advocates. Just ask the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Bill Shorten, who met Carmel in Ipswich when he was the Parliamentary Secretary for Disability Services. Carmel and Tony have used their experiences to tackle inclusivity issues while advocating for a national disability insurance scheme for a number of years. I cannot imagine the depth of concern of having a child with a disability who is reliant upon care—

(Quorum formed)





Mr NEUMANN:
  The Productivity Commission report into disability care and support makes it clear that the current system of disability care and support is unsustainable and unfair. The report outlines that a national disability insurance scheme would address this issue. I am pleased the Prime Minister announced that the government is immediately starting the work of building the foundations for an NDIS. Essentially this will entitle all Australians to appropriate levels of support in the event of significant disability. That support will be there regardless of whether a child is born with a disability or it is acquired. We know that transformational reform of disability services is needed and that work has to start straight away.


For 12 long years, the coalition ignored people with disability and their carers—they effectively defunded the system. Disability funding under the coalition grew by 1.8 per cent a year—less than the rate of inflation. The previous coalition government showed little support and little interest in the area of getting people with disability into work. Those with disability who wanted to work had to wait for up to a year to get help through the disability employment services and, when they did, their pensions were reviewed almost immediately. 


The Welfare to Work program was another coalition failure. The coalition paid lip service to the sector with a succession of failed attempts to support disability pensioners who were keen to contribute more actively in the community. At the last election, the coalition proposed to support just 6,000 children with disabilities and their families. I wonder what the 158,000 students with special needs in Australian schools—and their families—would think. I am confident the coalition do not have a plan to address the 164,000 students in Australia living with disability.


I am proud that, in the last budget, we allocated $200 million to support young people with disability in our schools. I have spoken to former and current principals and teachers at Ipswich Special School and Ipswich West Special School—people like Peter Davis, Andrew Thompson and Steven Leese. They warmly welcomed this funding. In my electorate of Blair, those living with disability are well served by a host of providers. Blue Care and UnitingCare provide invaluable nursing services to those living with disability, respite support for those who are carers and employment services to assist people with disabilities gain and maintain employment. Ozcare Ipswich, CODI, ALARA, Community Access and Transition Services Inc., known as CATS, are just a few of the organisations providing support and care for my constituents in Blair. Focal Extended is another great local organisation which rose out of the ashes of de-institutionalisation and the closure of the local Challinor Centre. These wonderful organisations and so many others provide individual support through personal care in-home and community access support. There is after hours school care in Ipswich Special School, vacation care during some of the school holidays, the independent pathways program and the independent living program to support those over 18 years of age.


These organisations do terrific work and we are going to make sure that those with disability are not overlooked or ignored. Their families and their carers need support and care. On 10 October I am expecting a large number of care providers and local agencies to attend a forum where the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin, and I will discuss the NDIS in the Ipswich and West Moreton community.


Further to that, on 2 December I will stage the second Blair Disability Links, an expo where disability care and support providers set up information stalls in the Brassall Shopping Centre for members of the community. Last year I held the inaugural event—a very successful event it was—with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the Hon. Senator Jan McLucas attending. These events connect people with the appropriate services so they have a greater chance to realise their potential by increasing engagement with employment, education, training and, indeed, sport. More than that, they provide a networking opportunity for these service providers.


It can be a difficult pathway to navigate when you suddenly have a child who has a disability or when your life is turned around through a profound accident that leaves you with a disability. Carmel and Tony James will tell you that one of the most frustrating things for their family is dealing with the mountain of bureaucracy involved in accessing funding and programs. As a schoolteacher, Carmel often sees families who do not cope with these stresses and sees that they get support. But they need more, and it takes determination and energy to ensure you get access to everything you need.


Even then in the Ipswich and Somerset region, in spite of the myriad of great services, you cannot get overnight respite easily. I am proud to be part of a federal Labor government that is turning the spotlight onto those with disability and confronting the cold, hard reality that we can no longer ignore the fact that by 2030 an estimated 2.3 million Australians will live with a profound or severe limitation.


I am proud that the foundations of an NDIS are being addressed. We no longer want in our country those with disability feeling invisible. Based on the Productivity Commission recommendations, the government has begun the foundations to this major reform, delivering an immediate additional $10 million to support the technical policy work, establishing a COAG select council for ministers from Commonwealth, states and territories to lead the reform, establishing an advisory group to the select council led by Dr Jeff Harmer to provide expert advice in delivering the foundations for reform. This vital work will be crucial for the care providers and its agencies in Ipswich and the Somerset region.


We are also providing additional funding of $147 million for the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative. This will be a great help for early intervention. There is the $60 million Supported Accommodation Innovation Fund. That is all in addition to the $7.6 billion provided to the state and territory governments through the National Disability Agreement to deliver increased and improved specialist disability services such as support accommodation, target support and respite.


The Productivity Commission recommended that the reform process will take seven years to be done right and to be financially sustainable. I know the James family has been fighting for 11 years to see significant reform. They appreciate that unravelling the various Commonwealth, state and territory systems and programs will be a mighty challenge. But, like them, we want to see reform sooner rather than later. As their federal member, I still have to look them in the eye and explain why the process is long, but we are determined to deliver an NDIS. Only then will people like Carmel and Tony James have the confidence that Andrew and others like him will receive the care and support that he and others will need throughout their lives. As their local federal number and part of a government that makes the tough decisions in the nation's interest I am pleased to support a national disability insurance scheme. I will continue to advocate for families like the James's, for kids like Andrew and for the many carers and support agencies in Blair that have committed themselves to supporting those with disabilities.


Carers Queensland say that there are more carers in my electorate than in any other electorate in all of Queensland. This is not just a peripheral issue. This is a mainstream issue that affects average families and individuals throughout the length and breadth of this country. Communities like mine, the Ipswich and Somerset regions, will benefit greatly from an NDIS. I commend the motion to the House.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2011-09-19,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (18:40):  I welcome the opportunity to speak about issues facing people with disabilities and their carers. I would also like to thank and commend the member for Blair for presenting this motion. I do not thank him for some of the party-political ranting which started his address, but he eventually got past that and started to talk more constructively about the issues facing people with disabilities.


I believe there is a need for bipartisanship as we deal with the very real challenges facing people with disabilities and their carers. I also refer to the Productivity Commission's final report into disability care and support, which found that the current system of disability care and support is unsustainable, underfunded and unfair and that it does not deliver the appropriate levels of care and support to Australians with a disability. I am certain that is not news to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it is not news to me or to anyone else who has spent any time at all meeting with people, getting to understand their issues and trying to deal with the many inconsistencies that exist in the current system.


The current system of support for people with disabilities and their carers is broken. It will be expensive to fix it but we are, I hasten to add, a very wealthy nation. The question should not be: can we afford to do better? The question should be: can we afford to let the current situation continue? We need to deal with the big issues in the disability sector. There are big issues such as the differing levels of assistance provided, depending upon how you acquire a disability; young people with disabilities who are forced to live in aged care homes because of a lack of residential care available for them; the lack of respite care for carers, who are doing the toughest job in the world but who need a helping hand; providing more funding for basic facilities like wheelchairs and modified vehicles, which often require volunteer fundraising activities in each of our electorates; and providing caseworkers to guide parents as they navigate their way through the maze of support services when they first are told that their child has a disability such as autism.


In my very first speech in this place I spoke about the need for increased funding in regional areas for support services for children with a disability, and I will continue to support efforts from both sides of this chamber for a better system. The opportunity presents itself today for me to publicly acknowledge the work of the former Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the member for Maribyrnong, and also the shadow minister, Mitch Fifield, for their efforts over the last several years to champion the rights of people with a disability. Arguably the greatest achievement of the member for Maribyrnong in his time in parliament is the way he has been able to provide some hope to people with disabilities and their loved ones. It is a hope that someone in a position of authority is on their side, and I congratulate him for his capacity to champion in this place the needs of people with disabilities.


In that same vein, I would like to congratulate the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, for being at the forefront of this debate at the state level, for being prepared to advocate for a national disability insurance scheme and for offering Victoria as the ideal location for a trial of a national rollout of such a scheme. I would also like to congratulate the people who work in special schools and other facilities who are directly involved in providing support services for people with disabilities in my electorate. They do an amazing job with great love and tenderness for the people in their care. It can be a very difficult job at times and it is an unforgiving role in many ways, and I know the families certainly appreciate the support they receive from you.


People with disabilities and the people who care for them often feel that they are alone in our community. They often feel that they are outcasts and that they are the problem that no-one else wants to deal with. I would have preferred tonight to have this debate about the national disability insurance scheme in the main chamber. I would have preferred that we debate this all week. Rather than talking about the carbon tax, which I believe is a multibillion dollar cost on the budget for something that may or may not happen in several decades time, in the disability sector right now we are talking about something that is very real on a minute-by-minute basis, an hour-by-hour basis and a day-by-day basis for people in my community. It is happening today. People need help today and it will require a multibillion dollar commitment from this and future governments. The case for the national disability insurance scheme is compelling, and I have spoken about it publicly on many occasions in my electorate. I acknowledge the member for Blair. In his comments tonight he made it sound as though, just by announcing it, the NDIS is already in place. I am sure he did not mean it to sound like that, but people in the disability sector are very concerned. The Labor Party made the in-principle announcement that it is on side and certainly the coalition has made an in-principle announcement that it supports that position. If I have any criticism, it is that I am worried about the time frames. It seems to be a very slow pace for reform and I believe we have to move as fast as we possibly can to achieve a fair and workable system. I take on the member for Blair's comments that we do need to achieve this sooner rather than later. It is a big reform, but we need to keep in the back of our minds that people need help today.


We need a system that puts people with disability at the very centre of the equation and provides them and their carers with flexible packages to access the services which most meet their needs in their own particular communities. I think we can do a lot more to help keep families together, as they are the ideal units to care for a person with a disability. I fear that too much of our current debate in the disability sector is crisis driven. The families at the centre of this issue are often left to soldier on. If they are not directly in crisis at the time, they are often left to fend for themselves, but there is no question that they do need more help.


It always seems to me that it is very difficult for governments to loosen the reins of control and let local communities develop some local solutions that suit the needs of local people, particularly in regional areas, but we are going to need that flexibility in the new scheme. We must not use planning for the National Disability Insurance Scheme as an excuse to stop the other reforms that are required from occurring in the meantime, as there are many steps that we can take now. On a cautionary note, I am wary of state governments backing out of their current levels of commitment under the guise of preparing for the NDIS.


Time is going to prevent me from talking at any great length about some of the other issues, but I would like to pass on some of the direct comments from local residents that I met with just last Friday in my electorate. I was there with the state member for Gippsland East, Tim Bull, who has been another great champion of people with disabilities in my community. I met with a parents and staff members associated with the MyTime program. For members who are not aware of MyTime, it is a very good program. It provides respite for mums, dads and grandparents, or anyone who is caring for a child with a disability. It gives them a couple of hours on a weekly or fortnightly basis to get together. Their child with a disability is looked after by a professional carer while they have got the opportunity to meet and discuss issues of concern to them. Its ongoing funding is uncertain in the sense that groups are forced to fundraise to make sure they can afford to pay for the extra help. I think the funding is committed to about 2013. I call on both sides of the House to remain committed to this program and to ensure it continues into the future.


One person who attended the meeting was Shirley, who is one of the coordinators in Sale. She said to me:


I just look at these wonderful parents and think to myself - what is being done for them. Everything they do is for their children.


The My Time program is one little thing we can do to help them. It gives them a chance to get together and network and learn from each other's experiences.


Christina, who drove 50 minutes to attend the Sale MyTime gathering, put it this way:


I can talk to my family and friends but they don't get it like the parents in this room. It is not just to have a chat  - it's to share information too – it's a great support to me.


I would also like to refer to a letter I have received from Jane and Shannon Nash, who describe themselves as 'parents and advocates for a child with a disability.' It is disappointing that they have to describe themselves as advocates, but in many cases parents have to go into bat to make sure they get access to services for their child. A couple of points that Jane and Shannon raised in this letter are that case management should just be a given when a family has a child who is diagnosed with a disability. They write: 'Our experience was tough. We found we had to self-advocate because professionals we were in contact with did not have the time or the knowledge and expertise to access the system for our child. Our experience has been that the system is inadequately funded and under-resourced. This results in families such as our own being ignored and turned away because they are not considered to be in desperate need.' The letter I have got here from Jane and Shannon I will pass on to the minister.


The really strong point they make towards the end of their letter relates to the family in a situation where you have a child with a disability. There is not a lot of support for the siblings, who often make many sacrifices because parents quite naturally have to put more time and effort into the child with a disability. They make this point: 'We are a family of a five. Our son's siblings are troopers and they love him very much. There is no support for siblings who have a brother or a sister with a disability.' They go on to say, 'Parents like us are trailblazing for those that come after us in the hope that conditions are made better for these wonderful but vulnerable children.'


Decisions made in this place are not academic and when it comes to the disability sector they have a real impact on real people. In the little bit of time I have left I will take as an example the government's decision to withdraw funding for the Take a Break occasional childcare program, which has caused enormous concern in my electorate where in many towns the occasional child care provided by that program was the only child care available to these people. Kristin met with me last week and told me about the support the Take a Break program had provided to her and her son Tyson, who has autism. I will also be passing this letter on to the minister, but I would like to quote from it:


Tyson was recently diagnosed with high-function autism, which has been a huge challenge for me over the years. Michelle Brooks has helped me for two years now with Tyson and the change in him has been amazing. Tyson wouldn't be making friends if it wasn't for the centre and its fantastic workers. Tyson is also coming along in leaps and bounds with his speech because of the interaction with all the other children. Michelle goes out of her way for my son and to lose that now when he is doing so well would break both our hearts.


The Take a Break program is one the government should not have ever thought about defunding and I call on the minister to change her mind. I am confident that, more broadly speaking, we are on the right path with the bipartisan plan to introduce a national disability insurance scheme. As always, the devil will be in the detail but we do have this opportunity and we must get it right for the sake of people with disabilities and their carers throughout our nation.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:50):  I congratulate the member for Blair for bringing this motion to the parliament and the member for Gippsland for his contribution to the debate. Before entering parliament I worked with people with disabilities and I believe that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a big step in the right direction, something that is very long overdue. I have great pleasure in supporting this motion before the House today.


The Productivity Commission Report into disability carers support was groundbreaking and I have to congratulate the member for Maribyrnong for the role that he played when he was parliamentary secretary. He was totally committed to ensuring that people with disability actually got a better deal than they have had in the past. The report highlights the importance of funding, it highlights the importance of access to services and it really details the issues that are important for people with disabilities and their carers.


I do not think there would be a member in this parliament who has not had the parents of a child with a disability come to see them and express their fears and worries about what is going to happen to that child as they become older: that there are not the proper supports in place and that there is not the availability of care and accommodation that their child will need. This Productivity Commission report that the government has given an undertaking to support and introduce is going to address those issues. I have two young girls with disabilities who come into my office and work and I know that their parents are concerned about them having the opportunities that they need in life. One concern is about making sure that one of the young women can find suitable living accommodation, and the other young woman is keen to enter the workforce.


I must congratulate the Prime Minister on already giving an undertaking of $10 million. The issues that I have found over the years that are terribly important to people with disabilities and their families are access to funding; care and support for carers; obtaining the aids, appliances and equipment that people with disability need; housing; living independently; and work. Work is an issue that has been very difficult for a number of people with disability, and I see that this will create opportunities for people with disabilities to enter the workforce, to be able to compete for jobs and to have the support in place that they need to be able to obtain employment.


The National Disabilities Support Scheme will provide assistance for a person throughout their life. Instead of trying to grab a little bit of money from here and a little bit of money from there, trying to get assistance from some employment brokerage or agency, it will all come as a package. The needs of that person will be paramount in where they are going. As somebody who has worked in this area and fought for people with a disability to get the piece of equipment that they need and to find a suitable place for them to live in, I know that when the disability insurance scheme is fully operational it will not only make a difference to their lives but actually change them. No longer will there be fundraising for a chair for a person who may be a quadriplegic or a paraplegic. That will no longer be necessary. Rather, they will have the right to expect to live a full life just like other Australians. The scheme will take seven years to be fully implemented, but it is important that we do it properly. It is important that we have in place the right sorts of frameworks, and the Disability Insurance Scheme put forward by the Productivity Commission in its report will ensure that the lives of people with disabilities are changed forever.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:55):  I am pleased to rise to speak on this important motion. I enter this debate in a unique position as someone in this parliament who, alongside fellow carers across the country, watches with interest the announcements about changes to the disability sector, knowing full well that the current patchwork state and federal system of disability support is inadequate. 


The Productivity Commission's report into disability care and support has reinforced what people who live with disabilities and their carers have long known, which is that the current system is broken and needs a full overhaul. For a parent caring for a physically or intellectually disabled child, it is a lifetime's task and, with such poor assistance available, they have little choice but to abandon any hope or thought of a career in order to take up life as the family carer, which is often lonely, arduous and poorly compensated. For carers there are no sick days, there is no holiday pay and there is no superannuation. A parent caring for a physically or intellectually disabled child lives with the fear and stress of what will happen to their child when they are too old or too frail to care for them anymore. This is a story that I have heard and felt countless times from devoted carers, and it is also a fear that I myself have personally felt. The time and emotional energy involved in caring can significantly influence the dynamics within a family, and so it is little surprise that when parents have a disabled child the chance of marriage breakdown almost doubles. 


We are a wealthy and compassionate nation. The time has come when, as a society, we must find ways to provide a generous and practical response to properly assist those with severe disabilities and their carers. While the blame game is not as evident in disability support as it is in other aspects of our health system, the responsibility for disability support is fractured across federal and state jurisdictions and that has lent itself towards needing closer examination for some time. Currently, the federal government has responsibility for specialised employment assistance and income support, while state and territory governments are primarily responsible for accommodation support, community support and access to respite services. 


In its draft report on disability care and support, the Productivity Commission reinforced the coalition's long-held position that disability support is a core government responsibility and must be treated as such. In response to the release of the report's recommendations, Carers Australia President Tim Moore described feelings of 'great hope' and that 'Australia would at last introduce a scheme that would provide quality care and support to all people with a significant disability'. Indeed, that is the hope of all Australians. But, as always, the devil will be in the detail. 


It is important that the legislation surrounding this reform is focused on three core deficits in the current system. They are: community and workforce participation and assistance; increased support for those with disability and their carers; and a simpler support system and advocacy support to help people navigate the bureaucratic maze. A national disability insurance scheme must be the goal of this parliament to work towards, but we must get there sooner rather than later. Talk of it being introduced nationally in seven years should be unacceptable to everyone. The Second World War was fought and won in less time. 


In quantifying the unmet need for care and support for Australians with disabilities, the Productivity Commission has established the figure that it will take to provide the sort of care and support that rightfully should be expected of Australians who suffer with severe disabilities and their carers. The Productivity Commission prices the scheme at $6.5 billion, which is no small cost, but it is one that should be, and indeed must be, achievable under a responsible government. It is a national disgrace that the equivalent of the full cost of financing this important scheme will now have to be paid out in the annual interest payments on the debt this Labor government has racked up in just four years. To be able to afford the cost of providing the resources that those with disabilities and their carers need and deserve we must have the economy firing on all cylinders. We must end the waste, we must end the mismanagement and we must end the indulgent schemes. Support for disabilities is not welfare. It should not be. It is an entitlement to assistance and participation in our community.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2011-09-19,"



Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (19:00):  With the member for Blair, I commend the government for its initiative, endorsing the vision set out in the Productivity Commissioner's Disability care and support report. The main recommendations of the Productivity Commission are:


A National Disability Insurance Scheme should be created to provide all Australians with insurance for the costs of support if they or a family member acquire a disability. The scheme will provide individually tailored care and support to around 410 000 people with significant disabilities. 


A National Injury Insurance Scheme should be created to provide no fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury.


The report also identified a seven-year time frame to transform disability services. As a result of the report, the Prime Minister is in the process of establishing a select council on disability reform at the next meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. This would bring together Commonwealth and state treasurers and disability ministers to do the work needed to lay the foundations for change.


In response to the Productivity Commission's recommendations for the states and territories to harmonise their approach to catastrophic injury, the government will also convene a working group, led by the Assistant Treasurer, to work with state and territory governments, lawyers and other stakeholders to progress this important complementary reform.


In my role as the member for Banks, I meet regularly with people who have disabilities and their carers. Some of the key points of the Productivity Commission report are similar to those which have been raised with me by those individuals. The inconsistency within the current systems is the outstanding issue, together with the difficulties for individuals in establishing what community and government support mechanisms are available to assist.


There is obviously significant work to be done in setting up the disability insurance scheme, so it will not happen overnight. As with any national project of such significance, it is best that it is done correctly from the outset. In the short term, the government has moved to deliver an immediate additional $10 million consistent with the Productivity Commission recommendations to support the technical work, move to establish a COAG select council of ministers from the Commonwealth, states and territories to lead reform in this area at COAG and take steps to establish an advisory group to the select council led by Dr Jeff Harmer to provide expert advice on delivering the foundations for reform and preparation for launch.


On its website, the Productivity Commission highlights the following—and I think it is worth stating:


Most families and individuals cannot adequately prepare for the risk and financial impact of significant disability. The costs of lifetime care can be so substantial that the risks and costs need to be pooled.


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, and gives people with a disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports. The stresses on the system are growing, with rising costs for all governments.


That is on the Productivity Commission website.


This is an area that deserves cross-party support. It is an area that does not deserve political point scoring. For too long, all sides of politics have looked the other way. We have an opportunity to build on the Productivity Commission report and to do good. I happen to be one who believes that it is imperative on government to provide a safety net for the vulnerable, the disadvantaged and the disabled in our community. I do not apologise for that. It is the role of the more fortunate to help the less fortunate and we should not apologise for it.


Normally I am one who is critical of the Productivity Commission, because their philosophy has been very different to mine over the years. But in this instance I have no problem in fully embracing each of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report. For the Productivity Commission to be giving politicians a wake-up call in this area is something I find quite interesting. I commend the motion of the member for Blair to the House. I think it is good that we have an opportunity to put our point of view in this place.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-09-19,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (19:05):  The member for Banks put it very, very well: the more fortunate helping the less fortunate. I commend his remarks. As the population ages, as medical intervention at birth increases and as health know-how improves, the number of people with a disability will increase. At the same time the number of unpaid carers—family members and friends who are willing and able, financially and physically, to provide support—will decrease. It is therefore time to take stock and plan adequately for the future. We need a vision for equity, for fairness and for justice for those with a disability and for the fantastic people who look after them.


On 6 April this year at the Wagga Wagga RSL Club organisers of an information session held about the National Disability Insurance Scheme put out 200 chairs. Another 200 were required; more than 400 people turned up to tell those politicians present—and I was one of them—and others how much this is needed. All Australians feel the need to have control of their own lives and it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth government to provide this freedom.


By highlighting my utmost support for this program I was told I was the first parliamentarian in New South Wales to sign up to the wonderful Every Australian Counts campaign. I would do it all over again, as I feel this is an extremely valuable scheme for our society. A national disability insurance scheme represents a fundamental reform to the way services are funded and delivered. In a budget of $350 billion, surely we can find it in our hearts as well as our finances to find the necessary dollars. As the member for Hughes said, it is an extra $6.5 billion. But I see this is an investment, not a cost.


The member for Hughes also stated what a compassionate nation we were—and we are—as well as acknowledging the fact that the current system is broken. The Productivity Commission certainly thinks we can find the money. We just need the political will, hopefully the bipartisan will. The economic case for reform for the National Disability Insurance Scheme has been described in terms of the number of people with a disability increasing significantly in the next 20 years, while at the same time the number of people willing and able to provide unpaid care will fall. Government is responsible for funding the difference between the two.


The resulting increase in costs has the potential to overwhelm already overburdened state treasuries. If current growth continues, the amount spent on specialist disability services alone will double in 14 years. A National Disability Insurance Scheme will ensure governments have the ability to meet current and future needs, whatever the economic climate. It will also provide other important economic benefits. As I said, I see it as an investment. By focusing on early intervention and identifying those support services which are most effective and efficient, the scheme will maximise the potential of and facilitate greater independence for those who most need it.


By providing people with what they need when they need it the scheme will ensure people with disabilities, their families and their carers have every opportunity to reach their full potential. Surely this is such an Australian ideal. This is about providing people with a disability with what they need when they need it and it should also reduce the pressure currently experienced by families of those unable to fully participate in work, life and the community. It will also enable much-needed respite.


The scheme could be funded by all taxpayers through general revenue or through a Medicare-type levy. Financing will have to be arranged. The modelling also needs to be worked out. As I said, the Productivity Commissioner said that we can do it, so surely we need to follow that lead. If the commission says we can do it then we have to find the necessary political will to be able to do it. This needs bipartisan support. Funding for essential care, support services, therapy, aids and equipment could then be drawn from this consistent pool of funds. The principal beneficiaries would be people whose disability has a significant impact on their daily life. Most importantly, the scheme would provide support no matter how that disability was acquired, because it can happen to anyone at any time. People born with a disability or who acquire a disability through accident or injury or as result of a medical condition or mental illness would all be eligible for assistance. Recipients with a lifelong disability should not, as they are now, be required to constantly prove their disability to continue to receive assistance. Eligibility for the scheme would be transparent, based on careful assessment. The system could be person centred and individualised, based on the choices of the person with a disability and their family. It would focus on early intervention and provide the supports that provide the best long-term outcomes.


Importantly, as I said, we must not forget that disability can happen to anyone at any time. Let us not wait for what might happen; let us act now and put in place a system for those who may need to rely on a little more assistance than many of us do. We need to plan properly for this and make sure it is done correctly but put it in place as soon as is humanly and legislatively possible—not in seven years time. As the member for Hughes said, that is far too long.


Debate adjourned.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2011-09-19,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (21:00):  I rise in this evening's grievance debate to speak about a situation where potentially thousands of Australians contracted the disease adhesive arachnoiditis after receiving a spinal injection of the chemical dyes Myodil or Pantopaque in the period from 1945 to the late 1980s. I bring to the attention of the House the sense of injustice and abandonment these people feel and to call for a parliamentary inquiry into their situation. At the outset, I would like to thank one of my Queens Park constituents, Mr Max Scott, a sufferer of adhesive arachnoiditis, for bringing this matter to my attention. Mr Scott attributes his contraction of arachnoiditis to his treatment with Myodil at Rivervale hospital in 1977. I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Library for the information that they have provided, which has been of great assistance as I have pursued information from Australian health authorities and as I prepared this speech.


Arachnoiditis is a debilitating neurological disease and, I think it would be fair to say, one of the most unpleasant diseases that one could suffer from. The condition itself is an inflammation of the arachnoid membrane. In many people, it affects the nerves running to the lower back and legs. The most common symptom is pain, but arachnoiditis can also cause (1) tingling, numbness or weakness in the legs; (2) sensations that may feel like insects crawling on the skin or water trickling down the leg; (3) severe shooting pain that can be similar to an electric shock sensation; (4) muscle cramps, spasms and uncontrollable twitching; and (5) bladder, bowel and/or sexual dysfunction. In its most severe form, this is an almost unbearable disease and, sadly, there are reports that many sufferers contemplate suicide. It slowly shuts the body down over a period of time.


When my constituent first raised this issue with me, he was able to walk into my East Victoria Park electorate office after driving himself from his home in Queens Park. Now, just a short time later, he is wheelchair bound and on the path to becoming a paraplegic. He suffers daily pain and there is little that can be done, as arachnoiditis is largely an incurable disease.


There are a variety of causes of arachnoiditis, one being the injection of a foreign substance, such as contrast media, into the spine. Unfortunately, the injection of the contrast media Pantopaque and Myodil, proprietary names of the chemical iophendylate, occurred widely in Australia between the 1940s and the 1980s. Iophendylate was injected into the spine and used as a radiological dye prior to the availability of MRI and CT technology. Once the dangers of the contrast medium and the link to adhesive arachnoiditis became apparent, the drug was withdrawn from the market across the world, but by then the damage had been done. Withdrawal did not occur at the same rate. There were reports that in Sweden it was banned in 1948, while in Australia it died a natural death in the eighties when MRI and CT scanning equipment became more widely used. Many questions have been raised as to how this contrast medium could have continued to be licensed for use in Australia up until the late 1980s.


This is a matter that has been raised in parliament before. Indeed, I acknowledge that this is not the first time that there have been calls for such an inquiry in this place. In 2002, the former member for Throsby, Jennie George, introduced a motion calling for an inquiry into this matter. Ms George referred evocatively to a 'conspiracy of silence about the incurable disease adhesive arachnoiditis', which she estimated to affect up to 60,000 Australian citizens. Ms George said questions needed to be answered about how a drug that had been introduced in Australia in 1945 and banned in Sweden in 1948 could have been used widely in Australia until withdrawn in 1987. I note that the current members for Boothby, Moore and Shortland also spoke on the motion. The member for Moore provided some details on the Commonwealth's role, stating:


Myodil was on the Australian market from at least 1959 and Pantopaque from at least 1961. Both agents were therefore available before the introduction of a therapeutic regulation program and requirements for premarketing evaluations in 1970.


The member for Shortland said that it was absolutely necessary that this is investigated. However, there was no subsequent inquiry, and the issue seems to have been put on the backburner ever since by governments of both persuasions.


An inquiry into this issue is long overdue, but now is an appropriate time. The slow decline in health for sufferers has meant that many people who were injected in the seventies and eighties are just beginning to suffer the ostensible effects of this disease today. It is in this context that Mr Scott approached me, asking for my assistance in getting to the bottom of this matter and seeing if there were any action he could take to achieve some assistance from the government.


I came to the chamber today to make this speech having made a great number of inquiries on his behalf to the Australian health establishment, and having received unsatisfactory results to date. I want to quickly brief the House on some of this correspondence now.


We wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 27 July 2010, and this was responded to on 18 August by the head of the Office of Medicine Authorisation in the Therapeutic Goods Administration. In this reply we were referred to the Medical Board of Australia. Accordingly, I wrote to the Medical Board of Australia on Mr Scott's behalf on 7 September 2010. After some time without a response it was followed up by a personal letter from Mr Scott on 31 October 2010. The response of 10 November referred us on to the Office of Health Review. Accordingly, a third letter was written to Anne Donaldson, director of the Office of Health Review on 17 November 2010. She replied on 1 December, stating, 'Whilst I sympathise with Mr Scott's situation, this office is unable to assist him on this occasion. This is because our legislation prescribes that we should not deal with a complaint that is older than 24 months. While there is some discretion available, we are unable to deal with a complaint about matters that occurred prior to 1995.'


This handballing from one organisation to another suggests that either these organisations are unaware of their functions or that this is an issue that they just do not want to deal with. I suspect there may be a bit of both going on.


Given these unsatisfactory responses, I thought the appropriate course of action to take was to contact the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which I did on 13 January this year. However, to this day I still have not received an official written reply from the Ombudsman and nor has Mr Scott.


I am beginning to understand why the member for Throsby in 2002 spoke about a conspiracy of silence. It is this lack of interest and communication that has been an unending source of frustration for those affected by the disease, and it is why I call today on the parliament for an inquiry into this matter. The lack of interest from the Commonwealth Ombudsman is particularly disappointing, given the positive role played by the UK ombudsman in extracting information from Glaxo. According to the Parliamentary Library, an article written by Judy Jones in the British Medical Journal said that a member of the public complained to the ombudsman in 1998 after the UK Medicines Control Agency refused to disclose information about the safety, quality and efficacy of Myodil that had been considered in reaching the decision about the product licence in 1987. After the ombudsman's intervention the agency agreed to disclose a substantial amount of the information about Myodil.


As I have mentioned already, it is not just Australia where people were injected with this contrast medium. It happened across the world and, as such, it is worth considering what has happened overseas. In the UK Pantopaque was marketed as Myodil and was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Glaxo, in 1987. According to research undertaken by the Parliamentary Library, Glaxo paid out £11 million in 1995 to 425 claimants in the UK, USA and Australia without accepting liability. The terms of the Glaxo payout were confidential, and there seems to be no information on how compensation has worked or was judged. The case that Glaxo regularly mounts in its defence is that by definition, people who had myelograms were already back sufferers.


In the US, where the substance was marketed under the Pantopaque name, the company was successfully sued by one person, but the settlement took place out of court. In New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation made payments to a number of sufferers of iatrogenic arachnoiditis. Payments varied from person to person and, again, the details of the exact payments, the persons to whom they were made and the nature of the evidence available were not in the public domain.


Many support groups around the world have made allegations of an alleged conspiracy by manufacturers to continue to promote the use of the agent and compliance by medical staff in maintaining the use of the contrast mediums Myodil and Pantopaque, despite the knowledge of a link with arachnoiditis. I understand that drug companies have settled many legal claims in the US, the UK and Australia out of court and on an individual basis, and that lawyers have deemed class action not to be viable.


The best committee to look into this matter is the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, of which I am the deputy chair. Fortunately, the chair is in the chair here tonight. I requested of the committee chair that the committee initiate such an inquiry, and spoke in favour of it meeting in March. The committee has agreed to reconsider this as its next major inquiry, and I look forward to this happening. 


In conclusion, it does seem that, whatever avenue one pursues, there is always a brick wall in the way. Even the Parliamentary Library has reported to my office that it is finding it difficult to get answers to some of its questions. The Prime Minister often talks about tearing down brick walls, and this is an ideal opportunity to do just that. It is time for an inquiry, and I thank you for your time because I have run out of time.
