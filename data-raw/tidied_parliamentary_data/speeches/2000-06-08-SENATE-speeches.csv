"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-08,"—I indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper. I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.

"CHAIRMAN, The",N/A,2000-06-08,"—Before we proceed with this, I have a statement to make. In the House of Representatives the Senate amendments, which were government amendments, were rejected but identical amendments were made to the bill. This is on the basis of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel claiming that the amendments made in the Senate should have been requests. In my statement on 5 July, I pointed out that there was no basis for the amendments being requests. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel appears to be taking the view that any amendment which might result in increased expenditure should be a request, even if there is no appropriation in sight affected by the amendment. On this basis, virtually every amendment moved in the Senate would have to be a request and proceedings on all bills would be greatly prolonged. I should add that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel did not respond to a request by the Clerk of the Senate for an explanation of the amendments being framed as requests in the first place. The simplest way for the bill to proceed is for the Senate to agree to the amendments made in the House, which are identical to the amendments made in the Senate in the first place.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-08,"—As I understood your statement, Madam Chair, the amendments now proposed by the House of Representatives are identical to the amendments carried in the Senate and therefore what the House of Representatives are asking us to do is to carry our amendments by agreeing to theirs. Is that the position? 
—That is correct, because the parliamentary counsel to the House of Representatives has advised them that they should have been requests and that we are not entitled to amend requests. It gets complicated, and we have some slight disagreement. So this is basically agreeing to keep the bill as it was amended when it left here in the first place.
—So this is a matter of form rather than substance, Madam Chair?
—Exactly.
—Thank you.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-06-08,"—On the same matter, what implications does agreement with these amendments have for the consideration of other bills when there are similar sets of circumstances? Is it the case that the advice that you have tendered to the Senate in your opening statement will, in fact, apply to other bills, and that there will be a considerable delay in the passage of other bills where we impose requests rather than amendments? 
—Senator Carr, that is precisely what I said. We are still waiting for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to respond to a request from the Clerk of the Senate for an explanation of the amendments and why they were framed as requests in the first place, and that has not happened.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-08,"—Madam Chair, I am not going to support a set of amendments from the House of Representatives when the amendments sent from the Senate were perfectly adequate. I support the amendments as they have gone from the Senate. If the House of Representatives wants to be precious about this, then let it supply the information upon which it insists on going through this procedure of adopting our amendments and then sending them back as its, because it does not want to accede to the fact that the amendments coming from here are the right of this chamber to send to the House. They are legitimate, they have been endorsed by this chamber and they are obviously acceptable to the House of Representatives. We are seeing a game play here which is effectively the House of Representatives saying that the Senate does not have the power to put forward these amendments while not providing reasons. I do not accept that.
—It is the Office of Parliamentary Counsel who is giving that advice, Senator Brown. Senator Harradine, were you seeking the call?",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-08,"—Yes, Madam Chair, but it is really to ask a question. I think we all realise that this is not just a matter of form but is a matter of substance. It goes to the very powers of the Senate in a bicameral system of government. I would request, Madam Chair, in your situation as Deputy President, that you raise this matter with the President in due course so that we can be advised in due course of the views of the presiding officers as to the powers of this Senate in respect of pieces of legislation that come before us.
—Thank you, Senator Harradine, I will raise it with Madam President. This was, of course, the subject of a Procedures Committee report a number of years ago and I think we need to find and review that report. I will certainly raise it with Madam President.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-06-08,"—I think we have to be very careful of lightly giving up the powers of the Senate because it is assumed to be a matter of form not substance. My own suggestion—and I would like reaction from the Senate to it—is that this matter be adjourned to a later time today for consideration. It may be appropriate to adjourn this matter to later today, because the content of the amendments is not the issue; it is the nature of the interaction between the two houses which is the issue. I would like to ask the Clerk, through you, Madam Chair, if he could devise a motion for us which would say that, whilst we accept that these amendments go through, we do not accept that this represents a precedent. We do not accept the views of the House as regards the way in which these are to be dealt with, and we object to it. That may or may not be a useful way to do it, but if the amendments are not at question, if it is the process that is at question, then I think the Senate simply should not acknowledge that the process is valid but should allow the matter to go forward in a practical sense. That is a suggestion, but I would need advice on that and I am not in a position to discuss this matter with any real understanding or knowledge of what is entailed.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-08,"—I am happy to have this adjourned until a later hour, but I would like to have it dealt with before 12.45 p.m. I also make the point that the statement that was read by you, Madam Chair, as you would know better than anybody in this chamber, is a statement that you have read on a range of bills when this situation occurs. It is an ongoing conflict between the Senate and the House of Representatives that is based particularly on an interpretation of the Constitution and of the forms of the House and that has been going on for a long time. It is not a new matter, and I find it surprising that senators who have been in this chamber for a long time have not noticed that the Chairman has read this out in the past. It is an ongoing dispute and the way it is being handled is the normal way, which is for the Senate to reiterate—which is quite proper—the continuing position of the Senate on these issues. It is a situation that has been well documented, and the Senate's view has been well argued, particularly by Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate. This is a dispute that came to my attention when I first became Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I sought to resolve the dispute between the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Senate. I used my best negotiating skills over a very long period of time, skills which are clearly not as good as the skills of my counterpart on the other side of the chamber in negotiating Senate committee amendments on behalf of the ACTU and others. Those skills failed, and I gave up because I figured that the pragmatic solution is to do exactly what the Chairman has done this morning, which is to restate the Senate's position. It is an ongoing dispute. If anyone else can assist me in trying to negotiate a resolution on this, I welcome their assistance.
But what needs to be understood is that this is not some new thing. The Labor Party were told exactly what we were doing with these amendments. They understand the amendments. The fact that we have created a hullabaloo over this this morning comes as somewhat of a surprise to me. I presume that the motives of those doing it are entirely worthy, and I am happy to go along with the concept of delaying it. But I would like to ensure that this matter is dealt with before 12.45 p.m. because if this arcane dispute between effectively—and I do not say this in a pejorative way—some bureaucrats is to hold up the program, it would turn it from being a matter of form substance into a matter of great delay, which will affect the people of Australia who will benefit from the provisions of the bill that we are trying to get through. I would move that progress be reported.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I do not intend to delay the proceedings, but I think that it is important that the opposition formally state their position on this. The motion of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is attractive, and we will support it if it is put to the vote. It seems to me to reflect the foreshadowed intention of the Australian Democrats and perhaps other speakers in this chamber, but that is for them to say. As for the opposition, we will support it. I do not intend to canvass this issue at great length. I am one of those who are notorious for not paying as much attention to the technical procedures as to the merit or substance of the issue. But it seems to me that the substance of the issue is met by the changes that the House have made to our amendments. Their insistence is that they move them, not us, and the question is a conflict between the chambers as to who takes precedence in this matter. That is an important issue, and I do not diminish it. But my immediate predilection is to go to the substance—what material difference does it make—and enable the chambers to continue an argument about the other matters. I thought that the foreshadowed intention of the Democrats in which we express a view and get on with the issue is probably the right outcome. An adjournment on this matter would enable us to give due consideration to it, and therefore we would support one.  
Before I resume my seat, there is one other comment I would make. It may well be—and I do not dispute what the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has said—that this statement has been read out on other occasions. Certainly I have not been aware of it, but I do not follow every item of legislation in the chamber and it is quite reasonable that it could have been read out and not attracted my attention.
—It is about once every month.
—Yes. As I said, my attention is usually on the substance of the issue rather than on the technical matter. It is perhaps a defect in my role as a senator that that is the case, but that is for me to correct. What the parliamentary secretary said was that the Labor Party had been consulted on this. I have just checked with my whip and the manager of business on our side and neither of them have knowledge of that. I want to say that for the record. I have not been consulted. If the opposition have been consulted, I am not sure who has been. Certainly the responsible officers on our side have not been.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (MISCELLANEOUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-08,"—I note in your statement, Madam Chair, the very important component here that if we are going to come back to this matter later in the day, we should be informed. There is not much point in us resuming this matter if we have not had a response to the Clerk's request for information from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel regarding the explanation of the amendments being framed by the House of Representatives and sent back to us. I would strongly submit that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel should respond to the Clerk so that we are able, when we come back to debate this matter, to be informed by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel as to exactly why this form of procedure is taking place, otherwise nothing will be gained. I would request through you, Chair, that contact be made with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and that when we resume we have that response in hand and that we not resume until we do get that response.
—I cannot guarantee that that will eventuate, Senator Brown.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-08,"—by leave—Not more than 10 or perhaps 15 minutes ago this matter was adjourned to a later hour of the day. At that time Senator Bishop was in the chamber inquiring as to when the matter would come up. We received no advice that this matter would immediately be dealt with. I understand that Senator Bishop is intending to seek leave to take note of the report. To deal with this matter, I would ask that his right, if it is possible, be preserved to do that. The normal courtesy would have been that we would have been told when this matter would be dealt with. If there is an understanding that Senator Bishop may seek leave to be granted to take note of the report at a later hour of the day, then I am happy that we proceed now accordingly.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-08,"—by leave—My preference was to have that report tabled after question time for the obvious reason that it would eat into opposition time and not scarce government business time. I was advised by the Clerk that, when a report is available for tabling, I am honour bound to have it tabled. Apparently that is the normal thing.  
Whenever people seek leave to speak on reports relating to bills that have been referred through the selection of bills process under standing order 24, I make a short statement saying that I think it is undesirable that those debates take place then, because clearly the debate on those bills is listed on the Notice Paper and will ensue shortly; but, being a pragmatist, as I have come to be in this job, we do not refuse leave. I understand that Senator Bishop or any other senator can seek leave between any other item of business to deal with this. That is his right and I will not interfere with it. 
I foreshadow that I will grant leave to Senator Bishop, but could I point out that standing order 24A(10) says this: 
A report from a standing committee relating to a bill referred to it under this order shall be received by the Senate without debate, and consideration of the report deferred until the order of the day relating to the bill is called on.
I remind all honourable senators that is the standing order and that the subject of the report that Senator Bishop will be seeking leave to speak on is listed on the Notice Paper. It is a high priority for the government, and we will be sending out the schedule for the next fortnight within a few hours. You will find it is listed high on that Notice Paper and, therefore, within a couple of hours of Senate sitting time it will be a matter for debate. To debate these items by leave when the report is tabled is a clear and unadulterated waste of Senate time, creating repetition and delaying the passage of legislation. It clearly delays it. The debate can occur, as the standing orders make quite clear, when the bill comes on. It is a clear waste of the Senate's time and could be perceived—I am sure it is not on this occasion—as a form of obstructionism and time wasting.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION AND DATACASTING) BILL 2000</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,9,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
You may be able to help me, Mr Acting Deputy President. Has the report of the legislation committee been tabled?
 (Senator George Campbell)—Yes, it has.
—Thank you. I just want to take a short time to address a few matters arising out of the bill. At the outset, I should say that there has been a very short time involved in the preparation of a rather lengthy report by both government and opposition, arising out of a very large bill, tabled less than one month ago in this place.
There were in excess of 40 submissions received by the committee in a week. There were almost 20 hours of public hearing on the digital television and datacasting bill, and the committee concluded its hearings last Thursday at about 9 or 10 p.m. The report is being tabled now and, as I understand it, will be listed very early when we return to this place after a week's sitting break. There has been quite an unreasonable time frame from beginning to end, and the government's desire for haste has compromised the ability of relevant industries to formulate detailed responses to the inquiry.
The ALP minority report addresses critical issues in the bill within the framework of the 1998 legislation. It should be noted at the outset that there was and is criticism of the 1998 framework because of uncertainty facing HDTV around the world, technological convergence, and aspects of the current bill which go beyond understanding around the 1998 framework legislation. Labor senators address in some detail in their report the following issues: datacasting, multichannelling by the national broadcasters, spectrum loan to commercial TV stations and HDTV, enhanced programming, and a series of reviews which are part and parcel of the bill.
I will turn to each of those points in a little more detail. In respect of datacasting, which is a critical emerging industry for the passage of information in our society, Labor senators, after consideration, came to the view that the definition of `datacasting' as it stands in the bill is overly restrictive, complicated and goes beyond restricting datacasting to services that do not constitute broadcasting. Labor senators believe that, while datacasting cannot be de facto broadcasting, the definition should be amended to remove the artificial and unnecessary limitations on datacasting. Labor senators believe it is crucial that this emergent industry is not stifled in this development and innovative capacity by overly restrictive regulation and that the benefits for Australia's technological advancement, improved consumer services and employment and economic opportunities should not be constrained. Accordingly, Labor senators oppose the genre based content definition of datacasting and call upon the government to withdraw from that approach. Labor senators support an approach that favours flexibility, minimises barriers to entry and allows new services to develop over time. 
In respect of the national broadcasters and datacasting, we regard the decision to impose datacasting fees on the national broadcasters as quite silly or nonsensical and call upon the government to reverse that decision. Similarly, the opposition senators believe that the national broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—should be allowed to broadcast radio programs for datacasting purposes. In respect of the datacasting transmission licences after the broadcast moratorium, Labor senators believe it is important that the post-moratorium arrangements for datacasting licences, which have a term of 10 years with a five-year option, be considered by early review. 
Turning to multichannelling, perhaps the second most important issue in the debate around the bill, Labor senators believe that there is broad support for allowing the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel. Labor senators see no valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel, particularly when those arguments are balanced against the resultant benefits. 
In terms of the debate concerning the spectrum loan to commercial television sta-tions and HDTV, there is some industry criticism of the government's policy decision to loan spectrum to commercial free-to-air broadcasters for the purpose of conversion to digital and HDTV. Labor senators believe that the arrangements mandating HDTV require early review to assess the continued mandating of HDTV broadcasting. In terms of enhanced programming, on the evidence it is a not unreasonable conclusion that the provisions of the bill allow simultaneous multiple broadcast of distinct substance, which could constitute de facto multichannelling. This allows the free-to-air broadcasters to compete with multichannelling services offered by the pay TV sector. After consideration, Labor senators have come to the view that the bill should be consistent with the minister's previous policy indications of what would comprise enhanced programming and the circumstances in which multichannelling in the case of an overlap would be permitted so that commercial free-to-air stations do not engage in de facto multichannelling.
In terms of the series of reviews that are part of the bill, in recognition of the transitional nature of the legislation the opposition is of the view that it is highly desirable that its consequences and efficacy are measured over the coming years to ensure that parliament's policy objectives are being properly and effectively implemented. Labor senators believe it is critical for the proposed reviews to be instigated, completed and their findings considered in a timely manner consistent with the industry's requirements for certainty. Accordingly, Labor senators believe it is pertinent for the reviews to be transparent and accountable to parliament. As such, they should be statutory and required by the legislation.
I was requested to be brief in my remarks. I just repeat that the critical issues of datacasting, multichannelling by commercial broadcasters, the spectrum loan to commercial television stations and HDTV, enhanced programming and the series of reviews are the matters the opposition senators have concentrated on in the bill process. Whilst we briefly addressed other matters raised in the public hearings, they are the critical matters in the bill and they are the matters we will be most likely moving amendments on when the bill is debated.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I just want to speak briefly on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000 because I know we will have an opportunity to speak in more detail in the next session. I must say that I was intrigued by a number of the definitions that were bandied about. I think we are the only country in the world that has this term `datacasting'. From what I see as the definition of datacasting, it is pretty much a joke in terms of the technological age we live in. From what I understand from talking to people who are knowledgable in the industry and particularly in communications, this is a modern equivalent of putting someone with a red flag in front of a modern motor vehicle and walking down the expressway. We have modern technology now being restrained by what might be new technology.
I was very impressed by the evidence given by Mr Encel, who was very concerned about the introduction of this new technology. He very much doubted whether the HDTV would bring the benefits to Australia that are being enunciated by people. If we extrapolate from the US experience, he said that on the basis of the percentage of the number of Australians as opposed to Americans we would only have 250 HDTV sets purchased here. The main reasons are the cost and the consumer resistance to it.
I have been asked to keep my comments short. In conclusion, I would like to say that I was very impressed by the people that came along from captioning. I was very impressed when they made the comment that the proprietor of Channel, Mr Kerry Stokes, seems to have gone out of his way to make sure captioning has been available to a large degree on his Prime Television. Mr Stokes, who I understand did not come from a privileged or advantaged background, I would think knows what it is to be disadvantaged and to be held back in this world and he has certainly done his bit for people who are hearing impaired.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-08,"—These bills are on the Notice Paper at No. 2. The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 2000 is on at No. 1, but my understanding is that the government does not wish to proceed with that bill today. In any case, I might say the minister is refusing to answer questions, which I think is a very disgraceful performance by him. It is something that we will have to pay attention to when that bill comes back on.
Let me turn to the bills now before the chamber. The Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000 and related bills are but another example of the incompetence of the minister responsible for the detailed implementation of the GST, Senator Kemp, to try and win favour with the vast, vanishing support base for the GST in country Australia. As the government continue to realise the devastation they are about to wreak on rural and regional Australia, they have finally realised what the ALP has been saying since 1998, that is, that the GST will push the price of petrol up in the bush and the gap between rural and city petrol prices, otherwise known as the fuel price differential, will only get worse thanks to the GST. After all, it is simple arithmetic. If you are living in Kalgoorlie and paying 10c or more per litre for your petrol than if you were living in Perth, then when it is taxed by 10 per cent under the GST you will pay an extra cent on your petrol. That is because of the percentage nature of the tax. So there is in-built discrimination in the GST against people living in country Australia, where there are higher costs for most consumer goods.
This package of bills seeks to provide a tiered system of grants for petrol sales to consumers in the bush with a higher rate of grant to be provided to sales in more remote rural areas. The scheme is estimated to cost $500 million over four years from the financial year 2000-01, although at the recent Senate estimates committee hearing we discovered that another $19.6 million will be required to operate and administer the scheme. A central component of this cost is an as yet undefined centralised computer system that will link all of the participating service stations to a central computer database. No doubt they will provide confidential information to the ATO for the government to use, as it has done in the recent ABN application of information on the Australian electoral roll.  
This scheme, though, represents a vindication of the position argued by Labor going back before the last election, when we pointed out that including petrol in the GST would widen the city-country petrol price differential. For a long time the government resisted this argument and claimed it was not so, but this legislation is an admission and an acknowledgment by the government of the fact that the GST will indeed push up petrol prices in country Australia. The government's plan involves reducing the excise on fuel by a set amount, such as 7c or 8c per litre, and then imposing the 10 per cent GST on fuel. The formula will have effect depending upon the retail price at the time. For example, if the existing retail price of petrol were 77c, removing 7c of excise and imposing a 10 per cent GST, that is, 7c, would have no effect, therefore, on the retail price. 
However, as anyone who has driven around the country or who lives in the country or who has spent any time in country areas will readily understand, at various petrol stations around the country there will be prices in excess of 70c per litre. Indeed, to cite Kalgoorlie, where my electorate office is at the present time, it is not unusual to encounter petrol prices of 98c per litre or more. Generally, the further away you get from the metropolitan area the higher that price differential becomes. For example, if you have a petrol station in country New South Wales which currently charges 87c, there will be a price effect whereby it reduces the price by 7c a litre for the excise reduction but then the 10 per cent GST kicks in. It would add 10 per cent of 80c, that is, 8c. The retail price in that country service station would increase from 87c to 88c because of the GST. There is still a price rise. There is still a widening gap between the city and the country. The city-country price differential increases. 
Where a petrol station is very remote, as in outback Australia—and we are all aware of examples of that in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, remote western Queensland and New South Wales—the price will be even higher, which will mean greater than a 1c per litre increase. That price effect is an inescapable mathematical fact, despite the weasel words in the ANTS package that no petrol price need rise. It is important to remember that this is what the government said—that no petrol price need rise. If you just plainly look at the facts, that is not true. 
To overcome the problem, various state ministers, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the former Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, were saying before the election that no petrol price would rise. That is palpably untrue. Despite their claims, Labor continually pointed out that this promise was undeliverable under the original ANTS package. Motoring organisations, and in particular the Australian Automobile Association, the most prestigious body representing Australian motorists, confirmed Labor's argument. The only ones in a state of denial are people like Senator Kemp and others in the government who are responsible for the design and implementation of the GST—although Senator Kemp has become universally known as the minister responsible for the detailed failure of the implementation of the GST. 
We did see, though, at one stage the Treasurer, Mr Costello, actually attempt to walk away from the promise that fuel need not rise as a result of the GST. He did that on the Laurie Oakes Sunday program when he said that there were limits to that promise. Before the election a promise that petrol need not rise and after the election an admission by the Treasurer that there were limits to that promise. This was basically Treasurer Costello attempting to redefine the government's commitment from a core to a non-core promise—weasel words at their worst. 
What the Treasurer was trying to do was to dud country Australia. We all know that Treasurer Costello has a contempt for country Australia. He hardly ever goes there or, when he does, it is in a Commonwealth car with tinted glass windows so he cannot be recognised. We know what the Treasurer's answer is to the problems faced by those in the bush. His answer is `Cut their wages.' According to the Treasurer, people in the bush are paid too much and the only way you will get more jobs in country Australia is to cut the wages of rural and regional workers. So the Treasurer's solution to the problems in rural and regional Australia is to put up their fuel, impose a 10 per cent GST on almost everything they buy and, what is more, pay them less for their efforts. Is it any wonder that rural and regional Australian Liberal MPs are not clamouring to take the Treasurer on visits with them to country electorates? He is political poison.  
What about the poor old pitiful National Party in all of this? Their raison d'etre is to stand up for country Australia. They do not represent anyone anymore. Respected by nobody, least of all the Liberal Party and the Treasurer, in particular, they are no more than the old obedient and trusty sheep dog, ready to be trodden on and kicked about by their Liberal Party masters, led by the Treasurer. It is really quite sad—the grand old and once proud National Party firmly on the Costello leash, told where to stand, when to sit, when to speak and, on the odd occasion when they try to speak out, when to shut up. Like the old, tired, obedient sheep dog this is exactly what they do. Black Jack McEwen must be turning in his grave.
To look at these measures in a little more detail, I now turn to the main bill. The main bill establishes a grants scheme to fuel retailers in respect of sales in non-metropolitan and remote areas to end users. A grant will apply to all sales after 1 July. This bill is notable because it is particularly light in any detail at all. What it does is establish a registration system for the grants, but it does precious little else. It merely establishes a framework for the grants. To obtain a grant, a person has to register under the scheme, and there is simply no detail provided about the key points. For example: where are the non-metropolitan locations that qualify for the grants? They are not set out in the bill. The government cannot tell us—and this was confirmed in the recent Senate estimates. This is the old argument on conurbations that we had previously and this is an argument that is being revisited: where are the boundaries for the fuel grants scheme? We need to know where the boundaries are to know who is eligible. If we do not have boundaries, we do not know who is eligible and there is confusion as a consequence. The bottom line is that Senator Kemp does not know because he is still waiting for Liberal Party headquarters to tell him where the final boundaries of the Liberal Party's most marginal seats will be as a result of the current redrawing of electoral boundaries. That is what politics in Australia has come down to: cut the boundaries according to political necessity; do not cut the boundaries according to economic need.
—What we did see, Senator, in the case of the diesel fuel grants scheme, was a trip between Canberra and Queanbeyan qualifying for a diesel fuel grant, yet a trip between Melbourne and Geelong does not. Why was that? Because Queanbeyan is in the marginal Liberal seat of Eden-Monaro and Geelong is in the safe Labor seat of Corio; therefore, discriminate against Geelong, provide the grant to Eden-Monaro. So, until the government knows the final boundaries of the marginal seats, we will not know where the boundaries will be in the fuel sales grants scheme.
This is just one of the outstanding issues, but there are many more. For example: where are the remote locations that qualify for a higher level of grant? Again, they are not set out in the bill. We do not know. What is the rate of the grant in various locations? Again, they are not set out in the bill. We do not know. All of these issues are absolutely basic, fundamental points and are to be given to us in the form of regulations, we are told, at some as yet undefined time. We are told this bill is urgent, but we do not know when the regulations will be tabled that tell us the critical detail about how this bill in fact will operate. We once again have Senator Kemp not telling the parliament or the community anything in the way of detail concerning this legislation, although to expect anything more from the Assistant Treasurer—we know on this side of the chamber—would be stretching his ministerial capability beyond anybody's expectation. 
Put simply, this bill is a farce. It gets the newspaper headline; it announces `$500 million'—and then quietly, `over four years', and says that this is the answer to the prayer of motorists in the bush; but then it does not provide any detail to say how this prayer will be answered. One can be forgiven for assuming that the purpose of this bill was to get the headline and not deal with the problem. It does not clarify any of the details which are necessary for this parliament to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. This is a house of review. How can we review whether this legislation does what the government claims it will do, without the detail? We are most concerned that the government have not yet actually settled the detail of the boundaries, yet they are able to tell us with certainty how much the scheme will cost. They know the price, but they just cannot tell us how it will be spent. All we have is the Treasurer's announcement that non-metropolitan locations will get 1c per litre grants and remote areas will get 2c or, possibly, more. Where is the detail? It is clear that this is a proposal arrived at on the run in the government's panic about being caught out, yet again, on another undeliverable GST promise.
Let me also make the observation that this scheme is not a benefit, as the government would portray it to be and would have us believe it is, but simply an attempt to offset an adverse impact of the GST on the country price differential. Therefore, to portray it as some sort of gift to regional and rural Australia is wrong. It is in fact ameliorating damage to regional and rural Australia. Because we do not have the detail, to what extent will it succeed? And one knows, because of the price differentials, it is unlikely to succeed all of the way—but it will not even do that. We had evidence presented to the Senate estimates committee that the full $500 million will not even flow through to consumers in the country. This is because the government has admitted that petrol station participants can offset the cost of complying with the grants scheme from the grants they have received from the $500 million that has been allocated. But guess what: the government cannot even tell us what the compliance costs will be. So we have a scheme with no boundaries, no rates, no idea of how much it will cost in terms of compliance and no idea of how the $500 million was calculated in the first place. `Think of a figure' appears to be the way in which it was approached. Yet we are told with certainty that it will ensure that the price of fuel need not rise as a result of the GST. Wait for the horse laugh from country Australia!
The government can rely on hope, because this is the only thing they have going for them in these circumstances. What we do know is that the GST will put up the price of fuel in the bush; the GST will worsen the city-country price differential. The government's only answer to this problem and others in the bush is to slash the wages of rural workers, as outlined by the Treasurer and aided and abetted by the tired old, but obedient in this case, National Party. This is the perverseness of the government's position. They want to put up the price of petrol in country Australia, put a brand new 10 per cent GST on almost everything people in the bush purchase, and the Treasurer wants to slash their wages with which they are to pay for the higher priced fuel and higher priced goods and services as a consequence of the GST. That is the government's plan for regional and rural Australia. No wonder Senator Macdonald is not in the chamber to face the music. 
I also note that we have before us the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Bill 2000 As with the main Fuel Sales Grants Bill, this bill is deficient in terms of detail. We are not told in this bill how often the grants are to be paid, or what the base is for calculating the grants. That is not there. Is the basis past sales, or is it anticipated sales? No detail given. Is the grant subject to income tax in the hands of the recipient? We do not know—no detail. What records have to be kept in order to satisfy the requirements of the scheme? We still do not know. The government criticises those who criticise that there is insufficient information to enable small business in this country to prepare for the GST. If they put through legislation like this with no detail, how can small business be expected to know what they are supposed to do? Since ignorance of the law is no defence, if the law is unspecific and no-one knows, how can they then be prosecuted if there are breaches, or how can they then be denied an entitlement if the government will not tell them what they should do to apply? 
We can see that this bill covers such administrative matters as method of registration and cancellation of registration; assessments and payments of claims; record keeping requirements; compliance enforcement measures, such as those against schemes which attempt to abuse the grants scheme; recovery of unpaid debts; penalties for false statements, et cetera, and information gathering and access powers for the Commissioner of Taxation, including secrecy provisions. In regard to the secrecy provisions, given the ATO's form to date, one has to question how protected confidential taxpayer information will be. We know that some taxpayer information is being sold by the tax office. I would therefore like to ask Senator Kemp this: once the government has its centralised fuel grants scheme computer database up and running, what, if any, information will be publicly available? What, if any, taxpayer information will be made available for sale? And will the government be using this database in order to conduct another taxpayer funded mail-out?
Labor understands that this scheme represents some form of compensation for the GST and, accordingly, the Labor Party will not be opposing these bills. We do commend the government for finally admitting that the GST will force up the price of fuel in country Australia. It has been our consistent position throughout the GST debate that, while we oppose the GST and believe that the compensation measures are inadequate, they should not be opposed; and we will not be opposing them. I move Labor's second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“But the Senate condemns the Government for worsening the city/country fuel price differential by imposing a GST and imposing a costly, complex, and uncertain new layer of compliance burden on fuel retailers.”
In the last seconds available to me, I also draw attention to the fact that the Labor Party spokesman on small business, Joel Fitzgibbon, has put in a private member's bill to help deregulate fuel pricing in the country. It is a pity the government voted it down. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-06-08,"—I rise today on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the concept behind the Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000 and the package of related bills. I want to note some matters which the government could consider in the regulations to be made under this bill—specifically, the number of, and amount given to, the grant categories. I will not speak too long on the matter, but I do want to take the chamber to some particular issues.
On 11 April, when the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer announced the fuel sales grants program, the Australian Democrats welcomed the announcement of the $500 million grants scheme to equalise fuel price effects in regional Australia following the introduction of the GST. A grants scheme is certainly preferable to greater cuts to excise rates across the board, which would have delivered lower fuel prices to city motorists, significantly reduced revenue and actually increased fuel price disparity. Our concern is much more about the city-country fuel price disparity. On 11 April I also acknowledged that it was the obvious way to equalise GST effects and that, had an across-the-board reduction in excise been used as the mechanism for the government to keep its promise, the country-city fuel disparity would have increased. So the Australian Democrats, at an adviser level and publicly on the record, had discussions with the government about such a scheme. These discussions were undertaken with the view that the grants should be done on the basis of transportation costs.
The current excise arrangement sees the government attain something like 44.15c per litre for unleaded fuel and 46.6c per litre for leaded fuels. This totals to $13 billion or $14 billion per annum. With the implementation of the GST, the government will need to adjust down the current excise levels to be able to not significantly increase fuel prices from 1 July. As all of us are all too aware, there is a serious disparity between the petrol pricing in the cities and in rural and regional areas around the country. This will mean that a straight reduction in the excise will not prevent an increase in fuels in rural and regional areas, if it is pegged particularly to the average retail price in the cities. The Australian Democrats recognised some time ago that a method of altering the excise or some other rebate scheme is necessary to avoid greater disadvantage to rural and regional areas than already exists as a result of lower levels of competition and, particularly, higher transportation costs. 
As a matter of fact, and I note what the Labor Party have said, the GST presented an opportunity for one of the three elements of petrol price disparity to be removed—that being the cost of transportation—hence leaving only lower through-put levels with competition and the number of sites as issues that need to be addressed in helping deal with the country-city fuel price disparities. The government's policy document, Tax Reform: not a new tax, a new tax system, released in August 1998, stated:
At the time of the introduction of the GST, the Government will reduce excise on petrol and diesel so that the pump price for these commodities for consumers need not rise.
To achieve that particular promise, it was estimated that the rate of excise would need to be reduced by 7c a litre, with the reduction being replaced by the GST payable. Businesses, of course, able to claim input tax credits will be able to claim the amount of GST on petrol. The promise made then was repeated a number of times during the campaign for the October 1998 election. I want to put on the record that the Prime Minister stated:
And because the price of petrol at the pump doesn't rise you will find in business that your petrol is seven cents a litre cheaper.
Later on he said:
The price of petrol at the bowser will not go up ... The excise will come down by the amount that is the equivalent of the GST and the price will not go up 1 cent at the bowser.
I think one of the difficulties in being able to implement the promise arises from the fact that, in regional and remote areas, petrol prices are generally higher than in metropolitan locations. The addition of a 10 per cent GST to a higher base price will result in the final price being greater than adding 10 per cent to a lower base. For example, if petrol in a metropolitan area retails for 77c per litre and excise is reduced by 7c per litre, the addition of a 10 per cent GST will result in the same retail price of 77c per litre. However, if the retail price is 90c per litre in a regional or remote area and excise is reduced by 7c per litre, the GST will be added to a base price of 83c per litre, leading to a final price of 91.3c per litre. This essentially means that the retail price has increased by 1.3c per litre, due to the replacement of part of the excise payable with the GST. Recently, these issues have come up in Tasmania, where they have seen prices of over 90c per litre in category; whereas in Sydney it has been, in places, just over the 80c mark. So, as prices increase in both metropolitan and regional and rural areas, it can be expected that the additional amount payable, due to the GST, will in fact increase.
However, whether prices have been reduced at the pump by the amount of the grant will depend on the prices charged throughout the supply chain, which will involve a number of decision makers. I want to take the Senate to a number of examples. If a wholesaler decides to increase its price or reduce a current discount to a particular outlet in an area, or to all outlets in an area, there is going to be difficulty, in the absence of any contrary evidence, in determining that it is due to the grant being offset. These are things that I think the government needs to take note of. While the ACCC may be successful in determining where prices have increased to make a windfall gain of the grant amount, the matter must be in doubt, given the current relatively much greater variations in prices. With regional prices currently varying from the metropolitan price by large amounts, for example, from 0.2c per litre in Berri through to 7.9c per litre in Bateman's Bay, I think the challenge for the government is really about ensuring that the grant is not exploited in the future. That would appear to be a difficult task to police. 
It was for this reason that the proposal the Australian Democrats worked on had eight categories, starting from 0.5c per litre to 4c per litre. Although this made it slightly more difficult to set up, the information systems available these days would mean that the paperwork would be no greater than what is currently required. There is one thing that the Democrats' policy did deliver—that is, a more realistic representation of what the cost differentials are. Also important is that the logic behind our scheme is, as alluded to earlier, the removal of transportation costs from the fuel equation. As it stands at the moment, I am not quite sure whether what the government has proposed will deliver what it expects. I might add that, although we suggested eight categories, it is also costed at approximately $500 million over four years. 
I think that the ACCC is going to have its work cut out in attempting to see that this grant is passed on. This is especially true considering the lack of transparency that continues to exist in this industry. I hope that the Treasurer and the government do give consideration to changes to the structure. I look forward to the government getting serious about change in the petroleum industry generally. The industry wants an oil code, some security in tenure and a program that will help small petrol station operators exit the industry where it is unviable for either them or their market to remain. There are smaller and smaller margins at all points within the industry. I think it is these smaller margins that, for the most part, have contributed to the industry being subjected to some 47 inquiries over many years. It is also of concern that only a small proportion of the excise is actually marked for infrastructure development, with the remainder being placed into consolidated revenue. These are important points, because I think moneys from the excise really need to be marked for both road and rail development. Moneys need to be made available to help make some of the structural changes needed to make this industry, again, one that is viable for small business operators.
The Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000 and the related bills are, I believe, a step in the right direction in assisting rural and regional Australia. It is a step in the right direction towards dealing with petrol price disparity. It is, however, a pity that it appears this is the only step being made to address the problem. It is tragic for public policy that this has only come about as a result of the effects of the GST. It is a problem that existed well before then.
The Australian Democrats support the bill. However we believe that, as it stands, it will not deliver on the government's election promises that fuel prices would not increase. As such, I would encourage the government and the Treasurer to seriously consider the issues I have raised today when implementing the regulations for this bill and the package of related bills. Finally, I also note the circulation of late amendments on behalf of the government to improve the capacity of the ACCC to police. I can flag now that we have no difficulties in supporting those. I note also the amendment moved on behalf of the opposition by Senator Cook, and I flag now that we will not be supporting that.",SENATE,<title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-08,"—The Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000 and related bills do a number of things in respect of fuel prices in this country. Firstly, they provide a tiered system of grants for petrol sales to consumers in non-metropolitan areas, with a higher rate of grant to be provided for sales in remote areas. Secondly, they standardise the administrative framework for grants and benefits administered by the Commissioner of Taxation. Thirdly, they ensure that the grants are covered under the Taxation Administration Act 1953, like other taxes in such areas as prosecutions, offences, et cetera. The estimated cost of the scheme is $500 million over four years, from the year 2000-01. It is important to point out that this is an additional cost to budget that was not factored in to the government's tax package that was taken to the last election.
From Labor's perspective, the bills represent a vindication of the criticisms we made prior to the last election that a differential in petrol prices between urban and rural and regional areas would emerge and that the differential would get worse as a result of the GST. The Liberal-National government's plan involves reducing the excise on fuel by a set amount—for example, 7c or 8c a litre—and then imposing the 10 per cent GST on top. The effect of this formula will depend upon the retail price at the time. For example, if the retail price of petrol is 77c, the 7c on excise will be removed and a 10 per cent GST will be imposed, which is equivalent to 7c, and there will be no effect on the retail price. However, at many petrol stations in rural and regional areas, some prices are above 77c. Generally, the further you go from the major metropolitan areas, such as Melbourne and Sydney, the higher the price differential for petrol. 
If you apply the formula to a petrol station in my home state of Tasmania which currently charges 87c—and I would say in passing that the petrol prices in Tasmania have been up to $1 in the last few months, but I will use 87c by way of an example—you would face the following price effect: there would be a reduction of 7c a litre for excise, you would then add 10 per cent GST, which would add 8c on top. So you end up with an additional 1c a litre on a base of 87 cents. To use my home state of Tasmania as an example, petrol is higher than 87 cents—generally in the low nineties, depending on where you purchase it—so, as a result of the GST, people in Tasmania will face a higher petrol price of 1c plus. This is in stark contrast to the commitment given by the Liberal-National parties prior to the last election that this would not occur.
The price effect I have outlined is an inescapable mathematical fact. It is based on the fact that petrol prices in most rural and regional areas are higher than in Sydney or Melbourne. The ANTS package—the government's propaganda document that they took to the last election—said that no petrol price need rise. To overcome the problems, we have had various government ministers—the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer—pledging that no petrol price would rise. There is a clear difference between `no petrolprice need rise' and `no petrol price would rise'. This government ignored this problem prior to the last election, and Labor has continually pointed out that the promise that was made under the original ANTS package was undeliverable. It is not just Labor that has said this; motoring organisations have also done so. The Australian Automobile Association in particular  has consistently confirmed Labor's arguments. Even that well-known public commentator, Mr Terry McCrann—who is not a favourite of the Labor Party's, I might say—has made very similar observations.
After the election, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, attempted to walk away from the promise when he said to Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program that there were limits to the promise. If you look through the government's document—the ANTS package—there were no such limits outlined prior to the election. The comment made by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, caused outrage, as it should have, in regional Australia. This in turn led the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to very firmly rebuke the Treasurer the following day by saying that the promise would be honoured in full. The comments by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, came a short time after his famous pre-Christmas message to Australians who live in regional Australia that they should take a cut in their wages. After two or three attempts to clarify what he meant, the Treasurer backed down on that matter as well. I might say that there was considerable criticism of the Treasurer in respect of lower wages in rural and regional Australia, and not just from our side of politics.
The Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000 establishes a grants scheme to fuel retailers with respect to sales in non-metropolitan and remote areas to end users. This grant will apply to all such sales after 1 July. The sale is when the fuel is delivered, not when it is paid for, and the bill establishes a framework for these grants. In respect of these, there simply is not a great deal of detail about some critical issues—for example, which non-metropolitan locations qualify for the grants, which remote locations qualify for the higher grants, and the rates of grants at the various places. We have to remember that there are about 5,000 petrol retailers in this country, so it is a very important issue. The details have not been released to the public, other than the Treasurer announcing that non-metropolitan locations will get 1c per litre grants and remote areas will get 2c. This bill is simply a farce when it comes to dealing with these issues—it does not clarify what are the critical issues to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. Just like the diesel fuel grants for heavy transport vehicles, the government has not settled the details of the boundary changes. 
We have seen a number of examples of major changes to policy, carried out on the run, with respect to the GST. We had another example in the other place yesterday, when Minister Anthony rolled out the so-called compensation for people who were not to benefit from tax cuts as a result of the implementation of the GST. I would also point out that it is the responsibility of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, to give us the details—it is one of his tasks delegated from the Treasurer. We look forward to his providing us with the details, but they should have been provided long before this.
The grants and administration bill will impose further compliance requirements on petrol retailers in this country. As if the GST itself is not going to be difficult enough, they will have an additional compliance burden placed on them. The cost of compliance will obviously be met by the retailer, and most of these petrol retailers are small businesses which are battling. But this legislation does not make this point clear. It is not known whether it is expected that the petrol retailer will have to make a loss as a result of them having to administer this particular scheme. So you have petrol retailers caught in a vice-like grip of administrative bureaucracy as a result of the GST package. On the one side they have to meet the requirements of the introduction of a GST and, on the other side, they are going to have to administer this grants scheme. How on earth do petrol retailers work out the costs of compliance when many of the details in this scheme are simply not provided? How often are the grants to be paid? What is the base for calculating the grants? Is it going to be past sales or anticipated sales? Is the grant subject to income tax for the recipient? What records have to be kept in order to satisfy the requirements of the scheme? The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, should come into this chamber and explain these details. It is obviously important to us as legislators, but it is particularly important to petrol retailers in this country, especially with the GST due to start in a few weeks.
There are two other points I want to deal with with respect to this legislation. The enforcement role of the ACCC is important with respect to petrol prices in this country. My colleagues, Senator Murphy and Senator Conroy, and I spent some time exploring this issue with the ACCC in front of Senate estimates last week. We asked questions of Mr Asher, who was representing the ACCC—Mr Fels had gone off to do another press conference, but that is another story. 
—The three millionth press conference?
—I think it was No. 299, according to the press release I was questioning Professor Fels about. Anyway, we can check that later for accuracy. It is certainly a substantial number so far this year. Mr Asher could not give a guarantee that fuel grants would be passed on to Australian motorists. So the ACCC—the regulator of the GST implementation in this country; supposedly there to ensure that there is not exploitation of consumers—cannot give an undertaking or a guarantee. Mr Asher was refreshingly frank when he said that they could not give a guarantee. He explained the practical difficulties in managing the schemes we are considering in this legislation. He pointed out that there are 5,000 petrol retailers in the country and that the ACCC would be monitoring about half of them. Under very incisive questioning from my colleagues, he explained that it was very difficult to monitor all 5,000 petrol stations in Australia. Of course, it is particularly difficult to monitor those petrol stations in rural and regional areas for obvious logistical reasons in terms of distance. So there is no guarantee that, when this scheme is implemented, motorists will benefit and that we will not see an increase in the price differential in at least some rural and regional areas.  
Unfortunately, we do not have the transcript available yet, but we did go to the point of whether or not a petrol retailer can absorb their compliance costs within, effectively, the subsidy paid to them to pass on to consumers, and the ACCC were not able to clarify this point. I put it to the Senate: with additional compliance burdens being placed on petrol retailers in this country—the vice that I referred to earlier—is it fair and reasonable for them to have to carry the additional costs, the paperwork, the bureaucratic burden? I would suggest that it is not. I would suggest that petrol retailers in this country, small business operators, are really going to be scrutinising this government and casting a harsh judgment, along with many other small businesses, at the next election. 
There is one other point I wish to make—and I will conclude on this point—and that is the failure of the National Party, yet again, to defend the interests of people living in rural and regional Australia. It is not only with respect to petrol prices—
—A sad failure.
—It is a sad failure. The performance of the National Party in recent times is somewhat pathetic with respect to not only the price of petrol in rural and regional but also the GST itself. How on earth could the National Party, supposedly representing farmers, accept the proposition that the implementation of a GST would be offset by income tax cuts, when half the farmers in this country do not pay income tax because they are not earning anything? They are drawing down on their capital; so they in fact have negative incomes at the present time. How on earth can the National Party be effectively not just conned but trampled on by the Liberal Party with respect to the GST? How on earth could the National Party accept that many farmers in this country are going to suffer as a result of the GST? There is no effective compensation. I had a discussion with a number of small farmers down at the Forth Pub about this issue a couple of weeks ago, and they pointed that out to me in no uncertain terms.
We have got two streams in the National Party in this country. We have got the old socialist strain, as represented by Senator Boswell. Senator Boswell is fairly rough and gruff but he believes in socialism, as long as socialism starts 50 kilometres outside the CBD of Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne. Senator Boswell is an old-style socialist. Then we have, for example, Senator McGauran, a more urbane, smoother intellectual type in the National Party. He may as well be a Liberal. But the point is that Senator McGauran and similar National Party members have the predominant say in the National Party caucus and they are constantly overruling the attempts of people like Senator Boswell to defend the interests of people in rural and regional Australia. I do not know why the National Party simply do not pack up and those who are effectively Liberals join the Liberal Party and those who are effectively the old-style agrarian socialists like Senator Boswell join the Labor Party.
—An invitation.
—I notice, Senator Kemp, that the National Party's Senator McGauran, because of the coalition deal in Victoria, was actually ahead of you on the Senate ticket. That does highlight at least one of the motivations for the National Party trying to continue in existence. But the basic fact is that the National Party, in respect of the GST, in respect of the issue of petrol prices and in respect of basic education and health services in rural and regional areas, has been a manifest failure in defending the interests of rural and regional people against the urban economic interests of the big end of town, the Liberal Party. This bill is further evidence of the National Party's increasing irrelevance in this country and its failure to represent rural and regional interests. We have seen this highlighted in a number of recent electoral outcomes, where the National Party has been defeated in a number of rural and regional areas, as it should have been.
I conclude my remarks by saying in summary that we are supporting this legislation. It is okay as far as it goes, but we still lack important details. It is yet another piece of legislation as a result of the GST. In the Senate we are going to see in the coming weeks thousands of pages of amendments on the GST—more amendments. But this will not deliver the same outcome in terms of petrol prices for people in rural and regional Australia, particularly those that I represent in Tasmania. ",SENATE,<title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-08,"—The bills we are debating are the Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000, the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Bill 2000 and the Fuel Sales Grants (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2000. If we look at the general outline and financial impact statement, it says:
With regard to the Fuel Sales Grants Bill 2000, this Bill confers an entitlement to grants to be paid to registered sellers of petroleum fuel for sales to end-users that are made at an eligible location. The amount of the grant is to be calculated according to a method prescribed in the regulations.
It goes on:
The financial impact of this measure is estimated at $500 million over four years. As the grants are entitlement based, the actual figure will vary depending on the total of eligible claims.
The first part of that statement says that the amount of the grant has to be calculated according to a method prescribed in the regulations. It is a very interesting set of circumstances, because we have not actually been able to identify yet where the 1c or the 2c will apply to, or in fact whether there is not a 3c a litre margin.
—Maybe in a Kellogg's box.
—That is possible, because I notice that the Treasurer said at one point:
Details on entitlement to the grant scheme, including the mechanisms for determining non-metropolitan and remote areas, along with the grant rates, will be prescribed in regulations to the legislation.
As Senator Sherry and Senator Cook pointed out, during the estimates process we asked a range of questions with regard to the conurbations or the lines on the maps where 1c will apply, what would determine the metropolitan area and the non-metropolitan area and how you then further determine remoteness in terms of how this will actually apply. We were finding it very difficult and in fact could not get any information. We were told the information would be forthcoming. The Treasurer also made a statement on 11 April. He said at that time:
We are using an established index that measures remoteness, and it applies from outside the built-up metropolitan area.
If it is so established, why couldn't we be given it and why couldn't we get responses to our questions during estimates? To actually work out your $500 million, there had to be some assessment of the number of litres that have been sold in the respective areas, remote or metropolitan. You had to do that to make any judgment at all. So I think that the Treasurer's statement is probably half accurate and that there is some information about. The problem with the information is that it is still very much untested and there is still a lot of concern about exactly where you draw the lines on the maps. I do not think they have really finalised it at all. That is why the bill actually says the amount `will vary depending on the total of eligible claims'.
Another aspect of that really relates to claims. What is the process here? We are told that there has been monitoring of a number of service stations throughout this country. I think the Treasurer said about 200; the evidence to the estimates committee was substantially more than that. I think there were about 8,300 service stations throughout the country, and we might find that up to half of these might be eligible for making a grants claim. I am not sure exactly what the circumstances will be—I suppose this will all become evident as time goes by—but it is very unfortunate that we are in a position where we have a proposal for legislation to go through this place and we have no idea about how it is really going to work; we cannot ask any questions about particular matters that relate to its operation. Going back to the compliance issue, we asked questions through the estimates process about the people actually administering this scheme—that is, the petrol retailers—and whether they are entitled to make some claim with regard to the administration costs associated with operating this grants scheme. Again, it was very unclear, although I thought the indication was that they would be entitled to make a claim for administrative costs and I thought—and I stand to be corrected on this, and maybe the minister when he gets up can actually deal with this matter—that there was an indication that they could make a claim and the cost of administration to the retailer would come out of the $500 million or whatever it might end up being.  
There were also some other issues that arose with regard to administration and whether or not the scheme could be rorted. The ACCC gave us a range of evidence that went to the possibility of rorting the scheme and, despite its best effort, I think there is a major concern that rorting is a real possibility. Will all this be passed on to the motorist? The real intention of this is to ensure that the cost ratio, the cost differential, between city and country prices—or indeed prices per se, because that is what it comes back to—and also the price of petrol will not increase as a result of the GST, and I will add a bit more to that in a moment. How do we actually guarantee that this gets passed on to the motorist, the consumer? It is going to be very difficult. If we look at all of the problems that we have had associated with fuel substitution and the total inability to even begin to address those issues, I cannot see at this point how you can ever guarantee that these costs are actually going to be passed on to the motorist and that the retailers are not going to be just taking extra profit. 
With regard to the cost impact on the consumer, we have had various statements over a period of time. I want to go back to some of those with regard to the cost of fuel as it relates to the introduction of the GST. In August 1998 the Prime Minister said:
The ordinary motorist will not pay any more for petrol. But, of course, they will not get that reduction. They will not pay any more. It won't go up. The price at the pump will be the same.
In September 1998—it was just a month later—the Treasurer said that no petrol price would rise as a result of the GST `anywhere'. That is a fairly strong and expansive statement—and I notice that Senator McGauran is nodding his head in agreement with that. We also had Mr Mark Vaile saying the same thing at about the same time, on 14 January. This issue must have worked a few people up into a bit of a fervour because on 14 January this year the financial services minister went one step further in respect of that. He said that petrol prices would actually fall. He said they would not go up, they would actually fall. I suppose it might have been part of the position of jockeying for advancement in the Howard government ministry. 
Now we come to our very noble Senator Kemp. On 8 February he actually said that the government would `stick to its policy'—we seem to be having great variation from falling petrol prices to no increase, to no increase anywhere—and that petrol prices `need not rise'. We are going backwards again now. `Need not rise'—there is no guarantee that it will not rise. Despite the Treasurer's commitment and the fact of the Prime Minister's commitment, Senator Kemp, being very much more conservative, said petrol prices `need not rise'. Of course, we then got—I think it was the next day—the Prime Minister on 9 February coming out and saying:
The imposition of the GST is not going to produce an increase in the price of petrol.
So we are back on to no increase again—not `need not rise' but no increase. Then with regard to the process it all started to gel, it all started to come out and it started to hit the government in the face that this was a major problem, and the Treasurer says, `Well, there are limits on this.' With regard to the `need not rise', the `will not rise' and the `and/or will fall' issue, how is it going to be the case that, with at least a six per cent increase in the CPI as a result of the GST, petrol prices will not go up? It is just not possible. Petrol prices will go up, and will go up quite substantially.
—Not in Collins Street.
—Probably not. Senator McGauran has probably got some arrangement there.
—Yes, a service station arrangement.
—You are going to have a buffer, and the buffer might be—
—The Volvo.
—Yes, for those with Volvo cars the petrol price need not rise. But, as I said, if you have an increase in the CPI of more than six per cent as a result of the GST, how is it that petrol prices will not go up? The Australian Automobile Association pointed out correctly the fact that, if you look at a 2c a litre increase—which I think is equivalent to a six per cent increase in the CPI; that actually bumps petrol prices up by about 2c a litre—the excise revenue that the government would get as a result of that would be about $400 million. 
It seems to me that there is a bit of a sleight of hand here. The government has made a promise to consumers on the price of petrol: `To offset the introduction of the GST, we're going to give you one or two cents a litre off depending on where you live. But in the meantime you are going to be smacked with a huge increase in the CPI that is going to cost you at least 2c a litre more for your petrol and is going to give us the money to pay you in the first place.' I think the suggestion of the Australian Automobile Association was right: the government ought to consider, at least for a period of time, moves to offset that. But there has been no indication of that—none whatsoever. When we started off with the ANTS package, the slogan was `A new tax system, not a new tax.' As if that hasn't been lost in the ether! It is a new tax, all right, and it is going to hit people very severely, particularly in respect of petrol.
I asked some questions on the petrol issue during the estimates process because I was curious about this whole monitoring issue—the administration of it and how we could make sure that people would not be ripped off. What has happened with regard to petrol prices in Queensland recently? Why has there been a significant jump in the price of petrol there? We know that Queensland does not have a state excise on petrol, but prices went up substantially there. I was unable to get from various officials any explanation as to why that occurred, so I find it difficult to accept that we are going to have in place an administrative process that will guarantee that consumers will not be ripped off. If occurrences in a state appear to be without any explanation and yet there are people who are supposed to be monitoring these things, then how is it that we cannot get an explanation? As I said earlier, how is it that we are yet to work out exactly where the lines on the maps will be?
Let us go back to the statements that have been made consistently by the Prime Minister, by the Treasurer and by Senator Kemp. Senator Kemp has probably been the most consistent of any of them—at least he has only had the one line, which is that prices `need not rise'. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister said, `I can only repeat what patently is our case; that is, we are going to honour our commitment.' I respect the Prime Minister for making that statement, but there is nothing in place to underpin it. There is no explanation that would give any comfort to anybody that that can actually be achieved—none whatsoever. So we are here debating legislation that is going to go through this place, and we are the people charged with the responsibility of overseeing the government's policy in this respect, yet we have no explanations on where the lines are, the administration of it and how it is going to work—nothing. It is deplorable that the government has that sort of approach and that it expects us to accept it on face value. You cannot do that, because of all of the other aspects of your legislation and the promises that you have made, none of which have ultimately been delivered.
—Wait till 1 July.
—Wait till 1 July! It is all going to happen, is it? The sky rockets are all going to go off on 1 July and it is all going to be hunky dory! It is all going to be okay! I would suggest to the minister that the `wait till 1 July' scenario is simply not good enough. People have a right to know that, come 1 July, these things are actually going to occur. It is not the `wait and see' theory here. It just does not work like that. And if the Treasurer were so certain that the $500 million—
—It's not $500 million.
—I will take that interjection. So it is not $500 million! Senator McGauran obviously knows more about it than the Treasurer or anyone else. Perhaps Senator McGauran will get up in a minute and explain to us what the figure is if it is not $500 million. It says $500 million in the explanatory memorandum here, so I am going to look forward to Senator McGauran's contribution and explanation as to exactly what it is. You can tell us where the lines on the maps are at the same time, and you can tell us how you are going to get the thing administered. You can tell us that you are going to guarantee that the consumers will get the benefit of this, which is something that we will all wait with bated breath to hear. The government might also address its mind to the CPI increase that will occur as a result of the GST, because this is all critical to the statements of the Prime Minister, of the Treasurer and indeed of Senator Kemp that prices `need not rise'. They are going to go up by at least 2c a litre as a result of the GST. There is no doubt about that. The government might like to address its mind to that and whether or not it is going to take any action in terms of delivering its promise—that is, the promise given from 1998 that petrol prices will not go up as a result of the GST. That is the challenge for the government. It is a challenge for the government to come in here, to explain this process, to make sure that people understand it and to make sure that it can carry out its commitments. You keep coming in here day after day and saying that you are delivering on them when in fact you are not. ",SENATE,<title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I rise to support Senator Cook's amendment and to talk in this debate about the bills. As has been explained by my colleagues, the coalition went to the last election saying that people who lived in what might be regional and rural Australia—or in what is now being defined in this legislation as non-metropolitan and remote Australia—would not be any worse off because of the introduction of the GST. However, from the points that have been put forward in the debate so far, people in regional and rural Australia know that they will be worse off under the GST. As Senator Murphy has so eloquently explained, the coalition spokesmen, from the Prime Minister through the Treasurer to the Assistant Treasurer, in one form or another said that petrol prices in regional and rural Australia would not be any worse after the introduction of the GST. As a result of their actions, they have tried to work out some sort of scheme which they hope will be a sop to country Australia. They hope that they will get themselves off the hook as a result of the introduction of this scheme.
As my colleagues have already explained, there are a number of deficiencies in this scheme on which we have sought information—questions we would like to see answered in the minister's reply. In particular there is the term `non-metropolitan and remote areas in Australia'; however, as far as I can see from the legislation, there is no definition of that. We had this problem with the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme as well. Fortunately, we now do have maps that determine what are the metropolitan and non-metropolitan parts of Australia. As has also been explained by my colleagues, they seem to be very much drawn up in terms of what might be marginal seats and the impact on those marginal seats in regional and rural Australia.
One of the difficulties still outstanding in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is the definition of `a journey'. The industry, the Taxation Office and the department of transport are still involved in determinations of what might be the definition of a journey because of the hotchpotch scheme that the government has introduced. As we have explained ad nauseam, if vehicles less than 20 tonnes leave a metropolitan area, go into a metropolitan area, make deliveries and then return to that metropolitan area, we have not been able to get succinct answers as to where and when the rebate will apply for that particular type of vehicle. Similarly, we are not sure whether a vehicle that comes from a non-metropolitan area, makes deliveries into a metropolitan area, picks up again in that metropolitan area and then proceeds to return to a non-metropolitan area in whatever time may be determined is eligible. We are not sure whether the journey is defined on a daily basis or by the time the vehicle returns to the non-metropolitan area.
—Blame the Democrats.
—I am afraid you are in government, Senator McGauran. You are the people who allowed this scheme to be introduced. You are confusing not only the road transport industry but also their clients and essentially the consumers in Australia. People will not know exactly where and when they will be able to make an application for this rebate so that it will mean, in effect, as you would argue, that the price of goods will come down. I will bet London to a brick on this one that shortly you will be advised that those prices will not be able to come down because, with any particular item, road transport costs—and I am only talking about road transport costs—represent anywhere between 27 per cent and 30 per cent of the cost of the item. It is a big gamble on the part of the government to think that there will be an impact on goods and services as a result of the introduction of this diesel fuel rebate, because I do not think there will be. I think you will find that the impact of that will be well and truly seen in terms of the consumer price index. Here we are, once again, dividing up our own land in terms of people having access to rebates or taxation exemptions, and we are leaving other parts of our country suffering through having to wear that additional taxation. 
We do not have a copy of the definition of what non-metropolitan and remote areas might be, but if you look at the guide of what the government did in terms of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, you can see that it is more attuned to the government's marginal seats campaign than anything to do with good economics. I will just point out one area. As I outlined during the debate on the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, we looked at towns just in this vicinity. Vehicles that are less than 20 tonnes and over four tonnes in the Canberra region are not eligible for the rebate. If you go to Queanbeyan, in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, you are eligible for the rebate. However—and I am not sure how we will define this—if you are a service station in Fyshwick maybe you will not be eligible for the petrol rebate. I wonder, if you are a petrol station in Queanbeyan, whether you will be eligible for this rebate.
Currently, if you drive down the road here to the Shell service station at Fyshwick, for leaded fuel you will pay 94.9c a litre and for unleaded fuel you will pay 91.9c. If you go across the border to the Mobil at Queanbeyan, which one of my staff was able to do this morning, you will find that leaded fuel costs 94.9c and unleaded fuel costs 91.9c. They are similar prices. However, under the determination of the government in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, you will find that Queanbeyan, in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, may be defined as non-metropolitan or remote. I do not know whether we could define it as remote, but it may be defined as non-metropolitan. I wonder how the service stations are going to react in Canberra when there is an incentive, if a city like Queanbeyan is to be defined as non-metropolitan, of maybe up to 6c or 7c a litre in rebate available to that region. What will the service stations in Canberra be doing? I will tell you what they will be doing: they will be closing down.
As the government should know, a number of road transport operators have said that they are going to move their base out of Fyshwick and into the non-metropolitan region of Queanbeyan, which seems to me just an extension of the industrial belt of Canberra. So you could have an adverse impact unless we see what is defined as non-metropolitan or remote areas in determination of this scheme.
We have seen in the legislation that it is going to cost about $500 million over four years, and it has come out in estimates that the implementation and setting up of this scheme—and the tax office has admitted this—is going to cost the tax office $19.6 million. So all around this hotchpotch of a goods and services tax is starting to cost a lot of money for Australians. We will wait with bated breath to see what the benefits will be, but I can tell you that they will not be much. Let us look at the implementation of this scheme—and let us say that we are looking at a figure of 6c or 7c a litre being discounted. Petrol prices in Liverpool in New South Wales have often been used for comparison, and currently unleaded fuel is worth 86.9c and leaded is 89.9c. In what may be termed `remote' Australia, at the Wilcannia service station in remote New South Wales unleaded fuel is 102.9c and leaded is 103.9c. If you go to Goulburn up the road from here, unleaded fuel is 89.9c and leaded is 92.9c. Let us say we take 7c a litre away from each of those prices and then add the GST. Currently, the Wilcannia unleaded is 102.9c. With the rebate of 7c and then adding the GST, that goes up to 105c. So the price is increased by about 2.6c a litre. The leaded fuel—which I would imagine a lot of people in regional and rural Australia are still using—will go from 103.9c to 106c a litre. Big deal! They must be bringing home the bacon with those increases in the fuel price. 
If some of the National Party senators moved out of their inner-city abodes, whether in Sydney or Melbourne, they might find that rural and regional people use a lot more fuel—petrol or diesel—than any other Australians. It is going to be a significant impost on them. With a vehicle that might take 60 litres when filled up—and they are going to do that at least three times a week—they are looking at paying at least another $10 or $12 a week to keep doing what they are doing now. And, as we have identified in a number of reports over the last few years, the level of incomes in regional and rural Australia is not as significant as it is in the metropolitan areas.
—Mr Costello wants to lower it even more.
—Of course he does. And of course that is supported by Senator McGauran, Senator Boswell and Senator Sandy Macdonald. They are lap-dogs here in the chamber who slavishly follow the Liberal Party philosophy of deregulation, to the detriment of their natural supporters. As I think Senator Sherry so aptly put it, what would Black Jack McEwen be doing now? He must be spinning in his grave. He must be disgusted with the compliance and the slavishness with which the National Party have laid down to their Liberal Party masters. 
—He would be proud we are in government.
—He would not be proud of you. He would be turning in his grave, Senator McGauran. He may be proud of you, Senator McGauran, for your achievements, but I do not think he would be very proud of that party that he set up.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you know as well as I do that this is going to be a regressive tax on people in regional and rural Australia. It will hurt them in the pocket and it will further diminish the standing of those people for the National Party and their Liberal Party masters. I support the amendment moved by Senator Cook, and I think it should be supported by the house.",SENATE,<title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-08,"—This is an amazing package of bills. Each of the three second reading speeches is on one sheet of paper, but most of them do not even fill a page. Yet this is a measure which, according to the explanatory memorandum, is going to cost $500 million over four years; $125 million is the estimate. I have to say the figure of $500 million shows that Treasury may well have advised the minister to throw a dart at a board and he hit 500—that is as good a guess as any.
I suspect the reason that these bills have got such a poor and limited explanation, with not even a page for each bill to introduce this measure, is that Treasury are running dead on this measure themselves. Treasury know that this is a policy outcome that has got an extraordinary number of holes in it. Any Treasury official from the rationalist school of economics—well trained at Sydney University or Chicago University, with a Friedmanite attitude—would say, `This is something we don't like, but our political masters have told us we have to prepare something. We will do the least amount possible to explain this measure. We don't want to have our fingerprints anywhere over it, because we know that, in a very short period of time, the measure won't meet the promise of the government to maintain the petrol prices in rural and regional Australia at levels that exist prior to the introduction of the GST; and, secondly, its administration is going to be a classic of maladministration, endless amendments and endless complaints.'
It will drive small business mad. It will drive Treasury and the Taxation Office berserk trying to administer this scheme. There will be people over in the Treasury building every night with cold towels around their heads and aspros in glasses of water trying to administer this scheme in a way that they can swear on their hearts that the money is being spent in the way the scheme is devised. 
—Blame the Democrats.
—Blame the Democrats, says the National Party. Goodness me! It is your policy to introduce the GST. Thank you very much, Senator McGauran. I have no doubt that the result of Benalla will be repeated all over Victoria if you go round saying your only defence is `blame the Democrats'. As a kid who grew up in Gippsland where the McGauran family owns half the pastoral areas, I cannot wait to tell some of my relatives that the policy of the National Party in Gippsland is `blame the Democrats'. I trust your brother will not be as dopey as you are and go round Gippsland campaigning if that is his only policy at the next election.
When you look at an outline given of the explanation, it is extraordinary. Let us just take the second reading speech. I will not go to any other comment in the press or the very good remarks by my colleagues in estimates exposing the shortcomings of the scheme. I will just use the government's own words on the proposal and how it is going to be administered:
Eligible locations and the rate of grants to be paid are to be prescribed in regulations.
I am informed by my colleagues that we have not seen the regulations. They are going to do this all by prescribed regulation. Are they in the bill? Are they attached to the bill?
—You never see regulations until the bill goes through.
—That is not true. It would have helped a little bit if you had given us some general idea of what the regulations would be. The reason you cannot even give us an idea might be that Treasury cannot even devise them or are not even thinking about them yet, or you do not want to embarrass yourself with this bill in the parliament by giving us some idea of what these complicated regulations will be.
 (Senator George Campbell)—Order! I would remind the senators we are in a second reading debate. We are not in committee.
—The committee is going to be a farce, too. I would trust the Department of the Treasury is not so incompetent that it has not started to draw up some draft regulations. If that is the advice the minister is now being given from the advisers table, this just proves even further that Treasury is running dead on this measure and is going to do everything it can to walk away from it. The second reading speech goes on:
Further details about the entitlement criteria and how to apply for payments under the scheme will be provided in advance of the implementation before 1 July 2000.
It is 8 June today. Are they going to provide this in the next three weeks? I see an adviser is kindly shaking his head, I think in agreement. Why can't they provide them now while we are debating it here, so we can get some idea of what these criteria—
—These days you have to put in software to administer it.
—Yes. This is astonishing—three weeks to go. I suppose Senator Kemp has gone over there to chastise the advisers for their embarrassment and to tell them not to show their embarrassment to the Senate. The second reading speech continues:
The scheme will provide for advances to be made against grant entitlements. These will address cash flow concerns.
I bet you there will be cash flow concerns. Then it says:
Fuel prices will be monitored in the lead up to 1 July 2000 and fuel retailers will be expected to pass on to consumers the benefit of the fuel sales grant.
It says `in the lead up'. Can we get an idea when you started monitoring prices? Was it today or was it three months ago? When did Treasury start monitoring prices so that you can make some assessment of what you are going to pay? I would appreciate, and I think the Senate would also appreciate, knowing how the monitoring has been going and when it started. Even the National Party might like to know for its constituency—what is left of it. Did you pick sample areas or did you do the whole of Australia? Did you go to every petrol station in non-metropolitan Australia and monitor them in some way? Did you ask them to do it on the Internet, mail it in, send out a carrier pigeon— 
—Just get it from the Democrats.
—Of course. Just get it from the Democrats. Blame the Democrats. The speech continues:
This Bill, the Fuel Sales Grants Bill, is one of 3 Bills that are required to implement the Fuel Sales Grants scheme. Together with regulations contemplated by the Bill—
Still being contemplated. What are you doing over there, Minister, you and your department? How is the contemplation going? Is this some sort of transcendental meditation you have going in the contemplation of the bill? It goes on:
It will confer the entitlement to the grant on eligible claimants. 
The provisions of the Fuel Sales Grants Bill are to commence from Royal Assent. The Government anticipates that the Bills will be enacted well before 1 July 2000—
we are at 8 June; you have three weeks to get it before the Governor-General—
so as to avoid any undue delay in implementing the scheme.
That is the end of the second reading speech. In the second reading speech there is no policy justification anywhere. This is why I believe Treasury are running dead. They are doing everything to leave this minister to hang in the wind and slowly twist. One of the main reasons I chose to speak on this bill is that when I was Customs minister I was responsible for the administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.
—Don't remind us of your performance.
—I will remind you, Minister, because you are now responsible for the administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.
—What did the Auditor's report say?
—He has done it again. Senator McGauran cannot help himself with his assistance. That is what I was just coming to, you gold-plated dill. I was just coming to—
 (Senator George Campbell)—Withdraw.
—Withdraw `gold-plated' or `dill'? 
—Senator Schacht, you know what is unparliamentary. 
—I withdraw, but I thank the senator for his assistance. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme in its present form, subject to various amendments, was brought in by the Fraser government in the early 1980s. About every two or three years when it was reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office, irrespective of who was in government, what did the Auditor-General consistently find? He found that no minister, no government, could guarantee that the money paid out under the fuel rebate scheme was meeting the policy objectives of the scheme. It was impossible to guarantee—it was running at something like $1.5 billion—that the money was going to be spent the way the policy intended. It was impossible to guarantee that the diesel fuel provided for non-off road use was being used for off-road use. That consistently was the Auditor-General's comment. He was saying that the government is appropriating money for the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme but in the administration of it, because of the nature of the scheme, you cannot guarantee that the will of the parliament in appropriating the money is being met. 
I put some amendments through to tighten up some aspects of the scheme and was roundly condemned by the Liberal Party as being too tough. Within a short period of the coalition being in government you also were moving to tighten up the loopholes, as commented on by the Auditor-General. You did it to try and save money; we tried to do it to save the taxpayers money and properly administer it. 
This scheme makes the diesel fuel rebate scheme seem like an absolute model of detail, an example that we should all hold up of how to do it. That is in comparison to what you are outlining in this bill, where the regulations are unknown, there is no time scale about the preparation, and the second reading speech I have just exposed as a one-page nonsense. The second reading speech for the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Bill is six sentences long, with five dot points. For a $125 million a year expenditure that is the best you can do? The second reading speech for the third bill, the Fuel Sales Grants (Consequential Amendments) Bill, is a classic—five sentences; six, if you include `I commend the bill'. You are saying to the Senate and in public administration terms that this proposal to expend an expected $500 million over four years can be explained in those three second reading speeches. Consider all the evidence before the government, before the treasury department and before the taxation department, from the people who have administered the diesel fuel rebate, which you took from Customs into Taxation, go and speak to any of those people who have had experience with the diesel fuel rebate, and they will know that this scheme is wide open to rorting.  
Some of the rorting will be by accident because I suspect many of the small businesses will not be able to meet the compliance arrangements or will misunderstand the compliance arrangements. The next thing is that the taxation department will be going around trying to penalise those small businesses. There will be screams all over the bush. Senator McGauran might say, `Blame the Democrats' but they will have to blame the government because the government is implementing it. Then there will be moves to reduce the penalties, to loosen the compliance, to meet the political problem of the National Party and rural Liberal members. As soon as you make it any looser, more of the money will disappear and not meet the objective. You will not know where the money is going. You will not know whether the supposed policy objective, which you outlined in a couple of lines, is being met. 
Then the Auditor-General will do his or her first report. It will be a classic report which we will have great fun with if we are still in opposition. If we are in government we will have to work out how to deal with the Auditor-General's report, how to deal with this terrible, badly thought out scheme. The Auditor-General's first report, I safely predict now, will be an outstanding piece of criticism of this scheme. Treasury and Taxation officials will squirm at estimates as they try to explain how the scheme went wrong, how they cannot trace the money, how people got away with it and how they then chased down a few unfortunate small business people who did not know how to administer it. In the end, the Treasurer's promise—that petrol prices in regional Australia will not be any higher than before the introduction of the GST—will still not be guaranteed. But in the meantime you may well have wasted in four years $500 million. 
So, Minister, I look forward to hearing some explanations. I would like to know how the round figure of $500 million was reached. Will Treasury be honest and say they have no idea about it? It is such a round figure. You would have thought Treasury might have disguised it a bit and told the minister: `We will make it $531 million, or $498 million.' This is another sign that Treasury believes this is a stupid scheme—saying to the minister: `It will cost about $500 million', a rounded out figure. Treasury has made no attempt to put to the minister and to the government any reasonable, rational reasons for this scheme. They have left the government with the most minimum explanation, which exposes the fact that this scheme will not work. It is an embarrassment to the officers concerned that they have been forced to do it. When you read the second reading speeches you know that. Anyone who has had any experience dealing with Treasury will know that they know how to skin a cat over in Treasury—to do a minister in, in their own subtle way. This ain't very subtle, of course. They are doing the minister and the government in in a very big, unsubtle way, saying: `Treasurer, you are on your own about this. We don't want much to do with it.' So I support the amendment moved by Senator Cook. I look forward to the explanation by the government. Above all else, I look forward to the first Auditor's report on this scheme, when he absolutely puts it to the sword.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-08,"—The government will not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook.
—You want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
—I do not know whether people really listen very much to Senator Schacht these days. I guess a few people do, but not many. Senator Schacht, as usual, wanders in; he was not on a speaking list. The trouble is that I do not think anyone told Senator Schacht that the Labor Party are actually supporting the bills before the chamber. I would have to say that opposition members would look through your speech and say, `Gosh, hasn't someone told Senator Schacht that we are actually supporting these bills?' I was just about to give a comment to your advisers: `Could you give Senator Schacht a note just so that he gets back on message.' It is perfectly all right, as it often happens, that Labor senators come in and say, `We are supporting this bill; but this bill should do this and that.'
—We are quite happy for you to build your own gallows.
 (Senator George Campbell)—Order, Senator Schacht! Senator Kemp, would you address your comments through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I greatly appreciate your protection on these matters. It is an unusual thing that you, Senator George Campbell, would be providing protection to me in this chamber—but I note that for the historical record. I want you to know that it is appreciated. Senator Schacht, of course, was not told that the opposition was supporting this bill, and we appreciate that support. Unlike Senator Schacht, I will be charitable. We appreciate the support for these very important measures which are going through the chamber, hopefully, today. These measures are designed to give effect to the government's commitment that fuel prices need not rise as a result of the new tax system. That commitment will in part be achieved through a reduction in fuel excise to offset the impact of GST on fuel prices. It is perhaps worth remembering that this will be the first discretionary reduction in fuel excise by any government since metric conversion in the early 1970s.
— Discretionary reductions! The prices are going up!
—We remember, Senator Schacht, as you spoke and complained about fuel prices—and all of us are concerned about fuel prices—that the trouble is that you have got form. You told us that you were the minister who was responsible for excise. I remember, Senator, that you held a ministry in the Keating government. I have to say that my memory is that you were often a minister in deep trouble—and, rightly so, given the wildness with which you approach issues.
—There was, Senator Schacht, you will remember, in the light of your comments, a hike of some 5c in excise between 1993 and 1996 under the former government. I am not sure, with the complaints that you were making about this, whether you complained at the time. This was a very substantial hike and, of course, it was not mentioned in any election campaign. The government is reducing the excise to ensure that the pump price need not rise. And we need to understand that for business this represents a fuel cost reduction, which is quite contrary to the impression that some members of the Labor Party may have given in their remarks. For business this represents a fuel cost reduction, given, of course, that businesses can claim an input tax credit in respect of the GST paid on petrol and diesel used for business purposes.
The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, established under these bills, addresses the fact that the excise reduction would need to be greater in rural and regional areas in order to offset the effect of the GST. For constitutional reasons, excise rates must be common across the Commonwealth, and for that reason additional assistance to rural and regional Australia will be provided by way of a grant. The grant will be paid at the retail stage, typically to service stations and other retail outlets. In that sense, this scheme differs from schemes operated by various states and territories which have paid subsidies to oil companies and distributors in an attempt to reduce the pump price of petrol and diesel.  
The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will be prescribed under the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's price exploitation legislation. The ACCC already have in place a system for monitoring fuel prices and will use this as a basis for monitoring the impact of the scheme. The amendments moved by the government today will ensure that the ACCC are empowered to receive information as to the recipients of grants under this scheme, which will assist the ACCC in their price monitoring efforts. We appreciate that the non-government parties will be supporting that amendment. The government are always proud to assist rural and regional Australia—indeed, all Australians. Quite contrary to the impression that Senator Schacht attempted to create, this is a very important bill; it is good legislation; and it shows the government's commitment to motorists and businesses in rural and remote Australia.
—It is not what Treasury says.
—The interjection of Senator Schacht reminded me that there was an unfortunate attack on officers of the Treasury.
—No. It was said in a rather facetious and unpleasant manner. I think the Treasury officers are always loyal to the government of the day. They carry out their duties in a conscientious manner. To suggest that Treasury is somehow setting up governments was most unfortunate. It was an unfortunate slur on the officers who are carrying out their duties.
Let me now briefly turn to some of the matters that were raised during the second reading debate. There was a very wide range of issues—of which, I might say, most have been extensively debated and dealt with elsewhere. Senators Cook and—from memory—Senator Sherry and, indeed, Senator Schacht discussed the details in the bill and were unhappy about what they saw as a lack of detail. The Treasurer has already announced the broad framework for the grants, and more details on boundaries and rates will be announced soon. The bills provide for regulations to define boundaries and rates. These regulations cannot be made until the bills are passed. A detailed registration kit is being mailed to petrol retailers this week and has also been available—
—Why can't it be available for us? We shouldn't have to go to the petrol stations. Why can't we get the details?
—In this week there is only tomorrow left.
—The advice I have received is that a detailed registration kit is being mailed to petrol retailers this week and it has also—
—Tell us now, then.
—Instead of interjecting, if they listened until the sentence was completed, it would satisfy their curiosity. It has also been available on the ATO web site since last week. Given the huge interest that everyone—
—Where is it in the second reading speech then?
—None of it is in here.
—Order! Senator Kemp, please continue.
—I am actually responding to issues which were raised by senators in the second reading debate. If they do not want me to respond to those issues I will sit down. I imagine that they raised issues and that they sought my response. I said, just to repeat it, that Senators Cook, Sherry and Schacht were worried about what they saw as a lack of detail in the bill, and that is what I am now responding to. Senator Schacht waves the second reading speech around, as though he makes some telling point. You are a very strange senator, Senator Schacht, I have to say.
 (Senator George Campbell)—Order! Senator Schacht! Senator Kemp, would you address your remarks to the chair? Perhaps if you focus on your comments in relation to the bill, we may get this matter over with quickly. 
—Indeed. As for the grants in detail, as I said, a detailed registration kit is being mailed to petrol retailers this week. I repeat myself: it has also been available on the ATO web site since last week. These grants are an important initiative by the government, and I believe they are widely supported in rural and regional Australia—quite contrary to any impression that Senator Schacht may have raised. The issue raised by Senator Ridgeway, who is handling this bill for the Democrats, was what he saw as the difficulty in ensuring that grants are passed on to consumers.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Please continue, Minister.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I greatly appreciate the protection you are affording the minister during his important response to the second reading debate.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Kemp, it would help if you continued with your comments rather than responding to the interjections.
—I am not responding at all, actually. I am just waiting for their comments to cease. I have actually taken your ruling and am accepting it. Let me make the point that the ACCC has strong powers under the price exploitation provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC will assess whether the grant is passed on by using the net dollar margin rule. The amendment that I will be moving today clarifies that the ATO can pass relevant information on grant recipients to the ACCC so that they can actively monitor the impact of the grant. Let me say, in conclusion to Senator Ridgeway's comments, the ACCC has been monitoring fuel prices across the country and has considerable data to assist in price monitoring.
In conclusion, we welcome the support that the bill will receive in the chamber, although we do not welcome the accompanying comments that many Labor senators have indulged themselves in—despite all the information which has already been put out on the table. The government has said that, with the introduction of the GST, the government will reduce excise on petrol and diesel so that the pump prices of these commodities need not rise. I reiterate that for businesses, fuel costs will fall substantially under tax reform, due to the availability of, among other things, the GST input tax credit and the expansion of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In fact, under the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme, the cost of diesel in eligible vehicles will be reduced by some 24c per litre. I would have thought that all of us would have strongly welcomed that measure and the commitment that the government has made to attempting to cut costs to business, particularly in rural and regional Australia. This is a substantial effective reduction in excise.
I listened, as I always do, very carefully to what Labor senators said and I checked with my advisers as to whether anyone—including Senator Sherry, who often speaks for Labor on tax policy; which we appreciate—had given any assurances that the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme would continue under any alternative government. I was a bit surprised that that commitment was not given, because this is providing a huge effective cut in diesel fuel prices. I give some notice that I shall be pursuing that guarantee in the debates, not only today but in future debate in this chamber. I put that on notice. As I said, we will not be supporting the second reading amendment by Senator Cook.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Cook's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FUEL SALES GRANTS BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-06-08,"—We have got approximately seven minutes before we move on to other business. As a result of yesterday's unfortunate experience when we asked a series of questions of the minister that were germane and apposite to the bill which he refused to answer, the government had to rearrange its program in order to ensure that the preceding piece of legislation got through. I will restate the five questions that we asked the minister yesterday. If the minister does not want to answer them, maybe he should just say, `I refuse to answer.' That way I will be able to ask the rest of my questions. If that is the response from the minister, that he does not want to answer these questions, we can probably proceed more quickly in relation to this bill.
Those who were involved in this debate yesterday—Senators Greig and O'Brien, both of whom are here—could probably recite the questions along with me but I will restate them for the Senate: (1) will the government undertake an analysis of the impact of the GST on local government; (2) if that analysis shows that the GST is having a detrimental impact on local government, what will the government do to address it; (3) will the government address the $15 million it took out of financial assistance grants in 1997-98 in the first Costello budget, which has not been put back because of the freezing of the escalation factor in that budget, which has now resulted in total cuts of $61.4 million, and will the money be put back; (4) does the ACCC have jurisdiction over local government in relation to policing it on what it regards as improper rate rises or what it regards as improper rises of fees; (5) will the minister explain why the local government incentive program was underspent by $1 million this financial year?",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-08,"—Again, I make my position clear. If there are questions on the bill before the Senate, I will answer them, as I did yesterday with Senator Forshaw's question. If Senator Mackay wants to waste the time of this Senate in asking estimates type questions, three of which she asked in the estimates not less than two weeks ago, then she can pursue that time wasting procedure. I will not be part of it. I invite Senator Mackay to ask me those questions either at estimates or at question time. Senator, you have not had a question at question time since 19 October last century, so you have a bit of goodwill there. You must get a turn every now and again, and that is some six months ago. Say that is 12 weeks here, say four days a week and that is 48 questions you could perhaps do in question time. 
—Why don't you answer the questions?
—I will answer them. I will answer any question you want at question time, Senator Mackay, because that is where they are asked. If you have questions about this bill, as Senator Forshaw did yesterday, I will happily, with the assistance of my advisers, answer those questions on the bill, as I did with Senator Forshaw. But, if what you want to do is rerun the estimates committee and ask questions—three of which you asked two weeks ago in estimates—and waste the time of the Senate, please go ahead but do not expect me to participate. So, if there are questions on the bill, I will happily answer them. I will happily answer them as I did with Senator Forshaw who, although he is not the shadow minister, had the intelligence to work out what a question is that relates to the bill. He asked the question about the Treasurer's powers which are referred to in the bill, he was given a response and I assume he was satisfied with that. Now, Senator, if you have questions on the bill, then you ask them and you will get a response. If you do not know what the bill says, please get some advice—from your senior minister, from the clerks or from your advisers—that can explain to you what the bill means, what we are debating and what the clauses are. But, if you want to ask questions about whether the ACCC can investigate councils, that is not mentioned in this bill, Senator. That is not.
—But the GST is involved.
—The answer is quite clearly yes, but it is not mentioned in the bill. It is not mentioned in the bill and I am not going to participate in pursuing estimates type questions here. There is a procedure where you can do that. I do not know how the Labor Party run their question time procedures, but I would say you have 48 opportunities to ask questions at question time.
—On a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: the minister is clearly attempting to talk this out. This is an absolutely pathetic attempt to talk this out. He does not want his bill to go through.
 (Senator Bartlett)—That is not a point of order, Senator.
—Okay, on a further point of order: Mr Temporary Chairman, are the five questions I asked the minister out of order in relation to this bill?
—It is not my role to order a question in or out of order. It is for the minister to respond as he chooses.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I am desperate to get this bill through, so is every council in Australia. All 700-odd councils are desperate to get this bill through. The Labor Party have indicated they are in favour, the Democrats have indicated they are in favour, and the bill should pass so that those 700-plus local councils can get their financial assistance grants. Instead of that, the shadow minister persists in asking estimates type questions that have absolutely nothing to do with this bill. There is a minute to go—no party has any objection, we can finish the committee stage, get the bill passed in the next 60 seconds and get the money out to councils in Australia.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-06-08,"—Minister, these are not estimates type questions. We will continue to ask these questions, the questions we have sought advice from the Clerk on. They are in order. They are related to the bill. These are questions that local government wants an answer to. You will not answer questions in estimates. You will not answer questions on your own budget bills. You will not answer questions when legislation comes before this chamber in relation to your own portfolio. Have a go at it. You have a few hours before the bill comes back on. We will be here until we get some answers on behalf of local government in Australia. So go away and have a bit of a think about it, get some advice from your public servants and your advisers in relation to this and try to answer these questions. I have been specifically asked to ask these questions here today by a number of councils. If you are refusing your responsibility in relation to answering these questions, my belief is that you should resign your commission and get out of that portfolio. If you do want to stay in that portfolio, do your job and answer the questions. 
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I rise to indicate that the opposition supports the passage of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment Bill 2000. In doing so, it is important to very briefly put on the record the history of this legislation. The impact of this bill will be to remove a two-year sunset clause, which expires at the end of June this year, from the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999. The Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act was a piece of legislation that replaced a number of previous acts, including the Live-stock Transactions Levy Act, which was passed by this parliament back in 1997. 
Honourable senators will recall—I hope they do, taking a deep interest in rural matters as we all should—that a package of some 17 bills was dealt with back in December 1997. Those bills related to the restructure and reform of the levy collection system within the meat and livestock industry. At that time, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee handed down a report on one of those bills, the Live-stock Transactions Levy Bill 1997. The unanimous recommendation of the committee at that time was that that particular bill be withdrawn and that a roundtable of negotiations take place between the various interest groups within the industry—those from the Sheepmeat Council, those from the Council of Livestock Agents and a range of other groups. The reason for that was that there were various differences of opinion as to how the levy should be structured and how it should be calculated. Some believed that it should be calculated on a per head basis, others believed that it should be an ad valorem system and others thought it should be a mixture of both.
As I said, at the time, the committee unanimously recommended that the bill be withdrawn and that industry be consulted so as to hopefully come up with an agreed position. However, despite the differences within the industry, the overwhelming view of those in the industry was that they wanted the legislation passed at that time in its then form and that they would continue to see how the system worked. Because it was a money bill, the opposition put forward the proposition that a two-year sunset clause be inserted into the legislation. That sunset clause would expire at the end of June 2000. The purpose of that was to enable the system of levy collections to operate during the intervening period. The parties would be able to monitor how it worked and whether or not it was successful, and then there would be a specific requirement upon the government to come back into the parliament with further legislation to amend the bill, to implement another system of collection if that was what the industry desired or to review the sunset clause. We are advised that the industry has monitored the system and that it has agreed that it would be appropriate to continue with the current method. Accordingly, we need to remove the sunset clause from the legislation. That is the purpose of this bill, and on that basis we are happy to support it.
In conclusion, I want to put on the record that it was an opposition initiative that this process occur. We are very pleased to be able to say that it was picked up by the government and agreed to. It has resulted in a situation where the industry has had the opportunity to assess the system of levy collections and has been able to come to a unified position. So we support the legislation that is before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-06-08,"—The reasons for the necessity of this bill have been provided in the second reading speech of my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on 13 April. It is quite critical for the sunset clause in schedule 18 of the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 to be repealed so that levy arrangements can continue for the sheep, lamb and goat industries. We need to enact this bill by 30 June this year. I welcome the support of the opposition for this very important amendment, and I am very pleased that it has had unopposed progress through the House and the Senate. All the issues which were raised on the original consideration have been addressed in the Sheepmeat Council report, and the Wool Council had no objections. It must be very gratifying for members of these industries to see that they are doing reasonably well at the moment. In the case of the lamb industry, this has been in spite of a hefty US tariff rate quota regime that commenced in July last year. In the case of the sheepmeat industry, I am pleased to report that livestock exports have resumed to Saudi Arabia, which was our largest live sheep market in the 1980s. 
The sheep, lamb and goat industries are very important to the economic health of many parts of rural and regional Australia. It follows that those industries should be provided with every opportunity for further improving and developing their opportunities. Promotion, research and development, and animal health are vital elements in the future for each of those industries. The enactment of this bill will ensure the orderly continuation of each of those elements, thus allowing the sheep, lamb and goat industries to attain the full extent of their potential.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-08,"—The opposition supports this bill, but there is a matter which I want to discuss in the context of the bill. Australia has great heroes, both in the armed forces and in civilian life, and we are entitled to be proud of them. Among those who have been at the forefront of producing heroes in civil life are the firefighters. They have fought fires, both in the cities and in the bush. What I am going to say is in the context of Victoria, but I think we pay tribute as a parliament to firefighters throughout Australia. There have been some dramatic fires that have occurred in Victoria. There was the fire known as Black Thursday, which took place in February 1851 and about which Manning Clarke wrote with great eloquence, as he was able to do generally. His prose persists forever. There was Black Friday in January 1939, which I remember. That dates me. One which I remember very well was Ash Wednesday in February 1983, which caused great damage to, amongst other places, Anglesea, a place where I go often, particularly at Christmas time. I think it produced the highest number of fatalities of any fire in Australia.
There was another fire that took place on 2 December 1998 near Linton, which is a town in Victoria near Geelong. On that occasion there were five men who went from Geelong to fight that fire at Linton, in the tradition of the firefighters who fought these other fires I have talked about. They did what many Victorians had done prior to them in Victoria and what many Australians had done in Australia prior to that. Unfortunately, those people were caught in the fire and perished most tragically near Linton. I am sure the parliamentary secretary, Senator Patterson, who is present in the chamber and is also a Victorian, will join me in saying, as will everybody here, that these were great men. The firefighters were: Gary Vredeveldt, who was aged 47; Jason Thomas, aged 25; Stuart Davidson, aged 28; Chris Evans, aged 27; and a young man of 17, Matthew Armstrong. These were people who carried on the proud line of firefighters we have had in Victoria and elsewhere. I want to acknowledge their great deeds today and to express the great sympathy that their families and the other people associated with them are properly entitled to.  
What has this to do with the bill? It has this to do with the bill—and I thank Mr Gavan O'Connor, the member for Corio, for drawing this to my attention; he has said much about this in the other place from time to time. Following that tragedy, a trust was set up and people who were sympathetic to what had happened contributed to it. The contributions that were made to the trust were substantial. At that time, this government said, `Yes, contributions to this trust will be tax deductable.' That tax deductibility is provided for in this bill that is before the chamber now. I do not want to be partisan about this or unduly critical, because we do not use occasions such as this to be critical. I am told by Mr O'Connor that it would have helped if this provision had been brought in earlier and it may have made things a lot easier than they have been. I simply put that forward.
It may be a thing for all of us to remember, whether we are in government or in opposition—and it is something for the Labor Party to remember when it comes into government—that, although in the overall view of things a trust fund is not a great issue in terms of the economy, or in terms of fiscal policy, this trust fund represents a proper outflow of compassion from the community to people who have been caught in tragic circumstances. We as a parliament ought to remember that those issues of the heart and the soul are issues that ought to call for a response from this parliament to accommodate them. In other words, it should be not only fiscal and monetary policy that guides us but also matters of compassion. This may well have been an example where the parliament could have passed the legislation that is contained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 10) 1999 earlier than, in fact, we have in this place.
No doubt the parliamentary secretary who is in this place at the moment and who is also a Victorian would agree with what I say. I am glad to have had the opportunity to have mentioned this tragic event. No doubt bushfires will occur in the magnificent state of Victoria in the future, but it is always worth while remembering the people who fight them, and fight them with such gallantry.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 10) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-06-08,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 10) 1999 makes amendments to the income tax law and to other laws to give effect to a number of measures: restructuring of certain managed investment schemes, film licensed investment companies, Cyclones Elaine and Vance Trust Account, mining and quarrying balancing adjustments, and transfer of interest in petroleum products. 
As Senator Cooney has pointed out, there is also provision here for the tax deductibility of the Linton Trust Fund. As Senator Cooney mentioned, it is important for my state of Victoria, particularly the people of the Geelong region, because it will allow deductions for gifts made to the Linton Trust. As Senator Cooney mentioned, it was established to provide assistance to the families of the five firefighters: Third Lieutenant Stuart Davidson; Firefighter Gary Vredeveldt; Firefighter Jason Thomas; Firefighter Matthew Armstrong—and Senator Cooney mentioned that he was only 17 but he was actually on his first firefighting effort; and a third generation firefighter, Chris Evans. 
Just after the tragedy I actually spoke very briefly on the adjournment debate to convey condolences on behalf of the chamber to the families of those firefighters of the Geelong West Urban Fire Brigade and also to mention that Andrew Joyce, one of my staff members, who is in the chamber as my adviser today, trained with three of those young men and was a member of the Geelong West Urban Fire Brigade. We forget not only the families of those people who were so tragically taken but also those people who have worked with them, who have grown up with them, who have trained with them and also those who lose best mates as a result. It has an impact not just on family but also on friends and the whole firefighting community.
I know personally just what it meant to Andrew when those five men died. He now is an active member of the fire brigade here in the ACT. They give up enormous amounts of time. They go out in the middle of the night; they risk their lives and sometimes their lives are taken in ensuring safety for the community. We do have to respect and value what the volunteer firefighters throughout Australia have done. We have just had a minor amendment made in one of the taxation laws on the diesel fuel rebate as a result of Andrew Joyce pointing out to us some of the issues that might occur with refuelling fire tankers. So it pays to have people on one's staff who have had wide community experience because they can bring their knowledge to the policy process.
As Senator Cooney said, these men were taken from us tragically. The Linton Trust was established to provide assistance to the families of the five firefighters who died fighting bushfires in Victoria on 2 December 1998. Senator Cooney pointed out that it has taken some time. One of the problems is that, when an event such as this occurs, people are moved to be very generous. Sometimes they set up a trust and then the legislation has to follow. Of course, at the moment we are involved in some of the largest taxation changes in Australia's history. That has probably meant that this legislation has been delayed more than it ought to have been. There is a problem when a trust is set up for a special purpose in that it has to be legislated for. Despite the very best intentions of those people, sometimes they get ahead of the process. This legislation will mean that gifts made to the trust after 2 December 1998 and before 3 December 2000 will be deductable. I would like to commend the efforts of my colleagues in the Senate. Senator Cooney has mentioned his colleague. The member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur, in the other House also has a keen interest in seeing this aspect of the bill pass through both houses as speedily as possible.
The amendments will also be made to extend, for a period of four months, the time in which donations to the National Nurses' Memorial Trust will be tax deductable. An extension of time has been granted to the trust so that it can raise additional funds for the construction of the memorial. In addition, the amendments will give tax exempt status to non-profit organisations which promote the development of fishing and/or aquaculture resources. The income tax law grants income tax exempt status to non-profit organisations that promote the development of a number of primary and secondary industries. The government believes that fishing and/or aquaculture organisations should receive the same taxation concessions, and the exemptions will apply for 1999-2000 and later years of income. Even in what might have been a dry old tax bill, we still see a part of the social fabric of Australia in the incredible voluntary contribution that people make in Australia, particularly in emergency services. I commend the bill to the house.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-08,"—by leave—The government announces today that it has decided to undertake the evacuation of Australian and other approved nationals from Honiara. In the light of further deterioration in the security situation in and around Honiara, the Australian High Commissioner, Dr Martin Sharp, has requested the evacuation of Australian citizens and other nationals. HMAS Tobruk has been tasked with carrying out this evacuation and will arrive in Honiara later today. The government had diverted HMAS Tobruk from its transit from Bougainville to Vanuatu two days ago to take a position off the Solomon Islands, to provide assistance in the evacuation of Australian nationals if required.
The safety of Australians is a prime concern of the government. This evacuation is intended to ensure that Australians are not caught up in the violence now occurring around Honiara. I would urge as many Australians and other nationals as possible to take this opportunity to evacuate from the Solomon Islands. HMAS Tobruk will only be responsible for the safe evacuation of people who are in danger and will not be involved in any other security operation. The government remains very concerned at the security deterioration in Honiara and urges all parties to negotiate a cease-fire without delay. This would be a necessary precursor to resumption of the ongoing peace process sponsored by the Commonwealth Secretariat. Australia's objective has always been to assist the Solomon Islands to deal with its own problems by peaceful and democratic means.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-08,"—My question is directed to Senator Herron in his capacity representing the Minister for Aged Care. Can the minister confirm that 78 of the former employees of the Riverside Nursing Home were owed $320,000 when the facility was closed by the government on 6 March this year? Can he explain why the Minister for Aged Care has not even bothered to respond to three requests from the ANF calling on the Commonwealth to take some responsibility for those employees' entitlements? Now that media attention has shifted from Riverside, is the government hoping that the 78 employees will simply go away? Don't the former staff of Riverside deserve much better, particularly since some of them were responsible for reporting the poor care and the kerosene bath incident to the appropriate authorities? What signal does this shabby treatment of these workers send to other health workers about reporting poor care in our nursing homes? When will the government provide some justice to those former employees?

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-06-08,"—I thank Senator Evans for the question because this is a concern of the minister in relation to both the residents of Riverside Nursing Home and the former employees. The government has done everything possible, as you know, to relocate the residents from the Riverside Nursing Home. That was initially started over a month ago. Those residents who remained had case managers assigned to them. The relocation of residents from St Vincents commenced on 4 April and 49 residents have now been moved. Suitable places are being located for the remaining two residents who had been shifted to St Vincents. There were reports, as Senator Evans would be aware, of the former residents' possessions being sold and that is being investigated by the department. Only one item belonging to a resident was in fact sold. That item had been left behind by a resident.
The problems associated with the nurses at Riverside have been referred on and the department is investigating to see how they can be ameliorated, because it is a very serious concern.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ray today, relating to the provision of electoral roll details to the Australian tax Office.
This morning at 9 o'clock, Slater and Gordon, Sydney, delivered on behalf of Senator Faulkner and me letters of demand on both the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and the Australian Electoral Commissioner demanding that they desist from their planned mail-out using the electronic mail list supplied by the AEC to all Australian electors. I am very gratified that, 23 hours before the deadline we set had run out, the government has caved in after a week of obstructionism and abuse directed at Senator Faulkner and me for raising this particular issue. I well recall the estimates committee that Senator Ellison mentioned today. I well remember the Electoral Commissioner shouting at Senator Faulkner and me, `Show me the law where it says I am wrong. You show me in legislation where I am wrong.' The Solicitor-General, in this very well-written piece of advice, has shown the Electoral Commissioner where he is wrong—game, set and match against the Electoral Commissioner.
It is not just the Electoral Commissioner who entered the lists here; the tax commissioner said that it was legal. The tax commissioner offered up to the estimates committee his legal advice. Twenty minutes later, after cross-examination, he withdrew that offer. To his credit, he said he would seek some further advice. But of course in his media release of 25 May, Senator Ellison enters the lists, criticising us for raising these issues in the estimates committee. The most significant thing of course—
—It was the way you did it.
—What rubbish, Senator. We were misled on these committees. We were not told the truth. There was no public announcement. It was only our cross-examination that brought these facts to light. The government was never going to fess up—but you did. You fessed up and said:
Government agencies and Departments, including the ATO, are specifically authorised by section 91(10) ... to receive Electoral Roll information.
What a duplicitous statement. They are entitled to receive that information on microfiche alone, not the electronic version. We read the act. We legally interpreted it; we eventually went for legal advice—it all confirmed that. Why in heaven's name has it taken a week for the government to understand that this was an untenable project? It could never stand up.
In issuing those letters of demand this morning, we threatened to go to the Federal Court on Friday. We do not have to—we appreciate that fact. But Senator Ellison wants to intervene today. Listen to what he said yesterday, not even in answer to the question I asked him:
... the Electoral Commission has received legal advice today confirming the lawfulness of the supply of information. 
That information, Senator Ellison, was supplied under 91(10). The reason why you always stuck to that story was that there was no end use attached to 91(10). Now you are shifting your ground. Now you are saying it can be supplied under (4A)(e)—but that is discretionary. Read the act. It was not asked for in a discretionary way. Eventually, again as a new process, the tax office can get that particular information under (4A)(e), but the problem is that the whole of 91A comes in, which restricts its use. It does not mention 91(10). You are shifting your ground from time to time, but you are not going to get away with it. You applied for it under 91(10); you did not apply for it under 91(4A)(e). For that reason, a whole series of illegal acts has occurred. If we had not raised these issues at estimates, this process would never have been turned up and previous flaws would not have been exposed. I reckon, Senator Ellison, you should cough up for the amount of money we have had to pay for legal advice—it is not much—because we have saved you a massive amount of money by raising these issues and helping you to avoid having to go to the Federal Court and lose.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-06-08,"—Since as early as 1991, the Australian Electoral Commission has acted on consistent advice that it was able to provide information in electronic form. That advice was not just sought on section 91(10), it was given pursuant to a request as to whether we were able to do this under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. That advice was recently confirmed by the Australian Government Solicitor and was obtained after the recent estimates. The Electoral Commissioner was doing his duty in checking on the allegations that had been raised. He was doing his job in checking that and the advice was confirmed. At that point there had been a long line of advice which had said that, under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, they were able to do this.
Senator Bolkus, who as a previous minister presided over the AEC, was of the same understanding. Mr McMullan, the member for Fraser, presided over the AEC and was of exactly the same understanding. There are even examples of a number of agencies receiving electronic information from the AEC: Social Security, Centrelink, Defence, Australian Customs Service, NCA, ATO, DETYA, ComSuper, the passport section of DFAT, ASIC and DEWRSB. The government took the responsible action of taking advice from the Solicitor-General. That was done yesterday, before any letter from Slater and Gordon. When you look at the letter from Slater and Gordon and the advice from the Victorian government, they said that the AEC could not provide this electronic information to a prescribed authority under the act. When you look at the Solicitor-General's advice, he says that the AEC can. What he points to is a flaw in what you can do with the information once you have received it. What we are going to have to look at, and what the AEC has said it will look at, is a regulation or amendment of the legislation so that the agencies concerned can then do what they are supposed to do for the Australian people; that is, provide services and use this information to that end. But at the moment, because of the advice we have had from the Solicitor-General, that will have to be remedied. I ask the opposition whether they are willing to remedy this longstanding flaw which existed when they were in government. It existed from about 1991. Since then, advice consistently has said that information could be provided in the electronic format.
—Why don't you just apologise.
—Order! 
—We have to remedy this defect. In relation to the question of the last estimates, what Senator Ray needs to look at is the absolutely outrageous attack on the officials. He said, `Show me in the law where it says that?'
—It is his job to look at the law, not to ask us to do so.
—The advice was that he could do it.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! 
—On a point of order, Madam Deputy President: I am trying to listen to what my colleague Senator Ellison is saying and Senator Ray, Senator Schacht, Senator Conroy and others are constantly interjecting and totally ignoring your calls for order. Would you please advise them that it is entirely disorderly and, if they are going to interject, could they keep the volume down a little so that those of us who want to listen to Senator Ellison can actually hear him.
—They are not here. They are all gone.
—Order, Senator Schacht! Can I have some order, please. I would also ask Senator Ellison to address the chair and not answer interjections. 
—Once again, the opposition has it wrong, just like yesterday in relation to the purchase of advertising. Channel 9 has written a letter confirming my position, and Senator Faulkner might like to listen to this. The letter confirmed that exclusivity was not sought by the government. It is further confirmed that neither the government nor its agents were aware of any possible conflict with other clients of Channel 9. I also have a letter from our agents, Mitchell Media, saying that they did not ask Channel 9 for exclusivity in relation to the time bought. 
—Tell us about sponsorship.
—The opposition do not want to hear this. They have that wrong and they have this wrong because they have said that the AEC could not provide the information that it did to the ATO. We have a long line of advice which has said that it could and that it acted in accordance with that advice. We have the Solicitor-General's advice saying that it can do that. The Solicitor-General has said that we have to look at the end usage and that we need to amend the legislation or bring in a regulation so that these agencies can go about their business.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-06-08,"—Today we have a humiliating back-down from the government, a humiliating back-down from Minister Ellison, who is responsible for the Australian Electoral Commission, and a humiliating admission that the Australian Electoral Commissioner was wrong. There is now an acknowledgment that the Prime Minister's GST mail-out to Australian voters was illegal. That is the point. Today the government has acknowledged that what Labor senators—Senator Ray and I—have been saying now for a couple of weeks is correct. The Prime Minister's GST mail-out to voters was illegal, as we have said since 24 May. It puts paid to what Minister Ellison said in his press statement of 25 May, and I quote him:
The release of electoral roll information is authorised.
Minister Ellison, that is just plain wrong. The Prime Minister asserted in the House of Representatives on 30 May:
All I say is that the correct procedures have been followed.
That is just plain wrong. What we did was broach this unlawful use of the Australian electoral roll in the Senate estimates committees in May. This morning, after substantial political debate on this issue, we sought written undertakings from the ATO and the AEC in relation to the use of that material. The government have folded on this matter. They stand humiliated. The Prime Minister has been humiliated. The Special Minister of State has been humiliated. The Australian Electoral Commissioner has been humiliated. And luckily we have been able to stop the Australian Taxation Commissioner being humiliated because the letter is not going out. That begs a few questions in itself. Minister Ellison said in Senate question time today that the Prime Minister's letter is going to be pulped. The opposition wants to know: how much did it cost to print the Prime Minister's illegal letter? How much has it cost to pulp the Prime Minister's illegal letter? The good news for Australians is that the Prime Minister's illegal letter is being pulped. The bad news for Australians is that they are paying for the pulping of the Prime Minister's illegal letter.
Alarm bells should have been ringing in government about this exercise from the very time that Senator Ray and I raised it in the Senate estimates committee. You would think that the Australian Electoral Commissioner and the Commissioner of Taxation would act on the information that was provided to them. The Electoral Commissioner should have told the Prime Minister of this country that this mail-out was illegal. The taxation commissioner should have told the Prime Minister of this country that this mail-out was illegal and the Prime Minister of this country should not have been associated in using the electoral rolls in such a partisan way for promoting political propaganda on behalf of the government. It is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia and now the Prime Minister finds himself, his government and his Special Minister of State utterly humiliated in relation to this matter. 
What did they do? They proceeded with an unprecedented, poorly planned, unlawful attempt to convince Australian voters of the benefits of the GST and to improperly and illegally use the electoral rolls of this country to do so. Finally, the bureaucracy has come to its senses. Finally they have been convinced of the merit of the arguments that the opposition has mounted and finally the Prime Minister's illegal letter has been exposed for what it is—an unlawful rort.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-08,"—Senator Faulkner has just added to his record of aiming a shot, firing it and missing the mark.

They would like to feel vindicated that their campaign has come off.

CLAIM AGAINST THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL COMMISSION (AEC) AND THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE (ATO)
Senator John Faulkner and Senator Robert Ray have instructed my firm to act for them in an application against the AEC and the ATO.
The application relates to the alleged provision by the AEC to the ATO of the electoral roll in electronic form for the purpose of mailing to electors a personal letter from the Prime Minister John Howard and ATO material.
My clients believe that this action by the AEC is in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, in particular, sections 91 and 91A. Further, that this action by AEC may cause disclosure of information that is unlawful pursuant to section 91B.
My clients seek a written undertaking from the AEC that it will not provide the ATO with the electoral roll in electronic form relying on section 91(10). Further, if it has already done so, the AEC will first, immediately demand that the ATO not use this material and, secondly, immediately retrieve this material from the ATO and any other organisation involved in the mail-out.
In the event that the ATO does not provide a written undertaking by noon, Friday 9 June 2000, my clients have instructed me to commence proceedings without further notice. My clients would seek a declaration that the AEC has acted unlawfully by providing the electoral roll in electronic form to ATO as well as injunctive relief.
As a matter of courtesy, please advise who is able to accept service on behalf of the AEC if you are not prepared to provide the undertaking sought.

—I draw people's attention to the specific injunctive relief that is sought by Slater and Gordon on behalf of Senators Faulkner and Ray. I invite all Labor Party colleagues to read closely the letter, because what Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray are trying to do is to gloss over—
—If it's in the Hansard a lot more will read it, won't they?
—I want them to read it. I invite Labor Party colleagues. I invite the press gallery—the packed press gallery that is showing so much interest in this issue!—to compare the track that Senators Faulkner and Ray were going down, which is to seek injunctive relief. I quote the letter again:
to seek a declaration that the AEC has acted unlawfully by providing the electoral roll in electronic form to the ATO as well as appropriate injunctive relief. 
That is what they have sought this very day, 8 June, in this letter. The press gallery then should go to the Attorney-General's news release released today some hours after the letter from Slater and Gordon—I refer particularly to the attachment which talks about the basis of the Solicitor-General's advice—and look at what it says. It makes quite clear that the advice that the government is acting upon has absolutely nothing to do with what Senators Faulkner and Ray would have you believe. They would have you believe that they have pulled off some marvellous political legal achievement. They want Senator Sherry to believe it. He is going to have to get up now and make a speech saying the Labor Party was right and we are wrong.
The fact of the matter, if you look at the behaviour of the Labor Party in government over all of the years since 1993, is that they actually broke the law. Their government did in the examples of the Australian Taxation Office, the Customs Office and the National Crime Authority, which have all been using electronic copies of the electoral roll since 1993 without the authority of prescribing regulations. Madam Deputy President, sitting up as you do just behind Senator Bolkus, you would have noticed that Senator Bolkus was quieter during this question time than he has ever been in my 10 years in the Senate. He sat there like a dog that had had his bone taken away from him. I have never seen Senator Bolkus so quiet. He was not called to order once, because Senator Bolkus has realised that due to his activities as the responsible minister under the Hawke and Keating governments he will be the first person to support legislation to overcome a deficit in the law—retrospective legislation that may be required, as referred to by the Attorney-General in the other place during question time. The embarrassment for Senator Faulkner, once his colleagues read the Attorney-General's release and then read the letter from Slater and Gordon, is that one more time Senator Faulkner has misfired. He has had the tax advertising misfire, where the Auditor-General has totally vindicated the government's expenditure of money on taxpayers. He has had the Natural Heritage Trust, where once again he accused the government of rorting and the Auditor-General fully supported the government's action. It was the same in relation to the Federation Fund. It was the same in relation to the Baillieu family, where he accused two members of the Baillieu family who had since deceased.
Now Senator Ellison has reminded us that he has accused us of some exclusive deal with Channel 9. Senator Ellison produced documentation only a few minutes ago to say that one more time Senator Faulkner has not only misled this chamber and made an absolute fool of himself but also misled his colleagues. Senator Cook, who should know better as he has been around here longer than Senator Faulkner, should look very carefully at what Senator Faulkner is doing, because he will cause you great embarrassment.

SLATER & GORDON
—Thank you. I will come to those letters in a moment. I think it is important to go back to when this issue began, at the estimates hearings of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on Wednesday, 24 May. I would ask anyone observing this debate, particularly the media, to have a look at the Hansard, particularly page 363 onwards. What occurred here was a professional questioning by Senators Ray and Faulkner about the activities of the Electoral Office, particularly their discovery that the Electoral Office had forwarded materials—the database in electronic form—to the tax office and then their discovery that the tax office was to send a letter out to all persons enrolled about the GST. 
It was very difficult for Senators Robert Ray and Faulkner to find out who was going to sign this letter. That occurred the next day. There was an element of obfuscation and, I think, misleading information was given on that matter. Senators Ray and Faulkner went to two issues with the Electoral Office. Firstly, and I think importantly, they went to the moral issue of this information being made available for a GST propaganda campaign, being made available for a purpose for which it was never intended it would be made available. Secondly, Senators Faulkner and Ray went to the legality of this matter. It is interesting to note the transcript on page 365, when Senator Faulkner said to Mr Becker from the Electoral Office: 
Why didn't you seek legal advice, then, Mr Becker? You just signed it off. Did you seek even internal advice on this? 
Mr Becker—Yes, I did. Of course I did. 
Senator FAULKNER—Let me know what you did. 
Mr Becker—We consulted each other about the issue and then felt that it fell within the privacy principles and we supplied the information. 
Senator FAULKNER—Who did you consult? 
Mr Becker—I spoke with Mr Dacey and our government and legal section. 
That was the start of this sorry tale. Clearly, the Electoral Office—even though they sought legal advice—were wrong. They were absolutely wrong. The next day it was discovered that the Prime Minister, at public expense, was going to send out a letter to every person in Australia—some eight million letters at public expense—as part of the $400-odd million propaganda campaign being conducted by this government in respect of the GST, which has never been done before to this extent in Australian history. 
The bottom line in this debate is that both morally and legally this government got it wrong. The Prime Minister got it wrong. Minister Ellison got it wrong. This letter is not going to be sent out because it is illegal. It is based on the provision of information given to the tax office—illegally, as it turns out. That was the assertion, the discovery, of Senators Faulkner and Ray at the estimates committee on Wednesday, 24 May—that it was legally wrong and morally wrong to do so. The bottom line is that eight million letters were to be signed by the Prime Minister. They have been printed and now no longer are going to be sent out. These eight million letters—goodness knows what it has cost—are going to be pulped or burnt. It is a pity the GST is not being burnt along with the letters. These letters are going to be burnt, a massive waste of taxpayers' money. Senator Ellison has been in denial for the last two weeks. He said on Tuesday of this week:  
The Electoral Commission has received legal advice today confirming the lawfulness of the supply of that information that confirmed prior legal advice that the Australian Electoral Commissioner had on this point. 
Senator Ellison was wrong. The legal advice that Senator Ellison received was wrong. So Senator Ellison has been maintaining for two weeks, along with the rest of the government, that the provision of this information was legal when now, apparently, according to advice through Mr Daryl Williams from the Solicitor-General, the information could not be provided. 
—That is not true. 
—It cannot be provided to the Australian people in the form you proposed and the methods that you proposed. It was Senators Ray and Faulkner who asserted this at the estimates and who sought this at the estimates and have sought—(Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Electoral Commission's funding and disclosure report, Election 1998, vindicates the Labor Party's concerns over the Greenfields Foundation loophole. This loophole was engineered by the Liberal Party. Greenfields was, and still may be, part of their shonky fundraising apparatus. First, some history. In 1995 the then Liberal Party treasurer, Ron Walker, guaranteed the Liberal Party's $4.6 million debt to the National Australia Bank. That debt was then assigned to the mysterious Greenfields Foundation, a so-called charitable foundation. The Liberal Party has made only token repayments of the loan. A loan to a political party in itself is not a problem—the problem arises from the fact that the Greenfields Foundation can collect substantial donations from sources which remain anonymous for the purposes of funding disclosure. That money is then forwarded to the Liberal Party in the form of a loan. What remains unanswered is: when will the loan be repaid, how will it be repaid, how is the funding secured and are there any concessional interest rate arrangements in the financing? We do know that the Liberal Party has made a payment of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. The money may not have been a repayment but rather a grant to set up the foundation. However, even if this is a repayment on a loan, it is at a very lucrative rate of about 2½ per cent. This would not be a loan on a commercial basis. 
Quite rightly, the Electoral Commission has now found the Greenfields Foundation to be an associated entity of the Liberal Party. It now has to supply returns to the AEC. But it has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table. Both the Liberal Party and the shadowy Greenfields Foundation do not want to be accountable. They both tried to hide. The AEC had to issue notices to the Greenfields Foundation to force it to come clean. Even then, it has tried to weasel out of properly disclosing its relationship with and funding to the Liberal Party. Naturally, the Electoral Commission was concerned about the uncommonly favourable manner in which the Greenfields Foundation treated the Liberals' debt to it, and it found that Greenfields's `lenient treatment of the Liberal Party in servicing the debt represented a benefit to the party'. The report states that `a person, or in certain circumstances a corporation' could avoid disclosures by `a series of transactions based on the Greenfields model'. It recommends that the loophole be closed `as a matter of priority'. 
Labor, and particularly my colleague Senator Faulkner, has been arguing for three years that this loophole be properly closed. The AEC has to take at face value Mr Walker's assertion that he personally covered the $4.6 million debt, but the AEC warns that `should the creditor not have any individual disclosure obligations, for instance, as an associated entity, the identity of the guarantor, the real source of the funds, need not be disclosed anywhere'. In other words, the Liberal Party have engineered a mechanism to hide the identity of its political donors. The Labor Party gives in-principle support to the Electoral Commission's recommendations to declare a loan as a gift so that paper trails can be followed to find the actual political donors of so-called loans. Mr Howard is happy, or he was at least up until today, to use the private information of 12 million voters from the electoral roll for a GST mail-out, but the AEC's report proves that, when it comes to the Liberal Party's own political activities regarding what are in substance donations, they will go to any lengths to cover up people's identities.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-06-08,"—It is very disappointing to see that the Liberal Party are prepared to go to such outrageous lengths to hide their donors. What have they got to hide? I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
 (Senator Calvert)—Are there any other speakers on the Australian Electoral Commission report?
—Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President—

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-06-08,"—I think it is my first such appearance. Searches are being made, let me assure you, to locate the missing jacket. Several people did offer to lend me theirs, but regrettably we determined that those might not have got the whole distance around.
What Senator Sherry has been addressing tonight is a very serious issue, and I do not intend to repeat it chapter and verse. Remarks were made earlier today by Special Minister of State Ellison complaining about approaches at the estimates committee. Let me tell you this, Mr Acting Deputy President: none of those issues around Greenfields would have come out but for the inquisitorial, and at times with the minister adversarial, approach that occurred.
—And appropriately.
—Yes. I think they were then—and at other times if not most times—within proper bounds. We had a situation in 1994-95 where the national office of the Liberal Party, as happens to political parties of all persuasions, was in serious financial trouble. The Treasurer of the Liberal Party at the time, Mr Ron Walker, was given the task of remedying that. As far as we are concerned, he is quite entitled to do so, provided he acts within the law. What occurred was that—at least by his own admission, but we have no proof of it—he anteed up the $4.6 million himself. But, to disguise that donation, it was assigned to the Greenfields Foundation. Note that it is not a registered company but a foundation. It was done at no interest at all. So far as we can detect, the Liberal Party has only repaid $200,000 of that debt. This was basically a device to avoid the provisions of the Electoral Act. That should not surprise us because from 1983 onwards the Liberal Party of Australia has sought to knock over disclosure provisions. It has voted against nearly every piece of legislation on disclosure from 1983 through to the current day. But you have to ask yourself: why would Mr Walker want to avoid disclosure? Surely, if he is putting in $4.6 million he should be proud of it; he should be a hero in the Liberal Party. But what you have to look at at the same time is this: what other activities was Mr Walker involved in? He was heavily involved through HudCon and his partner Mr Williams in the Victorian casino bid.
I am not going to regurgitate all the details here other than to say how amazing it was that, in the second round bidding, they were able to lift their bid by 40 per cent to exactly equal the bid of the other group that was involved. Then, when they started to get into trouble, their licence was expanded: more gaming machines were given than they were entitled to. Certain obligations in terms of theatres and hotel towers were reneged on—again they were forgiven. It is this juxtaposition between the favourable treatment of Mr Walker's group compared with the others, in conjunction with this hidden donation, that required the Electoral Commission, I think, to examine these questions in detail. The Electoral Commission have taken a long time to bring down this report but we must acknowledge that once they got their skates on they did it thoroughly. It is a pity they did not give other issues equal consideration. It is a pity that it was only through the estimates process that we discovered, for instance, their $10 million mail-out that they were assisting the tax office in. They had never given that proper attention. They were able to breach their act, according to the Solicitor-General today, in several ways—and you have to ask: why were they allowed to get away with it? This Greenfields issue has still got a long way to go. It is the most blatant example of a political party and its treasurer trying to avoid disclosure at all times. In the end it needs to be further investigated whether it was in fact Mr Walker who came up with the $4.6 million or the source of the money was elsewhere, be it overseas or some other business groups in Australia. We will probably never know. (Time expired)

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-06-08,"—The report on housing development at Parap Grove, Darwin, of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works is not a high point for the Defence Housing Authority—and rightly so. This report, the subject of which was referred to the committee on 23 September 1999, raises some very interesting questions about the provision of housing for Defence personnel around the country. When we took evidence on this matter in Darwin on 28 October, witnesses from the Defence Housing Authority told us that this was a very urgent project. Indeed, earlier on the committee had received a request for it not to be even considered by the committee. The project, worth $17 million, was for the purchase of 50 house and land packages in Parap Grove, Darwin, which were being developed by a private developer. As I said, we were told that this was an urgent project. It was urgent because of the need to meet the Defence housing requirements for its personnel in Darwin, with particular focus on the 1999-2000 personnel movement arrangements.
In February, I think it was, we were advised that the developer, Bayview Homes, had gone into liquidation and that the Defence Housing Authority had put their pursuit of the 50 house and land packages on hold to see what the outcome of the liquidation might be. We were told that they had options with regard to it and that they would come back to us. We subsequently received a very short letter to say that they were now not going to proceed with the purchase of the 50 house and land packages from the Bayview development. There was no other explanation. We have to consider this against the background that the Public Works Committee was told that this was a very urgent project and that it was vital to meet the Defence housing requirement in respect of the 1999-2000 personnel movement. It is quite possible that the committee would have approved this project. But when the committee was subsequently told that they were not going to proceed, it said, `Look, that simply isn't good enough. We want further explanation.' We did receive some explanation. The brief explanation said that the 50 house and land packages were no longer needed to meet the Defence housing requirements and that they were too expensive. Two or three other things were listed as justification for the Defence Housing Authority no longer wanting to proceed with this project. 
At the same time, the committee was asked to consider another project, Carey Street, which related to a three-tower high-rise development of apartments. The relevance of this particular issue and the process that has been employed over a period of time for the provision of housing for Defence personnel have become very interesting. As a result of some investigation through the estimates and discussions I have had privately with the Defence Housing Authority and people in Defence, I have now ascertained that there is a major problem with the process involving the provision of housing for Defence. It is very interesting to note—it is something that you do not find in any reports and it is something that has not been forthcoming in any evidence to any estimates committees—that Defence pay at least $20 million a year in dead rent. If you look at Defence housing costs to the Department of Defence for the year 1998-99, the net cost of rent alone was $188 million or thereabouts. If you then make an assessment of that, $20 million plus is dead rent. That is rent that is paid for houses that have no tenants. The Darwin region has been a major contributor to that. It is something that I find totally unacceptable. Upon further investigation, I have been able to ascertain that there have been problems with mismatching housing and problems associated with the general management, it would appear, insofar as actually getting people into Defence housing and not having them in the private rental system at the same time.
What is interesting about this position as it unfolds—it will become more interesting, and I know, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, that you are also on the Public Works Committee and it is of great interest to you—is that, if we took a snapshot of the Darwin housing situation as at 30 June 1999, it is quite possible that the Department of Defence would have been paying at least $2 million a month in dead rent. That is extraordinary. Of course, there are a number of issues that relate to the provision of information, which I think was one of the problems associated with the Parap Grove development. The Defence Housing Authority ultimately became aware that they did not need the 50 house and land packages and that they were headed towards a massive oversupply problem. This is something that will require both the focus and the attention of the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority to ensure that these sorts of costs—the costs that, as I said, are at least $20 million a year in dead rent—are avoided.
I know that the Public Works Committee have been very concerned about this, as is witnessed in this report in which we have referred this particular matter to the Australian National Audit Office for further investigation. And so we should. With regard to the Parap Grove development, I was provided with a letter that was written in August 1999—that is, before this matter was referred by the parliament to the Public Works Committee. That was a letter between the Defence Housing Authority and the developers of the Parap Grove housing development. That letter would infer quite clearly to me that there was an agreement between the Defence Housing Authority and the company known as Bayview Homes that the Defence Housing Authority purchase 50 house and land packages. That of itself is a very worrying matter. 
The Public Works Committee of this parliament is charged with the responsibility of making an assessment of, firstly, the need for a particular project or development and, secondly, whether or not it represents good value for money. We have to be certain in the future that we make very clear judgments on that. It is incumbent upon the Department of Defence in particular to provide accurate information. If we are to avoid the future waste of money to the tune of $20 million a year at least, then this must occur. I commend this report because, as I said, it has taken a very positive step in recommending to the Australian National Audit Office that there be further investigation of this issue. I hope at the end of the day that we will see better administrative practices as they relate to these matters. (Time expired)

Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-06-08,"A few times in recent weeks I have perhaps been a little inflammatory in questioning the claim so often made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that they are the party which Australians look to for progressive and innovative policy. Gough Whitlam, for instance, in his foreword to Mark Latham's recent book Civilising Global Capital, wrote: 
In Australian politics it always seems to be left to Labor to advance the nation's agenda. The Australian people are again looking to Labor for the next generation of public policy ideas and reforms.
I would suggest that this claim looks very sick. A party that hopes to secure office only by scablifting and by scaremongering does not deserve to govern. Tonight I want to touch on just one of the many reasons for the Labor Party's injured capacity to produce policies of relevance to the people of modern Australia. I speak about the continuing control of the Australian Labor Party by the union movement.  
Unions, with their ethos of collective action and mass agitation, are in many ways relics of another era, one where big unions confronted big business under the watchful gaze of big government. In the new economy of the 21st century, unions are far less important. Under the influence of technological advancement and the information revolution, the nature of work is changing very quickly. As both employers and employees demand greater flexibility in ordering their affairs, as employment becomes less and less trade based, and as jobs for life are replaced by frequent job—even career—changes, the scope for legitimate union influence narrows dramatically. Yet, blind to all the new realities, the Labor Party continues to be the slave of the union movement. 
At no time in our political history have so few had so much influence over so many. Unions still control 60 per cent of voting delegates at each national conference of the ALP. Yet they represent less than 25 per cent of the Australian work force. In fact, 80 per cent of private sector and 75 per cent of public sector employees do not belong to a trade union. In small businesses which employ fewer than 10 people—the vast majority of businesses—90 per cent of employees choose not to join their employee organisations. In August last year, the total union membership in Australia was 1.87 million and has been falling by an average of 90,000 members per year for quite some time now. The NRMA has got as many members as all trade unions; sporting clubs have twice as many members as all trade unions; private health insurance funds have three times as many members as all trade unions. Clearly, these statistics give lie to claims by the ACTU head, Sharan Burrow, that the unions are the largest representative group in Australia. Clearly, they are not. 
Failing to be relevant to the needs of Australian workers, the unions have chiefly become a career vehicle for ambitious men and women with political aspirations. You might call it a `kindergarten' for future Labor parliamentarians. Currently, six out of the 10 ALP shadow cabinet ministers are former union officials, including two former ACTU presidents—Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson—with a third one, Jenny George, still attempting to join them. In fact, the union presence and influence are growing in the ALP ranks. In 1983, only 28 per cent of Labor members of the House of Representatives and, indeed, only 30 per cent of Labor senators were former union officials. Now, even though union membership has plummeted by half since those glory days, union representation in the parliamentary Labor Party has nearly doubled—over half of the whole Labor parliamentary party are former union activists or union lawyers. In this chamber, 20 out of 29 Labor senators are in that category. Compared to the composition of a wider Australian work force, trade union officials are overrepresented 1,500 times in the parliamentary Labor Party. 
It now seems that the unions have decided to abolish all individual employment contracts should the Labor Party return to government. The right wing and the left wing unions have banded together in the cause of denying Australian workers freedom of choice. Kim Beazley has already announced that he would abolish Australian workplace agreements and, of course, the Office of the Employment Advocate. There are now 100,000 formal AWAs federally and the total number is growing at more than 3,000 every month. As the ALP yet again attempts to restrict people's freedom of choice—freedom has never been a catch-cry of the Left, ever, and Senator Schacht knows that—it becomes apparent that it is entering the 21st century with 19th century policies on industrial relations. We might just reflect on the failure of the Left in the 20th century, Senator Schacht, and the triumph of liberal democracy today.
—Senator, you should not direct your remarks across the chamber.
—Meanwhile, my own state of Queensland, Madam President, is already paying the price for Labor's inability to put the interest of the people above the interests of their union mates. As a repayment of political favour to their union supporters, the Beattie government has taken the Queensland industrial relations system a few decades back in time—abolishing greenfield site agreements, restructuring workers compensation and being soft on transport union militancy. The result is the loss of business confidence and an unemployment rate that is climbing to eight per cent— 
—I rise on a point of order, Madam President. It would save an awful lot of time if he just tabled what he is reading out from Mr Reith's former speech, and we could all get on with it.
—There is no point of order.
—It is climbing to eight per cent at the same time as the rest of Australia's employment rate is falling.
—Just table it!
—Senator Schacht and others in the Labor Party talk often about Tony Blair. Now Senator Schacht falls silent—funny that, Madam President. Blair had the vision to face the realities and break the chains that for 100 years bound his party to the union movement. He did it against the Left; and one day, perhaps, it will happen in this country. Senator Schacht falls silent—funny that. Does Kim Beazley have the courage to follow in Tony Blair's footsteps?
—`Mr Beazley', Senator, should be the way you refer to him.
—He got the press statement from Reith. That is the only problem he has got.
—And you should not be interjecting.
—Senator Schacht falls silent every time I mention Mr Blair, and I wonder why. Does Mr Beazley have the courage to follow in Tony Blair's footsteps and assert the Labor Party's right to develop policies of its own? Unfortunately for the future of this country, the answer seems to be no. As Doug Cameron, the national secretary of the AMWU said: 
We, as trade unionists, will not be denied our rightful and helpful input into the party's policy making as some would like.
And Mr Beazley concurs:
I am not a Labor leader who relishes the idea of there being substantial points of disagreement between ourselves and the union movement.
Political parties are community organisations seeking to represent their constituency.
—I actually agree with Mr Blair. If the Left in your party had any brains, they would too. That is why the Left in this country is such a miserable failure, Senator Schacht. For the most successful ones, the constituency is as broad and as diverse as possible. No-one is arguing that to become more representative again the ALP has to cut all the ties with the union movement.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. As I understand the standing orders, senators are supposed to refer to notes, not read a speech verbatim. Senator Mason is absolutely reading verbatim. I think he would be better off if he actually read from notes that might be more accurate than the speech he is reading verbatim from someone else.
—There is no point of order. The senator knows that he cannot read a speech, but he can have copious notes.
—Senator Schacht has interjected a couple of times today. I do not mind taking interjections from someone on the Left who is largely irrelevant in the political community today. The leftover people—the Vietnam generation—Senator Schacht, I am not going to be worried by. One of the most successful Labor politicians, the newly re-elected Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Jim Soorley, has recently called for such an outcome. He has said that the ALP will have to pull away from the schackles of the trade union movement. He is looking forward, not backwards.
—Order! Senator Schacht, you are persistently interjecting and that is disorderly. You can have an opportunity to speak later in the debate, if you wish to do so. 
Senator Schacht's interjections are really based on enormous frustration that the last century belongs to liberal democracy; socialism is dead; and the Vietnam generation is largely irrelevant. All your pathetic interjections mean very little. I am sure that Councillor Soorley's voice—
—I can end your interjections, Senator Schacht, easily; and I have had to repeatedly cut you off this afternoon, on many occasions. The sad part is that, continually, the Labor Party is shackled by the trade union movement. If it listened to Councillor Soorley, it would move on, undo the shackles and perhaps, like Mr Blair in Britain, move forward. The only way the Australian Labor Party will have the capacity to move forward and become relevant and not have its capacity compromised, prejudiced and endangered is if it does that. The question will be whether it has the courage to do that. But I doubt whether people like Senator Schacht, remnants of the Vietnam generation still clinging to power, will finally come to understand that. In the meantime, the debate will go on. I suspect that one day, perhaps in my life in this parliament, the ALP will formally cut those ties.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade Unionism</title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech
