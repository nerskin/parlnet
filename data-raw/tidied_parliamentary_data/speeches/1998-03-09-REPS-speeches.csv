"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Mr Speaker, I present the Report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Venezuela and the United States of America 5-22 July 1997 . In so doing, I will briefly offer a few points about the delegation and say at the outset that I believe that the success of the delegation was certainly due to the leader, the previous Speaker, the Hon. Bob Halverson. I thank him for his very hard work and, most particularly, for the very honest way in which the delegation was conducted and proceeded. I particularly express appreciation to my colleagues who went on the trip.
The delegation received very comprehensive oral and written briefings prior to leaving Australia from officers of the Parliamentary Research Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade. The assistance provided by those people is certainly acknowledged with thanks. In fact, I will mention Mr Frank Frost from the Parliamentary Research Service; Ms Clare Bergin, Ms Alison Burrows, Mr Richard Ryan and Ms Sarah Roberts from Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Alex Olah from Austrade.
The delegation, I feel sure, would also like to give thanks to the Australian missions in Caracas and Washington for the excellent support provided prior to and during the visits. The excellent work that was performed by the mission in Caracas has resulted, I believe, in Australia gaining particular kudos in Venezuela. The officers are mentioned in the report, but I give thanks particularly to His Excellency Mr Roger Frankel, Ambassador to Venezuela; to Mr Ben Burdon, his Second Secretary handling the political area—a wonderful, bright young man; and to Mr Aquiles Sanchez, Business Relations Director. I believe a lot of Australia's acceptance in 
 Venezuela is owed in no small measure to the work that those people are doing on our behalf in the embassy. The delegation appreciated the very warm welcome and the hospitality extended to us by the President and Vice-President of the Congress of Venezuela. We also had meetings with the First Vice-President of the Senate and the President of the Venezuela-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group. We met representatives from the Venezuelan Congress. We were very kindly assisted by the police. I believe they were invaluable in making the visit the success that it was.
The Venezuelans are now very keen to promote Australia as a development model considering the similarity of their mineral resource base to that of Australia. There is a very strong express desire to attract Australian investment and commercial interests, particularly in mining and industry areas where we are at the forefront in technology and know-how. Also, I think the timing of our visit to Venezuela was very significant as the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, or BHP, has combined with a very large Venezuelan company, Sivensa, in a joint venture to build a $650 million hot briquetted iron manufacturing plant in Puerto Ordaz. We had the opportunity to visit that plant and see it in operation.
Mr Speaker, the first recommendation in the report that has been tabled is:
The Parliament of Australia should encourage and support regular visits between the Parliaments of Venezuela and Australia, and other exchanges between the two bodies.
I hope the government takes note of that recommendation because I think the friendships we have built are very important, as are the expertise that was exchanged and the fact that the Venezuelans are so keen to get on with changing their country. It can only be to the advantage of Venezuela and Australia if those friendships continue to be encouraged.
Economically, at this stage, Venezuela is still going through a very hard time. But, because it has such abundant natural resources, I believe that the type of government structure they have there now and the commitment that they have will certainly help them to achieve. The mineral reserves in 
 Venezuela and the shared geological structures of Australia and Venezuela can provide very significant trade and investment opportunities for Australia, particularly in the mining sector. That was certainly brought home to the delegation. That is why we were very keen, in recommendation 2 of the report, to request the Australian government to:
. . . capitalise on the tremendous potential for investment in Venezuela by adopting appropriate policies and maintaining appropriate levels of representation in Venezuela to further Australia's commercial and business interests.
I think that is very important.
Before I go to the American part of our visit, I will touch on a project which helps educate young children that has been extended—with very limited financial output—through our embassy in Venezuela. As a delegation, we had an opportunity to visit a social development project, as the embassy calls it, which is sponsored by our embassy and, I think, the Canadian embassy. The project provides education for the children of persons living in Caracas who do not have citizen identity cards. These children, therefore, do not qualify for a state education. If it were not for this money, these children would not receive any education. The faces of those children when we met them, and the opportunity to see how proud they are to be starting to put words together and to be identifying words, I think is a compliment to our embassy. I believe they are making a very humane and social contact with people who are less privileged than ourselves.
When we left Venezuela—and, as I said, it was a very extensive visit in a very limited time—we went on to the United States. I am particularly pleased with the cooperation that was given to the delegation in the United States. It provided us with an opportunity to review and evaluate recent directions, particularly in US domestic and foreign policies, as President Clinton had just begun his second term. The opportunity was also taken by us to assess Australia's wide ranging bilateral relationship, particularly the examination of opportunities to strengthen our trade positions. I can assure you that we need to. We have brought down a recommendation in this report which states:
The Australian Government should pursue the prospect of a `Pacific Charter' as suggested by the Honourable Benjamin Gilman, Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, US Congress.
We certainly had many long and involved meetings with a number of congressmen, as mentioned in the report. I think it is important that we look at that.
During that period of time in Washington the delegation also received information on the possibility of Australia gaining fast-track authority to improve Australia's balance of trade situation by gaining better access for certain commodities. Subject to Congress approval of the policy, Australia, I believe, should pursue the possibility of gaining fast-track approval from the President of the United States for access to free trade in certain commodities. That is how recommendation 4 came about. As it states, subject to Congress approval of the policy, we should continue to pursue the fast tracking for Australia to have access to free trade in certain commodities.
The delegation also went to New York which I had requested we at least visit to see what was happening with the zero tolerance policy of the New York Police Department. We were very impressed with what has occurred in New York City. On behalf of the delegation, I would particularly like to thank the Police Commissioner, Howard Safir, and from the New York Police Department, the deputy inspectors and the commanding officer, and the District Attorney of New York.
There has been a reduction in New York in all major crimes over the past four years and something like a 60 per cent decrease in murders. When Mr Safir was questioned as to how this turnaround came about, he said that it first began from the writing of a book from two New York academics, titled Broken Window. The major theme of the book that they carried through in New York was that non-action against lower level crimes such as graffiti and littering gave a message or signal that other crimes would then be tolerated. That is how zero tolerance came into being in New York.
I think the areas covered in the report speak volumes about what has been able to be done in a city which recently had the largest number of crimes of the 200 cities in America and has now come down to the least. I think that is a clear message that what they have put into practice is certainly working. What we have done in our report is request that we pursue that at a Commonwealth level and perhaps look at convincing—I know it is a state matter—some of our state colleagues to start looking at some of the strategies that have been put in place that have proven to be very effective.
We were briefed by the Police Commissioner about the changes that have occurred to the structure of their police force. In the limited time left to me I would like to put some details on the record. They have now changed all the requirements for the employment of police officers in New York. Now they have to be at least a minimum of 22 years of age. They have to have at least 60 college credits or two years military service. The interesting part of that is that of the 50,000 applicants each year who sit for the exams to join the police force, only 1,500 are accepted. Again, it was a very interesting visit. I believe much can be gained for Australia from this particular visit.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Venezuela and the United States of America, July 1997</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—I begin by endorsing the comments of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who was a most gracious fellow traveller on our trip to Venezuela and the United States. I thank her for introducing the report into the House in the absence of the former Speaker, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson). I would like to make a few comments in the very brief time that has been allocated to this debate on the report of the parliamentary delegation to Venezuela and the USA, which went from 5 to 22 July last year.
The objectives of the delegation were fivefold. The first objective was to review the bilateral relationship with particular reference to any issues that may provide opportunities to improve Australia's balance of trade situation with the United States. I intend to concentrate on the United States because I only have a few minutes to speak today. I am 
 grateful that the member for Prospect covered both Venezuela and the United States.
Our second aim was to assess the direction of policies towards the Asia-Pacific region, including relations with a number of countries and including security and defence policies. We were also to: assess the economic situation in the US with reference to control of the budget deficit and with the prospects for economic growth; examine the strategies employed by the New York Police Department to reduce crime significantly; and, finally, assess the methods used by the US Congress to deliver members' entitlements.
In my opinion, the two most important issues that we dealt with were, firstly, the trade relationship between Australia and the United States and, secondly, the United States' interest in the Asia-Pacific region and the growing importance of that region in world affairs. Australia has a $13 billion trade imbalance with the United States, which means that that is a very important subject, and we spent a great deal of time talking to congressmen and senators with respect to that issue.
One of the reasons why we have this trade imbalance is that we have a significant purchase of civilian aircraft and military equipment from the United States. So it is explainable but, at the same time, it is unsatisfactory. We discovered on our trip that we are making some inroads through wine exports. As a South Australian, I am pleased to say that wine exports to the US went up by 42 per cent in the last year. South Australia produces 70 per cent of Australia's exports of wine and 50 per cent of all of the production of wine in Australia, and as a South Australian I am very pleased that is happening. We are also increasing our trade in manganese metal, and increasing trade in the film industry through some of the more celebrated films of the last 12 months.
The delegation was lucky to have meetings with people of the stature of the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, the Hon. Ben Gilman; the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, the Hon. Philip Crane; the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee 
 on East Asia and Pacific, the Hon. Craig Thomas; as well as Ford Motor Co. executives Dr Martin Zimmerman and Mr Alain Batty. Through those meetings we pushed very strongly the Australian view with respect to agricultural products, the aluminium ship market and the fact that Australian farmers are so badly dealt with through the Monroe Doctrine, which has applied in the United States for many years and which gives enormous preference to the domestic farmers of the United States, and also the Jones Act, which is an act which stops the import into the United States of Australian superflyte ferries. They are two very significant areas that Australia could make inroads into in relation to our trade and balance with the United States.
The second most important issue is the United States interest and engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. It became very clear to the delegation that it was absolutely vital that the United States maintains a defence and economic interest in not only the North Asian region but also South-East Asia because of the balance and the stability that that gives our region. In discussions with other members of the Congress already referred to plus Mr Thomas Foley, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Bob Dole, who was the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 1996, we teased out some of the issues in relation to the United States engagement in Asia.
One of the things that became very clear was that, through some of the hot spots like the South China Sea, the Paracel and Spratly Islands and the Asian financial crisis, Australia had a large stake in ensuring that the United States maintains its military interest and its economic interest in the East Asian region. In the last few months with the Asian financial crisis we have seen that it is very important that the United States takes a greater interest in Indonesia. It became very clear through our discussions that there is only a very specific group of people—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Venezuela and the United States of America, July 1997</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1
"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-03-09,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the committee entitled Examination of the annual report for 1996-97 of the National Crime Authority.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I am pleased to be able to say in the context of tabling this report that the committee has been working assiduously in fulfilling its legislative responsibilities, which are spelt out in section 55(1)(c) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, which requires the committee to examine each annual report of the authority and report to the parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of any such report. I would like, in that context, both to thank the committee for the hard work that it continues to do and, I think appropriately, to pay some tribute to the authority as it is presently constituted for the cooperation which it gives to the committee and particularly to the Chairman, Mr Broome, and the member of the authority, Mr Melick, for the forthcoming way in which they deal with matters that are put to them by the committee.
The degree of cooperation the committee receives at the moment is probably the best level of cooperation that any parliamentary committee on the National Crime Authority has received in the past in its working relationship with the authority. There have been times in the early days when relations between the committee and the authority were strained, but today I think I can say quite unequivocally that relations are good. Having said that, I would not like to give members or indeed the broader public the impression that the joint parliamentary committee is in some respect a rubber stamp of the National Crime Authority or that it has some cosy relationship with the authority.
In fact, the contrary is true. We have a good, solid working relationship based on mutual respect and, as I say, a degree of cooperation which, in the end, allows us as a 
 parliamentary committee to fulfil our responsibilities properly and which also enhances the work of the authority, because the sorts of questions that we are able to ask in our dealings with the authority give them, quite correctly, the impression that this particular committee is serious about the work that it does. I see my friend the Deputy Chairman of the committee, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), in the chamber. He will speak shortly. I would like at the beginning of this new parliamentary year to thank him for his cooperation as well.
I need to be a little circumspect in the remarks that I make here this afternoon because the committee is completing what has been about an 18-month project of formulating a very detailed evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the authority. To that end, even today we are working towards finalising that report, which I know is being very much looked forward to by people who are interested in law enforcement in Australia. I can say to the House today that the timetable for our completion of that report and indeed its tabling in this parliament is that we would aim to complete that work in time to table our report in the parliament no later than 30 March.
I do not really want to go into great detail in the comments that I make now because it would in some way be seen to pre-empt that report, which, as I say, is going to be a very good one and which the committee is working towards completing at the moment.
I would, however, like to say one or two things. I recognise that the time for these comments is limited. What I might do at this stage is not say anything further but allow the Deputy Chairman of the committee to make a few remarks. If there is further time available for consideration of this report, I would like to add to my comments.

"Sercombe, Bob,MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—The front page of the Melbourne Age  this morning quotes the Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria as saying, somewhat dramatically, that we have lost the drug war. Even allowing for the journalistic licence that subeditors might wish to have sometimes, it nonetheless illustrates a whole range of the 
 issues that the NCA deals with in somewhat more diplomatic language in its report. It certainly deals very dramatically with the need for additional resources for its central role in relation to problems of crime in this society. It also deals with the fundamental need for the National Crime Authority to be working cooperatively with other law enforcement agencies, particularly the AFP.
Even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) acknowledges the need for significantly increased resources for law enforcement. On 17 February, he gave a speech at the Asian regional conference of Interpol in which he said:
Last year, my Government commissioned a study by the accountants Deloittes to look at AFP resource management practices. Their report makes clear that there is a need for additional funds in the short term . . . 
They are the Prime Minister's own words. Yet as we look at the important strategic partnerships the NCA has, we see a very dim picture indeed. For example, on 5 November last year, the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police wrote to the NCA in relation to the secondment of AFP officers to the NCA. It was made abundantly clear that the AFP's critical staffing levels in eastern and southern regions preclude any additional resources to the NCA coming from those regions for the very important tasks with which the NCA relies on the AFP for assistance. In the reply that the General Manager of Operations of the NCA sent back to the Deputy Commissioner, he made the following very pertinent remark:
I hope that in the not too distant future, the NCA and the AFP are funded to a level sufficient to accommodate joint work across the country.
That is a very stinging criticism, I believe, of this government's failure to provide the resources that are needed if people are serious about attacking crime in this society. In fact, the AFP, as the principal strategic partner of the NCA, is in a quite bizarre financial position.
An internal minute dated 28 January 1998 prepared in the AFP says that, of the $18.1 million budget shortfall for this current year, half is to be made up by a delay in payment 
 of invoices and credit card accounts. What a shameful way to run the principal law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth. The internal minute says:
Naturally management of deferred expenditure should occur in consultation with suppliers.
I am sure trade creditors throughout the country will be delighted that the Commonwealth's largest law enforcement body is actually going to consult them about deferring its expenditure. It goes on to say:
Expenditure placed on the Australian Government Credit Card . . . after the close of business on 21 May 1998 will not appear on an American Express statement requiring payment this financial year.
What a disgraceful way for the government to run the affairs of fundamental law enforcement agencies like the Australian Federal Police that are central to the operations of the NCA. It really is an absolute sham.
The consultant's report by Deloittes, to which the Prime Minister referred in his speech to Interpol, makes it abundantly clear that, indeed, the Prime Minister is right: there are short-term financial problems of some significance for law enforcement in this country. But they are nothing compared with the problems that are going to arise by the year 2000. In the year 2000, there will be a range of massive demands on law enforcement in this country, the Olympic Games not being the least. There will be the Paralympics, the Pacrim Conference, the World Economic Forum and the centenary of Federation.
In that year, however, 85 per cent of AFP members who accepted fixed term appointments in 1990 have those appointments expire on 1 July. If they choose not to accept reappointment, they become eligible for their superannuation payouts with dramatic consequences for the Commonwealth law enforcement budget. So we have lip service from the government about the importance of resources and we have lip service from the government about the importance of proper coordination and cooperation between Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, but nothing of satisfaction has been done.

"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-03-09,"—by leave—I was hoping that the member for Moore (Mr Filing) would contri 
 bute to the debate, but I understand he has indicated that he does not intend to. So I would like to take the opportunity to make a few more remarks in the time that has been allocated for consideration of this NCA committee report by the parliament.
I am a little disappointed, although I understand, that the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) would take the opportunity for some political point scoring, particularly in view of the kind remarks I made about him earlier and about the contribution he makes to the committee. I do not resile from those remarks for a moment, but I do need to say that I am as concerned as he—and I think every member of this parliament and everyone in the nation would be—that law enforcement authorities are adequately funded for their tasks.
I did notice these remarks by Commissioner Comrie in this morning's Age: `We've lost drug war'. The police commissioner is quite entitled to come to that view. I do not think we have lost the drug war. There are concerns that we are not winning the drug war, but that does not necessarily mean we have lost it or, in other words, that we should concede defeat. I think it means that the war is still going and that we need to prosecute that war with all of the resources and with all of the energy that we have available to us.
As I said earlier, the NCA joint committee is completing a detailed evaluation of the NCA's activities over the last 10 years or so, and that report will be brought down in this parliament on 30 March, I hope. The question of resources will be looked at in the context of that report, and the member for Maribyrnong will make, I am sure, a very good contribution to the committee's consideration of that report.
The committee is a very representative committee because it has not only representatives of the two major parties but also the Independent member for Moore; Senator Stott Despoja, the Deputy Leader of the Democrats; and a representative of the National Party. In many respects, this particular committee, with both senators and members of all parties, including Independents, is a very representative committee. In the end, I think the com 
 mittee will be fairly unanimous in the sorts of recommendations it brings down.
The question of resources is an important one. The Australian people expect the Commonwealth government and the state governments to be taking this so-called `war' against drugs very seriously. I think the contribution this committee report makes towards achieving that will be very important.
The other thing I should say is that I do not resile from using the word `war' against drugs. There are people who are the so-called promoters of drug law reform, but we need to understand that, when people talk about drug law reform, they are mostly talking about softer laws on drugs, not harder laws. I do not resile for one moment from using the word `war', because it is a war that we are fighting against drugs in this country. It is as much a war as a war would be if an external aggressor started to attack our nation. People who push, traffic in and sell drugs to our kids are undermining the fundamental liberties and freedoms which we enjoy in our country as much as an enemy that attacked our shores in some other way. So it is a war and it is a war that we must win. More importantly, I am yet to be convinced that it is a war that we cannot win.
The resourcing of law enforcement agencies—including the National Crime Authority—is an important element of winning that war. I believe, along with the member for Maribyrnong, my committee and every member in this House, that if our law enforcement agencies are to be effective, they have to be adequately resourced. As I said, the committee will comment in detail on the NCA and its resources in the report that it brings down.
Let us not think we can get a result cheaply, because people who are trafficking drugs and importing drugs into this country are highly motivated, highly organised and highly efficient—they have all the latest technology. If we are to be effective in combating it, the law enforcement agencies which are charged with the task of stopping them, preventing them, frustrating them—however you want to put it—must be equally capable of doing the task. After my recent visit to the United States where I spent some more time with the 
 FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, I am more convinced than ever of the need for law enforcement agencies to have adequate resources to do the job.

I did notice these remarks by Commissioner Comrie in this morning's Age: `We've lost drug war'. The police commissioner is quite entitled to come to that view. I do not think we have lost the drug war. There are concerns that we are not winning the drug war, but that does not necessarily mean we have lost it or, in other words, that we should concede defeat. I think it means that the war is still going and that we need to prosecute that war with all of the resources and with all of the energy that we have available to us.
As I said earlier, the NCA joint committee is completing a detailed evaluation of the NCA's activities over the last 10 years or so, and that report will be brought down in this parliament on 30 March, I hope. The question of resources will be looked at in the context of that report, and the member for Maribyrnong will make, I am sure, a very good contribution to the committee's consideration of that report.
The committee is a very representative committee because it has not only representatives of the two major parties but also the Independent member for Moore; Senator Stott Despoja, the Deputy Leader of the Democrats; and a representative of the National Party. In many respects, this particular committee, with both senators and members of all parties, including Independents, is a very representative committee. In the end, I think the com 
 mittee will be fairly unanimous in the sorts of recommendations it brings down.
The question of resources is an important one. The Australian people expect the Commonwealth government and the state governments to be taking this so-called `war' against drugs very seriously. I think the contribution this committee report makes towards achieving that will be very important.
The other thing I should say is that I do not resile from using the word `war' against drugs. There are people who are the so-called promoters of drug law reform, but we need to understand that, when people talk about drug law reform, they are mostly talking about softer laws on drugs, not harder laws. I do not resile for one moment from using the word `war', because it is a war that we are fighting against drugs in this country. It is as much a war as a war would be if an external aggressor started to attack our nation. People who push, traffic in and sell drugs to our kids are undermining the fundamental liberties and freedoms which we enjoy in our country as much as an enemy that attacked our shores in some other way. So it is a war and it is a war that we must win. More importantly, I am yet to be convinced that it is a war that we cannot win.
The resourcing of law enforcement agencies—including the National Crime Authority—is an important element of winning that war. I believe, along with the member for Maribyrnong, my committee and every member in this House, that if our law enforcement agencies are to be effective, they have to be adequately resourced. As I said, the committee will comment in detail on the NCA and its resources in the report that it brings down.
Let us not think we can get a result cheaply, because people who are trafficking drugs and importing drugs into this country are highly motivated, highly organised and highly efficient—they have all the latest technology. If we are to be effective in combating it, the law enforcement agencies which are charged with the task of stopping them, preventing them, frustrating them—however you want to put it—must be equally capable of doing the task. After my recent visit to the United States where I spent some more time with the 
 FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, I am more convinced than ever of the need for law enforcement agencies to have adequate resources to do the job.

That this House:
(1)	 notes that the withdrawal of the operational subsidy to community based child care centres has caused a significant detrimental impact including:
(a)	 the need for child care centres to increase fees between 11 and 15 per cent per week;
(b)	 causing a number of families to reduce their hours of child care or leave the child care service altogether; and
(c)	 causing child care centres to (i) reduce administration hours, (ii) reduce staff or replace staff with lower qualified staff, (iii) curtail services to infants such as nappy services, (iv) either withdraw or reduce the quality of meals and drinks provided to children, (v) reduce the amount of spending on equipment and materials and (vi) reduce the extent of building and outdoor maintenance;
(2)	 calls on the Minister for Family Services to refer issues relating to the withdrawal of the operational subsidies to the appropriate House of Representatives committee with such terms of reference to include investigation of the impact of the loss of operational funding on 
 community based long day care centres and families who use that service;
(3)	 further calls on the Minister for Family Services to increase the child care assistance ceiling for child care services to better reflect the actual cost of care; and
(4)	 calls on the Government to immediately reinstate the $350 million taken from the children's services program in 1997-98 so that high quality affordable child care can be maintained and monitored.
We may all recall, in the course of the last election campaign, the photograph of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) sitting in the sandpit surrounded by children. As politicians, we can readily detect his motives for doing that. Before the Prime Minister had his facelift, when he still had bushy eyebrows, one possible motive could have been to appear as a cute little gnome sitting among the children. But we all know the reality. The reality was that the Prime Minister was wanting to convey an image of being concerned about children and child care. If the Prime Minister was a little gnome sitting among the children for the purposes of that photograph, he has since been quite a naughty little gnome because, effectively, he has bent down, grabbed a handful of sand and chucked it in the face of the children and in the faces of the mothers who patronise child-care services.
The government has removed some $851 million from the sector over a four-year period. They are not my numbers; they are numbers provided by the Department of Health and Family Services to a Senate estimates committee hearing on 8 October last year. Attacks have occurred in a number of areas, but the focus of my motion today, in particular, is on the removal of the operational subsidy for family based day care centres. These are non-profit centres—their name reflects reality. They are run by the community with the input of parents and often, indeed usually, by local councils.
Overnight, on 1 July 1997, about $160 million was stripped away from the community based day care centres by removing the operational subsidy component. The government's rationale for doing so was part of its marketplace philosophy, the so-called 
 free market, allowing the free market forces to prevail. They said, on the one hand, that it was going to encourage the community based day care centres to compete with private centres; on the other hand, they said that it would remove a benefit flowing to the community based day care centres which was not available to the private sector. What has happened is that the playing field has not been evened up; the playing field has been elevated significantly because the community based day care centres have put up their fees and the private centres have come up to match them. So parents across the board are now having to pay higher fees. In addition, the lead that was being set by community based day care centres in terms of quality has been significantly impeded and eroded. They were effectively the standard setters in the sector.
In support of that, I refer to a survey which was undertaken by St George Advocates for Children which covers centres not only in my electorate of Barton and in the electorate of Banks and Watson, which are Labor-held electorates, but also in the electorates of Hughes and Cook. They have revealed that removal of the operational subsidy has resulted in increases of between 11 and 15 per cent in these centres. In dollar terms, that is between $16 and $20 a week. On average, the report shows that 104 families have reduced their hours of care due to those increases, 12 families plan to leave the centres, 16 families have already left the centres, most centres have reduced staff, other centres have reduced administration hours, and many plan to replace more qualified staff with less qualified staff.
Most centres have restricted or withdrawn their nappy services. A lot have withdrawn meals and drinks. Three services have indicated that they will be reducing their spending on purchases and upgrade of equipment. Maintenance has been severely curtailed. One centre has cut its expenditure on maintenance by some three-quarters. The survey concludes:
. . . since the loss of operational subsidy to community based long day care centres . . . the issue of affordability has created a major problem for community based centres and has caused many families to reduce hours of care, to leave the centre 
 and find alternative informal types of care. Informal care is likely to be unregulated and is not required to meet the health, safety and quality standards of regulated care.
Those figures are consistent not only with a survey undertaken by the Australian Services Union in Melbourne but also with a survey undertaken by the Council of Social Services in New South Wales which conducted a survey across that state. Alarmingly, many community based care centres are now finding it necessary to get out of the very early naught to two-year-old category where there is a chronic need for services.
As the Weekend Australian reported on 28 February, there are a growing number of parents who are withdrawing their children from care altogether. Centres that had a two-year waiting list are now struggling to get enough children to break even. Parents who are strapped for cash because of current economic circumstances are literally having to put their children into backyard centres. We are seeing the phenomenon of warehousing, which has been much criticised in the United States, and it is Australia's future generation that is being warehoused.
More and more women are moving from full-time into part-time employment or, indeed, giving up work altogether. That is a chronic loss of talent and productivity for a nation. As family incomes are declining because of one parent coming out of the work force, that itself is placing additional strains on the social security system. In some cases, child care for families is now up to about $9,000 a year—which is exceeding private school fees in many circumstances. Bearing in mind that that commutes to something like $15,000 to $18,000 on a gross level, a woman has to earn $15,000 to $18,000 before she breaks even to make working worth while. This is because of these higher charges that have come about under the government's regime.
What is the response of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman)? Senator Newman is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 31 January 1998 as accusing the community sector of becoming `politically motivated'. It is a dangerous animal, isn't it? 
 It is a very dangerous animal: when it is attacked it defends itself. They have every right to defend themselves because this government is trying to impose a form of social engineering to take Australia back to the 1950s. But the traditional family values, 1950s style, simply cannot exist in an era when double-income families are not only the norm but often the necessity. While those on the other side of the House may not need two pay packets, that is increasingly an impossible dream for most Australians. Almost half of the families using community based day care centres have an income of less than $20,000, and only 20 per cent have an income of more than $50,000. There is no question that most families—
—They will benefit from the GST though, won't they?
—They will benefit a lot when that is added on top won't they, as the member for Hunter says. The facts of the matter are that parents using day care centres are using them because of necessity. As the member for Hunter says, if a GST comes about, there will be an additional hike on top of the existing hike; there will be a multiplier effect. Fundamentally, this government has taken $851 million out of the sector. But when we are talking about a sector, we are talking about individuals. We are talking about children whose opportunities are going to be impeded because child care is a springboard for education.
Mothers are the most selfless individuals who exist on the earth and, if we as elected representatives cannot do our bit to give them a hand during these demanding times when they have young children, we are failing dramatically in our responsibility to our electorates. This is a matter of such vital significance to the future of Australia that it needs to be examined by the entire community before irreparable damage is done. I call on all members to support the motion.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—I rise today in response to the motion from the member for Barton (Mr McClelland). The member for Barton has come into this House 
 today and has accused community based child-care centres of providing poor quality service to many Australian families who use their facilities. Even on face value, it is an absolutely preposterous statement to question the care and service that these centres provide.
I remember that late last year the member for Barton came into this House and put a similar motion, only this time he was complaining about outside school hours care. On that occasion—I would just like to refresh your memory—the member for Barton came to the conclusion that, as a result of this government's legislation, young children would be automatically left at home alone, unsupervised for long hours, before and after school care.
The member for Barton spoke about mothers and how selfless they are. As a mother I find that the statement that you have made is absolutely outrageous. To think that a parent would leave a child at home unsupervised is just inconceivable. Parents must provide and care for their children's safety. That is the very thing you undertake when you become a parent—to care for their safety and their care. Some months later, here he is again, uninformed about the basis on which these government reforms are taking place. This time he is questioning whether community based child-care centres can provide quality services. I think that child-care centres across Australia will strive to ensure that quality service will continue to be provided.
In fact, these child-care centres need to meet certain requirements under the accreditation system. Yes, there is an accreditation system out there. I just might bring it to the member for Barton's attention. The accreditation system deals with aspects of quality improvement, and the accreditation system is centred on 52 principles, which include the interactions among children, staff and parents, the health and safety aspects of the centre, as well as staff development and coordination of programs to suit the needs of children. In determining the system of principles, there is a five-step process which involves registration, self-assessment of those involved in 
 child-care centres, and reviews by experienced child-care practitioners. It is overseen by the National Child Care Accreditation Council which maintains standards in all areas—private and community based.
The member for Barton's comments completely disregard accreditation requirements. He disregards the inequalities which previously existed in the child-care sector, and he disregards the fact that for 13 years the Labor Party struggled to come to grips with this issue. There was a huge growth in this sector, and you did absolutely nothing. When debating this very important issue here today, it is very important that we put the facts on the line. That is what it is all about—the facts—isn't it? The growth in this sector over the last 10 years has been enormous. Over the past 21 years, the number of women in the paid work force with dependent children under the age of 15 has actually increased from 44 per cent to 60 per cent.
It is important to acknowledge the role of community based child-care centres. It is also worth while to reiterate the point that this was a scheme that was introduced by the McMahon government in 1972—yes, a Liberal government brought this in. It was needed at that time for a particular reason. There have been a lot of changes in the social make-up of this country since then, particularly in relation to the fact that 60 per cent of long day care places are provided by the private sector.
The member for Barton today spoke about women's issues, about how important motherhood is and about the wonderful role that mothers have in the community. One of the other issues that the member for Barton spoke about today was women going from full-time work to part-time work. I wish to add my comment that it is one of the best things that has happened to the workplace environment. Women now can balance their lives, family and work commitments.
I was one of those women. I worked in full-time positions and then I worked in part-time positions when my children were younger. Women go through different life cycles and it is important that they balance those needs. There are people on our side of politics who 
 do have to rely on two pay packets. I was one of those women as well. To say that we do not have to rely on two pay packets is an absolutely outrageous statement. It is tough. Families do have to work—both partners have to work—in this current environment.
However, this government has allocated $4.9 billion to the sector over four years. I do not know where you got your figures from, but let me state to you that this government has allocated $1.2 billion this year—an increase of 18 per cent since Labor's last year in office—to this sector. This government has committed to an extra 83,000 places over four years. And why did we need to make these reforms? We needed to clean up the terrible mess that the previous government left us. It is hypocritical of the member for Barton to come in here and lecture us on something that has been a chronic problem for 13 years.
There was no formal planning in the industry. Members of the opposition know as well as I do that there was no logical system or framework. Speaking as the mother of two children, I found the system absolutely incomprehensible. I could not understand it at all. There was an oversupply in many areas; there was an undersupply in others. I was on endless waiting lists trying to get my children into child-care centres near my home or my place of work. I had to drive from one end of town to the other to get my children in an adequate child-care centre and it drove me absolutely crazy. Now you are telling me that it did not matter that the system kept operating under those conditions. I have to tell you that I did not really care whether they were community based child-care centres or whether they were private child-care centres; I just needed a child-care centre. There was a need for child-care centres to service the demands of the community.
The Labor Party's policy is that a lot of these decisions are based on theory. However, theory does not always work in practice. The Labor Party provided the majority of assistance to the community based sector. This coalition government has heeded the concerns of the sector and we have provided far more of a level playing field and far more support to the industry. How can you argue with this 
 government's reform when for many years the industry was unchecked and unbalanced when you were in power? We are talking about an industry that has been crying out for reform for years. The member for Barton would be aware that private operations do not receive operational subsidies and are still able to provide a high quality standard of care and service. In fact, what makes the statements by the member for Barton even more amazing is the fact that the Labor Party and other parties in the Senate have enabled the passage of the legislation.
This government's measures will ensure that significant numbers of new places will be located in neighbourhoods and communities where there is high need and high demand. The removal of operational subsidy will remove the imbalance in government subsidies which exists between community based and private centres. The government has also provided additional funding to enable these centres to obtain expert advice to assist them to manage the loss of operational subsidies and to allow them to meet the transitional arrangements.
It is important to again highlight six of the principles behind the government's child-care reforms. Firstly, low and middle income families need to be assisted to meet the cost of child care. Secondly, families in like circumstances should be all treated the same, regardless of what type of child care is being used. Thirdly, what the government has done will ensure that assistance for school age children will be the same, regardless of what service families choose to use. Whether it is family day care, long day care centres or outside school care centres, it is important for these changes to be followed through. Parents' needs and individual requirements will be able to be dealt with in a much more flexible way. Fourthly, what the government has done will also provide extra resources to assist children with disabilities who are in care—let us not forget about those children who have very special needs. The provision of additional support in geographical areas is something that was never tackled by the previous government. Fifthly, the government is determined to provide a high level of child 
 care. It is important that centres providing quality services continue to receive strong support. In addition, $12.3 million has been provided for the needs of these children. The government has introduced better planning to meet areas of greatest need, and better equity by withdrawal of the operational subsidy.
The second part of the member for Barton's motion calls for a House of Representatives committee review into government decisions. For the information of the member for Barton, I point out to him that there already is a committee: the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, under the chairmanship of one of your own, actually—Senator Bishop. He is presently calling for submissions for an inquiry into child-care funding. You really should talk to some of your members a bit more often—you might get some wonderful information.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I am rather intrigued by the approach of the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). She got to her feet before defaulting to her government document—her written speech—and attacked the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) for questioning the quality of care provided by the community based sector—something he never did at any time. The Hansard  record will show that to be the case. Then she went on a vicious attack on the very sector that she suggested the member for Barton was attacking. She went on to question the quality of care given by the community based sector. Then she expressed her absolute naivety by referring to the member for Barton's previous speech with respect to out of school hours care, questioning his suggestion that kids will be left at home alone.
How naive is the member for Petrie? Is she not aware of newspaper articles not long ago which showed that parents were leaving their kids in cars in casino car parks? Does she believe that parents will leave their kids locked in cars in casino car parks, but will not, even when forced by financial pressure, send their kids home to an empty house? How naive is that?
The member for Petrie says that this is about competition and lifting the game of the community based sector. The idea of competi 
 tion reflects the ideology that lies behind this scheme—an obsession with the private sector. The member for Petrie referred to the child-care sector as an industry. That is the way they see it; it is just another industry. They get out the micro-economic textbook, apply the graphs—supply and demand and marginal cost curves—and then they say that Cessnock or Singleton should no longer be entitled to a community based child-care centre. How ridiculous, when we are talking about the health and wellbeing of tomorrow's community leaders.
Let me tell the member for Petrie about the effect of government cuts to operational subsidies on child-care centres in my electorate. The honourable member must understand that additional impacts stem from these decisions in rural and regional Australia. The member for Barton talked about the existing infrastructure and the need to maintain it because, once it is lost, it is lost forever. Let me give some examples.
In Muswellbrook, the abolition of the child-care operational subsidy will cost the centre $33,000 per annum, or 9.4 per cent of its operational budget. In Singleton, it is $42,000 or 11.5 per cent of its operational budget. In Cessnock, it is $40,000 or 9.3 per cent. In Beresfield, it is a whopping $54,000 a year out of the operating budget—a massive cut of 12 per cent. In Kurri Kurri, it is $40,000, and I am not sure about the percentage in terms of its budget; but in Thornton, it is $39,000 or 12 per cent of the operational budget.
In Thornton, that means that the centre has been forced to increase its fees not by $20 a week, not by $25 a week—which is probably the average—but by a massive $45 a week. That is $90 a week out of the budget of a family with two children. I have with me 130 letters, which I intend to submit to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today, from Thornton residents who are desperate to retain that child-care centre. Those people do not have access to public transport. They do not have another child-care centre within cooee.
The member for Petrie says that there is going to be new competition, but there is no motive for private sector competition in Thornton because the numbers and the bucks 
 simply are not there. That is why it is necessary for the community sector to come in and fill the void. Government members do not seem to understand how important child care is to families, particularly when both parents are working. They must understand that.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,1998-03-09,"—Before I address the motion on child care of the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), I would like to remark on some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), on the obsession which this government has with privatisation. When the Labor Party was in government it led the obsession with privatisation, whether it was with Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank—that sacred cow—the AIDC, or the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory. The Labor Party was the leader in it, and so those comments are the ultimate in hypocrisy.
I will now return to the subject of this motion, on which the previous speaker did not elucidate very well at all. Our child-care policies are all about fairness. In the Richmond electorate there are more than 50 registered long-term day care centres. At the outset, I point out to members of the House that I have spoken directly with many of the directors and have visited many of those centres.	I have spoken to staff and parents in my electorate, including those at the Rainbow Children's Centre in Ballina, Joey's Pouch in Murwillumbah and Pippies Early Childhood Centre in Bogangar, to name a few. They are all providing care and a safe environment for under-5s in which they can grow, play and share.
This environment is also provided by private child-care centres and family day care centres. I am in contact with many throughout my electorate, including Ballina Kiddi Care Centre, Rosella's Children's Centre in Murwillumbah, Alstonville Early Learning Centre and some in Bilambil. For many years, community child-care centres have had the benefit of additional government funding in the form of the operational subsidy—the $20 per child—which the private sector clearly has not received. In effect, this has meant that the 
 average person in the street—the taxpayer—has been subsidising this service, which provides funding to less than one-third of child-care centres nationally.
—Are you opposing the motion?
—In my electorate of Richmond—and the member for Hunter might learn something—where more than 2,100 children are in care each weekday, only 10 per cent of places are in centres that are receiving the operational subsidy: 1,747 places in private, community and family care centres, and only 170 through the community based centres.
The opposition talks about the impact on low income earners. The seat of Richmond has one of the lowest income levels—under $20,000—of any seats, unlike the affluent seats that those opposite represent. You should look at the demographics. With the withdrawal of the operational subsidy, will this mean that lower income families will not be able to afford quality child care? The operational subsidy was never beneficial to 90 per cent of the children in the Richmond electorate. Low income families have, by choice, sent their children to private day care centres. So good luck to those who wished to send them to community day care centres.
I was amazed that the member for Barton talked about the necessity for an inquiry. As the member for Petrie has already mentioned, an inquiry has already been set up. I refer the member for Barton to that inquiry, which is being chaired by an opposition senator, Senator Bishop—not to be confused with former Senator Bishop. Submissions to that inquiry close on 20 March, so I hope you put a submission in to your own people and that they take it as evidence.
Let us look at the figures on child care as far as the federal government is concerned. There has been an 18 per cent increase since the Labor Party lost office. Some $1.2 billion has been allocated this year: over $280 million for New South Wales, and over $4.9 billion in the next four years.
—Do you oppose the motion? 
—These are important facts that the previous speaker might learn something from: 83,000 places over the next four years. I contrast this to the 13 years of deficit spending by the previous Labor Party government. We got to this mess in the first place through the $10 million deficit which the previous government created. We could have used its approach and put it all on bankcard.
—Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 101.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Last Saturday I attended the 75th annual Blacktown Show. The first Blacktown Show was opened in 1923 by the then New South Wales Premier, Jack Lang. So this show maintains a direct link with the history of the region. The show contains the usual activities such as sideshows, woodchopping, poultry, farm products and cattle exhibits.
The New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery, who opened the show, stated that there was still considerable agricultural activity in the Blacktown local government area. In fact, there is farm production valued at $70 million at the farm gate being generated by this region. The local government area of Blacktown also contains one of the largest single dairy farms in New South Wales. I congratulate the show president, Barnie Gallen, and his hardworking committee on an excellent run event. Barnie has been the show president for the past 30 years—a great achievement.
Blacktown is one of the fastest growing regions of Australia, with a population of 236,000 hardworking and loyal Australians who have gathered to live there from more than 147 nations. As well as its agricultural history, Blacktown now has a large manufacturing and industrial base established with major industries such as BHP, BTR, Sharp, 
 Sanyo and the very famous engineering firm Transfield all contributing to the industrial and economic development of Australia. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Blacktown Show</title>,Statements by Members,3,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 condemns the persecution of all religious minorities around the world;
(2)	 deplores the long lasting plight of the Christian minorities in Turkey involving discrimination against those minorities to freely practice their religion and culture; and
(3)	 requests the Government of Turkey, in the interests of secularism and respect for minorities to:
(a)	 make it easier for all Christian denominations to be recognised as official churches and to have clear legal rights with regard to property ownership;
(b)	 allow the opening of the Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic seminaries which were forcibly closed in 1971 and permit other Christian denominations such as the Syrian Orthodox to have seminaries as well;
(c)	 abolish the special tax imposed on Christian institutions;
(d)	 preserve Christian monuments and cease the destruction or desecration of Christian churches, monasteries and other religious monuments;
(e)	 provide more protection for the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox church in Istanbul and Armenian and Greek Christian churches in Turkey, against possible further attacks by Islamic extremists;
(f)	 return to the Armenian Protestant Church all property that was taken from it including money that the Armenians were forced to pay; and
(g)	 not interfere in the selection of church leaders or in the affairs of the Christian communities, in particular the operations of schools.
I wish to bring to the attention of this House the discrimination and persecution of Christian minorities in the Republic of Turkey. This continuous abrogation of the most basic human rights is an appalling indictment on the Turkish government—a government which is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a member of the United Nations.
Turkey's breaches of international agreements to respect and protect minorities are 
 brazen and without shame. Historically this is linked to the incomprehensible denial by the Turkish government that the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in the early part of this century ever took place, despite compelling evidence to the contrary. Coupled with the killing and expulsion of 1.5 million Greeks, the Turkish government's track record on protecting basic human and civil rights is shameful and deplorable.
Despite being a secular state since 1920, the Turkish government has abandoned the welfare of non-Muslim minorities. Early this century, Turkey was home to 12 million Christians. Today, barely 100,000 Christians are left. It was estimated in 1992 that some 60,000 were Armenian Orthodox and about 3,500 were Greek Orthodox.
The honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland), who in the spirit of bipartisanship will second this motion, has agreed to speak in detail on the plight of the Greek community in Turkey. I wish to concentrate on the continued harassment and humiliation of the Armenian community in Turkey. The Armenian community has settled in the rural and remote regions of Turkey. Their isolation from the world, and subsequently international scrutiny, has put them in a state of virtual servitude to their Turkish neighbours.	At the turn of this century, some 2.5 million Armenians lived in their ancestral lands in eastern Turkey, where they established a rich and vibrant culture. This was annihilated in the horrific Armenian genocide of 1915-1922. Entire Armenian communities were transported to death camps in the Syrian desert. Many Armenians who were not executed in their homes and villages were forced to march to their deaths.
Armenian males were conscripted into the Ottoman army and placed in labour battalions, where they were literally worked to death. Women, children and the elderly were rounded up and subjected to horrific atrocities. Some were raped, some were massacred and some were forcibly converted to Islam. For those lucky to survive, most were deported from their ancestral homes and exiled. When the genocide ended, 1.5 million Armenians had been killed and thousands more had been 
 displaced. Every successive Turkish government has denied that this genocide ever occurred. In Ankara, there is even a mausoleum honouring the man who had the dubious honour of coordinating this mass extermination and deportation. The killings and deportations may have stopped, but the harassment and discrimination continues unchecked to this day.
In the 1920s, in flagrant disregard of the terms of the 1923 Lausanne treaty to protect the rights of minorities, the Turkish government passed a series of laws specifically directed at the Armenian community. Those who had left their villages during World War I were forbidden to return and individuals were prevented from reclaiming property. Since the 1930s, literally hundreds of Armenian religious and cultural monuments in historic Armenian provinces in eastern Turkey have been destroyed, and the preservation of what remains as symbolic cultural artefacts prohibited.
Although permitted to own property, a law passed in 1942 introduced a one-off tax on capital. After assessing property held by Armenians at greatly inflated values, many were forced to sell businesses and other assets to pay the tax. For those who could not raise sufficient money, a concentration camp awaited where many became ill or died. Today, a five per cent control tax is imposed on all minority-owned property, even though the law was officially repealed in 1980. A 1970s regulation in effect forbids most non-Turkish institutions from owning property purchased after 1936. This has led to the further confiscation of churches and schools without compensation.
An Armenian child cannot attend an Armenian school unless the child has completed the previous year in an Armenian school. Discontinuing attendance results in exclusion, and the child must complete his or her education in a Turkish school. Only Armenian language classes can be given in Armenian, and all classroom inscriptions are in Turkish. Outspoken Armenians cannot become teachers or administrators in schools. Furthermore, an ethnically Turkish vice-principal is appointed to each school, and their consent is required 
 by the Armenian principal for every suggested initiative.
In the late 1980s, Armenian churches were closed for reasons of safety by the same authorities who refused to approve building repair applications. The Armenian church was denied a seminary in which to train clergymen, and the Turkish authorities have interfered in the election of Armenian church leaders. In another insidious form of ethnic cleansing, in a village in Erzurum a former Armenian church is currently being converted into a mosque. Only last Friday, reports were sent from occupied northern Cyprus that the Turkish government was intending to convert a former Armenian church into a hotel.
Isolated acts of violence by individual Armenians and organisations outside Turkey in the 1970s and 1980s were seized on by the Turkish government to heighten anti-Armenian sentiment. A wave of hostility towards the Armenian community swept the country. Violent attacks on the Armenian Patriarchate, churches and schools became commonplace.
The acts of intimidation perpetuated by the Turkish government have a clear purpose—to destabilise the core institutions of the Armenian and other Christian minorities. These communities are unsettled by continual attempts to undermine the ability of churches and schools to function properly. An air of uneasiness and disquiet has descended on these people. These constraints on their fundamental human rights have taken their toll on community and family life. And while 1.5 million Armenians can never be brought back, the international community has an obligation and a duty to protect Christian minorities living in Turkey and to guard against the risk that such atrocities may occur again.
Mr Deputy Speaker, today in the gallery we are joined by a large number of representatives from the Armenian community in my electorate and from the Greek community all around Australia. I would like to welcome them here today because they, too, represent part of the protest at what the Turkish government is doing. As the representative in this House of the largest Armenian community in Australia, I can confirm the determination of 
 this community to continue to place an international spotlight on the Turkish violations of human rights. We in the House of Representatives today join with others around the world, including the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in condemning the ongoing discrimination and harassment of Christian minorities in Turkey.
The Armenian diaspora scattered around the world is living testament to the failure of the Ottoman Empire to exterminate the Armenian people. I urge my colleagues to consider the obligations we owe to communities who are suffering as the Armenians and the Greeks in Turkey are suffering and join with me in vociferously supporting this motion.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I second the motion, with honour. I join with the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) in welcoming members of the Armenian and Greek communities to this House. It is an important matter, not only for their communities but also, as I frame my debate, for the entire world. Indeed, I should add that not only were there literally in excess of 1½ million Armenians murdered in the early part of this century, but among them were some 400,000 Greeks who were lost in that genocide. But these are things that the Turkish government must account for regarding past conduct. What we are looking at today is what they should be doing in the present day and age.
After the Second World War, the international community realised that human rights extended beyond national boundaries. Indeed, the international community realised that there could not be world peace unless there was respect for fundamental human rights. So the nations which formed the United Nations gave attention, very early in the life of the United Nations, to very important treaties regarding fundamental human rights. We have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, more recently, the European Convention on Human Rights. There are many others that affect this area but, univer 
 sally, they focus on the rights of minorities. Those rights include the freedom of religion and the freedom to respect and uphold cultural identity.
In terms of Greeks residing in Turkey, these were not the first treaties to apply. In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne guaranteed a number of fundamental rights. Regrettably there is a significant creditability gap, however, between those signed and ratified treaties and the conduct that is displayed. Very recently, the Turkish Prime Minister is on record as saying that he is determined to end human rights abuses in Turkey. Motions such as this—and they are commonplace around the world—put him on notice that, increasingly, the international community is becoming impatient with that creditability gap between Turkey's pen and its actions in its own country.
The motion raises a number of issues to which I will speak briefly. The Turkish government fails to recognise certain Christian denominations and, as a consequence, those denominations are unable to hold real property. Indeed, the ownership by churches which do hold real property is frequently the subject of ambiguity. Buildings are often arbitrarily confiscated without any compensation being paid. There is clearly a need for the Turkish government to recognise all Christian denominations and guarantee them the right to hold property.
In 1971, as with the Armenians, the Turkish government closed the Halki Patriarchal School of Theology, which had existed since 1844. Because Turkish rule requires that the Patriarch and other clergy of the Greek Orthodox Church must be citizens of Turkey, that is a very serious problem indeed for the patriarchate. Because there is no long-term training facility for the clergy, there are no clergy from whom the patriarchate can draw. The hidden game of that strategy of cutting out the training base is designed to cause the extinction of the Greek Orthodox faith in Turkey. This motion justifiably calls for a reopening of those apostolic seminaries that were forcibly closed in 1971.
The member for North Sydney spoke of the special tax of about five per cent on Christian institutions, which tax is not justified in any 
 context other than that they are Christian institutions. Over the years, not paying that tax has resulted in countless abuses. Also, it has resulted in the confiscation of the property of those institutions that have been unable to meet the fee in a context where, as a result of intimidation and pressure, the populations of those churches are declining, thus making the burden of the taxation even more oppressive. The motion calls for the repeal of those taxes.
Recent history has demonstrated at least apathy to, at worst positive encouragement of, the destruction and desecration of some Christian churches and monasteries and other religious monuments. In respect of the Greek Orthodox faith, there have been statues desecrated, and even cemeteries, to the distress of relatives, have been desecrated. While it may appear perhaps more trivial, the facts of the matter are that the authorities have used church buildings from the Greek Orthodox faith and, I have no doubt, other Christian faiths for quite inappropriate ceremonies within those hallowed buildings. That has been very much an affront to the those of the Greek Orthodox faith.
The other way that the government is causing a decline in the significance of the religious institutions is to deliberately restrict the preservation of these buildings. They do this under the guise of a preservation order just as we have in many cities around Australia for the preservation of historical buildings of significance. But these preservation orders are framed in such a way that basic repairs and renovations to uphold and maintain the buildings have been prevented. Hence, decay is rapidly setting in. The motion calls for steps to preserve and maintain Christian monuments and buildings.
The Turkish government has over the years boasted that the presence of the ecumenical patriarchate of the Orthodox church in Istanbul is an example of its racial and religious tolerance. But the facts of the matter are that it has failed to give that patriarchate its proper respect and indeed it has failed to give appropriate and proper protection. There have been riots in the vicinity of the patriarchate that have infringed on the property. Indeed, 
 there was an attempt in 1993 to bomb the patriarchate. While those attempts were defused, it is quite clear that sufficient protection is not being given in a context where the Turkish government, through its propaganda, is evoking sentiments against the Greek Orthodox faith. The motion appropriately calls for proper protection for those Christian institutions.
There are also instances, which Mr Hockey, the member for North Sydney, has referred to, where property and money have been confiscated. It is often done under more clever guises—for instance, saying that a road widening plan is going through an area and therefore properties are being confiscated on that false premise. Indeed, history has shown that the premise has been false because a road widening has not occurred. Again, that is another method of acquisition.
The government itself has had a history of censoring and restricting proper administration. Again, the member for North Sydney spoke of arrangements in public schools whereby there is a dual principal arrangement so that one is appointed by the Turkish government and the books of the students are significantly censored, and whereby there is restriction on the teaching of Greek history and indeed the Greek language. That censorship applies to any newspapers espousing the Greek Orthodox faith. Many Australians would be quite astounded to know that even the candidates for the patriarchate have to be vetted by the Turkish government.
This is a situation which is totally unsatisfactory in the modern world when we are two years away from the 21st century. The Turkish government is on notice. It cannot hope to have full admission to the international community until it gets its house in order in terms of these human rights abuses.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Persecution of Religious Minorities</title>,Private Members' Business,6,1
"Dondas, Nick, MP",CLP,1998-03-09,"—Today I rise to speak about the ongoing persecution of Christian minorities in Turkey. I would like to congratulate the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) on this motion. It is an important and timely issue, and I have received several letters of support for its contents from many Greek and Armenian people in Australia. I would also 
 like to acknowledge representatives from the Greek and Armenian communities in Australia who are in the gallery. This is a very extended motion and unfortunately in the few minutes I have to speak to it I will speak only on (1) and (2), but I do support the whole motion.
Too often we take for granted the freedoms we enjoy in Australia. We go about our daily lives without interference from our government. We freely choose our schools that our children attend. We practise religion freely. We own property and are promoted on the basis of our ability, regardless of our ethnic background or religious beliefs. For those of the Christian faith in Turkey, this is not the case. Turkish government interference with Christian communities is not new. It has been going on for centuries.
Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you may be aware that I am of Greek origin. I am a second generation Australian. But during the course of my early boyhood days when growing up I was always advised of and schooled in the atrocities caused by the Turks on Greeks in Turkey. In fact, most of the Australian Greeks who came in the early 1900s had to change their names in order to get travel documents to move through Asia Minor or either come to Australia, or go to America, England or wherever they wanted to go. For example, they abbreviated their names to get passports.
When the island of Kastelorizo, where my forebears came from, was under Turkish control the children had to be schooled in secrecy in a monastery. In the monastery on top of the mountain on Kastelorizo there was a little passageway no bigger than the human body through which they were able to go into a very large cavern where they were schooled in the Greek religion and our culture.
Interference with the Christian community by the Turkish government is not new. The execution of nearly two million Armenian and Greek christians between 1914 and 1922 brought home the extent to which the government would go to create `Turkey for Turks'. In 1974 the invasion of Cyprus by the Turks, taking away the rights of those Cypriot Greeks to practise their culture and their 
 religion, was certainly something condemned by the United Nations at the time. Unfortunately, some 21 years later, that same situation exists—a disgrace that the Turkish community have obviously supported.
Christians in Turkey now constitute only about 0.2 per cent of the population. Sadly, as the numbers of Christians in Turkey fall, it becomes easy for the government to restrict their lives. There are many contemporary examples of this restriction. In 1970 the ministry of education prohibited prayers in minority schools. In 1984 a law was introduced that prohibited the establishment of schools for the teaching of religion. The time allotted to religious education is also tightly controlled. I am told that Christians are assigned a Turkish Muslim principal for every Christian one as only Turkish Muslims, not Christians, can be recognised as government officials.
The plight of Turkish Christians has often been overlooked as the world focuses on the persecution of the Turkish Kurds, who are fighting for a sovereign nation in the south west of the country. Turkey's Christians want to live in peace within the borders of Turkey. They do not ask for the overthrow of the Turkish government. They do not seek political sovereignty. All they ask for is the freedom to practise their religion in safety. This freedom is guaranteed by the Treaty of Lausanne signed in 1923, a treaty constantly ignored by the Turkish government.
The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe wrote to the Turkish Prime Minister, Mesut Yilmaz, on 24 February 1998 after a delegation visited Turkey, Greece and Cyprus to examine human rights in the region. The commission expressed concern over the continuing closure of the Halki seminary as well as, and I quote from their letter:
. . . the situation of other minority religions or beliefs, including Armenian and Syrian Orthodox believers, as well as Roman Catholics, Armenian, Chaldean Greek and Syrian Catholics, and Protestants who face various forms of discrimination and harassment.
I join with the international community in calling for the protection of Christian church 
 es and institutions in Turkey. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Persecution of Religious Minorities</title>,Private Members' Business,6,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—The motion that the House is debating this afternoon is an important motion because it says something about our country as well as the country we are talking about, Turkey. The motion essentially asks us to condemn the persecution of all religious minorities around the world and particularly the effects that the Turkish government are causing to Christian minorities in Turkey. Many people have come to this country from Turkey and from countries around it and are able, in this country, to share with people from all over the world their religious and political freedoms. In Turkey, that is not so.
The Turkish government is, at this stage, actively working against Christians in a financial way and earlier this century did it in a most inhumane and murderous way in that two million people were marched off and killed and whole communities were uprooted. Communities that had been living around the Bosphorus and the Black Sea for hundreds and hundreds of years were just obliterated. A whole culture was obliterated, and this was done by the Turkish government.
Turkey, as my colleague the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) said, has forgotten nothing and learnt nothing. In 1974, as he said, they invaded the island of Cyprus and started to do the same thing—moved people out, killed people and desecrated churches. There are still icons being sold on the international market which have been plundered from churches in northern Cyprus. Churches in northern Cyprus have been turned into barracks and have been turned into living quarters.
What the Turkish government did in Turkey they are now doing in northern Cyprus, and this is a country that expects to become part of the European Union shortly. Turkey is a member of NATO. Turkey is a country that puts its public face forward as a Western liberal democracy but beneath that public face there is a murderous anti-social, anti-Christian attitude. One does not expect that Turkey should become pro-Christian; one just expects that Christians in Turkey should have the 
 same rights as people of the Islamic faith have in other Western countries.
What we are asking for is that people have the same rights—that Christians in Turkey should have the same rights that Turkish people have here in Australia. That is not asking much. I think, as I am sure my colleagues do, that this parliament should have a point of view on that, that the Australian people, through their representatives here, should say that. While it is not normal that we have a vote on matters of private members business, I think today on this matter we should. So that we can do that, I move:
That the question be now put.

"Hanson, Pauline, MP",IND,1998-03-09,"—Following my briefing from the Treasury on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment last week, I read the latest draft of the MAI, which is available on the Australian government Treasury Internet site. Having read this latest document, my original concerns regarding the effects of the MAI on the people of Australia have been reinforced and remain as strong as ever.
As it is not possible to download the text of the agreement from the Treasury Internet site onto a computer disk, it is very difficult and expensive to distribute the text of the treaty. Distributing the document is essential if the Australian people are to know what the government is negotiating and what that will mean for us all.
Also, the decision to examine the MAI through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is but a part of the cover-up and will not result in the concerns of ordinary Australians even getting a hearing, let alone being 
 taken into account. Fifteen of the 16 members of the joint committee will be appointed by the government or the opposition. We all know the Labor Party started negotiations on the MAI in May 1995. Both the coalition and the Labor Party have demonstrated their commitment to signing the treaty.
Despite requests, I could not obtain a list of any Australian government exemptions to the treaty from the Treasury or any detailed information from the Parliamentary Library. My having to rely on the Internet for information on the MAI caused me to make contact with representatives of the Canadian parliament for help. These contacts, made in desperation, have been by fax, e-mail and phone, and began late last year. It is scandalous that a member of the federal parliament has to go to such lengths.
My accusation of secrecy remains, and I put to the Australian people the question: if the MAI is so good, why is this government even now still keeping all the important parts secret? This is not an issue of national security, so why is there so much secrecy? What is it that the government does not want the Australian people to know?
I will detail some of my specific concerns with the treaty. Equal treatment for multinationals may sound warm and fuzzy, but this will make it illegal for Australian levels of government to favour a local company over a foreign company. There are many good reasons why we should be able to discriminate in favour of Australian companies. For example, it will even be illegal for a local council to favour a local business over a foreign company for council work, or for deals to be negotiated with the understanding that money will stay in the community. Instead of the money and employment going into the local area, the work could be performed by foreign labour and the profits repatriated overseas, most likely untaxed.
The subject of multinationals importing labour may seem unlikely, but just listen to this paragraph from page 16 of the draft MAI:
No contracting party may deny entry and stay as provided for by this article, or authorisation to work as provided for by paragraph 1 (a) of this article, for reasons relating to labour market or other 
 economic needs tests or numeric restrictions in national laws, regulations and procedures.
The treaty allows multinationals to bring in their own employees and their families, and we will have to give their spouses a work permit. Will these foreigners also get access to Medicare and other social security benefits? We have enough unemployment without multinationals bringing in their foreign workers.
As the Demtel man says, `But wait, there's more!' Under the MAI, no-one, not even the federal government, can attach conditions to foreigners who seek to establish themselves in Australia. For example, we will not be able to make a multinational use any Australian made components or domestic content. We will not be able to make a multinational establish a joint venture with any Australian company. We will not even be able to insist that multinationals employ any Australian people at all.
Within three years of signing this treaty, we will have to enter into negotiations to roll back and remove any current Australian laws that the multinationals do not like. Any exemptions the government proposes will likely be worthless in future and we will be forced to repeal them. The question of whether taxation constitutes a form of expropriation is not at all clear. As it stands, the Australian Taxation Office has already told us multinationals pay little or no tax now. If this agreement is signed in its current form, we may never be able to correct the pathetic situation of multinationals paying virtually no tax.
All levels of government in Australia are liable to be sued in the event of an infringement of multinationals' rights. Under the MAI it is compulsory for the government to enter into binding arbitration which will leave us, the Australia taxpayers, liable for damages and horrific fees. Under the protection from strife clause, the Australian people are also liable for any loss of profits resulting from a state of emergency. Just what exactly will that mean? As if this is not enough punishment for the innocent victims currently known as the Australian people, we will not be able to signal our wish to get out of the MAI for five years. After that, the treaty will continue in 
 effect for another 15 years. The Australian people must be made aware that we will be bound by this draconian agreement for at least 20 years.
Australia is currently very good to foreign investors and many, including me, would argue that we are too good and give too much away. We have many resources, we have a well-educated work force and we have fairly good infrastructure. Multinationals get the benefits of our natural resources, infrastructure, stable society and educated population without contributing. More and more Australians are becoming aware of these facts and they are getting angry and becoming tired of being used. It is time to make multinationals and foreigners pay their share of tax.
It must be acknowledged that, whilst some foreign investment may be good, foreign control is not. It must also be understood the majority of foreign investment buys up existing profitable Australian companies and downsizes the work force. Much of what the government says about the benefits of foreign investment is simply a lie. Australia has relied far too heavily on foreign capital in the past, and we are now paying the price of high unemployment, a failing society and less ability to control our destiny. I maintain the MAI is largely being negotiated in secret, but it is not in the best interests of Australians and will benefit only the multinationals in their push for a single world economy. In its current form, the MAI will hand over vast powers to multinational companies which will plunder our country on their terms and then bill us for their time.
Rather than relying forever on foreign capital, only worsening the situation, One Nation policies will reindustrialise Australia and embark on programs of self-sufficiency. We will create jobs in diverse industries and lift our living standards. In short, One Nation will arrest the social decay that it would seem is almost a government sponsored plan.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—The Higher Education  Funding Act 1988 makes provision for grants of financial assistance to higher education institutions and other bodies for higher education purposes. It also establishes the higher education contribution scheme and the open learning deferred payment scheme, and it makes provision for the repayment of moneys that are lent by the Commonwealth to students under those schemes.
The  Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  amends the act in order to seek to achieve a number of things. It seeks to set the maximum grant amount for operating purposes for higher education institutions for the funding years 1999 and 2000; to vary financial assistance payable to higher education institutions for superannuation expenditure for 1998; and to set an upper limit for the following two years.
The bill also seeks to vary the maximum aggregate amount of financial assistance which may be granted to higher education institutions in respect of their teaching hospitals for the 1998 funding year, and to vary the maximum aggregate amount which may be granted to higher education institutions for approved special capital projects for the 1998 funding year. There are a number of other sundry technical changes.
The bill also presents us with the opportunity to consider some of the broader issues in higher education. Last week, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training heard from the National Union of Students and 
 education unions. In the course of an inquiry into the appropriate role of TAFEs and how they relate to universities, we were told by representatives of both the student and teaching unions that no higher education contribution scheme or deferred payment scheme for TAFE should be considered, as this would discourage and deter people from going into TAFE. However, we have also heard that some institutions lend to students. Up to $500,000 a year is provided in some institutions in concessional fees. From what I can see, this compounds the problems for institutes drawing students from low income cohorts.
There has been a lot said in this place in the last two years about equity in relation to higher education, but it is worth the House remembering that about 15 per cent of higher education students come from families earning the bottom 25 per cent of household income. In contrast, about 40 per cent of the higher education dollar is currently being spent on students from the top 20 per cent of household income, with an average income of $84,000 per year. In other words, the working-class battlers of this country have been paying for the education of others in institutions that their own children are not likely to see the inside of. The government's changes to HECS now bring more equity to the system so that those who are the primary beneficiaries of a higher education now make a more appropriate contribution to it—still, I must say, only 25 per cent of the cost of higher education on average.
With fee paying places once government places are filled there are also now new opportunities for Australians who might otherwise miss out. It is worth the House remembering that, with all the rhetoric that has been said about up-front fees and fee paying places, about 360,000 students this year will face no up-front fees whatsoever. The government has also put in place around 1,000 positions for scholarships each year based on merit for disadvantaged students, particularly those from indigenous and rural backgrounds.
The total number of undergraduate positions continues to rise—by an estimated 17,000 
 between 1996 and 1997. The actual total Commonwealth funding for higher education in the 1997-99 triennium does not drop below what Labor spent in 1996. If you look at total revenue from all sources, 1997's funding for higher institutions exceeded 1995's by some $460 million. Full fee paying positions further enhance these opportunities.
Student contributions make students more discerning about both the quantity and the quality of education that they receive. They also force universities to focus much more on the needs and demands of students so that their activities relate much more to catering to the students rather than simply focus on existential survival, which, unfortunately, some universities have become preoccupied with in recent years.
It is worth the House also remembering with some of the criticisms levelled at the government in relation to changes to HECS that in 1988 when HECS was introduced about 186,151 students were affected and by 1996 it was just under 236,000, but the number of university places increased from 283,000 in 1988 to some 470,000 places now. For those who are critical of the higher education contribution scheme, that would not have been possible without the very existence of HECS.
In legislating funds for 1999 and 2000, the bill confirms to the sector the amounts that have been published in the higher education funding report for the 1998-2000 triennium. This should, hopefully, address the earlier criticisms that funding had been uncertain without legislating levels to the turn of the century.
Some people have argued that the introduction of fees to the higher education sector has had a detrimental impact on demand and access, but this is not borne out by the facts. Nor, in a society with collapsing age dependency ratios and expenditures on health, education and welfare exceeding taxation receipts from PAYE taxpayers and company tax, is it a sustainable proposition. There are over 600,000 people currently in the system. The ABS 1996 census reveals that the number of people over the age of 15 obtaining a university degree has dramatically increased over 
 the decade to 1996, increasing on average from about three per cent of the population to 7½ per cent, although in the ACT it increased from 11 per cent to 16 per cent, representing the socio-demographic nature of Canberra.
Much has also been made of funding cuts, as they are described, to universities, with the 1996-97 budget reducing forward estimates for higher education operating grants by one per cent in 1997, three per cent in 1998 and a further one per cent for each 1999 and 2000. In addition, the government provided over $10.2 million for universities in need of assistance in restructuring and adjustment. These changes obviously got the universities' attention, but it has perhaps had its greatest impact on forcing them to focus much more on the future—what they do, how they do it and the needs of a society in which the utilitarian view of education confronts—perhaps as it did in 19th century Britain—that of learning, research and human development.
When you look at the equivalent full-time student unit and you go back to 1983, you find that the then Hawke government provided $12,514 per EFTSU. In the ensuing five years it dropped 3.5 per cent to $12,081. The commitment of this government this year of $13,112 per EFTSU represents a 4.8 per cent increase on 1983 and an 8.5 per cent increase on the decade from 1988.
One of the debates, amongst others, that was distilled down into a contemporary form by Roderick West's preliminary report into higher education is this constant tension between higher education having a utilitarian purpose only and higher education being principally concerned with human development and being a repository for learning and society perhaps understanding where it has been as much as where it is going. The debate about education last century was extremely polarised. Perhaps not a lot has changed in that regard, particularly in Britain where the utilitarians, for whom knowledge meant emancipation and power, argued for accessibility for all.
Jeremy Bentham founded University College in London to disseminate knowledge to the community, believing that knowledge would emancipate people, particularly from 
 low income backgrounds. The contrary view was based around humanist themes: the development of intellect, the inculcation of values, the ethics of education and learning, and the absorption of knowledge through debate and argument, particularly between teachers and students. Knowledge was seen to have a value in its own right.
John Henry Newman—whose Dublin lectures in 1852 were published as `The idea of a university' in 1858—directed to the members of the then Catholic University in Ireland the liberal tradition of seeing university education as a development of both the mind and the personality. He fostered much of what remains today of this tension existing in contemporary higher and post-secondary education debate.
Education needs to be able to cater for the diverse potential that exists particularly for young people, assisting them to achieve their own potential—whatever it is likely to be. The most important characteristic of a good education should be as Professor David Pennington said: learning how to learn. In his 1995 address to La Trobe University's Winter Conversazione `The idea of education and the cultural wars', David Pennington said this:
I would not, for one moment, deny that vocational and applied education are important for at least two-thirds, if not three-quarters, of our young people in the post-school period. However, to suggest that vocational or technical education does not differ from the sort of education appropriate for the most intellectually able in our society, who can be extended in quite different ways is, in my view, a profound denial of society's responsibility in caring for its own future.
What Pennington touched on just under three years ago was, in fact, I think where we are at the moment. There are a number of people in the education sector who are expressing a concern that what we are now doing is training people. I speak as someone who has been trained, as distinct from being educated. We are constantly looking at people learning or acquiring skills which are going to lead them to a job. I think there is a reasonable basis for being concerned that perhaps the importance of language, of history, of sociology, of understanding how we relate to one another, is being pushed to one side in a headlong 
 push to train people for income earning activities.
Whatever else governments do, whatever their political colour, I think we need to ensure that we have financing systems for higher education which do not actively discriminate against learning and personal development. It would be a great tragedy if we end up with a society where everybody is trained but, frankly, nobody is educated or perhaps able to think. Training also needs to be put into an educational context in terms of the past, and it needs to fit in terms of the framework of what as individuals and as a society we are trying to achieve.
Excessive and centralised governmental control of universities in which perhaps prescriptive indicators of performance are applied, in my view, is a recipe for mediocrity. I think the current government is moving very much in the right direction in increasing the autonomy of universities and, whilst in the first sense this is applying in an appropriately limited way to financing, I think it is actually a healthy thing.
I do not subscribe to the politics of mediocrity which say that everybody ought to be the same. I think everybody ought to have the opportunity to achieve their potential, whatever that is, but I think that when governments centrally say, `Well, all universities shall achieve the same educational and perhaps even the same financial sorts of standards,' what we are doing is trying to lift those who are not as capable as others at the expense of those who are perhaps the most gifted in society. Irrespective of the mechanism by which we finance higher education, it needs to recognise and cater for the diverse potential that is in human beings. Without it, both individuals themselves and society generally are likely to suffer.
Turning specifically to funding issues, one of the best commentaries I have seen on this was in the 6 January edition of the Financial Review this year. It said:
Although the Federal Government has introduced sensible policy changes that will reduce funding to Australian universities over time, taxpayers are still tipping too much cash into this over-regulated and over-protected sector. Listening to the nation's 
 vice-chancellors, a casual observer could easily gain the impression that the tertiary education industry is in a state of impecuniosity verging on bankruptcy thanks to the meagre level of Government funding. But federal subsidies for universities are still $5 billion a year, including money for research. Governments provide 58 per cent of all university income; fees and student contributions only 25 per cent.
Again, I say to my colleagues on both sides of the House, particularly those in the ALP, who, quite genuinely, are seeking to represent the interests of low income people: just remember what I said earlier—only 15 per cent of the predominantly young people receiving a university education when we came to government were from the bottom 25 per cent of income earning households in the country. What is happening is that the battlers in this country, the people who do carry the tax burden, are financing the education perhaps of people like me, although I do come from a modest background. They are paying predominantly for the education that is provided to others who will then go on to benefit from that, and their own children have increasingly found it difficult to see the inside of universities, particularly of sandstone universities. The Financial Review  went on to say:
This in turn would push universities into further improving the quality of their product. As this newspaper has reported over the past two days, the financial squeeze that tertiary institutions have faced over recent years has already induced a wave of change for the better. This has included more specialised and diverse course offerings, a greater focus on the employability of graduates and a sensitivity to the needs of consumers . . . Many universities have also shown entrepreneurial zest in entering the Asian market . . . 
It is worth noting that last year we had just under 63,000 overseas students in this country—86 per cent of them from Asia. I think one of the obligations of government and those who profess to lead is that when we see BHP, for example, announcing the closure of its steel works or its collieries or we see companies like Berlei relocating to Asia because of complex industrial relations and taxation problems here in our country, our responsibility is to open the future. We need to give young Australians an understanding that, whilst those industries will be important 
 and continue to be important in our economic and social development, it is knowledge based industries—areas like higher education, multimedia, biotechnologies and health—and areas like that where a lot of our economic future lies. What we have to do is have an education sector, if not political leadership, that actually gives young Australians a sense of where we are going and opens the future as much as it does upon the closing of the past.
The Financial Review went on to say:
Clearly many academics and most universities are capable of skilfully adapting to a freer and more competitive market for their services. They should be provided with greater incentives and greater freedom to do so. Putting subsidies in the hands of buyers rather than sellers, preferably through a voucher system, is one crucial step.
I am not suggesting that is something that I would support, but at least the Financial Review  went on to make that point.
I think what the government is essentially doing in higher education is right. It is really forcing universities to focus much more on the consumers and the beneficiaries of education and, in doing so, to give some sense of perspective to the greater social and economic responsibilities that higher education has.
The danger I see, however, is that universities in the post-secondary education sector generally are pushing perhaps a little bit too much toward training and moving away from the value of education itself. As a society, I think we need to do everything we can to see that governments implement and sustain financing systems that do place as high a value on the importance of learning and personal development as they do specific training for a job. Learning for life is just as important as training for a specific task. It is important that we not just accept competency based skills assessment in terms of training but we also give some credence to the professional and personal development that underlies any knowledge or training or skill that a person might have.
Sitting suspended from 6.32 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, before I turn to 
 the substantive part of my remarks I would like to move a second reading amendment to the legislation which was to be moved by my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Because of the nature of the sittings of the House, that opportunity was not available to him, so I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government:
(1)	 for reducing funding to Australian universities, resulting in 21,000 fewer student places;
(2)	 for the failure of its up-front fees policy;
(3)	 for increasing HECS charges and lowering the repayment threshold such that applications for enrolment in undergraduate courses fell by 3.3 per cent in 1997 and a further 3.1 per cent in 1998;
(4)	 for creating a crisis in science education by doubling the charge for university science courses; and
(5)	 for its inadequate response to the challenges of globalisation in higher education"".
The opposition moves that amendment for obvious reasons. My colleague the member for Werriwa alluded to many of those in his contribution to this debate last week. But, beyond that, I believe that the case which we seek to make in relation to the government's higher education policy is now self-evident. The way in which the changes in HECS fees and funding cuts have impacted on higher education has taken a while to be felt, but are quite clearly evident now that the initial enrolment figures are in for 1998, and the impact of these changes will continue to be felt throughout the tertiary sector.
If we look at the Commonwealth's record in the area of university funding, we see that the Commonwealth has a proud record of funding the university sector right across this country. The Commonwealth picked up this particular area of government some years ago; and, if pressed, I would admit that governments of both political persuasions, not just those of the party that I represent, have in the past made a contribution to the tertiary education sector. Unfortunately, we now have a government, and in particular a minister, totally focused on outsourcing, privatising and 
 downsizing every aspect of the public sector—in this case in particular, our universities. So we no longer have that bipartisan commitment to funding of the university sector.
It was the Whitlam government, in the early years of the 1970s, which really focused national attention on the importance of our universities and on ensuring an equality of opportunity to a wide range of students, not just those who could afford the then expensive fees attached to university courses but students from a wide range of working class and other backgrounds who were able, because of the reforms instituted by the Whitlam government, to attend university for the first time. Because of the substantial capital and other infrastructure investments which that government made in its three short years to the universities and to the tertiary education sector as a whole, the nation was made aware of the way in which universities and our tertiary education sector can deliver economic and cultural benefits for the nation as a whole.
The Whitlam government introduced some massive changes to accessibility by students, to investment in university infrastructure, and to the way in which our community values higher education. Many of those things were supported by governments on both sides for the next two decades. But we now have a situation where a government, for the reasons that I have just outlined—those ideological obsessions on downsizing, on reducing the size of the public sector, on cutting back contributions from government, and on demanding user-pays fees from students on a scale never seen before—has begun to undermine the nature of our national commitment to the tertiary education sector.
Universities are not slow to adapt to change. The university sector has seen more change, in fact, than probably any other area of Australian society—even more change than has applied to government as a whole, and certainly more than that which has applied to the private sector. Over the last decade, university enrolments have increased from some 421,000 to a current level of just over 650,000, a rise of 56 per cent—but during a period when academic staffing rose only some 
 15 per cent. International fee paying student enrolments, which have seen very significant changes in the last decade, have gone from just about 1,000 in 1988 to some 53,000 students 10 years later, which makes Australian universities a very substantial contributor to our national income—a level of export dollar earning which I think now exceeds some of our major primary industries like wool and beef.
Indeed, those students have contributed a lot to Australia's position overseas. When they return to their home countries and they then take, as is often the case, leadership positions in their government and in their public and private sector, throughout South-East Asia particularly, Australia is well remembered by those students. The memories which they take home reflect well on Australia and in its endeavours in foreign policy terms and in terms of our economic and political influence throughout the region. But, of course, that image is now under threat because of the nature of the changes to university funding and student contributions which this government has implemented.
Our universities are a major economic resource to the community, and I will cover some of the other areas and way in which they contribute to R&D in a moment. It is worth remembering that universities themselves are a very important focus of community activity. They deliver a great deal to the local community in which they are based, and it is not just in terms of academic learning, but also in terms of economic activity and in terms of the cultural contribution to that community. It is a contribution which is even more significant in the regional economies of our country. I was recently in Townsville and the impact of James Cook University in that local community is very substantial. Of course, that situation is replicated throughout Australia's regional economies.
The major universities based in our capital cities are also strong contributors to the economic wellbeing of those communities. Indeed, universities are substantial taxpayers in their own right. So we should not just see the tertiary sector, as I think this government does, as simply another cost centre. We 
 should see it in terms of its whole contribution to Australian life, not only in the academic context but also for the cultural and economic value which universities bring to the nation.
Universities have very substantial challenges in front of them. Very many of those challenges have been imposed by the government but others are of a more general nature demanding a response from the government which we have yet to see. Globalisation, for example, has imposed significant strains on universities in all countries. Universities are now required to compete in a global marketplace for students rather than simply having as their natural birthright students from their local community. Indeed, we are seeing an increasing ability of students throughout the region to simply attend any university that they wish.
It is for that reason that universities' reputations are very important to them as well. If a university can secure a substantial reputation for scholarship, for research and for the academic standards which it sets, then students will be attracted to those universities not only from within Australia's own educational pool of students but also, in terms of fee paying students, from outside Australia.
I think recent history has demonstrated that Australian universities are able to more than hold their own with those of competitor countries. One might look at, for example, Canada, universities in British Columbia, the United States or the United Kingdom or other universities in Europe. Australia's universities have demonstrated that they are well able to attract students from our region and to hold those students because of the value which those students place on an education from an Australian university.
Australia's universities have earned those reputations through hard work over many years, but that can readily be undone if the standards are allowed to fall and if overseas students perceive that we no longer fund our universities and the university research infrastructure at a level which ensures them of a good education. Those students, after all, like many Australian students, are paying substantial fees for their education and where full fee 
 paying students from overseas are involved they are going to demand very high standards from the universities. If we do not provide the investment in those universities as we have in the past, then obviously numbers will suffer and the economic and geopolitical value, the community and cultural value, of those students to Australia will decline accordingly.
Over the last few decades we have seen a substantial change in the way in which universities relate to the community. World War II was a very significant turning point for science and technology and for our understanding of the value of scientific research. Indeed, it was in that post World War II period in 1945 that Vannevar Bush, who was the director of the wartime office of science and technology policy in the United States, presented a report to the then President of the United States at his request on Science: the endless frontier. Vannevar Bush identified, quite correctly, the value which scientific research and technology can bring to society as a whole.
World War II marked the turning point in our understanding of the impact of technology on everyday life, the impact of technology on economic growth and, indeed, the impact of technology on wealth and job creation. Studies in recent years concerning the 50-year period since World War II have revealed that very nearly half of all the wealth and job creation which has taken place in Western societies during that half-century has been due to research and development in science and technology. Often those discoveries have taken place in an academic context and not just an industrial context. Our universities are vital incubators of new and innovative ideas and they are teachers of students who can practice their craft at the leading edge of science and technology and then take that knowledge, experience and practical advantage into industry with them when they graduate.
To understand the value of universities to our economy and the community we should also look very much at the way science and technology and high technology in particular benefit our economies, which they do in a number of ways. I am indebted to the Nation 
 al Research Council of the United States for a recent report which analysed the way in which high technology firms benefit society. Those firms are associated with innovation. Those firms who have high levels  of innovation tend to gain market share. They create new product markets and they use their resources much more productively.
Secondly, high technology firms perform larger amounts of research and development than more traditional industries. If we look at the high technology companies which have evolved in recent times—for example, electronics, aircraft industries, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, advanced materials—all of those firms are associated with much higher levels of R&D than are the traditional industries. They contribute a disproportionate share of R&D expenditure and they should attract government support accordingly.
These positive spill-over benefits from scientific research also generate new products and processes that lead to productivity gains and generate new manufacturing opportunities in other sectors of the economy. So we have seen that advances in electronics, in transistors, for example, have been a key enabling industry and a key technology for developing whole new manufacturing areas in other parts of the economy. So the spill-over effects are very substantial. It has been estimated that the return to a private company on R&D will be something in the order of 20 to 30 per cent, but the spill-over effects mean that the returns to society as a whole will be well over 50 per cent. That illustrates the point that private sector firms are often unable to capture the full benefits of R&D. Therefore, it is essential that society ensures collectively that the public benefits of R&D are captured for the benefit of the community as a whole, and the universities have a vital role to play in that.
Private sector R&D in this country commenced from a very low base. We have always had a very strong public sector R&D, but our business sector has always been behind in OECD comparative terms when we look at their contribution to R&D. The previous Labor government identified this problem some years ago and instituted a very substantial taxation concession of 150 per cent of 
 eligible R&D expenditure to encourage those private sector firms to contribute more to research and development. They responded very well to that incentive and to the options which were provided by syndication.
Although this government has sought to ridicule as a rort some of those gains through the taxation system and their contribution to increased R&D by the private sector, the reality is that those gains were very substantial. Although we were coming off a low base, we had begun to see quite a substantial increase in R&D expenditure by private sector firms. However, that was very much put at risk by the decision in previous budgets of this government to reduce the concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. I have spoken about the problems which have arisen from that decision at other times in this House. I will not cover that ground again because I want to concentrate more on the impact which our universities have had in that area.
The reality is that this government not only confined its research pruning activities to the R&D tax concession. They have also taken substantial funds away from our universities. University operating grants have been cut by six per cent in the period from 1997 to 2001.
Without standard indexation for salary movements, the overall cutback will be about 20 per cent by the end of this year. Without indexation to reflect national productivity growth anticipated through to 2001, the cutback figure could come in at something like 30 per cent over the period. That is a figure which was identified by Professor John Niland of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee in a recent contribution to a seminar in Canberra held at the National Press Club and sponsored by the Federation of Australasian Scientific and Technological Societies to illustrate the impact of this government's funding cuts on university science.
The reality is that our universities and their ability to provide a worthwhile science education are very much under threat. If we look at some of the recent trends in enrolment statistics, we can see that, while enrolments in science as a whole have increased faster than 
 the average of enrolments for the university sector, the reality is that that has mainly been in the areas of the biological sciences—genetic engineering and molecular biology—and in the area of computing science. Those fields have seen substantial increases in student numbers. But the basic areas of fundamental science I am concerned about—mathematics, physics and chemistry—have seen a decline in enrolments. Those are the areas which have suffered in the approach which this government has taken to university funding and to science education in particular.
The reality is that, where students can see a clear career path, where they can see the economic long-term benefit, they will be attracted to those courses. That has been the case with law and commerce, with medicine, with dentistry and the like. But where they perceive that society fails to properly value a career and a course, as in the case with physics, chemistry and maths, then those areas have suffered substantially.
If our basic fundamental science is devalued, then Australia's ability to reap the benefits which are identified from high technology industries, from those areas of the economy which are very R&D intensive, will suffer in future years. Unfortunately, good science costs money to do. Good science education, whether it is at the primary level, the secondary level or the tertiary sector level, does cost money. That is the harsh reality of this business. The problem is that the returns from that investment, because it is not a cost as much as an investment, are a long time in coming.
It has taken us 30 or 40 years to identify the gains which our society as a whole has had from the massive investment in R&D which took place after World War II. Very often the gains are unexpected. Who would have thought that, for example, those researchers who discovered the transistor in the late 1940s or those who identified at that same time the then obscure scientific phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance would have led now, 30 or 40 years later, to having MRI imaging technology in almost every major capital city hospital and the very important role that plays in medical treat 
 ment? Who would have thought of the way in which the impact of transistor technology would spread right throughout our whole society in 30 or 40 years when those basic research decisions were being made in 1948? That continues to be the case.
The Hubble space telescope, a very fundamental piece of basic research, has led to the development of new imaging correction algorithms because of the problems which were inherent in the optics of that telescope. The algorithms which scientists have developed to improve the quality of those images are now being adapted to ensure that imaging in mammography, a very important part in cancer detection in women, is in fact more accurately imaged and that potential cancer is detected much more reliably. The spill-off benefits from fundamental R&D are very hard to pick. They come about years after the research is undertaken and they are often quite surprising, even to the people who are involved in the original research itself.
If we allow this threat to fundamental R&D in our universities to continue, if we allow this government to get away with the doubling HECS fees in science, withdrawing recurrent and infrastructure funding from our universities, that will threaten Australia's capacity to respond to the challenges of the next century, opportunities which will deliver job growth, wealth creation and fundamental benefits to our society in a way which no other contributor to the economy can. Our universities are in trouble. Science education in particular is at a crisis point. It is time this government recognised it and addressed those issues seriously.
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—As is traditional in this place with the present opposition, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) closed his speech with a request for more money. It is an interesting aspect of the budget that, prior to the election of the Hawke and then Keating Labor governments, one can look at budget outlays by function and see that education in relative 
 terms actually attracted more of the government's expenditures than health and in fact slightly less than defence. But, of course, one of the first actions of that government was to decide to change dramatically the way health services were delivered in Australia.
So we have gone from a situation where defence got about $4 billion, education got about $3.75 billion and health got about $3.5 billion to one where we find health spending over $20 billion, education spending about $11 billion and defence spending $10 billion. That relativity is even worse when one looks at the fact that in those same figures of budget outlays by function the public debt interest is also nearly $10,000 million, probably about $1½ billion less than the expenditure on education.
Why has that situation arisen? It is simply because throughout 13 years of a Labor government, if you were a little bit short, you just borrowed the money. Funnily enough, the people for which the member for Bonython makes a plea because, I think he believes, they need more help are the biggest losers from that policy because it is a policy of `let the children pay'. For you, Mr Deputy Speaker, some of the more mature members of this parliament and me, we will not be around long enough to pay back all the debt, the $100 billion, that is causing that $10 billion interest cost.
But it seems outstanding and outrageous to me that a government could be standing here talking about how much it spends on education when it is only slightly more than what it spends on public debt. We as a government have set about doing something about that. In the process, certain people will be dissatisfied. But it is a courageous government that is prepared to stand up and say, `Here are the relativities. These are the losers, if you go down an irresponsible path. Good fiscal management is fundamental to good education services.'
It is amazing because, quite frequently, I get letters—like you no doubt do, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your constituent role, and as the member for Bonython and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) do—telling me that the education system needs more money. I 
 write back to them and say, `Here is that page in the budget—budget outlays by function. I draw to your attention some of the expenditures involved. From where do you suggest I take the money?' It is a peculiar fact that very few people reply. The odd one does and says, `Take it out of defence.' Of course, I grin a bit about that because I am old enough to remember seeing people parading in civvies with broomsticks on their shoulders learning to be soldiers to protect us from the war of 1939-45, which I lived through as a kid. That is a pretty silly proposition, particularly as that expenditure, as I say, has gone from being the top of those three important outlay figures to the bottom.
There is no solution other than good management, and I want to touch on health for a while because that is one area that enrages me. We had a good system. We had 70 per cent of the population looking after their own health needs and the state governments quite capable, under their teaching hospital system, of looking after the rest. It is an interesting statistic, for what it is worth, that pre-Medicare the federal government expended $220 per capita on health and the general public could buy private health insurance for something like $500 per annum for their entire family, doctor and hospital. Today, the figures are $1,150 of federal government expenditure and $2,500 and rising for private health insurance. I will not go any further on that issue because it is not relevant to this bill, but it is relevant inasmuch as to where the money has gone. If anyone can tell me that is progress, that everybody is better off, I will go he.
The member for Bonython also chose to talk about an issue of considerable interest to me—that is, the great task of research that arises from our tertiary institutions. I support him in his argument for recognising the very important role that universities and, might I add, the CSIRO, who was decimated by the previous government in terms of funding, contribute in their research programs and how important it is for government to retain a role because pure research is probably something that only government can really support.
Not surprisingly, industry is looking for targets. Industry wants to charge a researcher with finding something it wants. I do not criticise it for that, but there is a reality that every now and then you have to have someone who looks at that mould growing on a pumpkin and says, `I wonder what that might do for humanity,' and they invent penicillin and, of course, all the derivatives that have come in the antibiotic sector.
The reality is that someone has to do that and somebody has to put up some money. I am supportive of government doing that well ahead and in the health arena of paying me a subsidy of $18 or $20 for my first visit to a GP. I do not need it and nor does anybody attending this parliament. So why do we do it? We have now corrupted the medical profession because they think it is their money when in fact it is a rebate to patients. It was never a payment to doctors. That is just another problem you get when you do these things.
The member for Bonython has made his speech and left—and I think it was a considered speech. But, of course, when we look at the second reading speech associated with this legislation, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) advised us as follows:
Funding for higher education research through the targeted higher education research program has been increased over the 1997-99 triennium, with additional funding totalling $129.3 million including the $90 million for research infrastructure. The quality of research training is being enhanced through an additional $9.3 million in support for Australian Postgraduate Awards.
And he goes on. So whilst I stand with the member for Bonython in supporting that form of expenditure, it is there. We have done it and that is a positive aspect.
There are many other factors in this piece of legislation. It is a piece of legislation that is described as technical, but it has some fairly substantial and very important aspects to it. For instance, it gives certainty to the tertiary education sector to the year 2000 in big bites, because the minister informs us that the government has legislated to expend $3,581,640,000 in the year 2000 on tertiary education. That is a lot of money and, as I 
 said, it is not more only because the previous government skewed their expenditure in other areas, particularly the health sector and public debt. If you do that, you end up with somebody missing out.
You can get all philosophical about that, but there is a funny thing about education. When I was at school, two plus two equalled four. Paul Keating used to turn it into five, six or whatever suited him on the day. He told us he was bringing home the bacon and all those other sorts of situations, when he was just getting the country further into debt and, as I said, leaving it to the kids of Australia to pay off.
I have another matter which I am concerned about and which I join this debate particularly to make reference to, and I have done so in this place before. We still have difficulties in ensuring equity of access to the tertiary education system. I will stand corrected at the margin, but the last time I recollect reading about this, the figures were that only nine or 10 per cent of rural and remote area secondary students were going through to tertiary education, whereas in the metropolitan area it was closer to 27 per cent.
There is no doubt that there are equal degrees of intelligence amongst the students of rural and remote areas and the metropolitan areas. One of the most significant contributing factors to those very disparate statistics is the fact that it is all about money. It is extremely expensive to relocate your child or children away from home, even by a distance of 50 or 60 miles in old-fashioned terms, or 100 kilometres, if you like. No government yet has properly done anything about it. It is not an issue of how much money you have got; it is an issue of equity.
I welcome, and thank the government for, its move with the common youth allowance—which I read the Labor Party is trying to knock off—to at least bring what was once an Austudy student into the rent assistance arena. That is very positive, but we still have a secondary hurdle; and I want to give to the House the following example.
We do not have to talk about farmers, fishermen or those in business whom people tend to focus on when they think of country 
 areas. Let us think about the fellow who works at the co-op store in a small country town. He is probably on a salary of $25,000 a year and probably votes Labor. Let us say he has a very bright son who has just got good marks at the local secondary school and has all the potential to be a brilliant student at university. But if that father is earning $25,000 a year—and there are probably a couple of other kids and a wife to look after—where does he find $5,000 to $10,000 to relocate that child into accommodation at a university in a capital city? He has not got enough. He has a discussion about this at the family dinner table one night and his wife says, `I used to be a school teacher,' or `I used to be a nurse,' or `Maybe I'll just go and work somewhere and I'll earn the $10,000 or $7,000 necessary to see that our kid can be relocated away from where we live and work and go to university.'
Let us do the sums taking my simple arithmetic of $25,000 and $10,000. While the family is on $25,000 a year, they are eligible for Austudy but, if mum goes out and earns $10,000—which is necessary; that is the minimum you can earn living in the country to be able to afford to send your child away to university—they are no longer eligible for Austudy. They have hit the threshold. They are rich!
You might be rich if your house backs on to the fence of the university, but you are not rich if you are living 100 kilometres away from the university. What is more—and isn't it funny—in all metropolitan regions, the richer you are, the closer you live to the university. That problem is not your problem. It is an issue that this parliament has got to confront. It is not a matter of means testing. It is just that one segment of the community is disadvantaged on the basis of access and the statistics prove it—nine per cent, 27 per cent. It is time we considered it on that basis.
As I said, we are not talking about farmers' sons or anybody else. They would probably go. They would probably find the money. I know those who borrow it. But there are all those other people out there who work and get salaries which are often quite small—and let us remember, if you are earning $25,000 
 a year, you are paying something like $80 a week in tax. They have got to be helped too, and it is a fundamental issue for me. I have raised it in this place before and I want to raise it again and take the opportunity of this legislation to point it out. It is about as unfair as you can get. While we pay subsidies for people, we have got to recognise that particular situation.
Strangely enough, we do something about isolated primary and secondary students. We have a non-means tested living away from home allowance if you have to send your children away from a pastoral activity or something like that. That is good and I appreciate it, but compared with the downside of tertiary education, it is a small issue. I really do plead with everybody to think about it because I think it is very unfair and it is something we want to have some attention on.
In closing, having made the point on which I wanted to address the parliament, I welcome this legislation. It commits the government to some very substantial amounts of money, including, of course, some finetuning as it relates to meeting the costs of additional superannuation and the sorts of fluctuations that occur in funding these areas.
I also want to say that I support entirely the concept of giving Australians a second chance. It may be that there are bright kids who just had a bad time when they did their tertiary entrance examinations or maybe there was some other contributing reason, but they missed the cut. They now have an opportunity that has been available to overseas students for a long time to at least say, `I will pay to go to university and I will pay up-front.' Again, it is equity.
I have never been able to work out why, as a fundamental, we do not fund the student instead of the university. We know the bureaucracies of universities are not too keen on that idea because, of course, they see that as putting them in a market situation, and that makes them stammer a bit. The reality is that people should have buying power and governments should give assistance where it is needed, be it in education, health or anything else. I have a standard saying, `You should fund people, not institutions.' Institutions get 
 an inflated view of their worth to the community and, over time, when governments say to them, `We think there is readjustment required in expenditure,' they are out there telling the people, `We're not doing this for us, you know. We're not doing this to sustain our security or our wages; we're doing it for you.'
I cannot see any better way to `do it for you'—that is, for the taxpayer—than to send them some money in some form that, of course, restricts where they can spend it. It is commonly known as a voucher, and the education sector has worked assiduously over decades, if not centuries, to put a bad odour on vouchers. A cheque, of course, is a voucher, and I have never seen a schoolteacher that would knock one back.
The realities are that a voucher system in education, health or any other area is worthy of consideration as a simple means of assisting those who need it, and it is a lot easier to target them. Let the education sector, the health sector or whoever else compete with the people who have the buying power as provided by government. I will stand by that view as long as I am in this place because I think it is simpler, fairer and more efficient.
The reality is that we have taken some steps. We see a growth in university admissions, and we see some wonderful education being delivered. But, all in all, if education is to get more money, somebody has to decide at whose cost. I think some of the distortions in the budget that I have pointed to tonight might be the starting point.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—In memory yet green, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) alluded to the old health system that he was supportive of: people taking out private health insurance and providing for themselves and the states taking up the burden of public hospitals. That was his preferred model for how the health system should operate. That is a system that was basically in place in the Menzies period, and it is the one that was reconstituted during the Fraser period of government.
I am sure that in memory yet green for most of the members of the coalition government, and certainly for the Minister for 
 Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), we have a similar point of view with regard to pre-existing education systems: those that pre-existed Labor's period of government from 1983 to 1996. It is in fact reflected not just in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, the piece of legislation before us tonight, but also in some of the precursors. If we go to one of my favourites, the National Commission of Audit—not everything in that has been accepted, but it is the basic philosophical document for this government—and have a look at what it was recommending in terms of higher education, we find some very interesting things. In fact, at recommendation 4.20 on the level of funding—and this really is in memory yet green, and it is prospective—it says:
Funding through scholarships (see recommendation 4.18) should replace all operating grants to universities and TAFEs. Institutions would be required to budget, plan and manage their total resource needs from revenues from the scholarships, HECS, student fees and other commercial revenues or bequests.
In memory yet green, the Menzian education system was where most people could not get access to a tertiary education and where, if you did not have the money to pay the full fees, you had to be reliant upon winning a Commonwealth scholarship or a teachers college scholarship or being able to take up a position at university because of an understanding, agreement or bond that you had undertaken with a private employer. In those years, prior to the Whitlam reforms and to what was done by Labor between 1983 and 1996, that is how it operated.
I think that the point of departure in relation to this recommendation is what has been done since 1996. This higher education legislation amendment before us tonight is about making the steps along the way because, where they argued that all operating grants to universities and TAFEs should be replaced, what do we find that this bill is in fact about? It is about capping the operating grants of the universities and placing those universities in a position where they have to deal with those capped funds and, as a corollary, they effec 
 tively have to find funding from other sources.
The person who has brought this legislation to the House is, in fact, the chief spruiker for this side show alley of a government that we have, the person who has trumpeted the benefits of a more privatised way of doing things, both in the employment area and in education. Before I go further to concrete parts of the bill, I want to take up another matter that was alluded to in his core argument over the first 10 minutes by the member for O'Connor. He argued that, when you look at the budget outlays by function under the Labor period, effectively too much was done in the education area and it became unbalanced. Other areas suffered because of Labor's increases in funding and this government is just re-weighting the balance.
There is some other collateral proof of that position. The previous minister, Senator Vanstone, in a speech on 25 June 1996, cast her mind over the period of Labor government and what had happened in education. She went on to argue later that, in fact, a re-weighting was necessary because education was taking up too much of the budget moneys. I will briefly quote from what she said in relation to the Labor period:
In 1996, Commonwealth expenditure on higher education will be some $5.3 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in 1983—growth in real terms of 67%.
As a proportion of gross domestic product, Commonwealth expenditure on higher education has grown significantly from 1.18% in 1983/84 to 1.27% in 1993/94.
As a proportion of Commonwealth outlays, expenditure on higher education increased from 3.0% in 1985/86 to 3.6% in 1995/96.
To a senior officer sitting in the Department of Finance or the Treasury, these figures warrant immediate attention. From their perspective, these numbers tell a story of rapid growth, faster than most other areas of Commonwealth expenditure . . . From their perspective the picture is one of generous and expanding public subsidy.
Not only did total Commonwealth funding rise by 67% over this period, it also rose when measured in per student terms.
As a member of the Australian Labor Party, although not here at that particular time, I plead guilty to the former Labor government 
 increasing expenditure in the higher education area by 67 per cent over the term of the Labor government. It was done for good and sensible purposes: to expand the number of higher education places open to all of the people in this community, to increase the rates at which students would finish year 12 and to increase the capacity of students to enter either university places or other TAFE and higher education places. So we plead guilty. We did put an emphasis on higher education. We did fund it very fully.
Where the member for O'Connor argues that our notion of budget outlays by function was distorted because we had an over proportion of funds going into higher education, that was based on this simple premise: the infrastructure of Australia is not simply dependent on roads, rail and seaports. The human infrastructure of this country is vitally important and the public moneys spent in higher education are well spent in building the human infrastructure of the Australian continent.
We come in particular to this bill and what it sets out to do in capping. As to background—I will be quoting at length from the Bills Digest produced by the information and research section of the library, in particular by Kim Jackson to whom I am indebted—`In the 1996-97 budget, that reduced the forward estimates for higher education operating grants by one per cent in 1997, a further three per cent in 1998 and a further one per cent in each of 1999 and 2000.' One plus one plus three equals a five per cent cut in the operating grants going from this Commonwealth government to the nation's universities. I have not just said that; this has come from the brief provided by the Parliamentary Library, and they are unbiased.
Not only did that happen—we have a forward cut through those years of five per cent—but we also have a situation where the minister at the time indicated that there would be problems in the restructuring that the universities would have to undertake and funds for those would be provided. In 199798, we had a grand sum of $10.2 million provided to the universities for that. The  higher education legislation of 1997  contained provisions for the minister to make grants to 
 institutions for that restructuring and rationalising. But the grant levels were not in the legislation. This amendment bill is to supply us with those grant levels and to tell a bit of the fuller story.
This does not happen in complete isolation, of course. We are not just getting some figures here to add to the previous legislation. This background paper shows that there are some very interesting outcomes when you take a look at how this whole picture fits together. Let us look ahead three years, as the government sought to do, at what is happening in education funding. We can look, as this paper points out, to the report entitled Higher education funding report for the 1998-2000 triennium, produced in December 1997. That report forecast that total revenue available to higher education institutions from all sources—I emphasise `all sources' because the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, often seems to omit the fact that this is from all sources—would increase by an estimated $8.4 billion in 1997 to around $8.6 billion by the year 2000. I quote:
The report states that this estimated increase in total resources will be primarily due to projected increases in revenue from fee-paying students, both local and overseas.
So part of the top up the government expects will come not only from the continuation of students from overseas—and, in particular, Asia—but also from fee-paying students within Australia. You would now have to rejig the forward estimates in relation to Asian students because of the situation that Asia finds itself in. Already, the indication is that many students will not be continuing with their education—or not beginning it—in Australia as a result of that economic downturn.
When the previous Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, introduced full fee paying places—and therefore the opportunity to gain a place at a university—the eight universities that signed up for it said that could be done. It did not matter that people would have a TER of about 10 points less, people would be able to pay their way into those courses. We 
 have already seen one of those universities very quickly saying, `Yes, we can see our operating grants being cut. We have problems in getting other sources of income to bolster paying staff and paying for the running of this institution.' One of those institutions has backed off this year, and that is the University of Technology in Sydney. In an article from the Sydney Morning Herald, Luis M. Garcia indicates:
The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Technology, Sydney, Professor Tony Blake, announced last week—
and this is an article from the end of February—
that his university would not offer full-fee places for the 1999 academic year.
We have got only two major universities in Sydney continuing to offer those full fee places: the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales. It was expected and projected by this government that about 600 places would initially be offered. Sydney and New South Wales universities have 150 full fee paying students at the moment. The amount of money which was to have come from the other 450 is now not a source of funding. The fact that UTS knocked it back indicates that they are no longer as eager as they previously were for this approach to solving their funding problems. In fact, the Vice-Chancellor said:
. . . the original predictions by the Government of universities making millions of dollars a year from full-fee students, had clearly been based on ""questionable assumptions"".
They are not merely questionable assumptions because of what has happened in Asia but, far more directly, questionable assumptions in terms of the students who will not be lining up to pay very hefty fees: in arts and commerce, $9,000 to $11,000 a year; in law, $10,000 to $15,000; in science and engineering, $13,000 to $15,000 a year; and in dentistry and vet science, $20,000 to $24,000 a year. So the government is in a bit of trouble over full fee paying places.
In memory yet green, the Menzies government had full fee places. If you were not in a position to pay those full fees in a very contracted university system, if you were 
 quick enough and good enough and you were able to get a scholarship, you might have been able, as part of the deserving poor, to get into a narrow education system by winning your way through scholarship. That is the direction we are heading back to in relation to what is being done here.
This paper also makes some very interesting comparisons. If you have a look at what has been provided by DEETYA, the funding figures in this bill do not correlate, as this paper points out, with the actual amount of funds that they expect to get. It is not an actual reflection of the total funds available as a result of government policy. If you look at what is provided by DEETYA in total grants available for institutions over selected years, you will see that it was $5,463.1 billion in 1997 declining to $5,289.9 billion in the year 2000.
But that is not the total picture. When the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, deals with our allegations that he has cut funds and places, he absolutely denies that anything like that has happened. As the chief spruiker for this government in this area, one would expect him to do so. He denies that there have been cuts.
This Bills Digest provided by the Parliamentary Library actually shows another way of looking at what has been said. It gives this reasoning as to why there is not a correlation and it relates to funds from all sources. I quote from page 3:
These figures do not readily correlate with those contained in the Bill because they include funds made available through HECS.
We know that HECS has been increased differentially as a result of the 1996 budget. Those students who did not take up university places because they would not have been able to bear the on-costs, those students who did not take up university places because they would have had to start paying not at $25,000 a year of income when they finished their course but at $20,701 as provided in the government's legislation, those students who never got a start, who may have gone off to the TAFE system to find they are in a position where the Commonwealth no longer 
 really wants to fund the TAFE system and does not want to bring it along as Labor did and have a better funding regime and a better resourcing of that TAFE system to build a better multi-tier education system in this country—those students who were knocked back because of those increases—would be very interested to hear this point from this paper. After making the point about the figures not completely correlating, the paper continues:
For example, the grants for operating purposes given in the Bill for 1999 . . . represent a reduction of 17.4 per cent on 1998 operating grants, rather than the one per cent reduction indicated by policy.
Only a 16.4 per cent difference. Thank you, Dr Kemp, chief spruiker. The quote continues:
This is because they reflect the savings made through the 1996-97 Budget decisions on HECS.
The paper then gives a table of savings from HECS, running into the out-years. The HECS rates in 1997-98 were $66.1 million; in 1998-99, $101.1 million; and in 1999-2000, $123.5 million. The lower HECS repayment thresholds for 1997-98 were $229.9 million; for the next year, $269.7 million; and for 1999-2000, $317.8 million.
So from all Dr Kemp's sources we have a different set of figures and a different set of correlations. But this independent paper indicates that, instead of government policy arguing a one per cent reduction, we have a reduction of 17.4 per cent on 1998 operating grants. This is not only about putting levels and caps on the operating grants but also about cutting them by 17.4 per cent. (Time expired)
—I call the honourable member for Stuart.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—I am the honourable member for Sturt, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—How could you forget?
—No, Stuart is a name that means something to me. My forebear was on John McDouall Stuart's expedition to northern Australia. However, my seat is named after Charles Sturt.
Before I turn to the substance of the  Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 , I would like to deal with the pious amendment that was moved by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). The first two clauses of the member for Bonython's amendment read:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government:
(1)	 for reducing funding to Australian universities, resulting in 21,000 fewer student places;
(2)	 for the failure of its up-front fees policy;
I think it is very important in the initial stage of this debate that some of these furphies from the Labor Party opposition are put to rest. The whole point of the government's reforms in the higher education area has been to try to create opportunity for young people to gain access to universities, young people who have not previously been given the opportunity to do so. Some might ask the question: how could that be so through introducing up-front fees for the 25 per cent of places over and above the Commonwealth funded places? I will explain it to the House. The facts are that for too long many people who could not get their first choice of university course chose to do their second course. In doing so, they denied somebody access to perhaps their first preference because that preference was taken by somebody who had been pushed out of their first preference.
Under the government's changes, everybody will now have the opportunity to take their first preference, except in the medicine course, if they can afford to pay the up-front fee for the 25 per cent of places over and above the Commonwealth funded places. However, if they cannot afford to do that, there are more Commonwealth funded undergraduate or HECS places available than there were under the Labor Party. So nobody is worse off through the government's changes. In fact, there are some people who are much better off: firstly, the people who get their first preference courses for their university education and, secondly, the people who would have lost their opportunity to do their first preference courses because somebody else had taken that HECS-funded place. So 
 there are winners on both sides of the equation.
In 1997, 17,000 new enrollees started at university in Australia. So, in the climate when the Labor Party were claiming that the sky was falling in, like Henny Penny, there were 17,000 new places at universities and undergraduate HECS funded places. This is at the same time—1996-97—that 55,000 new TAFE enrolments were received. Later I will explain why this is important.
This government has maintained funding per capita per student at $11,200 for university undergraduates. This is one of the very important measures of a government's commitment to the university sector and to students. Under the Labor Party, from the Dawkins reforms until we came to government, that funding suffered a steady decline from very significant levels to very low levels. This government, because of its changes, because of its reforms, has been able to increase the funding per student and maintain it at $11,200.
The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) claims that we have an up-front fees policy, and I think it is very important that we put paid to that suggestion. This is the rhetoric that has run through the universities on a regular basis. We have more Commonwealth funded HECS places than Labor offered. For the Labor Party to claim we have an up-front fees policy and to suggest that everybody is paying up-front fees, I would remind the Labor Party that this government is providing more Commonwealth funded HECS places than it did. The Labor Party introduced HECS—after promising not to do so—when I was at university. I remember it very well. The Labor Party, after promising the student body that it would not introduce the higher education contribution scheme, had no compunction in introducing it. Later I will get to the many changes and backflips that it made along the way.
We have given Australians the same opportunity to go to university and pay for their places at university that the Labor Party offered to overseas students for many years during their 13 years of unhappy government. I think that is very important to remember. 
 The Labor Party were very happy for people from outside Australia to come to this country, pay for places at university and provide support for our economy. However, they were not prepared to allow Australians the same rights and access, which has absolutely no logic at all. I would challenge the member for Barton (Mr McClelland) to explain how it was logical for the Labor Party to provide support for overseas students to come to this country but not Australian students.
In answer to the first two points of the pious amendment, we have introduced new flexibility for universities so that they can gain new streams of revenue. We have introduced new flexibility for the management of universities that vice-chancellors are very happy to accept. They will be able to use this flexibility to try to improve their universities, to increase the number of students and the number of places they offer, and to improve the quality of the education that they offer to young people. The third and fourth paragraph of the member for Bonython's pious amendment read:
(3)	 for increasing HECS charges and lowering the repayment threshold such that applications for enrolment in undergraduate courses fell by 3.3 per cent in 1997 and a further 3.1 per cent in 1998;
(4)	 for creating a crisis in science education by doubling the charge for university science courses . . . 
This amendment comes from a man whose government increased the higher education contribution scheme twice in the last parliament, introduced HECS in the first place, and introduced full fees for postgraduate courses during its terms in office after an election in which it had promised to do the opposite. Because of its closeness to the Labor Party, the National Union of students, which is supposed to represent students, failed miserably to at any stage oppose or condemn the Labor Party for breaking the promises that it had made to students, hand on heart, before its election.
Let us put to one side the nonsense in this pious amendment that the Labor Party actually cares about students. It only cares about whether students vote and who they vote for; it does not care at all about benefits or disad 
 vantages to students. There is no evidence to suggest that applications have fallen because of HECS. It is important to understand that applications are not the same as enrolments. While the Labor Party is happy to sprout so-called facts about applications, it forgets to talk about enrolments.
In 1997, while applications fell by 3.4 per cent, enrolments increased by 4.9 per cent. HECS seems to have little to do with students' choices about whether they start higher education. The proof of the pudding is in the eating: enrolments in arts, which is the cheapest HECS course, fell by four per cent; enrolments in science, which is the middle HECS category, fell by two per cent; while enrolments in law, which is the most expensive HECS category for undergraduate courses, rose by 0.6 per cent.
Madam Deputy Speaker, you are an intelligent person, and you would realise that, if what the Labor Party is saying were true, there would have been an increase in the applications for arts because of the cheapness of the category. There would also have been an increase in the applications for science, and there would have been a decrease in the applications for law, because it is the most expensive category. In fact, quite the opposite has happened, and that gives the lie to the suggestion of the Labor Party that HECS is influencing students' decisions about undergraduate courses.
We have to understand why applications are changing. It would be good for the Labor Party to catch up with some of these changes as we are going into the 21st century. I know that the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is an unreconstructed leftie from the 1970s, a trade union leader in a suit, but it is 1998. The member for Batman has to realise that, because he is in a safe seat, he is going to be a member of parliament well into the next century. Therefore, he should try to catch up with some of the changes in our economy and understand why things are happening.
For example, students these days are much more discerning about the courses they choose to take. Universities are now part of the market for higher education and so they 
 need to offer courses and match students to courses that students want, as opposed to the courses that universities want to offer. Because of the government's excellent changes in vocational education and training, which I know have been endorsed privately by the member for Batman, there has been a massive increase in the number of people in TAFE—55,000 in 1996-97. Some 220,000 new apprenticeships are starting this year and next year and, because of that, fewer people need to start at university who might want to choose other options. They are taking up those other options.
—What about the last year and the fall off?
—It is no coincidence that applications fell the most in New South Wales where, coincidentally, there was the largest increase in new jobs in the last quarter. I am not absolutely certain of the figure, but I think that 90,000 new jobs were created in New South Wales alone in the last quarter of last year. This means that students have a lot more options than they had before, which means that they are less inclined to go on to tertiary education if they think that that is not what is good for them in terms of their careers.
Turning to science enrolments, science applications have fallen by 1.9 per cent in 1998, while overall applications have fallen by 3.5 per cent. Where is the crisis in science applications? Science applications have actually fallen by less that the 3.5 per cent that applications have fallen by across the board. In 1997, science enrolments—remembering the difference between applications and enrolments—actually rose by five per cent. I defy the member for Barton to produce the evidence of a crisis in science applications.
The other important thing for the member for Batman to remember as part of his pledge to try to up-grade and modernise his thinking for the next century, is that a lot of people who would previously have studied physical science are now moving into computer science streams at university. As a consequence, the share of enrolments in computer studies at schools has increased to four per cent from 
 0.4 per cent, and that has been mirrored at universities. In 1997, enrolments in mathematics and physical sciences fell by 5.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, but computer science enrolments increased by 14 per cent.
There is also considerable variation in the pattern of science applications. In Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, applications for science courses increased—6.1 per cent in Queensland, 0.6 per cent in South Australia and 1.2 per cent in Tasmania—so I defy the Labor Party to produce evidence of a pattern across Australia of a massive collapse in science applications. It simply is not true. The member for Bonython's pious amendment is aptly named, but it is also disingenuous, unctuous and sanctimonious, and it should be exposed for the tripe that it is.
The accomplishments of a nation's higher education system are measured by many factors. It is essential that Australia's tertiary institutions not only continue to maintain world-class standards but continue to set higher standards to remain competitive in the world market. The introduction of fee paying students, both overseas and Australian, will lend itself to continuing our competitiveness in the international higher education market. The regulated fee paying student system means that Australian universities have a strong financial incentive to deliver a high quality product to Australian and overseas students. This will also have spin-off benefits for non-fee paying students.
The coalition government also recognises that high endeavour deserves recognition and reward. Accordingly, the Committee for University Teaching and Development was established in July 1996. With a $20 million budget over a three-year period, the committee makes recommendations for grants to encourage practical development and improvements in teaching and for the provision of staff development initiatives. In recognition of the outstanding work of educators, this government is committed to enhancing the status of teaching. The Australian Awards for University Teaching recognise excellence in teaching which surpasses the elevated standards that already exist in our higher education system. 
Funding arrangements for higher education research through the targeted higher education research program have been increased over the 1997-99 triennium with additional funding totalling $129.3 million, including the $90 million for research infrastructure. The quality of research training is being improved through an additional $9.3 million in support for Australian postgraduate awards.
This government has also overseen improvements to the funding of collaborative research grants. This has now been realigned in the strategic partnerships with the industry research and training scheme and has enjoyed an increase of over $30 million. This collaborative funding arrangement will produce stronger partnerships between industry and universities, providing mutually beneficial opportunities for researchers in both sectors in addition to encouraging and assisting universities to diversify their funding sources.
In considering the amount of resources available to the higher education system, it is essential to look beyond the government's direct contribution and to consider the total level of funding which is available. At present, while the government remains the single largest source of funding, approximately 33c in every university funded dollar comes from non-government sources. All indications suggest that these revenue sources have the potential for significant increases. Indeed, it is estimated that by 1999 total university funding from all sources will increase by approximately $650 million from the 1995 funding amount available to Australian universities.
This government also acknowledges the commercially strategic importance of attracting students from overseas. While the Asian financial crisis is having an expected temporary effect on the exponential growth of fee paying Asian students participating in Australian universities, the Australian tertiary system is still a very competitive alternative to most other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. Furthermore, currency devaluations may work to the advantage of Australian universities, in many cases by widening the cost gap between our education export market and those of other 
 countries vying for a share of the lucrative international education market.
The simple fact remains that Australia's tertiary institutions have an enviable reputation overseas and should therefore continue to capture a very significant share of the education export market. Although there has been a 26 per cent fall in student numbers from South Korea and a seven per cent fall from Thailand, it has been countered to a certain extent by strengthening numbers in enrolments from students from Indonesia, China, Vietnam and India. Possibly as a result of social unrest in their home country, Indonesian students studying in Australia have increased by 11 per cent, Chinese students have increased by nine per cent and, significantly, Vietnamese student numbers are up by 46 per cent and students from India are up by 41 per cent.
This government also recognises that a modern education must place an emphasis on individual skills development. Students and trainees with qualifications which meet the needs of the business community not only are an attractive employment proposition but add to the skills base of Australian industry and research to the benefit of all Australians. This is fundamentally why one of the government's main priorities is to ensure that every young person wanting to pursue education or training after the compulsory years of schooling has the opportunity to do so.
At present, approximately one-quarter of all 16- to 18-year-olds in Australia are not participating in any form of post-compulsory education or training. This is why the coalition government believes that further education and training should be inclusive of, and not exclusive to, any section of the community. Alternatively, the former Labor government supported a tertiary education system which was limited to a privileged number of students and an apprenticeship system which had a minimal impact on both young people and the business sector.
By increasing the number of further education opportunities available to young people, the coalition government is also very mindful of the importance of increasing opportunities for groups that have been previously 
 underrepresented in higher education. This government has introduced merit scholarships to encourage an increase in student participation by people with disabilities, from an indigenous background, from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, from rural and isolated areas or from non-English speaking backgrounds. In many cases, access to further education can give people from these groups the freedom to pursue their dreams and to live more independently. In this respect, the introduction of merit scholarships by this government has been very significant.
Merit scholarships provide exemptions from the HECS charge to the equivalent of 1,000 full-time students each year. By the year 2000, the scholarships will provide HECS exemptions for the equivalent of 4,000 full-time students every academic year. This is an outstanding achievement of the coalition government.
It all demonstrates this government's resolve to reinvigorate Australia's higher education system so that it continues to remain world class and becomes more accessible to young and old Australians who wish to seek further education. The Labor Party have no credible plan to make the education system more accessible to all Australians, but they are asking the Australian public for absolution for their 13 years of inactivity and lack of imagination when in government. Meanwhile, the coalition government continues to make more opportunities available for more young people. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I oppose the second reading of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  and support the amendment moved by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans). There was some hypocrisy in the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). In his concluding words he said that the philosophy of the current government was to ensure that Australian universities `remain' at the international standard that they are respected for—or words to that effect. Necessarily, he means `respected for' their present status achieved over the period of all previous governments, certainly those from the 1970s.
At that stage, after admitting that Australian universities are of world standard, how can he dare criticise the initiatives of the former Labor government? In fact, the tragedy of all of this is that most of the initiatives that have occurred have had bipartisan support. Until the more ideologically hamstrung Howard government, all parties had favoured the development of Australia's talent base. That is now not the case.
The greatest indictment of this government was—I will quote the member; I think it is a fair quote—`Everyone can take their first preference if they can afford to pay.' That is the result of user-pays. If you can afford to pay, you get to use. If you cannot afford to pay, you do not get to use. They say, `Hold on, there is a whole range of other courses available here,' but the facts of the matter are that people are going to be paying these very hefty enrolment fees of $100,000 to $120,000 a course. They will not be paying them for lower TER arts degrees. They will not be paying them for lower TER commerce degrees. They will be paying them because they cannot get the TERs to get into the elite courses such as medicine, law, dentistry and vet science.
So what is happening is that those 25 per cent of places that are being earmarked as private full fee paying places will be those in the elite courses. That is going to have some fundamental effects on the future structure of society, and I will say something during my speech on that. The member says, `Look, we have identified 25 per cent of places, but we have not disturbed the totality of existing places.' I have already said that the totality of existing non-full fee paying places will most likely be in the non-elite courses.
Aside from that, I was put to a challenge, and I will put the other side to a challenge. Tell me one university or tertiary education institution that has built an additional building. I will be satisfied with an additional room; I will be satisfied with an additional demountable. Tell me one university or higher education institution that has employed one additional staff member. They cannot because in fact 3,000 have lost their jobs or departed the sector over the past year. If you do not 
 have new buildings, if you do not have new lecturers, how can you say that those 75 per cent of places are the 100 per cent of places? They clearly are not. Clearly, 25 per cent of places being earmarked as private full fee paying places have been taken out of 100 per cent, leaving 75 per cent for those who cannot afford to pay their fees.
My little niece, Jacqui, will be doing her high school certificate at the end of this year. She is fortunately doing very well at school. She has a lot of opportunities ahead of her, and she has the prospect of making those elite courses but, effectively, 25 per cent of those elite courses have been taken away from her prospects. She will be competing for 75 per cent of those elite courses.
It is just nonsense for anyone on the other side to say that is fair, that is equitable and that is part of the Australian way. I can remember sitting for my high school certificate was indeed more stressful than an Australian Labor Party preselection. It is a very stressful occasion. The facts of the matter are that there will be a rise in the stress levels and the pressure placed on those 75 per cent of students whose mums and dads cannot afford the spare $100,000 or $120,000 to pay their full fees. Effectively, 25 per cent of their opportunities have been taken away from them.
So that is something that I feel particularly strongly about. It is something that is particularly reprehensible and quite un-Australian and contrary to the bipartisan support that existed until we had this more ideologically fanatical government. They are obsessed with this user-pays/free market philosophy. The tertiary education sector has now become an industry. It is not a service to individuals, it is not a service developing Australia's future talent and resource base, it is now an industry. These universities are businesses competing within that industry.
That brings me on to the next point: how this philosophy has fundamentally affected my electorate. In my electorate I have the St George campus of the University of New South Wales at Oatley. What has occurred is that there has been quite a lot of money—I think it is about $11 million—and 1,100-odd 
 student places taken away from the University of New South Wales. So they have asked, `How do we make this up?' They have said, `We are in this brave new world. We are in the free market economy. We are going to have to, in the future, attract these 25 per cent of full fee paying places.' Of course, they are saying, `Who is going to pay a full fee?' Again, as I have said, they are in the elite courses. They are also saying, `What other avenues are there available for earning money?' Of course, they are in the research facilities, whether it is pharmaceuticals, engineering or medicine or other forms of research.
So what is being taught at the St George campus of the University of New South Wales? What do we have out there? The vice-chancellor says, `We have one of Australia's premier teacher education facilities for teaching primary and infant students at a stage when they are developing their literacy skills. We have a very sophisticated sports-science facility out there—one that contributed to Australia's cycling success in the last Olympic Games.' Is anyone going to pay a quid to get into those courses? They say, `No, we are not going to make much money out of that. How much is it costing us to run that campus out there?' The conclusion comes up, `That is expendable.'
So the University of New South Wales, as a result of these financial pressures, and as a result of the future pressures to earn more money—indeed, to earn money to survive in this brave new world—has said the campus is expendable and is shutting it down. It is shutting it down despite the fact that it is one of Australia's premier teacher education facilities. It is a purpose-built facility, ideal for what is being taught. It is a world leader indeed in the use of computer technology for educational purposes at the childhood level. It is the only university in southern Sydney for 500,000 people. That includes my electorate of 120,000 people and the matter also vitally concerns the marginal seat of Hughes, held by Mrs Vale.
This sale is being considered despite the fact that the University of New South Wales was given this very significant public resource 
 by Minister Metherell of the Liberal state government in the late 1980s for a payment of $1 and despite the fact that all the documentation at that time indicated the intention that the university was to hold it, effectively, on trust, to serve the higher education needs of southern Sydney and to provide education for the educators.
All this appears very unjust in terms of the history of that institution and the success it has achieved, and indeed is still achieving despite a very significantly depleted morale. It is grossly unjust for the campus to be closed. But the University of New South Wales is saying, `Look, we are in a business here. We are no longer service providers; we are no longer educators. We can make a quid out of this university. We cannot make a quid because we cannot get people to pay full fees nor can we do research, but we can lease it or we can sell it and that is going to be a good little earner,' as is said in the TV program Minder.
The St George campus, instead of being a vital teacher education facility, is becoming a good little earner. The University of New South Wales is going from educator to landlord and the government seems to suggest that that is appropriate. In June last year I asked a question without notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as to whether he would intervene in the situation. He candidly said, `No, the government's policy is that these things are matters for the autonomy of the university concerned.' Departmental representatives have been cross-examined before Senate estimates committees and they are in favour of the University of New South Wales becoming a landlord rather than an educator because it is part of the overall business plan of these universities now. That is what they have to have: they have to have business plans. They do not have to have aspirations to develop Australia's educators and in turn for those educators to develop Australia's talent base for the future. That is not their concern. They are running a business.
The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) himself has, I understand, been approached by the member for Hughes for a meeting with 
 representatives of the St George campus. To my amazement, I found out that that meeting had been declined, despite the fact that the member for Hughes, I have to say, has been devoted to this issue, as have I. Despite her making that request, and despite the fact that she has to win an election, probably in a few months time, in a marginal seat, the minister's office declined the meeting. Instead, of the Liberals, what is on offer here?
I say this to up the ante. Last Friday I attended the campus with the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the shadow minister for education. He inspected the campus, the purpose-built facilities, the video rooms, the computer rooms, the sports facilities, and he said, `You cannot let a public resource like this go.' He has made a commitment that Labor will ensure that the teacher education facility at the St George campus will continue, even if it means facilitating the transfer of the campus to the University of Wollongong. Detailed proposals have been put forward by both the St George campus and the University of Wollongong as to why that is practicable and how it could be achieved with a payment of about 4½ million over a four-year period. They have sat down and drawn up their figures sensibly and that is all it would require to achieve the survival of the St George campus. But the minister has literally done a Pontius Pilate. He has literally washed his hands of the issue. The people of southern Sydney, if this government goes beyond the end of the year, are going to lose a very vital teacher education facility.
I have concentrated to date on the unfairness to the individuals and also the effect that this market driven mentality has had on a very significant local institution. Indeed, I am sure that situation is being reflected in many regional institutions. I would also like to comment on, from the point of view of the amendment moved by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), just what effect this government's policy has had on Australia's future industry base.
It has to be seen in the context of the introduction of increased HECS charges from about $2,700 to almost $5,000 for science, which has caused a significant problem. 
 Indeed, Vice-Chancellor Niland, despite my disagreements with him in respect of the St George campus, has been on the record as saying the effect that this is having on the development of science is as catastrophic as a major drought. Although it was a year before my birth, I know the consequences of the Russians launching the Sputnik in 1957. The Western world was caught short by seeing the Russians with this space technology ahead of the world. The space technology, of course, was allied to the use of missile launching facilities.
What happened after that? There was a panic. In New South Wales the Wyndham scheme was introduced to increase the maths and science literacy of the student population. I remember when I did my higher school certificate, for instance, that if you did first level science and maths you effectively got the marks equivalent for three subjects where you studied only for two. There was a very concerted effort that lasted a good 20 years to increase the science base of Western countries—a number of countries were like ourselves. That paid dividends. Australia has, in recent years, created about two per cent of all world inventions, despite our small population.
Without the government sponsoring, developing and promoting the university sector, including opening up the use of research and development grants, that science base that we have developed is at serious risk. The government should look very closely at what is happening in the allocation of education resources. Again, because of this concept that all these universities are autonomous, that they can all compete, catch and kill their own, there is no coordination as to what they are going to develop—whether it is teacher education or science—or how they can contribute to the Australian economy.
I indicate to the government that the lack of appropriate resourcing of Australian universities is a matter of concern for the public generally. A poll taken last year on behalf of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee showed that 65.6 per cent of Australians believed that Australia should be spending more on higher education and certainly more 
 than our Asian neighbours. The Asian nations which look like weathering the economic troubles in the region are Taiwan and Singapore. Taiwan spends 11 per cent of its gross domestic product on education, Singapore 17 per cent and Australia only 5.3 per cent. Sixty-five per cent of Australians say that we should be doing better than they are. We should significantly up the ante. Only 5.8 per cent said that we should spend less, which is what this government, no matter how it wants to bodgie the figures, is doing. A total of 60.3 per cent of Australians surveyed thought that the priority this government gives to education is too low and only seven per cent thought the government gave too much priority to education. An overwhelming 94 per cent agreed that universities were important for shaping Australia's long-term future.
The Prime Minister quite frequently gets up and says, `You are seeking more taxpayer funding for universities. What about those battlers who have no aspirations for their kids to go to universities?' With respect to him, he is putting a chip on their shoulder which they themselves do not have. While they may not have aspirations for their own children, they appreciate the importance of education for all Australia. If it is their neighbour's kid, their niece or nephew, they appreciate that education is a great resource.
The figures indicate that if you have a tertiary education qualification your prospects of unemployment are diminished by a massive 50 per cent. Australians appreciate the individual significance. But, more importantly, they do not have this small-minded mentality; they appreciate the significance of Australia's higher education sector for Australia. That is something this government do not do. They have put ideology ahead of national goals—goals which we should achieve not only for individual Australians but also for the nation as a whole.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-03-09,"—I am very pleased to be following the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) tonight. Like him, what I want to do is focus my remarks particularly on the economic impact on Australia but also on the university that happens to be in my electorate, the La 
 Trobe University. I am also very pleased to be able to support the Labor amendment which highlights to the House and to the Australian people the folly of the Howard government's reforms and changes to Australian universities.
It is the case, as so many have said before us, that the prosperity of our nation to a very large extent is determined by the skill and knowledge of our people. This has become increasingly so as the effects of globalisation have impacted on national economies. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) outlined not only the importance of education as a means of coping with globalisation but also the importance of education for earning export income. In his speech he warned against taking our current pre-eminent position as an education services exporter for granted.
This is one of Labor's major criticisms of this government. They are not just taking our current position for granted; they are actually seeking to weaken it. What is readily apparent is that those nations most successful at coping with and taking advantage of the changes wrought by globalisation are those with a highly educated and highly skilled population and work force. It is not just the nation as a whole that benefits; individual citizens and businesses that benefit. And, when increased investment is made in people through improved education, the country as a whole benefits.
Let us have a look at what the coalition parties in their 1996 pre-election policy statements actually said:
. . . the Liberal and National Parties recognise that an educated and well trained society is an essential part of ensuring that Australia improves its international competitiveness and, consequently, our ability to guarantee sustainable economic and employment growth.
You would think there were no grounds for disagreement. Why is it, then, that since the election of the Howard government two years ago we have seen such considerable cuts particularly taken to higher education? They have taken to education with a logic that seems to completely fly in the face of not 
 only international evidence but also their pre-election promises.
There have been cuts to higher education of over $900 million, seeing a reduction of 21,000 student places. HECS has been transformed through increased charges, through differential rates and through lower repayment thresholds into what is now a real barrier to higher education for many from low and middle income families. As the member for Barton indicated, this has seen in particular a decline in enrolments in key disciplines, and of major concern to Australia is the decline in the sciences. This is because of the disproportionate HECS burden placed on science graduates.
There has been more than $240 million cut from vocational education and training and another half a billion dollars cut from student assistance. This is not a message about supporting young people in their educational aspirations. This is not a message about saying that, if we want to be part of the world, we will invest in our young people, invest in education. I must say that one wonders whether any of this was in the mind of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) before the last election. There was certainly no mention that this would be the government's policy. I have absolutely no doubt that parents and students alike will be much more wary this time when facing the ballot box.
The government seems to see no role for education as a means of transforming and invigorating our society, of helping it to cope with and take advantage of our place in the world. The government seems to have no appreciation of the importance of education as a major generator of export income nor any understanding, I would have to say, of how precarious our current advantage is. At best the government seems to see education as a private good only, of value only to the individual and therefore to be subject to the most severe of user-pays principles. That of course is why we have seen the changes to the HECS scheme and why we see the worst of user pays, which is the introduction of up-front fees.
As I said, tonight I want to briefly set out the real impact of these changes on one 
 university, because sometimes what happens in these debates is that we use these big numbers—hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cuts on this and that—and nobody really has much of an idea of what the real impact is on particular places and particular people. In the electorate of Jagajaga is one of Melbourne's finest universities, La Trobe University. While the main campus in Bundoora was established some time ago, La Trobe now does have a network of regional campuses around Victoria in Wodonga, Bendigo, Shepparton, Mildura and Mount Buller.
We can all be very proud of the efforts of the staff and the achievements of the students at La Trobe for their fine academic and research record.	But I am pleased to say it is also one of the universities that has taken a stand against the Howard government's imposition of full up-front fees, and this has not been an easy thing to do. This university actually understands the community that it is part of. It knows that universities need to offer access to their courses on the basis of merit, not on the basis of how much you can pay to do a particular course, not on the basis of how much Dad or Mum have in the bank.
This university is not located in a wealthy area and it does realise that providing excellence in education to this community is a goal to be worthy of, an important goal of being able to offer the students of the northern suburbs of Melbourne who do not come from wealthy families the opportunity to get on in life. As the member for Barton said, the one thing you can be sure of that will take you away from the horror of unemployment is a decent education. It is a thing that this government does not seem to understand. What they want to do is talk about the need to reduce unemployment by attacking the unemployed. A much more productive way of going about things would be to invest in education to give young people the opportunity to improve their lot and not to face the horror of unemployment.
Unfortunately, it is the case that La Trobe has been forced, like most universities, to make cuts to programs in order to cope with this government's funding cuts. The National 
 Tertiary Education Union reports that 3,000 jobs have been lost to academia in the last 18 months, 230 of those at La Trobe alone. In fact, the scale of the cuts to funding at La Trobe is effectively around 25 per cent over the years 1997 to 2000 because the university has had to also absorb an unfunded pay increase for academic staff. Cuts of this scale have meant that Italian, chemistry, agriculture and humanities courses have been affected. This is the real impact of these budget cuts. All of these courses have had to be downgraded, cut. The university's music course, which has received wide renown for the quality of its graduates, will be forced to close. Within the humanities, a significant cut has been made to the school of archaeology, one of the landmark research areas at the university with an impressive reputation in archaeological research into the indigenous inhabitants of Australia.
The closure of the music school means that the plans of the 200 students who are enrolled in the course have been thrown into doubt. It has been a particularly popular course because it is one of the few in the country where students can actually study contemporary music. Even if those students currently enrolled are able to complete their course, the fact that the course is closing and there will be no new students coming in will of course take away from the vitality of the department. Many have already reported the real impact of the decision to close this course—a completely different change in atmosphere and dedication in the department. As I said, these are the real impacts of these cuts, the real impacts on the students and their aspirations.
Another blow has been the forced closure of the School of Environmental and Resource Sciences, yet another devastating impact of the Howard government's cuts. Because of La Trobe's wide regional presence, the effect of the cuts has also translated into areas already hard hit by the loss or downsizing of Commonwealth and state government presence. Staff currently located in Albury-Wodonga are having to relocate to Bendigo because of the forced concentration of the school of education in response to these funding cuts.
As I have said already, and I will say it again because it is so important for everybody to understand: the real impacts of this government's cuts to higher education are dashed hopes and reduced opportunities. They are the real impacts of what we are talking about tonight. Even despite this, the La Trobe University does continue to pursue innovative programs. It has recently announced an initiative involving education and Asia. It certainly has many students from Asia studying at the university, but it has also developed a program in partnership with a number of Asian universities in different countries to allow Australian students to take part in the courses in Asia. This, of course, will allow our Australian students to acquire a genuine understanding of their studies from an international perspective.
That said, even with that enthusiasm to continue to pursue innovative ideas, there is no escaping the fact that the overall effects of the cuts and the subsequent reduction in the numbers of staff and the numbers of students have been a lowering of morale and a lowering of commitment to education, which is the last thing that anybody would want to see in this country. Neither the staff nor the students can face the future with any degree of security. There is no longer any sense of security about higher education. In that, they have a lot in common with other areas of Australian society because the government is taking these funding cuts into so many aspects of our lives.
But it is through these cuts to higher education that we are seeing the tearing away of opportunities from our young people that would, in fact, see them contribute so much to our country in the future. It is an indictment of this government that we have seen such significant cuts that will have such a long lasting and devastating impact. For that reason, I strongly commend the opposition's amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Zammit, Paul, MP",IND,1998-03-09,"—I would just like to say at the outset with regard to the comments made by the honourable member for Barton (Mr McClelland) that I had occasion to visit the St George campus. Some of my constituents go to that university. 
 What I saw there impressed me immensely. It will be a very grave shame if that campus is closed down and lost forever because it is doing really good things and it should be very proud of its achievements. I wish the honourable member for Barton good luck in ensuring to the best of his ability that the campus remains open, even if it means amalgamating with the campus of the University of Wollongong.
Ever since men and women started to read and write, there is one thing that all parents around the world have in common, no matter what nation we come from: apart from good health, we want for our children the very best education that is available. We know that it is the future, and that is what we want for our children. I was fortunate some years ago as a state member of the New South Wales parliament to go on a state visit to China. There is a sister state relationship with the state of New South Wales and the Guangdong province in China. I recall visiting quite a few places where they have strong manufacturing set-ups, and I was very impressed with what I saw there, especially in what is known as their economic development zones.
There was one particular factory that I visited and, whilst I am not very computer literate, I saw on a large wall a very large computer—I am advised, the very best technology that is available anywhere in the world. All that was needed to operate that computer—it was there to check the quality of the product that was being made—was one young lady. She sat there with the mainframe feeding information into the computer and watching the computer. I spoke to that young lady and to the manager of that firm and said that I was very impressed with what I saw there, and they said to me, `Yes, this is the very best that is available anywhere in the world. It is made in Germany.' Then they said to me that, within a short period, it is their view that they will be able to compete with the Germans and be able to produce similar equipment for their own market in China.
Education is extremely important. I am getting a message from the universities, from the tutors, from some of the vice-chancellors that I speak to and certainly from the students 
 at the universities that there are grave concerns about the cutbacks. I am advised that tutorials are now being dramatically cut back. Whilst we will not see the effects of these cutbacks now or in the next few months, we will certainly see the effects of these cutbacks over a longer period—two, three or four years down the track. I think that is a shame.
Australia is renowned for its education system. Australia has one of the best education systems anywhere in the world, and anything that is done that would reduce that tremendous respect that Australia has all around the world for its tertiary institutions would cause a very serious problem.
We all know that overseas fee paying students have always provided a valuable source of income for Australian universities. However, in light of the cutbacks to public spending and the downturn in the Asian economies, which will inevitably lead to a drop off in overseas students wanting to come to Australia from the Asia-Pacific region, universities now are under tremendous pressure to find alternative means of raising revenue.
The changes introduced by the coalition government have pressured the universities to dramatically increase the revenue raising efforts, which have resulted, I am sad to say, in a two-tiered education system which tends to favour the rich and disadvantage those who cannot pay an up-front fee for degree courses. Beginning this year, Australian universities will for the first time offer full fee paying degree courses to any student who can afford the fee, including local Australian students. In turn, for paying the up-front fee, students will be able to enter university with an entrance ranking five per cent lower than that of other students. I am very concerned at that because there is no doubt the impression will be given—especially overseas—that we are downgrading the very highest levels that are available at Australian universities. Of all the changes made, I think this is probably the one thing that has caused the greatest angst amongst Australian students because they can see well into the future and I see this causing us tremendous problems further down the track. 
The other problem is this growing feeling in the community that those who can afford to pay for it will be able to provide for their children an opportunity that those who cannot will not be able to do. That is not the Australian way. That is not the way I believe Australia should be going. Those who are colloquially known as the Aussie battlers should be given every possible opportunity and should be able to compete with everybody else on the same level and at the same opportunity. This is not happening.
Time is running on and I know there are a lot of bills before the parliament. I would just like to say in conclusion that, whilst I agree with the sentiments in the amendment proposed by the opposition, I will not be supporting the amendment on this occasion. We are only a few weeks away from the budget, which will come down in May, and I would like to reserve my judgment on the situation until I see what is in the budget.
—Don't hold your breath.
—I do not know about holding my breath; it is not that long for me to wait. I will leave my comments at that. I want to reiterate that, whilst I agree with the sentiments in the amendment, I will not be supporting it.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—As I will be the last speaker in this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 , I shall make some broad comments on the debate as well as address the issues which were raised by the second reading amendment from the opposition. The government's principal objectives in relation to higher education are to expand the opportunity for young Australians and older Australians to take part in higher education and to improve the quality of the teaching and research in Australia's universities.
Australia's universities have a critical role in ensuring  that this country is able to be dynamic, strong and competitive into the 21st 
 century. The research effort of Australian universities is critical in ensuring that science, technology and industry in Australia are able to take advantage of the most recent advances in knowledge, that our scientists are at the cutting edge of world science and that the Australian nation can benefit from that fact. The government is also concerned to promote the quality of teaching in Australian universities because, from the point of view of most young Australians, it is the teaching function which impinges most directly on their future opportunities.
The government's policies have been designed to open the doors to increasing levels of resourcing for Australian universities. To do that, we have altered the mix to a degree between public and private funding. The government has taken a number of decisions in this era of fiscal constraint, when we have had to fill the $10 billion black hole left by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was Minister for Finance. We have opened the door to the universities gaining additional resources from other avenues.
As a consequence of this, Australian universities are today better resourced than ever before. Total university revenues have risen by some $400 million in the last two years, and the projections of the universities themselves and the government indicate that university revenues will increase substantially over the next few years as well.
The total number of enrolments in Australian universities this year is likely to be significantly higher than last year. The government has given very high priority to ensuring that school leavers and young people can continue in increasing numbers to gain access to Australian universities. Some 10,000 more places will be funded by the Commonwealth government in universities this year than in the last year of the Labor government. So opportunities to occupy government funded places are expanding quite significantly in Australian universities at the present time.
In addition to that, the government has changed the funding for places in Australian universities and has agreed to pay to the universities the minimum differential HECS 
 of about $2,500 in respect of overenrolments. This will encourage universities to take extra students where their marginal costs are low.
The government has also allowed universities to admit for the first time full fee paying students to undergraduate places. This has been an important advance in equity and social justice in relation to admission to universities. It has put Australian students in the position of overseas students for the first time. The Labor Party, as we know, have consistently sought to deny access to Australian students on the same basis as overseas students for purely ideological reasons. Their ideology of class warfare has once again misled them here. In fact, these fee paying places have opened the doors of opportunity to hundreds of Australian students who would not have otherwise been able to gain their first preference places. Many of these students, as we know, have vacated government funded places to take up their first preference. This has meant that many Australian students who would not otherwise have gained entry to universities at all are now able to occupy government funded places which would have been closed to them.
This government has acted decisively to address the problem of unmet demand, which was one of the most unfortunate legacies of the Labor period in office. As we recall, the Labor Party, through its ideological policies, shut the doors of Australian universities to tens of thousands of qualified students. This government has moved to put in place policies to open these doors to Australian students and, as I have said before, this year we will very likely have the largest number of students enrolled in undergraduate places in universities for a very long time. We will certainly be seeing many more government funded places in universities this year than ever existed under the Labor Party.
This gives the lie to the first proposition in the second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party that places in universities have been reduced by 21,000. This is truly Orwellian stuff: places in universities are up, but the Labor Party says places in universities are down. Nothing shows more clearly the 
 fantasy land in which these idealogues on the other side of the House are living.
Their sole justification for this figure is that it relates to the forward estimates, which they were never going to be able to deliver. They were never going to be able to deliver these figures because the present Leader of the Opposition, when he was Minister for Finance, allowed the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, to walk right over him in the course of every budget process. Spending got out of control and the country plunged into deficit—$23 billion of deficit in the last two years of the Labor government. There is no question whatever that, just like the fantasy unemployment targets that the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is so fond of, these fantasy targets for places in Australian universities had any chance of ever becoming reality.
As to the second proposition of the second reading amendment concerning the up-front fees policy, we now have some 800 Australian students who have been admitted this year to the courses that they wanted—
—You're still looking for them under the bed.
—They have shown their willingness to invest in their own education.
—What marks did they get?
—And they have vacated places in Australian universities that can now be occupied by students who depend on government funded places. It is very disappointing that the student unions unleashed by the Labor Party have intimidated a number of the universities from offering up-front fees places. Therefore, many Australian students who would otherwise have gained those places have been denied them by the Labor Party's minions on the university campuses. These are the student unionists who still seek in a number of states to use the compulsorily acquired fees of students to support their own activities but deny other Australian students the right to access places in Australian universities.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The honourable members at the table will kindly desist from interjecting.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is very hard to suppress the noise from the other side of the chamber, but I know you are doing your best. The third proposition in this second reading amendment relates to the HECS fees imposed by the government. Again, this is a change which is a significant advance in equity because it means that students in the more high cost courses with the higher prospect of substantial incomes when they graduate are now paying a higher proportion of their course costs. The Labor Party thought it was entirely equitable to have students in lower cost courses like arts courses paying a much higher proportion of their costs than it was to have medical students paying a reasonable proportion of their costs. The government has righted that wrong and, consequently, it has put in place a much fairer HECS regime than ever existed under the previous government.
The Labor Party persists with the fantasy that this has, in some way, affected science enrolments. There is no evidence whatever that this is the case. In fact, science applications rose this year some six per cent in Queensland. They are essentially stable in several of the other states. There is no Australia-wide pattern in science applications. Therefore, there is no basis whatever for saying that the HECS charges have affected the pattern of science enrolments. For many years, the Labor government allowed the decline in science in schools to continue. Because their education policies are essentially handed to them by the Australian Education Union, they were unable to do anything about science or maths in schools, or indeed about literacy—the Australian Education Union would not allow them to do so.
This government is now acting very strongly to put in place literacy and numeracy standards at a national level for the very first time in Australian history. That is because we are not beholden to the Australian Education Union but take our decisions in the public interest and what is in the interests of young Australians. The opposition's second reading 
 amendment, therefore, is completely without foundation or credibility. It flies in the face of the facts. It shows that the Labor Party has absolutely no grasp of the fundamental issues in this area.
The government is particularly concerned, as I said at the start of my remarks, to expand opportunities in education. That is why we have increased the number of government funded places. That is why we are increasing the opportunities for universities to fund additional places at minimum differential HECS. That is why we have allowed Australian undergraduates to invest in their university education by paying fees if they wish to gain their first preference course. It is also the reason why we have supported an increasing number of places in TAFE. There were some 53,000 additional places in TAFE last year, of which 43,000 were funded by the Commonwealth government, and there will be additional places in TAFE this year. It is also the reason why we have put in place the new national apprenticeship system.
You would think that someone like the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) on the other side of the table would have some concern for the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go on to university. Instead, we have heard the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) say that he is deeply concerned that this government is placing too much weight on vocational education. He rarely speaks in this House, as we know, about anything other than universities. He shows no concern for the students who are not going on to university, but this government does. That is because this government is greatly concerned with equity and fairness in education. Consequently, we are now seeing a very substantial increase in apprenticeships and traineeships and the numbers are rising very rapidly.
Last year we had a record number of apprentices and trainees. New apprenticeships were up by 11 per cent in 1997 over 1996. We have just had a 24 per cent increase in trade apprenticeships in the first part of this year over the previous year. So apprenticeships are now recovering from the devastating situation into which they were forced by the failure of the Labor Party to take account of 
 the needs of all young people who need those kinds of opportunities.
This government is completely unequivocal in its determination to expand the resources of Australian universities, even in a time of fiscal constraints. Operating grants paid for by the Commonwealth government for Australian universities are up this year over last year.
—That's a big measure!
—They are up by some $4 million this year. If we look at total resourcing from the Commonwealth budget for higher education this year, we find that total resourcing, including research grants, is up some $40 million over last year—1998 over 1997.
—Don't mention 1996.
—Over the last two years, the total revenue of Australian universities is up by some $400 million.
—That's a different measure.
—But it is the important measure. That is where the Labor Party has fallen down year after year, because it has failed to open the doors to proper resourcing for Australian universities. This government is determined to place Australian universities at the level of the world's best. That is not going to happen overnight after the run-down which has occurred over the last 13 years. Funding per student has also risen. We now have the highest funding level, at $11,400 per student, that we have had since 1990. This is significantly higher than funding per student in the last year of the Labor Party in 1996.
I believe the government's credibility in relation to education and training is unquestioned by anybody who looks at the matter reasonably and is prepared to look at the facts without the blinkers of ideology which the Labor Party imposes in this area. Nothing demonstrates this more than the  Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 . I have pleasure in asking the House to support this bill and to reject the second reading amendment of the Labor Party.

",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Lloyd, Jim, MP",LP,1998-03-09,"—I would like to take the opportunity tonight to raise a concern of mine. As many in this House would know, unfortunately my father passed away last year. I would like to speak about the disgraceful letter that my mother received just five days after my father had passed away after 52 years of marriage. The letter my mother received was from Rookwood Gardens, and it was headed with the name of the funeral director. The letter stated:
The New South Wales Public Health Regulations requires us to record the placement of the cremated remains. We therefore respectfully ask you to 
 contact us as soon as convenient. The arrangements necessary to proceed with your wishes can be at our Memorial Office any time by prior appointment between the hours of 8.00 am—5.00 pm seven days a week.
In the next few days, if you have not made prior contact with us—
remember that this is five days after my father's death—
we will telephone you to assist you with arranging a day and time that is convenient to you.
We respectfully ask that the one authorising the arrangements be the above addressee.
I was so enraged by this letter that I contacted the Department of Fair Trading through the state member Mr Bruce MacCarthy, who assisted me with this matter. I also contacted the Hon. Faye Lo Po. I was very disappointed in the letter that I received from the Department of Fair Trading, signed by the director-general, in response to my concern. The letter said that Rookwood Gardens had been contacted and had given an assurance that the letter that was sent to my mother was not intended as a restricted marketing ploy but was meant as a letter of sympathy and condolence and to let me know that my father's ashes were ready to collect.
I raise this issue tonight not for my family's sake but for the sake of many elderly Australians who would have received a similar letter to this. When my mother received this letter she rang me in a distressed state, thinking that she had to deal with this issue straightaway and that she had to deal with Rookwood Gardens. My mother was lucky in that she had her family—me and my brother—around her to consult with her and let her know that she did not have to comply with the wishes of this letter from Rookwood Gardens.
But there are many elderly Australians out there who suffer bereavement, sometimes after many years of marriage, who do not have people around them to assist them and who are led to believe, by letters worded like this, that they must contact Rookwood Gardens, that they must deal through Rookwood Gardens to place the ashes of their loved ones with Rookwood Gardens and that they alone are those who should contact Rookwood Gardens to make the arrangements. The letter also says:
In providing a service to those who have just experienced the loss of a loved one, it is evident that most people choose to memorialise their loved ones in some form, at this time, from the many options available.
Of course, only from Rookwood Gardens. It continues:
This becomes a way of recognising a precious life lived, which family and friends find offers them great comfort now and into the future.
As you can see, Mr Speaker, this really is just a marketing ploy. I am very disappointed that the letter from the Department of Fair Trading basically accepts the explanation of Rookwood Gardens and takes no further action on it.
I have chosen to raise the issue in parliament tonight in the hope that this may gain some more publicity and in the hope that Rookwood Gardens and other funeral directors or crematoriums throughout Australia listen to my concerns on behalf of the many thousands of elderly residents who have received letters similar to this and have been distressed by them. Hopefully, some action will be taken to correct what I believe is a very disturbing form of marketing that is happening throughout Australia at this stage.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Rookwood Gardens</title>,Adjournment,12,1
