Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  The Labor Party will be supporting the passage of the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014 through this place. I want to provide a bit of context and background as to how we have come to where we are on this.


In this bill we are looking at a series of well-negotiated, bipartisan suggestions and proposals on how implementation of the FoFA reforms of previous years can be improved in a practical, sensible and reasonable manner. I want to acknowledge the work that the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, the Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer, has done in bringing these together in conjunction with Dr Jim Chalmers, the shadow minister from the Labor Party looking after financial services. Together they have been able to craft what is really a bipartisan series of proposals and changes that really clean up some of the more practical components of how this legislation is and has been implemented.


Mr President, as I am sure you no doubt recall, the provision of financial advice and the law surrounding that has been a very contentious issue over recent years. It has been before this chamber several times and, I am sure you recall, there was a very large debate regarding the disallowance of a series of regulations that were implemented by the last government. In the past year, we have had a series of different government ministers responsible for this area. In particular, when we were having that debate, it was Senator Sinodinos and then Senator Cormann. I note that since that time the Hon. Josh Frydenberg has also had that role, and now it is the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer.


The industry has been crying out for certainty and it has been crying out to make sure there is one fixed set of rules. Different people in this chamber at different times have had some very different views on what these laws should be, how these laws should be implemented and what the standard for the provision of financial advice should be—particularly the role that the FoFA reforms implemented by the Labor government performed. Following the end of that debate last year, I think there was an acknowledgement from the government—rightly so, I believe—that the biggest mistake we can make now is having a long debate that provides uncertainty to the industry about what the standard is and what the requirements are going to be. 


The government, at that point, turned around and said, 'As far as we're concerned, we had a different view than this parliament and certainly a different view than the Senate chamber.' They were looking to make some reforms that were not supported and were disallowed. That being said, there are still some minor reforms that can and should happen to provide practical certainty to the industry, also acknowledging that with any large piece of legislation like FoFA there are going to be implementation challenges.


I have to say the government has been true to its word. I know that, while ideologically there are certain members of the government that have come to the financial advice debate with different views, broadly they accepted that the debate had been settled and this legislation represents a consensus view that, while we may disagree on some of the bigger issues around financial advice, we can work together at a practical level to fix some of the minor challenges and make sure there is a level of certainty there for the industry.


I acknowledge the work that the PJC also has been doing in this space in relation to the provision of financial advice. The committee that I have been involved with, the Senate economics committees—both references and legislation—have also played a fairly sizeable role at different points in this debate.


There are still some challenges within the industry. I note that the PJC is looking at the education standards and has done some amazing work in setting them and working with industry to do that. I note that the Senate Economics References Committee is still going through a process, through the scrutiny of financial advice inquiry, where we are looking at whether or not there should be some kind of a scheme of last resort. They are good debates to have. There is a difference of views in this chamber, and that is all healthy; but what we do not want is to be going right back to the drawing board again for the provision of financial advice.


These are practical, simple, sensible changes to the existing legislation to provide certainty to the industry. That is why the Labor Party will be supporting the bill.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-24,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:36):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014. What a difference a day makes. In the Senate yesterday Senator Wong put on an academy-award-winning performance about the Greens doing a deal with the government over a water register and an agricultural land register. The Greens have played a very important role in this debate in this country in recent times. I was part of the Senate inquiry into the FoFA changes and played an active role in the allowance motions. But today we have been given 40 minutes notice to look at the detail of what is a very complex subject. We have been given 40 minutes notice to look at a number of changes to the bill. We have seen a number of measures in the bill removed. We have seen amendments to the bill—some minor but some very technical. We have seen a set of legislation that is a totally different from what we have been debating in this parliament in recent months. So Labor are happy to come in here and lambast the Greens and the government for doing a deal, but today they are doing exactly the same thing.


It is disappointing that we were not given more of a heads-up so that we could at least have a closer look at this detail. I do not have anything to speak on because I have not had a chance to look at it—and nor have Senator Xenophon or Senator Madigan; they both had to drop off the speakers list because they have had no time to prepare for this. It is really quite pathetic, considering how important this legislation is. But let me say that Labor have done a lot of work on FoFA in the last three or four years. It is their law and the measures we are debating here today have been put into parliament by the Labor Party over a long period of time. They rightly should play an active role in this legislation and any changes go forward. I recognise that and I want to get that on the record. But it is disrespectful to the rest of us in the Senate that we have had no time to look at this. We have had no time to consider it. We have had no time to get legal advice on it. We have had no time to speak to stakeholders about it. In my opinion, this is a very direct attempt to cut us out of the debate. On that basis, the Greens do want to participate and we will ask some questions in the committee stage so that we can get some answers on this.


These laws are critically important. We have seen a number of scandals in financial advice in this country in recent years. A lot of things have come to the surface and there has been a lot of murky water. The legislation that we are dealing with today is absolutely crucial to restoring the 'advice' back into the financial advice industry and getting more Australians to seek financial advice. I think that is a good thing. The more Australians educated around the potential risks and opportunities in financial advice the better. We want to see a financial advice industry that transitions to being a lot more professional and accredited with higher standards. And I think that is what the industry wants. This legislation is critically important to restoring faith and confidence in the financial advice industry and helping the industry to prosper and boom.


I have worked with the FoFA committee stage. I have worked with a number of financial planners in my home state of Tasmania. This is something I have taken very seriously. I am really disappointed that we have had 40 minutes notice on what is before us today and we have not had a chance to consider it. The Senate is a house for reviewing legislation, but that is not going to be possible today because we have not had a heads-up.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:41):  I thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. I would also like to acknowledge and thank Dr Chalmers, Mr Bowen and Mr Ripoll for working with the government to help facilitate bipartisan support for the government amendments to this bill that will be moved shortly. This bill seeks to deal with a number of minor and uncontentious technical refinements to the FoFA regulatory regime, which is designed to ensure that we minimise the level of the compliance burden without reducing the important and necessary consumer protections in place in the context of the financial advice industry. I commend the bill to the Senate.

These are agreed refinements aimed at improving the operations of FoFA and alleviating a number of unintended consequences that have arisen since the FoFA laws were legislated. 


Senator Dastyari and Senator Whish-Wilson would well know that this piece of legislation, the broader FoFA regulatory arrangements, have a long history, particularly in the Senate. Both senators have been in much of that, along the way. As a result of the disallowance of a previous set of FoFA related regulations some further regulations were made, on a bipartisan basis, to deal with some of the necessary improvements, which have bipartisan support.


This bill now enshrines these things as appropriate into legislation. These amendments remove measures in the 2014 bill that do not have broader parliamentary support. These amendments include an extension of the time frame for advisers to send renewal opt-in notices to retail clients and fee-disclosure statements to pre-1 July 2013 clients from 30 to 60 days. The bill already extends the time frame for financial advisers to deliver fee-disclosure statements to their post-1 July 2013 clients. The amendments bring the time frames for providing these documents in line with each other. 


During consultation, a number of stakeholders supported the extension of the time frames for fee recipients to provide their statements. I noted that the 30-day time frame was not long enough to properly prepare and quality-assure these documents, particularly as information is usually needed to be sourced from third parties. The extension of the time frame will also be beneficial for consumers in ensuring they receive documentation that contains accurate information.


The amendments also amend the short title of the act—to the bill, at the moment, which hopefully will become the act, to the Corporations Amendment (Financial Advice) Measures Bill 2015. This change is reflective of the fact that the proposed amendments have substantially changed. They are, primarily, minor and technical in nature. The government is committed to ensuring that FoFA operates efficiently and effectively for all consumers and industry participants and, as I indicated in my summing-up speech, we particularly thank Dr Jim Chalmers for his assistance in progressing these bipartisan refinements to FoFA in an efficient manner. With these few words, I commend these amendments to the committee.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:49):  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. As you would be well aware, we have had hours of debate about all the ins and outs of the future of financial advice changes, which had their iteration right from the outset—from the previous government's efforts to implement recommendations from a bipartisan inquiry, locally referred to as the Ripoll inquiry, through the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services.


With reforms of this size and complexity, there are always unintended consequences. Various parliamentary committees have scrutinised this in some great detail. The amendments here in front of us are amendments that have broad consensus across, at least, the two major parties as being sensible technical improvements to the framework that is currently in place and will continue to be in place. As such, unless Senator Whish-Wilson has a specific question he wants me to address, I do not propose to go back through the whole comprehensive debate that we have been having for a number of years on these matters. In fact, that debate started all the way back in 2009. I am always happy to answer specific questions but that is really a question that invites me to go through the whole history, again.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:51):  You are absolutely right, Minister, I do remember the long and lengthy debates and conversations we had, in here, around this. The unintended consequences we talked about related to things I cannot see in this bill. In fact, they may relate to things around catch-all phrases and best-interest duties, which have been removed from this bill and which I am quite glad about. I was just wondering if there was anything more specific that you could point to, in relation to the unintended consequences, in your statement.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-11-24,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:51):  Unless you have a specific inquiry, there were many unintended consequences. I will give you one example. It relates to the way FoFA treats basic insurance products and non-cash payments. Essentially what we are proposing to do here is ensure that FoFA treats basic insurance products and non-cash payments consistently with other simple and well-understood financial products. There was an unintended consequence that the application of the previous FoFA regime went too far, and that is now widely accepted. 


It also clarifies the intrafund advice provision to ensure it operates as originally intended and not in the broader way, essentially to avoid unintended consequences here too. It makes clear that the client pays exemption; it also applies in circumstances where benefit is paid by another party, as long as the payment is made out of the client's funds and the benefit is given at the direction of the client and with the client's clear consent. 


So this is essentially a tidy-up bill, which I would have thought was pretty uncontentious.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:56):  Just before you move on, let me get on record that there very well may have been amendments that the Australian Greens would have put up to this, including the extension of 30 days to 60 days for opt-in. we did hear a lot of evidence during the inquiry that 30 days was sufficient time. Most financial planners and most financial advisers, have good databases; the information systems where their clients would well and truly have advance notice of the requirement for an opt-in and that still gives them a month to do follow-up work on those clients. So that is an example of something we very well might have put an amendment up for. But let me get on record here today that we have not had time to consider amendments. We have not had time to even consider the amendments in front of us and we are very disappointed that we have not had the opportunity to do our job in the Senate, which is to scrutinise this and actually see if we can improve the legislation.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  The Labor Party will be supporting the passage of the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014 through this place. I want to provide a bit of context and background as to how we have come to where we are on this.


In this bill we are looking at a series of well-negotiated, bipartisan suggestions and proposals on how implementation of the FoFA reforms of previous years can be improved in a practical, sensible and reasonable manner. I want to acknowledge the work that the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer, the Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer, has done in bringing these together in conjunction with Dr Jim Chalmers, the shadow minister from the Labor Party looking after financial services. Together they have been able to craft what is really a bipartisan series of proposals and changes that really clean up some of the more practical components of how this legislation is and has been implemented.


Mr President, as I am sure you no doubt recall, the provision of financial advice and the law surrounding that has been a very contentious issue over recent years. It has been before this chamber several times and, I am sure you recall, there was a very large debate regarding the disallowance of a series of regulations that were implemented by the last government. In the past year, we have had a series of different government ministers responsible for this area. In particular, when we were having that debate, it was Senator Sinodinos and then Senator Cormann. I note that since that time the Hon. Josh Frydenberg has also had that role, and now it is the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer.


The industry has been crying out for certainty and it has been crying out to make sure there is one fixed set of rules. Different people in this chamber at different times have had some very different views on what these laws should be, how these laws should be implemented and what the standard for the provision of financial advice should be—particularly the role that the FoFA reforms implemented by the Labor government performed. Following the end of that debate last year, I think there was an acknowledgement from the government—rightly so, I believe—that the biggest mistake we can make now is having a long debate that provides uncertainty to the industry about what the standard is and what the requirements are going to be. 


The government, at that point, turned around and said, 'As far as we're concerned, we had a different view than this parliament and certainly a different view than the Senate chamber.' They were looking to make some reforms that were not supported and were disallowed. That being said, there are still some minor reforms that can and should happen to provide practical certainty to the industry, also acknowledging that with any large piece of legislation like FoFA there are going to be implementation challenges.


I have to say the government has been true to its word. I know that, while ideologically there are certain members of the government that have come to the financial advice debate with different views, broadly they accepted that the debate had been settled and this legislation represents a consensus view that, while we may disagree on some of the bigger issues around financial advice, we can work together at a practical level to fix some of the minor challenges and make sure there is a level of certainty there for the industry.


I acknowledge the work that the PJC also has been doing in this space in relation to the provision of financial advice. The committee that I have been involved with, the Senate economics committees—both references and legislation—have also played a fairly sizeable role at different points in this debate.


There are still some challenges within the industry. I note that the PJC is looking at the education standards and has done some amazing work in setting them and working with industry to do that. I note that the Senate Economics References Committee is still going through a process, through the scrutiny of financial advice inquiry, where we are looking at whether or not there should be some kind of a scheme of last resort. They are good debates to have. There is a difference of views in this chamber, and that is all healthy; but what we do not want is to be going right back to the drawing board again for the provision of financial advice.


These are practical, simple, sensible changes to the existing legislation to provide certainty to the industry. That is why the Labor Party will be supporting the bill.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-11-24,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:36):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014. What a difference a day makes. In the Senate yesterday Senator Wong put on an academy-award-winning performance about the Greens doing a deal with the government over a water register and an agricultural land register. The Greens have played a very important role in this debate in this country in recent times. I was part of the Senate inquiry into the FoFA changes and played an active role in the allowance motions. But today we have been given 40 minutes notice to look at the detail of what is a very complex subject. We have been given 40 minutes notice to look at a number of changes to the bill. We have seen a number of measures in the bill removed. We have seen amendments to the bill—some minor but some very technical. We have seen a set of legislation that is a totally different from what we have been debating in this parliament in recent months. So Labor are happy to come in here and lambast the Greens and the government for doing a deal, but today they are doing exactly the same thing.


It is disappointing that we were not given more of a heads-up so that we could at least have a closer look at this detail. I do not have anything to speak on because I have not had a chance to look at it—and nor have Senator Xenophon or Senator Madigan; they both had to drop off the speakers list because they have had no time to prepare for this. It is really quite pathetic, considering how important this legislation is. But let me say that Labor have done a lot of work on FoFA in the last three or four years. It is their law and the measures we are debating here today have been put into parliament by the Labor Party over a long period of time. They rightly should play an active role in this legislation and any changes go forward. I recognise that and I want to get that on the record. But it is disrespectful to the rest of us in the Senate that we have had no time to look at this. We have had no time to consider it. We have had no time to get legal advice on it. We have had no time to speak to stakeholders about it. In my opinion, this is a very direct attempt to cut us out of the debate. On that basis, the Greens do want to participate and we will ask some questions in the committee stage so that we can get some answers on this.


These laws are critically important. We have seen a number of scandals in financial advice in this country in recent years. A lot of things have come to the surface and there has been a lot of murky water. The legislation that we are dealing with today is absolutely crucial to restoring the 'advice' back into the financial advice industry and getting more Australians to seek financial advice. I think that is a good thing. The more Australians educated around the potential risks and opportunities in financial advice the better. We want to see a financial advice industry that transitions to being a lot more professional and accredited with higher standards. And I think that is what the industry wants. This legislation is critically important to restoring faith and confidence in the financial advice industry and helping the industry to prosper and boom.


I have worked with the FoFA committee stage. I have worked with a number of financial planners in my home state of Tasmania. This is something I have taken very seriously. I am really disappointed that we have had 40 minutes notice on what is before us today and we have not had a chance to consider it. The Senate is a house for reviewing legislation, but that is not going to be possible today because we have not had a heads-up.

I would also like to acknowledge and thank Dr Chalmers, Mr Bowen and Mr Ripoll for working with the government to help facilitate bipartisan support for the government amendments to this bill that will be moved shortly. This bill seeks to deal with a number of minor and uncontentious technical refinements to the FoFA regulatory regime, which is designed to ensure that we minimise the level of the compliance burden without reducing the important and necessary consumer protections in place in the context of the financial advice industry.

Mr Furnival was a member of the delegation to China in his capacity as a director of the global economic group Castalia Advisors, with a particular interest in health care.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:




That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Tourism and International Education (Senator Colbeck) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senator Gallagher today relating to the Goods and Services Tax.



I just want to go through a little bit of a history here if I can. We must go back to the 1996 election, when the then Leader of the Liberals, Mr Howard, said that he would 'never, ever' introduce a GST.




Senator Sinodinos:
  And he took it to an election.




Senator STERLE:
  And—through you, Mr Deputy President—in 1998 he did, Senator Sinodinos. He took it to an election. So what I want to ask is: how long is 'never, ever' going to last for? In this case it was two years. So you see there is a trend, Mr Deputy President, because on this side they cannot wait to denounce any talk of a GST, although it is probably the most discussed issue in the papers since the change of leadership from Mr Abbott to Mr Turnbull and is ably backed up by the Liberal states.


While we are talking about the Liberal states, I just want to touch on the state of Western Australia, because one of the biggest—and rightfully one of the biggest—whingers about the GST is the Western Australian Premier, Premier Barnett. We could cut through the crocodile tears, because as a Western Australian I reckon West Aussies get ripped off. Do not worry about that. I reckon we are the engine room of the economy, and we have carried along a number of other states for a number of years. I know that I may get some opposition from my colleagues.



Senator Bullock interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Senator Bullock. I have one on my side. But one must never forget that Mr Barnett, in his previous life when the GST was introduced, was actually the energy and resources minister and education minister in Western Australia. He is up to his neck in the way it was set up. So it is really disingenuous for him to stand up and start whinging about a process that he was very keen to support, vote for and help get through in the Howard government.


But I want to talk about the distinct possibility of a GST increase—not just in schoolbooks, uniforms and that sort of stuff. I want to talk about something very close to me, the possible impost of a GST increase on Australia's trucking industry. I want to talk about my own experiences, which no-one in this chamber could deny. In fact, no-one could even raise their voice and try to argue against the knowledge and experience I have in long-distance haulage in Australia, particularly pulling road trains between Perth and Darwin, because that was my life.


I did some quick calculations. If there were a GST increase from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, what would it mean to Western Australia's truckies? I took what I used to do, and I took a triple road train operator running from Perth to Kununurra. This is a weekly occurrence, and there are a number of our long-distance subbies and truck drivers who every week run from Perth to Broome, Derby, Fitzroy, Halls Creek or Kununurra or even service the Pilbara, doing two trips a week. But, at the end of the week, you can bet your bottom dollar they will cover around the same number of kilometres if they are a two-up operation and they will cover the same number of kilometres per annum if they are a single operation.


If we put a five-percentage-point increase on GST just on their fuel alone, what would it mean to Australia's truckies and to those communities that our long-distance truckies are servicing through the Pilbara and the Kimberley? A typical Kimberley runner—and this could, as I said, go for a Pilbara runner as well—would do about 400,000 kilometres per year on a two-up operation. I did two sums, but I will use the lesser one. I used about $1.30 a litre, because FuelWatch at the moment says diesel is about $1.40 in the Kimberley, and I took off the diesel excise rebate. The sums are quite scary. For an average truckie, a two-up operation, the driver's fuel bill would be $520,000 if fuel were to stay at the current rate. Of that, a five per cent GST on our truckie's fuel bill would be no less than $26,000 a year. I am not making this up. So what I am probably suggesting—



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  before some peanut from the other side who does not know one end of a truck from the other says something; I am not suggesting you at all, but you had your mouth open—is that it will get down to this stage for Western Australia and Australia's truckies. You will get the truck. The best thing you can do is to get the number of your house in big, bold, brass letters, put it on your passenger door and cut a slot in the passenger door. Make it about the same size as your average mail envelope. Park it out the front. Turn it into the best, biggest, brightest letterbox in the street because—I have to tell you—it will be a lot cheaper than running it up and down the road if this mob are ever allowed to increase the GST, let alone the impact on shoppers and the communities in our far north. They will be absolutely screwed. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-11-24,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (15:08):  I too rise to take note of answers and to address some of the remarks by fearmongering Senator Sterle. I thought the WA preselection had been done, but clearly it has not. Again he is peddling the 'fact' that this government somehow is asserting that it is going to increase the GST by five per cent. He states that it has discussed the issues in the paper, asserting that it is a big conspiracy of the Liberal states—the Liberal-Nationals states, I might say. The sad fact of it, Senator Sterle—through you, Mr Deputy President—is that it just is not the Liberal states. In my own home state of Victoria, Premier Andrews knows and admitted last week that he has taken his opposition—the 'never, never' opposition—to the GST off the table because he is faced with the reality of running a very, very complex state where the interplay between our taxation system, the GST payment and indeed the cost of running state schools, hospitals, infrastructure et cetera at a state level is incredibly burdensome. He recognises that it is holding us back, and that is exactly what is occurring.


The ALP wanted this year to be the idea of big ideas. I wonder how that is going for you. On this side of the Senate we are not afraid of ideas. In fact, we welcome open debate and discussion around a variety of ideas about how to make our nation the very, very best it can be and how we can ensure that Australia is very well positioned to take advantage of all the opportunities that the 21st century can and will provide us if we rid ourselves of the burden of a complex and outdated taxation system interwoven with the complexities of our federation.


Our government is the best friend that the worker of Australia has ever had. That is because we on this side of the Senate want to grow our economy, to increase job security, to increase job growth. We are backing our potential; we are backing our latent capacity and our creativity, and we are doing it through a variety of means. We have signed off three trade agreements in recent times which mean thousands of jobs for Australians—thousands of jobs, particularly in regional Australia. We are rolling out a $50 billion national infrastructure plan. We are getting spending under control. And what I think is so exciting is that we are putting innovation at the centre of our economic plan. Science is recognised and encouraged and supported to be all it can be and should be to drive our economy and our nation forward into the 21st century. That is exciting stuff. We have some of the best scientists in the world around our country, and our government is the one that is prepared to back their innovation, back their creativity, put money on the table and support them to give us the technology that we need to go forward.


We do know that we have a bit of a productivity problem going on in this country. It has been masked by fantastic commodity prices over the last 10 years, but the sad fact is that we know it and you know it. We have a productivity problem. If we do not get that under control, we are all going to pay the price. In agriculture, for instance, the only way we are going to get any increase in productivity—it is well recognised—is through transformative technology. That means that we have to back our scientists. We have to back technological rollout and infrastructure in the regions so that our farmers can be as productive as they can. It is our government that by putting science at the heart, by doing a research review so that we can restructure and re-examine the way we fund research going forward in this country, will be backing our intellectual capital and our productive and economic future.


The reality is—and you do not like to admit it—that confidence is up. It is up because, unlike you, we are taking a holistic look at tax reform. Poor Ken Henry, constrained with caveat after caveat on what he could look at and what he could not look at! We understand that the relationship between our federation and tax reform in this country is complex. It is only common sense to look at it holistically, and that is exactly what we are going to do, unlike poor Ken Henry. He made 138 recommendations. Those that were implemented were bungled. It is a very, very sad fact. That is why in March last year he called for tax reform as an imperative, and that is exactly what we are doing.


I wish the Labor Party would back our attempts to do this and not be afraid of ideas. If Bill Shorten wants to put them on the table—and this is supposed to be your year of big ideas—let us have the conversation. We are not afraid of ideas. We are not afraid of putting them on the table. We are not afraid of discussion and debate, because that is what we are good at, and that is what we all should be doing in our national interest.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:13):  I rise to take note of answers given in question time today, in particular the answers to the questions that I asked Minister Cormann about the impact of the GST on the price of housing. The questions originate from the housing affordability crisis that is underway across our country. In the last two days, two different reports have been released. One, by Moody's, clearly shows that households, particularly in major capital cities, are having to spend more and more of their weekly income on mortgage repayments. The other, by National Shelter, shows the pressure that is on rental accommodation for people. It shows that more people are renting than ever before and that more of those people are experiencing housing stress.


The questions that I put to the minister were not about any particular proposal that they have but about whether the comments from the Housing Industry Association about how a GST would impact on the price of housing were correct. The minister did not answer any of the questions I asked, instead obfuscating around the debate that the Liberal Party has started—let's not pretend anything else—on this campaign around the GST and softening people up for a GST increase, which was started by the Prime Minister last month, in late October, when he agreed that a GST increase is on the table and is being considered by government. That is well-documented fact. Since then we have had other Liberals enter into the fray. We had the previous Prime Minister expressing his views, and we have also had contributions from Senator Bernardi and from others like Angus Taylor and Senator Canavan, who have all entered the debate with their own views about whether or not the GST should be increased and whether or not that is a good idea and how that should all be used. We have had people deciding that the GST could be used for funding the health and education cuts that have been imposed—the $80 billion that is still on the table for states and territories' health and education budgets.


So it is no surprise we have premiers worried about where the money is going to come from when they are facing running hospitals and schools without the level of Commonwealth funding that they were expecting, to the total of $80 billion over 10 years. We have other contributors from the Liberal Party saying that the GST will help deal with debt. We have others saying that it will pay compensation for those who cannot afford the GST. We have others saying that there cannot be any greater tax burden from this proposal. So let us not pretend there is no proposal being talked about by the government. You have a lot of people talking about the GST—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator GALLAGHER:
  Not in any detail, I agree, and sometimes at cross-purposes. So it is no wonder that the Labor Party is trying to get some understanding of exactly what the government is considering, and is asking sensible questions about how that will impact on everyday households. We can see in the area of housing, an area I am responsible for, that major industry groups are coming and adding their comments, ahead of firm commitments from the government, about their concerns about what a GST would do should it be added to the price of housing, and it is very clear. My question was: is the quote correct that it will it increase the price of housing by about $60,000? The data is very clear that it absolutely would. Depending on what capital city you live in, there would be significant costs from raising the GST from 10 to 15 per cent.


At a time when people are already struggling to meet the needs of their mortgages and more people are renting and more of those renting are in housing stress and more of those are in severe housing stress and pressure is on homelessness services that have had their funding cut by this government, that is not a very coherent policy position for the government to be in. We do not have a housing minister. We do not have a housing policy. As far as I can find, in the last couple of years none of the senior members of the Liberal Party has expressed a view on housing. We have an affordability crisis that seems to be growing and absolutely no interest from the government, other than a willingness to look at increasing the GST on the price of housing. I will argue that those things do not add up. If you want to address housing affordability you cannot look to the GST as being the solution to that problem. It will escalate the challenges already being faced by everyday Australians, and it should not be part of any consideration by this government. (Time expired)

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-11-24,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:18):  I find it highly ironic that Senator Gallagher is talking about housing affordability, given her record and the record of the government that she was part of in squeezing tens of thousands of Canberra families out of the housing market. It was achieved through deliberate policies, which colleagues like Bob Day have commented on in terms of other states. The ACT was at the forefront of these deliberate policies. They own a lot of land and they deliberately push the price of land up to keep their profits up as a government, forcing families to take on more and more debt just to get into the housing market. Then they put a massive tax on units for those who rent or for those who want to purchase a unit. It is no wonder that Senator Gallagher would not want to stay and defend her record on this, because the government she was part of and then led was just outrageous when it came to forcing Canberra families out of the housing market.


What I want to do now is talk about the debate we are having about the GST or about tax more broadly, I think it is fair to say—




Senator Conroy:
  You don't want to talk about the GST.




Senator SESELJA:
  I am happy to talk about the GST—




Senator Conroy:
  Good, then do so.




Senator SESELJA:
  I am very happy to talk about it, but I will not talk about it in the same context as Labor state premiers seem to want to talk about it, which is, 'Raise the GST and give us more of it. Give as more money.' That is what certainly Andrew Barr in the ACT would like. That is what Jay Weatherill would like. It is, 'Yes, please. Go ahead and raise the GST, but give us the money.' I do not think that is the kind of conversation we should be having when it comes to tax reform. When it comes to tax reform we should not be taking the Labor premiers' or Labor chief ministers' way of doing things. What we should be on about, and what this government needs to be on about, is lowering the overall tax burden on Australians. That is the starting point for any conversation about tax reform. It is about lowering the tax burden. It is not about jacking up taxes so we can give more money to state governments, who often spend it in highly inefficient ways, whilst increasing the burden on Australian taxpayers. But let's not be afraid of the conversation, as the Labor Party appears to be. What state Labor premiers are saying as part of the conversation is effectively that we should just jack up taxes and give them more money. Even if I reject that, at least they are engaging in the conversation. At least they are engaging in a conversation about how we best make sure we lower the tax burden—well, they are not in that part of that conversation, but some state premiers are part of a conversation about the future of taxation in Australia.


I disagree with this prescription of higher and higher taxes for more and more spending. That is not the way to prosperity. The way to prosperity is actually to give Australians more of their own money. The GST of course—




Senator Conroy:
  The 'taxation is theft' plan.




Senator SESELJA:
  No, but there are levels of taxation that are far too high.




Senator Conroy:
  You need to give rich people more money because they use it smarter! Give more rich people more money because they use it better!




Senator SESELJA:
  If Senator Conroy believes there is no level of taxation that is too high for him, that is an opinion he is free to express, but it is an opinion I absolutely reject. Certainly I believe, and the coalition believes, that we should always be looking to keep taxes as low as possible to allow governments to do the things that they need to do and to allow citizens to have more of their money to spend on their priorities. 




Senator Conroy:
  To give rich people more money.




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Conroy's position is that if you give a tax cut to someone on $80,000, $100,000 or $150,000 a year then you are giving money to rich people. I reject that. We should be giving those people tax cuts—even if the Labor Party does not want to. We should be giving them tax cuts and we should be giving them more of their own money. Why don't you trust the Australian people to spend their money? Why don't you trust the Australian people? Why do you think you are better at spending their money than they are? This is the fundamental difference: we believe in the freedom of Australians to have as much of their own money as possible so that they can make the best decisions for their families. That should be the framework for any discussion about tax reform, rather than gouging more money out of Australians like Labor premiers and— (Time expired)

"Bullock, Sen Joseph",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator BULLOCK
 (Western Australia) (15:23):  It is most disappointing that the GST is once again the subject of debate in this parliament, given the solemn undertakings offered to the Australian people by a previous coalition government that a GST, once introduced, would never, ever be increased. The fact that an increase in the GST is broadly being canvassed suggests that this government is running out of its own promises to break and now has to resort to breaking the promises of previous coalition governments. 


For my part, I have always taken a consistent position with respect to the GST. I campaigned against it when it was proposed by John Hewson, when it was proposed by Paul Keating and again when it was proposed by John Howard. I campaigned against the GST on behalf of shop assistants because the GST is a regressive tax measure. It has no regard for capacity to pay. It impacts more severely on those who can least afford it. A poor person or family spends all of their income of necessity. A tax applicable to expenditure, if applied without exemptions, is a tax on all of the income of the poor. In fact, for some working people who are forced for a time to spend more than they earn, a GST is a tax on more than their income. The wealthy, by contrast, have the opportunity to save and invest. While this is a commendable practice, that proportion of their income is unaffected by a GST. As a result, poorer people suffer a proportionately higher level of taxation than wealthy people from the imposition of a GST. This unjust shift in the burden of taxation, away from those with the capacity to pay and onto the shoulders of those who can least afford it, is a measure of which we should be ashamed. 


When the GST was first introduced, some of its regressive impact was somewhat ameliorated by the inclusion of exemptions. There are exemptions for fresh food, for health and education expenses. These exemptions make perfect sense. Everyone, even the poor, needs to eat. The poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food than the wealthy, and this exemption directly addresses the GST's regressive nature. Similarly, there is no community benefit in taxing people out of receiving necessary medical treatment. And, in any event, since a large proportion of health expenditure is funded by the taxpayer, the imposition of the GST would largely push up the government's costs.


Education is a less obvious but also important exemption. Many parents struggle to give their children a private school education. Every child educated at a private school saves the government some of the costs associated with public education. Applying the GST to school fees would raise some additional revenue but would force a considerable number of parents to withdraw their children from private schooling and send them to government schools. Given that the additional cost of publicly educating a child is far greater than the 10 per cent of the cost of private schooling, the perverse effect of applying the GST to education costs is that the revenue so raised could be less than the additional government expenditure incurred. 


Without these exemptions the truth as to the regressive nature of the GST would be laid bare and undeniable. Yet the advocates of so-called GST reform set the removal of exemptions higher on their list of objectives. Indeed, much of the additional revenue proposed to be raised derives from the removal of exemptions. But what really gets the advocates of change to the GST excited is increasing the rate by 50 per cent to 15 per cent. There is simply no excuse for imposing this great big new tax on everything on the people in the small businesses of Australia, particularly given its regressive impact on the less well-off. 


At this time, when real wages are in decline and nominal wage growth is at its lowest level in decades, how can families afford a five per cent increase in the price of everything and a 15 per cent increase in the cost of fresh food, health and education? How can this huge tax impost be justified? This is not tax reform; it is simply a huge tax grab, the burden of which will fall disproportionately on the less well-off.


What happens to the extra revenue raised? The GST was designed to provide a guaranteed income stream to the states. Don't start me on Western Australia's share. Now, however, the sales people who would increase it would have us believe in a magic pudding to fix all of our problems. We can use the GST to give the states money for health and education. We can eliminate the deficit, pay back the debt, compensate the poor, cut income tax and cut company tax. This is, of course, nonsense. Money can be spent only once, and I would not hold my breath if I were a state premier. The extra revenue is likely to be swallowed by the Commonwealth with the possibility of some token income and company tax cuts. The effect will be higher GST for workers and lower tax for voters in Wentworth. Malcolm Turnbull's so-called tax reform is nothing more than a reverse Robin Hood: robbing from the poor to give to the rich.

Online gambling, in particular online sports betting, has grown exponentially over the past 10 years in Australia and with it an exponential increase in the harms associated with problem gambling.


This issue was examined by the former Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform who made a number of recommendations in the course of its inquiry which were ignored by the then-government.


The Coalition's policy statement includes tougher restrictions on gambling advertising and improved self-exclusion systems, but even those limited recommendations appear not to have been followed through.


The terms of reference of the review announced by the former Minister for Social Services, the Hon Scott Morrison MP into online gambling are welcome but the terms are quite limited, with a particular focus on illegal offshore online gambling. The terms of the review appear to fail to acknowledge the enormous harm that can arise from authorised operations. I have seen through my office many cases of harm caused by legal online gambling as well as illegal online sites.


The Interactive Gambling Act 2001, whilst only 14 years old may as well be 140 years old in that it has been outdated and outpaced by the explosion in online gambling and aggressive practices of online gambling entities to lure customers.


The Australian community is already seeing the effects of a lax regulatory environment for authorised gambling sites and the absence of a political will to tackle the illegal sites by disrupting financial transactions.


In August 2015, Financial Counselling Australia released its landmark report: 'Duds, Mugs and the A-List: the impact of uncontrolled sports betting'. This report described the devastating consequences of gambling addictions on individuals and families. The report argued that a number of industry practices contributed to a person's gambling getting out of control. The ability to gamble using credit was identified as one of the biggest contributors to unsafe gambling habits. This Bill tackles this issue by prohibiting websites who offer sports betting from providing credit to individuals for the purpose of gambling. It is a simple yet powerful harm minimisation measure.


There is currently an absence of sensible measures to ensure online sports betting is conducted in a responsible manner. This Bill seeks to fill these gaps in a way that offers protection for those who have difficulty controlling their gambling but will have minimal impact on so-called recreational gamblers.


The measures introduced by this Bill aim to minimise the harm caused by uncontrolled sports betting, and to give problem gamblers more effective tools to manage their gambling.


As the case studies in Financial Counselling Australia's report demonstrate, the time for reform of the online sports betting industry is past due. Amendments to the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 are essential in order to put an end to dangerous and predatory industry practices and to make an all too often unsafe product much safer for consumers.


If we fail to act now we will see an increase in the number of Australians, particularly young men, who will lose enormous amounts of money and cause irreparable harm.


The time to act is now. The Parliament of Australia must ignore the vested interests of the online gambling industry and unambiguously side with the public interest.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator MUIR:
  This motion has attracted some interest from the highly respected publication that is The Courier-Mail, but, more importantly, it did attract some interest from the government. Using national security was a way of attracting attention to this problem. This was the same tactic used by the government at the time I wrote this motion. Although there may be tenuous links with stolen vehicles leaving Australia and ending up in Syria, the real problem is this: approximately 20 passenger and light commercial vehicles are stolen and exported from Australia each week. Putting terrorism aside, I would just like to ask one question: do you think it is okay for a motor vehicle to be exported from this country without any checks at the border to ensure it is not stolen? I do not. If someone wants to personally import a vehicle, a lot of rules, red tape and costs are involved. If someone wants to steal our pride and joy, there are no checks to prevent it from being exported. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Attorney-General, his staff and the department for listening to my concerns and taking steps to address them. I will continue to talk to the government about this issue, but probably not The Courier-Mail.(Time expired)

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:01):  This is an important debate, and I note that my good friend Senator Edwards will be following me in this debate. I want to begin by talking a bit about the bipartisan nature of a lot of the work that has been done. I note, Senator Edwards, that your party has afforded you 10 minutes in this debate and I have only been afforded five minutes, which clearly makes you twice as popular as I am!


This is a debate that the nation needs to have and is having. I want to start by touching on the work that has been done, in a very bipartisan fashion, through the Senate Economics References Committee, which is chaired by me and the deputy chair of which is Senator Edwards. What we have seen is company after company, sector across sector using what I call some very sharp practices and practices around the edges of what is and is not appropriate in many cases to be able to minimise their tax arrangements and minimise the tax they pay in this country. We have seen it in the tech sector. We have seen it in the mining sector. We have seen it in the LNG sector. We have seen it in the pharmaceutical sector. And we have seen these same practices and types of practices, be it transfer pricing, be it debt loading or be it hybrid structures—simply arrangements that are built for the sole intention of minimising tax liability.


Where we disagree is on how far and how we should address it. I want to say—and, again, I am very conscious of time—that the bill that was introduced by Joe Hockey as one of his last acts as Treasurer of this country is a good bill. It is a bill worthy of being supported but it is not enough. There are more measures. There are more steps. There are ways of improving that legislation, and simply arguing that you can make a bill better does not mean you do not believe there is not something good in that bill to begin with. I want to acknowledge the work of the former Treasurer and I want to acknowledge the work of Senator Edwards in this space. But there are some disagreements here and that is a healthy part of this debate. Where we disagree is on how far we should go and what needs to be done especially around the issue of transparency.


What we saw overnight was an extraordinary list of 1,498 companies that Lenore Taylor from The Guardian put up on their website which demonstrates who the companies are who have been given a special exemption to allow them not to have to put in ASIC forms and for whom there is no publicly available information. These are the companies whose affairs we have been unaware of and, as a result, the types of companies who if better tax transparency measures were put into place the Australian public would have some information on.


This is a worthy debate for this chamber to have. It is important for us. As we have gone through this debate over the past year—and I think it has been a big and constructive debate this chamber has had—I have remained of the view that shining a light in these corners, greater transparency and more information will not only better inform the Australian public but will actually drive policy change in this area, That is a positive development. That is a development that I support.


In coming days, we are going to have this debate once again. I do not want to pre-empt legislation that is listed on the Notice Paper, but perhaps in coming days we will have a debate more specifically around the Hockey legislation and what we should and should not do with amendments.


I urge the crossbenchers who supported improving the bill last time to maintain the rage, if you will, and to maintain the support of improving this bill. Make sure that we are putting in as many and as strong transparency measures as possible and do what we can do to make what is a positive and good bill better, because that is the objective of this chamber and that is the role of this Senate. It is to take legislation that has been passed to us by the House and see how we can improve it, and one of the great ways of improving it is through transparency. One of the great ways of improving it is making sure that that Australian public has the information they so want and deserve.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2015-11-24,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (16:06):  I concur with Senator Dastyari's comments about the fact that this committee has been doing work on multijurisdictional tax minimisation avoidance—call it what you like—and transparency. I do reject the contention that we are at the forefront because in his acknowledgement he was quite right to mention former Treasurer Hockey and now Mr Morrison's great work in being at the forefront of the G20. So in fact this committee's work has been valuable in the fact that it has been giving the tax commissioner an opportunity to respond to the concerns of the community has. 


The coalition is forcing multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax in the jurisdiction in which they earn their profits. This is not a revelation coming from the benches opposite. That is a simple and important principle encapsulated it in these reforms. This is what we are going to be at debating in the next days. We are implementing on this side the G20-OECD base erosion and profit shifting recommendations on a country by country reporting and harmful tax practices to address multinational tax avoidance and the common reporting standard for automatic exchange of financial account information to address the taxpayer offshore tax evasion. We are stopping the practice of profit shifting, which may have been lawful but was clearly not consistent with the spirit of the law or the public's expectations. Meanwhile, Labor on the other side is seeking to force private companies to publicly reveal their private commercial information with no public benefit—no public benefit! 


The ATO has already all of this detail and revealing it publicly achieves nothing in the public interest. It does not provide increased powers to the ATO, it does not increase the amount of tax the ATO raises from those companies, it does not reduce tax minimisation, but it does violate individual privacy and does force companies to reveal their competitors to their suppliers and to reveal to their subcontractors their private financial information, and all for no gain whatsoever to the taxpayer. 


Labor and Senator Xenophon plan to block the government's changes and the reforms, which will collect extra taxes which will go a long way to reducing any tax dodging, unless the government accepts the privacy violating amendments, which is certainly not what I think is good policy. They plan to block a government bill that will force multinational corporations to pay their fair share of tax in this country in accordance with the profits they make in this country. Labor and Senator Xenophon have already flagged that they plan to block a government bill that will stop multinational corporations from shifting their earnings overseas into lower tax jurisdictions, rather than paying their tax here. Labor and Senator Xenophon cannot conscionably hold up this legislation for a day longer than it needs to be. I will go some way to explain why they are doing this.


Three weeks ago, these important privacy measures passed the Senate when Labor senators failed to turn up for a vote and when Senator Xenophon did not make it to the chamber for his turn to speak because I understand he was conducting media activity instead and time got away from him. The division was called and the division passed. There was much fury and embarrassment among the aforementioned senators but the bill had passed and that was that— that was that! That was until a red herring came along in the form of a newspaper story about Family Office Institute, an organisation formed to represent the interests of private companies targeted by Labor. The FOI made a submission to the inquiry into the matter by the Senate Economics Committee. The journalist called my office to test a series of accusations about that organisation, about its corporate history, about representations to the inquiry and about its legitimacy. Not one of those accusations withstood basic scrutiny and so not one of those accusations made it into the story—go figure! It is simply attacked the organisation through using the word 'institute' in its name without having members behind it. The story asserted that an institute, because it is an institute, needs to have a substantial membership base, although that is not a definition in which the Oxford Dictionary concurs. There were nine assertions made by the FO I in the inquiry and published in its report. Eight of them were directly supported by submissions by the Law Council of Australia, the Tax Institute of Australia, PWC or by EY. The ninth cited publicly available data. In other words, Labor and Senator Xenophon used the testimony of the Family Office Institute to discredit a report they signed off on and a bill they passed in this chamber three weeks ago, without taking issue with any statement, assertion or word that organisation wrote.


It is a ruse and it is more of the political grandstanding we have come to expect from the other side of the chamber and from parts of the crossbench. Senator Dastyari—I wish he were still here to enjoy this—and I have co-chaired the Economics Committee's corporate tax inquiry and while the purpose of that inquiry has been to uncover certain dealings that might be hidden from public view in order to improve tax law, it turns out that tax minimisation arrangements are not the only deals being done behind closed doors.


Labor has long been running a union protection racket throughout the course of the inquiry. The Labor-crossbench-controlled inquiry actually started when tax exempt trade unions joined forces with the tax exempt 'Tax Justice Network' activist-group to produce a report on corporate tax which, shall we say, was less analysis and more activism.


The ATO pointed out that it was 'patently false' and 'misleading' and that it made fundamental errors, such as analysing company accounting profit rather than taxable income, a fairly fundamental mistake, thereby massively inflating the impression of tax avoidance by entirely disallowing the notion of legitimate tax deductions. It alleged multinational companies had not paid tax where they had in fact already paid tax in other countries and where paying it again in Australia would have been to pay it twice. It singled out 21st Century Fox, for example, the bulk of whose business is done in the US. The report's authors failed to realise that trusts are not taxed until they distribute their income, at which point they certainly are taxed. This is an egregious error. They all are.


Grant Wardell-Jones, a senior tax partner at KPMG, said: 


These statistical assertions are clearly misleading and are a misuse of information.


But the facts are not integral when you are running a tax-exempt trade union agenda. Just last week, Chevron bosses were facing questions before the same inquiry about their tax compliance. Those questions arose from a newspaper report which mirrored statements made in a report by the tax-exempt International Transport Workers' Federation, a body funded by the tax-exempt Maritime Union of Australia. The Australian's Leo Shanahan reported that:


In recent years, the MUA has been attempting to gain control of the supply chain to the Gorgon project, being built on Barrow Island off WA's northwest coast, while pushing for higher wages and the removal of foreign workers. It has staged protests and stormed the offices of Chevron in Perth along with militant union partner the CFMEU.


Surprise, surprise! He goes on to report Chevron CEO, Mr Roy Krzywosinski, as saying the reports painted 'a completely inaccurate picture' of Chevron's tax arrangements, and pointing out that the Gorgon project has yet to create one cent in revenue. Chevron might, I add, be responsible for the biggest single commercial investment in Australian history, and their Gorgon project has yet to make a cent.


The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, the shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, and former Treasurer Mr Swan all understand the importance of taxpayer confidentiality—each is on the record defending it. But I guess that Labor's actual leadership team—the ACTU, the AEU, the NTEU and the Victorian Trades Hall Council—has spoken.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:16):  I am not quite sure how this got turned into an anti-union rant by the government, but then again I should not be surprised, because that is going to be one of the key threads in any debate in this chamber. Let's get back to the idea of tax avoidance.



Senator Edwards interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Can you protect me, please, Madam Acting Deputy President?



Senator Edwards interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator Edwards! Order!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  The only thing about Senator Edwards I am impressed with is his moustache. It is for a good cause, I must say. But let's get back to the very important issue of multinational tax avoidance—in fact, to tax avoidance in general in this country.


What Senator Edwards has failed to understand—and I genuinely believe this is an enormous oversight on behalf of the Liberals in this country—is that this is a significant matter of public interest. It has enormous public benefit. The objectives of having transparency in tax are twofold. The most important, and I will go directly to the Bradbury act, which is what introduced these laws in the first place. The first objective of these amendments is to discourage large corporate tax entities from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance practices. The second objective of these amendments is to provide more information to inform public debate about tax policy, particularly in relation to the corporate tax system.


I would like to read a quote from the previous Treasurer, Joe Hockey, who put out a media release on budget night—12 May 2015. In talking about a voluntary code of tax disclosure—not a mandatory code, like the Greens would like to see, but a voluntary code—he said:


The voluntary code will highlight companies that are paying their fair share of tax. It will also discourage companies from engaging in aggressive tax avoidance.


It is very similar to Labor and Bradbury, so far.


The Board of Taxation will provide a business and broader community perspective for the development of a voluntary corporate disclosure code.


But this is the good bit, Senator Edwards:


The government would like more companies, particularly large multinationals operating in Australia, to publicly disclose their tax affairs. In developing the code they will need to consider what information is disclosed and how it is disclosed.


The Liberal Party and the previous Treasurer believed in tax disclosure. The difference was that they wanted a voluntary scheme. Will you tell me which of the 1,400 companies that Senator Dastyari was talking about are actually out there wanting to voluntarily disclose their tax arrangements to the Australian public? How many of them are voluntary tax disclosers? None. That is why we need a mandatory code in this country for tax disclosure. This is a significant matter of public interest.


Most Australians pay their tax, and they expect large corporations to pay their tax. They do not expect to have a government that is essentially prepared to slug them in the hip pocket—where it hurts the most—with cuts to pensions, cuts to a whole range of different things that we have talked about in this chamber in the last two years. Now they are proposing to increase the GST, which will slug the most disadvantaged Australians in the hip pocket, but they will not take on the issue of multinational tax avoidance.


This is a serious test for the Prime Minister. He wants to put up some legislation in the Senate very shortly that will show he is taking action on tax avoidance. But at the end of the day that legislation, while it has some merits, does not go anywhere near far enough. We have a good amendment that was put up in this chamber by Labor, the Greens and the crossbenchers that asked for a simple system of tax avoidance; a simple system that will not cost anything to administer. That is your only criticism I had heard from the government until Senator Edwards got up here and said the government clearly does not believe in multinational tax disclosure. They want to slug you in the hip pocket, but they do not want to take on the big end of town.


They can throw as much spin into this as they like about kidnap bills, but they are happy to put up their rich mates' amendment bill in this place. It is for their mates, the big end of town, who probably donate to the Liberal Party—a small number of Australians who do not want to disclose their tax. And you have to ask why. Why don't they want to have their tax disclosed? It has nothing to do with kidnapping. It has to do with the fact that they do not want to be part of a public register that can provide incentives and disincentives to avoid tax avoidance.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:22):  Australians can smell a rat a mile away and they have well and truly smelt a rat in relation to multinational tax avoidance. Wage earners in Australians cannot avoid their tax; most do not want to as most Australians recognise that tax revenue contributes to hospitals, schools, roads, public transport and so on—the general wellbeing of our community. Why is it that our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and his government want to shield multinationals, want to shield private companies when it comes to transparency on tax? This is something the Australian public has called for. Why is it that they want to continue to protect the big end of town? 


I do not believe there is any justification for private companies with over $100,000 million in revenue in any given year being shielded by the Turnbull government. Why should these companies not be held to account through proper scrutiny and transparency? How dodgy is this secret list? Surely, one of the companies on the now public list presents a conflict of interest for the whole of the Turnbull government. Turnbull and Partners is one of the companies on the secret list, and the sole directors are listed as Lucy and Malcolm Turnbull. Then, once the list becomes public, and only then, suddenly the PM says he has requested to come off the list. Good on people like Mr Turnbull making money, but it well and truly smacks of self-interest and a very, very big conflict of interest that Mr Turnbull and his government are hell-bent on protecting the Prime Minister and his partner Lucy Turnbull and others on the list.




Senator Fifield:
  Acting Deputy President Reynolds, on a point of order, I think Senator Lines was coming precariously close to reflecting on a member from the other place talking about conflicts of interest. It might have got close to crossing the line.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Minister, I concur. Would you like to rephrase your last comment, Senator Lines.




Senator Moore:
  Acting Deputy President, on that point of order. We have seen that that is part of the standard debate. It actually came close to a conflict of interest; it was not actually making direct reflection. I make the point that the senator needs to be careful in her statements, but I do not think that she has actually crossed the line at this stage.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator LINES:
  Today we see that, perhaps, there is another reason why the Turnbull government is so intent on protecting those on that list: many of them are big donors to the Liberal Party. We have Dick Honan, whose Manildra company has contributed to the Liberal and the National parties. We have Michael Crouch's Zip companies, who have contributed to the Liberal Party. We have Mr Crouch himself who has contributed to the Liberal Party. We have the late Paul Ramsay's healthcare company, who has contributed the Liberal Party. We have the late Doug Moran, who has contributed to the Liberal Party. We have the late Richard Pratt who has contributed to the Liberal Party. They are all on the former secret list. That is one of the reasons why these lists need to be transparent so Australian taxpayers and Australian voters can make up their own minds.


Of course there is another company on the list, and I am calling it a secret, dodgy list: 7-Eleven, a truly discredited company. They currently hold the record for making the top of another list, the top of the list for the highest ever record of underpayments to its own staff. To date, the Fels panel has uncovered $2.3 million of underpayments for just 101 workers. They are on the secret list that the government wants to continue to protect. Mr Fels told the Senate inquiry last week that they have written to 15,000 workers. So this is just the tip of the iceberg. 


The company 7-Eleven tells us it wants to be accountable, yet fiercely clings and seeks government protection to stay on the secret list. Last week at the Senate inquiry, we discovered a similar fraud to James Hardie. The company 7-Eleven has now set up an independent company called Independent Claims Pty Ltd to which it is going to funnel payments to workers who have been underpaid. That is a company that the government wants to protect and does not think it is okay somehow that the public and Labor demand transparency for companies like that. That is not good enough. Thankfully, that secret list, with all the people on it, is now out there for the public to see, along with the list of donors to the Liberal Party for the Australian voters to make up their own minds about. 


Right now, we have a government hell-bent on raising the GST—again, going after the Australian community and Australian workers—to a whopping 15 per cent, but steadfastly refusing to deal with tax transparency. Boy, have they got it wrong and the Australian public know it right now.

 (Queensland) (16:28):  Senator Lines, I thought you might have learnt a lesson from your leader's attempt to smear the Prime Minister. Perhaps you should have a look at the opinion polls in recent weeks to see what the Australian public think of these very base attempts to smear people simply because they have been successful. Senator Lines, you talk about dodgy companies. I wonder if you include in that the dodgy operations run by the union movement?




Senator Moore:
  Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. The comments should not be made directly to Senator Lines; they should be made through you.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, you are correct. Senator Macdonald, if you could refer comments through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I do stand corrected, but I can understand why the Labor Party would take such a trivial point of order. That seems to be the standard of the Labor Party these days. If you say something they do not like, they try to stop you saying it. Perhaps they should have a look at something about freedom of speech in this country and get on with the matter. I can well understand this, because the Labor Party is controlled by the union movement and, whenever you start attacking the unions, their underlings in this place simply try to stop you raising the point. We have all seen example after example of how the unions have ripped off their own members in a disgraceful display, and there is no accountability at all. Where is the legislation to make unions accountable for the money which they steal from their members? We all know about the Health Services Union and the CFMEU. We know all about the union of workers in Sydney that funds the New South Wales Labor Party and the rorts and corruption there. Yet Senator Lines has the hide to abuse parliamentary privilege by naming people in this chamber.


This government has done more for accountability across the board than any government in recent history, and I am pleased that the royal commission into trade unions is providing, at last, some accountability for the hundreds of millions of dollars that go through the hands of dodgy union bosses—and, I might say, some union bosses who are not dodgy. One wonders about the Labor Party's enthusiasm for accountability when it comes to people's private tax issues and not about accountability and transparency where union funds are committed.


I do not have a lot of time, and in answering Senator Lines I have strayed a bit from the subject. But can I just point out that the government maintains the Australian Taxation Office's corporate tax transparency publication except for those companies where the publishing of the information would have put at risk the privacy of owners and the competitiveness of businesses. I might also point out that submissions made to the Labor government before the Labor government introduced some legislation in this area some years ago highlighted the risk that disclosing the tax affairs of closely held companies will effectively disclose the tax affairs of companies' owners, and the risk of making public commercial-in-confidence information for private companies. Those submissions were made to the Labor government, and the Labor government at the time took that into account in the legislation they brought forward. The concerns were also raised when the coalition government consulted on the exposure draft of legislation to exclude Australian-owned private companies from the Australian Taxation Office tax transparency publication. The exclusion of these companies, however, has absolutely no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. So the tax office already has that power. It is a very strong power, and it is a power which, I am aware, the tax office regularly uses. The exclusion of those companies also has no impact whatsoever on the amount of tax paid by those companies under the law, and the public disclosure will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies.


In the limited time left to me, can I again pay tribute to the coalition government and particularly the former Treasurer Mr Hockey for his work in having implemented G20 and OECD base erosion and profit shifting recommendations on country-by-country reporting and harmful tax practices to address that multinational tax avoidance, and the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information to address offshore tax evasion. These are real initiatives of the coalition government. The Labor Party were in power for six years. I was going to say they talked a lot about this and did very little, but I do not think they even talked too much about it. It was left to the coalition government to work with countries around the world to try to fix this problem of tax and profit transparency. It is an issue that has been around for a long time, and I am delighted that the government of which I am a member is at last doing something that should have been done decades ago, and that will ensure that companies that operate in Australia pay the right amount of tax in Australia, something Mr Hockey and the whole government were very keen on and something the Labor Party had six years to do something about and did absolutely nothing about. But that work is on the way, and I would urge the Labor Party to get involved in constructive issues like that rather than having these base debates and trying to malign and smear fellow Australians.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-11-24,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:35):  Today's debate is on the importance of tax transparency. Let me be clear: tax transparency is not important. Government should be transparent about what it does with our tax dollars. Government should not be transparent about the affairs of people who pay that tax. Taxpayers are required to provide private information to the tax commissioner so that he can check whether the taxpayer has paid enough tax. Taxpayers face fines and imprisonment if they do not provide this private information. Such coercion is a necessary evil of government. Traditionally governments have softened this imposition by promising not to share the private information they extract. But we have rejected this tradition. As it stands, the law requires the Tax Commissioner to publish the tax affairs of foreign companies with high turnover. This is an abuse of trust and a violation of privacy, and it adds insult to the injury of taxation.


This parliament is full of politicians who want to change the law so that the tax affairs of more and more taxpayers are published. These politicians who want to publish the private information of taxpayers are either meddlesome, unbalanced or conniving. The meddlesome ones love to pry into other people's business. It is a great shame that these snooping busybodies, who just have to find out other people's business, have found their way into the federal parliament.


The unbalanced politicians are driven by a visceral hate of those with more money than they have, a hate that veils a seething jealousy. Again, it is a great shame that our parliament contains so many people who believe that the wealth of rich people must be ill gotten, rather than the result of hard work, ingenuity or luck.


And the conniving politicians are just pandering to antirich prejudices felt by others in the electorate. We will never get rid of conniving politicians, but we should quell, rather than stir up, the antirich prejudices on which they prey.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-24,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:37):  At the very least, in this debate it is good to see that some senators on the Labor side are just as agile and nimble as this government. They are showing a level of agility and—I do not know if 'nimbility' is a word!—nimbleness. That is perhaps a word! We have been asking them to do that. We have been asking them just to be a little bit more open minded and to see the possibilities for this nation. Unfortunately, they have not really applied that agility and that nimbleness to the issues facing the country and the problems and concerns that people have in the real world; they have applied that agility and nimbleness to their arguments that they are bringing to this debate.


I was here only a couple of weeks ago when Senator Dastyari was going around getting the numbers on a particular amendment that the Labor Party had, to do with tax transparency. They were making the argument that it was okay to put this provision in the bill to make everybody with a net worth of more than $100 million be transparent—it was okay to do that—because it is already available. It is already available through ASIC. You can just pay $38, I think it is, and you can get the details. Since then it has become apparent that actually some companies can request not to have that information made public, obviously because they prefer to have their personal tax matters private. And now the Labor Party have a completely different argument: 'We need it because these people are excluded, and there is a list of businesses that are exempt from those ASIC provisions.'


It is, I think, very interesting and very important to recognise that this exemption to ASIC reporting—this is my understanding—was introduced in 1995. Who was in charge in 1995? It was the Labor Party. The Labor Party introduced this particular exemption, and now they are trying to argue against it. They did not even realise it was an exemption a couple of weeks ago, and now they are using it as part of their argument to justify something that they really did not understand. It is clear now that they did not understand, because they did not understand how the law works.


They are being very agile in this debate to change tack on this argument to justify why they need to now continue their position even though the information has changed. Unfortunately, they are not so agile sometimes when it comes to transparency from other organisations. They are very keen here for individual Australians to have to put on the public record their individual tax affairs, even if there is not even a suggestion that they are doing the wrong thing. They might be paying their tax. They might be lodging it on time, doing everything right. They would have to put their personal financial affairs out in the public domain. That is what the Labor Party want to do.


But, even though they believe in transparency in that regard, they completely oppose efforts to improve transparency when it comes to trade unions, or registered organisations. Registered organisations have a very privileged place in our legislative framework. They are protected and exempted from trade practices laws. They have the ability to collectively bargain among their members—much more power than farmers get in that regard—because they are registered organisations under an act. But they currently can hide a lot of information, including director fees and whether or not they have actually lodged their appropriate statements with Fair Work Australia, the relevant regulatory body.


So, a few years ago, we—actually, it was Mr Tony Abbott, in the other place—put forward a private member's bill to increase transparency of registered organisations, to make it a civil offence for a reporting unit not to lodge a compliant full or concise report with Fair Work Australia. That is right; it was not even an offence, civil or otherwise. It was not even an offence under the Fair Work Act for a trade union not to lodge their proper reports with the appropriate regulatory body. We know from certain scandals in trade unions over the past few years that many organisations had failed to lodge those reports.


Guess what the Labor Party's approach was to that bill? Nothing. They did not want any transparency of organisations that get privileged places in our legislative framework and that should be subject to transparency because the members, ordinary workers, ordinary Australians, pay fees every week to be members of those organisations. They deserve that transparency. They deserve that organisation to be fully compliant, but the Labor Party do not want to apply that in those instances.


They do want to apply it to people who happen to have some wealth in our society. I support the statements of Senator Leyonhjelm. I do not think we should be dividing the country in any way. I do not think we should be dividing the country on race, on creed, on background or on income. We should apply laws to everybody equally. If there are people who are doing the wrong thing who have less than $100 million or people who are doing the wrong thing who have more than $100 million, the law should apply to them equally. I believe that every Australian deserves to be equal before the law. If they have done the wrong thing, the law should absolutely come down on them like a ton of bricks.


But we should not seek to make one set of rules for some Australians and another set of rules for other Australians, because there has been no evidence presented here that somehow there is noncompliance or a culture of nontaxpaying in those people earning above a certain amount of income. There is no evidence. We have had a huge Senate inquiry into this issue. It has had hearings all around the country. While certainly that inquiry exposed issues particularly in regard to multinational tax avoidance, there was absolutely no evidence that individual taxpayers in this country are somehow avoiding large amounts of tax or that there are any deficiencies in the powers and privileges that the Australian Taxation Office has to follow up any issues on individual taxpayers.


Without any of that evidence, why would we impose this unequal burden? Why would we do this? One reason, I think, that this is being raised again is an attempt from the Labor Party to reheat another sequel on an agenda here: trying to bring in the Prime Minister. It failed a few weeks ago. They are now trying for the sequel. I would advise the Labor Party that usually the sequels are worse than the original movie. Usually they are not as good, and this one is certainly a poor man's sequel, relative to their attempt a few weeks ago.


Finally, I am a relatively new senator, and it does frustrate me no end when we in this place seek to place a higher bar or a higher burden or greater compliance on individuals in our country than we would on ourselves. If we in this chamber and in the other place think it is appropriate to make public the tax paid, the personal financial affairs and the tax returns of Australians with a certain amount of income or assets, why would we not impose that same obligation on ourselves? I have not seen anyone in this chamber propose that, and I think it is deeply hypocritical for people here to try to impose that standard on other Australians, who have not necessarily done anything wrong, when not a lot of people in this place would be too comfortable doing that. I am not proposing it, but I think that if others want to propose a law for certain Australians they should be willing to apply it to themselves as well.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (16:45):  I rise to support the matter under discussion, and in doing so I want to place it in its proper context, which is that the government is most keen to have a debate about taxation and in particular have a debate about the GST and the role that a rise in the GST might play in plugging holes in revenue and in funding a cut to corporate taxes. That is the reality of the debate we are having now. That is the context in which we seek to initiate a discussion about tax transparency. Instead of talking about a GST, people on this side of the chamber believe that the government should first look to the solution that is right under its nose.


There is a problem in this country with corporate tax avoidance. The Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance has just been through this, at length, and found disturbing evidence of the practices that are taking place every day in major multinational corporations in this country. There are real problems with transfer pricing. Apple reported a taxable income of only $247 million in Australia from revenue of over $6 billion. Just last week we heard from Chevron, and they talked to us about why it is that they pay significant amounts, a transfer price, to a shipping company headquartered in Bermuda. They provided the laughable response that the reason they locate their shipping company in Bermuda is to take advantage of the world-leading health and safety standards in that jurisdiction. BHP earned profits of $5.7 billion from its Singapore marketing hub, and the tax paid on that amount in Singapore was $121,000. Uber is a company renowned for being disruptive and innovative, and they are certainly disruptive and innovative in the way they approach taxation. Uber requires its drivers to submit 25 per cent of every transaction to its head company in the Netherlands. That profit, made off the backs of ordinary people driving cars for their company, is not recognised in Australia at all. Uber has 100-odd staff in Australia to facilitate its thriving and growing business—and I should say that it is a very important and interesting business, which I think is going to add great value to our country. Nonetheless, the 100 people headquartered here who are driving this business are not considered to be part of the company and not considered to create value for the company. They are simply described as a 'marketing operation'.


The ATO thinks this is a problem. On Wednesday last week at our hearings, Commissioner Chris Jordan explained it this way. He said:


For example, one thing I find odd is when firms are marketing goods and services here in Australia we're told that it's a 'low value add' activity. But when Australian goods and services are marketed to foreign countries through marketing hubs it is suddenly a highly valuable activity. It just doesn't add up.


This is a real problem. It is a problem that is recognised by the OECD, and we on this side of the chamber do not assert that transparency is the only solution, but we do say that it is a key part of the solution. Some people want to say that it is not necessary that we should be simply focusing on compliance. Indeed, it is very important that we properly resource the ATO. But the truth is that tax transparency allows us to have a proper conversation as a nation about the kind of tax regime we have in place and whether or not it is fair.


The purpose of a transparency regime is not to drive compliance. I agree that that is the job of the ATO. The purpose of transparency is to ensure that we as a nation can assess whether or not the laws currently in place are operating properly to ensure that everybody pays their fair share. Everyone here understands that the ability to fund the services that Australians expect—good health services, good education services, an aged pension and the kinds of things that make Australia a great place to live—is utterly dependant on a robust, fair and effective tax regime. Tax transparency is part of the process of ensuring that we can secure these into the future.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-24,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:50):  In two minutes or less, I say this: tax transparency is important because without a high level of transparency in our tax system, particularly for large corporate entities, public confidence in our tax system can be undermined and eroded. Parallel to that, having tax transparency can stimulate public discourse and debate as to whether some of our biggest corporations are paying a fair and appropriate level of tax. So it is relevant and important as part of this public discourse to be aware, for instance, that global energy giant Chevron paid just $248 on revenues of $1.73 billion. We need to know what the story is there. That is why I moved those amendments in relation to general purpose accounts in the last session of this parliament. I think it is important that we have that additional layer of information for companies that have a part of a global entity with $1 billion or more in revenue. If you are small or medium company that has $25 million or more in revenue you need to provide details to ASIC, which are public and transparent. There is a grandfather clause of close to 1,500 companies that do not have to provide that. Treasury itself, in its own inquiry back in 2006-07 said, 'We should get rid of that exemption.' That is part of this debate.


Finally, I want to make reference to Senator Edwards, who said that it is all my fault and that I was not part of the debate several weeks ago. I did miss the debate. The speaking list collapsed. I was doing an interview. I have been up-front about it. I have apologised for it but there was no division. Senator Edwards needs to be corrected in relation to that. Unlike Senator Edwards, I am not perfect. I will try to do better next time. That is why I am trying to make amends so that we can have greater levels of tax transparency in this nation. I think it is absolutely imperative that we have a good public debate in a great democracy such as ours.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:53):  I thank all senators for their contributions. It is always great to see the Liberal Party dragged, kicking and screaming, into a debate about taxation. In case anybody has misunderstood what this is about, it is about the Liberal Party protecting its mates. It is about the Liberal Party protecting its leader, who believes it is okay to run his assets through the Cayman Islands. That is fine, but he says, 'I want to make Australians pay a GST of 15 per cent on food'. This is a party—those opposite—who do not want Australians to understand exactly how much tax is paid or, most importantly, not paid by a select group of companies in this country. Company after company has been dragged to the economics references committee taxation inquiry, and over and over again they have come up with the most pitiful excuses as to why they do not actually pay any tax in Australia. 


We have a government pretending that it is going to get some tax revenue from overseas companies or, what has become worse now, we have a trend where Australian companies set up their businesses in a deliberate way to artificially shift their profits to another country which has a lower tax regime. That is what is at stake here: the integrity of our tax base. Why don't the Liberal Party want Australians to know why and how much tax some people do or do not pay? Why is that the case? One blog this afternoon went through all the Liberal Party donors that are on a secret list and the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that the people on this list—who the Liberal Party are trying to protect today—actually donate to the Liberal Party. Is that the reason? 


I looked on in amazement as certain big international companies fronted a tax inquiry in the United Kingdom. They were asked, 'Why don't you pay more tax?' Do you know what their simple answer to those British members of parliament was? It was, 'We pay all the tax that your laws require us to.' Those laws are so fraught with loopholes that you could drive trucks through, so set up with vested interests, that these companies say, 'I pay exactly the amount of tax that I am required to. These companies that set up all these tax avoidance mechanisms to make sure they pay as little tax as possible use the defence of, 'I pay all the tax I am required to.' Do you know who else said that recently? Do you know which other prominent Australian said recently, 'I pay every tax dollar that I have to, even though my assets go through the Cayman Islands'? Do you know who that was? It was none other than the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Turnbull. He chose his words very carefully when he said, 'I pay all the tax that I am required to by law'. That is exactly what all those tax-avoiding companies that turned up in the UK said. That is exactly what they said: 'It's your fault, parliament. You haven't made us pay any more tax.' And now we have Mr Turnbull running the same defence: 'I pay all the tax I am required to by the laws of the country I'm the Prime Minister of.' Prime Minister, you can change that. 


Today we have seen that the Prime Minister, when exposed as being one of the people who runs a company that is not required to disclose how much tax it has paid, has now written to ASIC and said, 'Please take me off the list.' If that is not an admission that he knows that this is the wrong thing to do, then why has he written that letter today? If that is not a smoking gun, nothing is. This is a government that wants to protect its mates, wants to protect its Prime Minister and argues that it is okay to run your assets through the Cayman Islands—because it is just a beautiful place. You have got to read some of the reasons that these people have set up in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Apparently it is really safe. The Bermuda Triangle is news to them. It is a very safe maritime regime. The Bermuda Triangle does not exist. It is just part of the fiction of the sixties and seventies. 


These are companies that have set themselves up with structures that are designed to minimise the amount of tax that they provide to the Commonwealth so that the Commonwealth can provide services to Australians. That is what this debate is about. It is about the Liberal Party wanting to protect its mates, wanting to protect its donors and wanting to protect companies that are ripping off the tax base of this country. These are companies that actually engage in economic activity in Australia, that make sales and purchases here in Australia but manage to transfer their revenue and their profit streams to other countries like, say, Singapore—which has officially half the rate of tax. It is sort of like what they call the 'rack rate' at a hotel. That is if you are dumb enough to pay only the 15 per cent; you can get a much cheaper rate out of the Singapore regime just by asking nicely. Fifteen per cent is just the headline rate to get companies to register and set themselves up there. 


I had to stop myself laughing when the chief executive of one of the big Australian international companies said, 'Yes, we do all this work here in Australia. We've got a billion dollars worth of revenue but, do you know what, our base is actually in Singapore.' Senator Xenophon asked him if he had ever been to Singapore. Here we had the chief executive of a company that sends all its revenue to Singapore because that is where they set up their business. How many times do you think he had visited Singapore in his period as CEO? Ten? Five? Two? One? No, you guessed it: he had never been to Singapore—to his own head office! That shows you what a sham transaction looks like: when the CEO of an Australian company says, 'We've set up our head office in Singapore'—nothing to do with tax—but he has never bothered to visit the country where his head office is set up for the region. What an extraordinary contempt for the Australian public. What an extraordinary contempt for that committee. But, most importantly, what an extraordinary contempt for Australian tax laws when you can divert all of your resources and your revenues to another country so that you do not have to pay tax.


So the challenge I put out to those opposite today is: do not stand here and pretend that you are doing anything other than protecting your Liberal donor mates. Do not stand here and pretend that you are going to fix the tax-base of this country, when you are not going to. You want to claim that there is a problem with the budget in this country that needs a GST fix—that ordinary Australians have to have a 15 per cent tax on food put on, while you want to protect your Liberal donor mates and your Prime Minister.


Do not pretend that it is about anything else. This debate is about why the Prime Minister of Australia says it is okay to put his assets running through the Cayman Islands and why companies run their assets, their profits and their revenues through the Dutch Antilles, the Bermuda based companies and the Cayman Islands based companies. This is a tax debate that is a fair dinkum tax debate. This is a piece of legislation that is going to come before us but those opposite are going to die in a ditch over. The signature moment for Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister of Australia, is to protect Liberal Party donors, to protect companies that are ripping off ordinary Australian taxpayers and to try to pretend that he is much nicer than Mr Abbott. Well, Mr Abbott did not have assets run through the Cayman Islands. Mr Turnbull does.



It is time that Australians knew exactly how much these companies pay. It is exactly why this amendment and this debate is so important. Australians deserve to know how much those opposite are protecting their mates from paying tax in this country, and then they can make an informed decision about why they need a GST. Should tax companies, should Liberal Party donors, should the Prime Minister pay a bit more tax, or should I have to pay 15 per cent GST on food? That is what this debate is about. So come clean, those opposite. Come clean and do not insist on your bill without the amendments. (Time expired)

Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (17:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I refer to the letter received by the President on 17 November advising of the motion passed by the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia that calls on the federal government 'to abandon the proposed plebiscite on marriage equality and urgently calls on all members of the Federal Parliament to have a free vote on a bill to amend the Marriage Act 1961, to provide for marriage equality.' This was recently supported by this Senate during the last sitting period. Members would recall that the Senate passed a Greens motion noting that a plebiscite is divisive, costly and not necessary and calling on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to provide a free vote on the issue of marriage equality by Christmas.


The clock is ticking. There is still an opportunity for Mr Turnbull to break with the Abbott prime ministership and show some leadership on this issue. At the moment, Mr Turnbull is in the Lodge but Tony Abbott is his ghostwriter. He is still drafting these policies and still setting the policy agenda of this government from his political grave. We have seen that on a range of issues from climate change to marriage equality. Mr Turnbull needs to break with the Abbott era and provide a free vote.


We have talked about this plebiscite before here in this place, but let us make no mistake here: it is often presented as some kind of way of providing progress on this reform. What a nonsense that is. What a complete sham it is to spend $160 million of taxpayer funds to ask a question we already know the answer to. The people who are putting this idea on the table are not doing it because they think that it is going to bolster the prospects of success or because they are wanting to deliver this reform. They are doing it because they are trying to find another roadblock. They are trying to concoct some other elaborate excuse, some other way of shutting the door on marriage equality for same-sex couples in this country, some other way of furthering Tony Abbott's ridiculous ideological opposition to marriage equality in this country.


We have a new Prime Minister, and he needs to put his money where his mouth is. He needs to break with the Abbott era and offer a different style of leadership. We are not seeing that at the moment. We have, as I say, Mr Turnbull in the Lodge but Tony Abbott being his ghostwriter, still pushing this agenda. It is clear, however, that momentum for marriage equality is building in this country. There is a mounting list of parliaments rejecting a plebiscite and calling on the parliament to act. I do congratulate the Parliament of Western Australia for taking that step. It is great to see the Senate here doing the same thing. We do need to, collectively, keep the pressure on Mr Turnbull so that he acts on this important issue. Let us have a free vote on marriage equality before Christmas.

 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I want to be clear that the primary motivation of the criminal groups and individuals threatening national security and perpetrating the extremist violence around the world is just that—a threat to our national security. Their primary motivation is to perpetrate this terrible violence right across the planet. These people seek to impose their will and world view through the most heinous of crimes—crimes that are designed to scare, to silence and to suppress any manifestation of culture, belief or thought that is different from theirs. Their tactic is to divide us and to generate and perpetuate fear and suspicion. In doing so, they attempt to erode the very nature of our democracy.


As we remember and honour the lives of those killed and injured in recent attacks in Paris, in Beirut, in Bamako, in the Russian airliner brought down over Egypt and in the hundreds of other incidents around the world in this year alone, we must redouble our efforts and commit again to those principles that we hold dear—democracy, respect for diversity, inclusion—of course recognising that global cooperation has to be our first response. Violent extremism does not respect or distinguish between national borders. If there is one lesson we have learnt from the recent tragic events, it is that making the world safer from these horrendous acts requires a high level of diplomacy and cooperation between nations.


Like many Australians, I am deeply concerned by the conflict in Syria. The facts are staggering. The UN has said that 250,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011 and an estimated 7.6 million are internally displaced. Four million people have fled the country. The Greens have said all along that, without a clear plan—a plan that outlines our objectives, our exit strategy—military action is just adding to the chaos in that country. We, like many others, believe that a US led coalition is not going to achieve much for Australia's or indeed the world's national security interests. As the President of the US himself has said only recently, they do not have a clear long-term strategy for countering IS. Their past military involvements in Iraq, since 1991, have been spectacularly unsuccessful and indeed a disaster for the region.


Unilateral military involvement in Syria is unlikely to provide a long-term solution and it risks greatly increasing the appeal of IS to young people. This is a disgraceful organisation, and the barbarity with which it acts is appalling, but the response needs to be a comprehensive, multilateral strategy with our allies, including the Arab League, working with the United Nations to achieve a number of objectives—objectives that are not as simple as simply sending in ground troops and that might not fit as neatly into a two-minute sound bite as some of the interventions we have heard, as unhelpful as they have been, from the coalition of yesterday's men, people like Kevin Andrews and the former Prime Minister himself.


What is required here is a comprehensive response, closing the Turkish border and preventing the flow of weapons and foreign fighters from joining IS or Daesh, cutting off the organisation's money and supplies. This is critical. The financing of terrorism is what keeps these organisations going. We cannot engage in an arms race and keep sending more of our military to face more of these weapons. We need to work to ensure stability in Syria. We know that there has been a power vacuum that has allowed radicals and foreign backers to take hold. Of course we have to assist in the rebuilding efforts—the rebuilding of hospitals, housing, schools and other vital infrastructure.


We also have to face up to the reality that huge inequality, poverty and disenfranchisement all contribute to the problem by providing fertile ground for the recruiters to the criminal cause of violent extremism. That is why the Greens believe that an international response must include a commitment to address the social and economic conditions that enable it to thrive. Reversing our trajectory on foreign aid would be a start. At the same time as these conflicts continue unhindered, we are now on track to see our lowest contribution to foreign aid in 30 years. The Greens advocate increasing Australia's foreign aid budget to reach 0.7 per cent of gross national income by 2025, a commitment already reached by countries like England, which we know has faced greater economic pressures than the pressures we are facing here in Australia right now. The Millennium Development Goals target of 0.7 per cent was intended to be reached this year but we are further away from it than ever. Now is the time to get back on track. As one of the wealthiest countries in the world, we should demonstrate our genuine concern by lifting our contribution to foreign aid and ensure that we not just increase the level of aid but also its effectiveness. Using foreign aid, for example, to expand our detention centre network is a shameful use of money.


Tackling violent extremism is incredibly complex. It requires a considered response. We have to work with the international community to make Australians and the citizens of all nations safer from violent extremism. Australia clearly already has comprehensive protections with regards to community safety. We have laws that stop a person from travelling in and out of Australia, that prosecute a person for supporting terrorist activity overseas. We have laws that restrict a person's movements and communications without charge, that subject them to surveillance and that revoke the citizenship of dual nationals on the basis of past convictions—just to list a few. But we are not persuaded that new citizenship laws will offer any further protections against the threat of terrorism and we are concerned that they might make the threat of public safety at home and overseas worse. We believe that the safest place for people convicted of terrorism charges—that is, criminals—is in jails rather than roaming the world. We do support a strong domestic policing response here in Australia and we agree that our security agencies should be equipped with the powers and resources to do that job. But we also believe that investment in programs that support families and communities that are vulnerable to the insidious influence of recruiters and extremism is critical.


We have called for the establishment of a centre for social cohesion to develop key preventative programs to help stop young Australians from becoming radicalised, to work with communities, to work with young people to unite the nation rather than divide it. We think that such a body fostering social cohesion can bring together government, law enforcement agencies, academic researchers and indeed people who were previously recruited to the cause so that we can work together to build resilient and cohesive communities. I hope that our parliamentary colleagues will support this action for an important piece of national security infrastructure. We all do agree in this place that we have to rise to the challenge to defeat the criminals behind extremist violence. We agree that violence anywhere is unacceptable and that lives all over the planet are equally valuable but we also believe that we need to look at new ways of addressing the problems and to support our values of respect and inclusion.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws.


The Government is committed to fairness and sustainability in Australia's tax system. This Bill underlines that commitment by making some important changes to realign policies with their original intent, improve integrity and reduce complexity for taxpayers. 


Schedule 1 to this Bill will modernise the methods for calculating tax deductions for work-related car expenses by streamlining and updating the available methods and rates for claiming work-related car expenses.


Schedule 2 will better target the Zone Tax Offset to exclude Fly-in Fly-out and Drive-in Drive-out workers. This meets the Government's priority to deliver a fairer tax system—ensuring only those genuinely living in the specified geographic zones are entitled to the offset.


Schedule 3 will introduce a separate grossed-up cap of $5,000 for salary sacrificed meal entertainment and entertainment facility leasing expenses for certain employees of not-for-profit organisations, and all use of these salary sacrificed benefits will become reportable.


Schedule 4 will create a new reporting regime which requires third parties to report on a range of transactions. 


The 2015-16 Budget delivered by this Government demonstrated a commitment to building a fair and sustainable tax system. Schedule 1 to this Bill contributes to this commitment by modernising and streamlining the available methods and rates for calculating work-related car expenses. The schedule reduces the number of methods for claiming the deduction, not what is deductible for car expenses. 


Currently, work-related car expenses are claimed by 3.8 million taxpayers each year.


Under current rules, taxpayers can choose one of four methods to calculate their claims based on their travel and documentation. This Bill reduces the available methods down to two.


Having four different methods available adds complexity to claims for taxpayers. This is because taxpayers—or their tax advisers—tend to calculate all four methods in order to identify the method that delivers the greatest amount of deduction.


Of the four methods currently available, both the 12 per cent of original value method and one-third of actual expenses method are used where more than 5,000 business kilometres are travelled, and therefore require less substantiation. Yet these two methods are used in just two per cent of claims each year. As such, this Bill will remove these two options.


Instead, for the 2015-16 income year, taxpayers can continue to calculate their claims using the more popular cents per kilometre method for business travel of less than 5,000 kilometres, or the logbook method to calculate their claims based on actual expenses and travel.


This Bill also modernises the formula for calculating claims using the cents per kilometre method. Under this method, no substantiation of car expenses is required—only a reasonable estimation of the work-related travel conducted throughout the year, up to a maximum of 5,000 business-related kilometres. This will not change under this Bill. Under present arrangements, these work-related kilometres are then multiplied by a cents per kilometre rate based on the size of a car's engine - currently 65 cents per kilometre for small cars, 76 cents per kilometre for medium cars, and 77 cents per kilometre for large cars. 


In addition, the existing rates apply to rotary engines of different sizes, and have not previously been modernised to apply to modern electric or hybrid vehicles. 


This Bill streamlines the different rates based on engine size to a single rate of 66 cents per kilometre, which is based on the average running expenses in Queensland and New South Wales of the five highest selling vehicles in Australia. This rate is a fair estimation of expenses for all taxpayers, and is supported by recent data from both RACQ and NRMA for the costs of running the top five selling cars.


For those taxpayers who travel more than 5,000 business‑related kilometres, the logbook method will not change—establishing work-related driving by keeping a logbook for 12 weeks which is valid for five years—still enables them to claim their actual expenses based on their work-related use. 


For those that wish to stay on the cents per kilometre method, Tax Time 2016 will be much easier with a standard rate applied to their travel. 


The original methods and rates were set in the 1980s—it is clear based on the methods actually used, and up to date industry information on current running costs, that these rates and methods are outdated. They are adding to the compliance burden of everyday Australians—which is already one of the highest in the modern world. 


Going forward, the Commissioner of Taxation will review the new single rate each year reflecting the most up to date running costs for the greatest number of Australian taxpayers. These changes will raise $845 million over the forward estimates, making a significant contribution to our ongoing budget repair effort. 


Schedule 2 provides for changes to the Zone Tax Offset to realign it with its original intent.


From the 2015-16 year, the Zone Tax Offset will be targeted to people genuinely living in identified regional areas. This Bill will exclude 'fly-in fly‑out' and 'drive-in drive-out' workers (also referred to as FIFO workers) from claiming the offset, where their usual residence is not within one of the 'zones'. FIFO workers whose usual residence is in one zone, but who work in a different zone, will retain the Zone Tax Offset entitlement associated with their usual place of residence. This will ensure that the offset is better targeted to those taxpayers genuinely living in these regional areas. 


The Zone Tax Offset was introduced in 1945 and was intended to compensate recipients for the disadvantages of living in remote areas including isolation, uncongenial climate and higher costs of living. 


Geographic regions associated with the Zone Tax Offset are spread across Australia and include regional areas of all states and territories except Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. In addition, particularly remote areas (including parts of the Northern Territory, far west and north Queensland and northern Western Australia) are eligible for higher zone rebates in recognition of the additional costs they face.


Currently, to be eligible for the offset, a taxpayer must reside or work in a specified remote area for more than 183 days in an income year. The residency test does not require a Zone Tax Offset recipient to spend 183 days consecutively in the relevant zone. As a result, FIFO workers who spend more than a total of 183 days in a zone are currently eligible to claim the offset.


When first enacted, the Zone Tax Offset was intended to compensate Australians genuinely living in these regional areas for certain disadvantages associated with living in such remote areas. However, this offset was designed before the rise of the Fly-in Fly-out worker, before modern travel and before the mining boom made temporary relocation for work economically viable.


So what we now see is that FIFO workers flying in from Perth, or Brisbane, or Sydney—areas otherwise ineligible for the offset—are able to spend over 183 non-consecutive days in these regional areas of Australia, return to their home in Sydney or Brisbane or Perth, and still claim the offset. This is clearly not the intent of the original policy and it is unfair on those Australian families who are genuinely contending with the isolation, uncongenial climate and higher costs of living in these remote areas.


It is estimated that up to 180,000 people currently claim the Zone Tax Offset based on where they work rather than where they live. 


Schedule 2 to this Bill amends the law so that only those residents genuinely living in the designated geographic zones are eligible to claim the offset, and is expected to raise $325 million over the forward estimates. This change is consistent with the original policy intent of the offset, ensuring that it is fair, well targeted and sustainable.


Schedule 3 to this Bill introduces a separate single grossed‑up cap of $5,000 for salary sacrificed meal entertainment and entertainment facility leasing expenses for employees of certain not‑for‑profit organisations. All use of these salary sacrificed entertainment benefits will become reportable.


The charitable and not‑for‑profit sector in Australia is vitally important to the strength of our community. Each year the federal government provides billions of dollars in support to the sector in the form of various tax concessions.


These include income tax exemptions, deductible gift recipient status, applying a higher threshold for GST registration and fringe benefits tax concessions.


Employees at a public benevolent institution or a health promotion charity are ordinarily entitled to Fringe Benefit Tax exempt benefits up to $30,000 a year and employees in public hospitals, not‑for‑profit hospitals and public ambulance services up to $17,000 a year. 


In addition to their $17,000 or $30,000 cap, an employee will also be entitled to spend an unlimited amount on entertainment benefits without being subject to Fringe Benefit Tax. These uncapped benefits can include meals, alcohol, cruises, holidays overseas and birthday parties.


The use of these concessions has moved beyond its original intention. However, as the government recognises the ongoing importance of these concessions in the not-for-profit sector, this Bill imposes a cap of $5,000 grossed up on these benefits rather than removing them altogether. A cap improves fairness and is further evidence of the Government's commitment to the integrity and sustainability of the Australian tax system. This change is expected to raise $295 million over the forward estimates.


Since 2007, the Australian Taxation Office has offered individual taxpayers a pre-filling service to help them to complete their tax return. It uses the information received from third parties to provide this service.


The Australian Taxation Office now receives sufficient information to completely pre-fill a simple tax return. It now provides information to taxpayers on wages and salaries, interest and dividend income, government benefits from Centrelink, and Medicare and private health insurance details.


To further improve compliance and make it easier to complete tax returns, Schedule 4 to this Bill amends Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to increase the information reported by third parties to the Commissioner of Taxation.


Schedule 4 creates a new reporting regime requiring third parties to report on the following four types of transactions: government grants and payments, transfers of real property, transfers of shares and units in unit trusts and business transactions made through payment systems.


First, government grants and payments often constitute income in the hands of businesses. Examples of these payments are those provided to contractors or consultants for a range of services. These payments may give rise to taxable consequences for the supplier of services.


Commonwealth and state and territory government entities will be required to report information on grants and payments for services to businesses that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


Local government entities will also be required to report information on payments for services to businesses that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


Second, transfers of real property may give rise to different kinds of tax consequences. A common consequence is an income tax liability, based on a net capital gain. Another is a goods and services tax liability.


Each state and territory will be required to report information on transfers of freehold or leasehold interests in real property that occur on or after 1 July 2016.


Third, transfers of shares or units in a unit trust may give rise to income tax consequences based on a net capital gain. Corporate events, such as a return of capital to shareholders, may also have income tax consequences.


The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will be required to report on transaction data that it has received under the market integrity rules. ASIC will report on transactions that occur on or after 1 July 2016.


To enable the Commissioner to identify the parties in each transaction that ASIC reports, market participants such as stockbrokers will provide client identity information to the Commissioner.


Such reports will be provided for transactions that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


Trustees of trusts other than unit trusts are required to report on transactions that have a tax consequence for absolutely entitled beneficiaries. This will allow the Commissioner to attribute any capital gains tax consequences to absolutely entitled beneficiaries. Such reports will be required for transactions that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


The Commissioner will exempt trustees from reporting under this regime where they lodge a tax return for the trust for the relevant income year.


Finally, amounts that a customer pays a business typically give rise to income tax consequences for the business.


Administrators of payment systems will be required to report the total of all electronic transactions paid to a business or provided as a refund or cash to a customer of the business. Examples of electronic transactions are those payments using credit or debit cards. However, the reporting will be limited to transactions the administrator of the payment system reasonably believes are for the purposes of a business. 


These reports apply to transactions that occur on or after 1 July 2017.


This measure will improve taxpayer compliance by increasing the information reported to the ATO to allow improvements to pre-filling of tax returns. This is expected to raise $123 million over the forward estimates. In addition to increasing integrity in the tax system, this measure will also simplify the tax return process for taxpayers. 


The Government recognises that this regime will impose some costs on reporters and fully expects the Commissioner of Taxation to streamline processes and avoid duplication. Compliance costs for reporters can be minimised by aligning information reporting requirements with the natural systems of businesses (such as setting up new client records or paying suppliers) and using current and emerging technologies.


This Bill is aimed at better targeting and strengthening our tax system to ensure it is fair and sustainable. 


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:22):  I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. The purpose of the Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Bill 2015 is to amend the Migration Act 1958, to introduce a new criminal and civil penalty regime that will make it unlawful for a person to ask for, receive, offer or provide payment or other benefits in return for a range of sponsorship related events. The bill also allows visa cancellation to be considered where the visa holder has engaged in such conduct, referred to as 'payment for visas' conduct.


This bill reflects the key integrity recommendation of the independent review into integrity in the subclass 457 program: that it be made unlawful for a sponsor to be paid by visa applicants for a migration outcome and that this be reinforced by a robust penalty and conviction framework. This bill will apply to a range of temporary sponsored work visas and skilled permanent employer sponsored visas, where payment for visas conduct is known to occur, including the 457 visa and the 186 and 187 permanent employer sponsored visas.


The practice of giving or receiving a benefit in return for a visa sponsorship can have serious detrimental effects. These include making vulnerable non-citizens liable to exploitation; reducing employment opportunities in Australia and putting downward pressure on wages and conditions for citizens and permanent residents; allowing persons who receive a payment in return for sponsorship to inappropriately make significant financial gains; and adversely affecting the integrity of Australia’s migration program.


Payment for visas conduct is not currently unlawful. It is, however, unacceptable to the government and the Australian people because it undermines the genuine purposes for which visas are intended to be granted. This bill will strengthen the integrity of Australia's migration program by deterring payment for visas conduct and allowing action to be taken where such conduct has occurred. The regime of offences, civil penalties and discretionary visa cancellation provided for in the bill will allow the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to take action against unscrupulous people across a broad spectrum of payment for visas conduct.


The proposed amendments protect Australian workers, because they ensure that overseas workers who are employed in Australia and who may eventually gain permanent residence do so on the basis of genuine skills and need rather than because they have paid their employer. The proposed amendments protect overseas workers from exploitation by sponsors who threaten to withdraw their support in the visa or employment process if payment is not forthcoming. Employment opportunities in Australia should be earned not sold, and the employment of foreign workers should not act to undercut Australia's wages and conditions.


I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee have recommended passing the bill without amendments. They have also recommended the government undertake a broad information campaign to ensure that migration agents, sponsors and visa applicants understand the requirements of the bill. The government accepts and will implement this recommendation. I would like to thank the committee for their work. I commend the bill to the Senate.

As I noted during the second reading debate, in our judgement this bill is defective in that the bill does not apply to all work related visas, including student visas and working holiday visas. It is limited to employer sponsored visas, but the kinds of exploitation that the bill seeks to prevent have arisen with regard to other visas as well. As we have seen with the 7-Eleven examples, these amendments extend protection to all holders of temporary work visas and subject their employers to the same penalty regime. A consequential amendment substitutes the term 'migration outcome related event' for the term used in the bill: 'sponsorship event'. The thrust of these matters is to provide proper protections, not taking away rights but actually enhancing the rights of visa holders when, as we have seen, there have been so many examples of people being ripped off.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:31):  We will not be supporting these amendments. Whilst the principles of the mischief that you wish to ameliorate are sound, this is specifically about particular coercion for a particular group. Government would say that it is not appropriate within this legislation to spread the mischief from actually coercive behaviour, in the purchasing or receiving of benefits from either the party of the person who receives the visa or in fact the sponsor who is assisting in providing the visa, to some issues around how much you actually get paid. They are significantly separate issues, and we would say that the matter that you are referring to should be dealt with by Fair Work Australia.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:32):  Looking at the amendments as circulated by the opposition, the Greens support them. We need to be clear here that we too are very concerned about the exploitation of people on those more short-term working visas or student visas. They are indeed some of the most vulnerable people working in our community and some of the most vulnerable noncitizens working in our community.


How much more evidence do we need than the scandal from 7-Eleven? I know it was a little bit of a Freudian slip by the Leader of the Opposition in one of his interviews, where he referred to 7-Eleven as Subway, but the issue here is surely that we would be naive to think that this type of exploitation of workers only happens within the 7-Eleven chain and franchises. We know that there are employers out there who are doing the wrong thing, particularly by young workers whether they are here on holiday visas or whether they are here on student visas, and they should not be able to get away with it.


Of course, there are some elements of being able to tackle this through the Fair Work Act and the Greens are doing what we can. The Member for Melbourne, in the other place, has introduced legislation to amend the Fair Work Act to ensure that there is responsibility for exploitation such as this to be taken right to the top of organisations that operate on these types of franchise set-ups. But here we are today looking specifically at issues that relate to the exploitation and wrong use of people on working type visas. Why shouldn't it also ensure that we protect those people who are here on student visas, working holiday visas and other types of short-term working arrangements?


I struggle to understand why the government is not taking this issue up themselves head-on. It is surely not a particularly hard line to draw if you want to crackdown on those who are doing the wrong thing in terms of employer sponsored visas. If the same credentials apply to them and you want to crack down on them then surely you are able to stretch that out and ensure that you get those who are amongst the most vulnerable of our non-nationals and non-citizen workers.


I have also got some questions for the minister. I raised in my speech on the second reading the big concern around these issues: that they do not just deal with the employers who have done the wrong thing but that they also capture the person who has been given the visa, who may have got into this situation unwittingly. I am drawing this question in the context of these amendments from the opposition because a lot of these students are people who have English as a second language and who do not have family supports around them. They are back home overseas. It makes them even more vulnerable. I think we should be going after the employers in this area, not the workers. I would like to know what the government is doing to ensure that we are not going to be tripping up and catching those who are actually the victims in this rather than the masterminds of unscrupulous behaviour.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:36):  Thank you for your question. This legislation deals with a class of visas that are sponsored. You need a sponsorship to come to Australia to have a work right. In the circumstances that you are describing there may well be mischief in that area, but their right to be in Australia is actually afforded invariably by a study right so it is not about the sponsorship issue.


Whilst I appreciate the very good remarks you make, the recommendation from the committee was to stick specifically to where coercion is able to be offered, where the coercion leans on your capacity to be in the country and the right to be in the country rather than on the right to work. For a student the right to be here to study is already conferred but they have a right which is very similar to other rights in the country, which is why it is our recommendation that that is dealt with through Fair Work Australia.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-11-24,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:37):  I understand the comments not put forward by the minister. The problem is that there is this intersection with these group of workers where they are being exploited because of the conditions on their student fees, for example, or on their working holiday visa. So employers are able to exploit them. It may not be that that is the reason they are sponsored to be here but because they are being forced to do things that are out of line with their visa conditions, that is where the coercion sets in. For a student who is forced to work more than 20 hours a week, otherwise they do not have a job, their employer will sack them, it is that type of exploitation. They cannot work legally more than 20 hours a week because they would be in breach of their student visa but here we have the employer exploiting that vulnerability.


I understand it gets into a grey area but it is a very clear intersection between the already large number of vulnerabilities of these workers linked into this business model from employers, whether they are sponsored work visas, whether they are keeping people here as low-paid exploited workers on other types of visas, these people are doing the wrong thing and the people who are copping it, if they speak out, if they do not comply, are the vulnerable workers caught in the middle.


I understand it does not fit exactly with what the government is trying to do in this legislation, but what we are pointing out here is that there is a big gap where most of the exploitation is happening. If we are not going to do it in this piece of legislation, where are we going to do it because it does need to be tackled? Perhaps the minister could give me some indication as to where the government wants to go. If not with these amendments, where are you going to pick up cleaning up the system because, for all the talk, we have not seen amendments to deal with that issue.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:40):  Thank you again for that contribution, Senator. I can only reiterate that for the particular legislation we are dealing with now a fundamental recommendation was that we deal with this particular part of it. That may be because of the complexity of the transaction between those two areas. I am not the minister; I am just acting on behalf of the minister so I cannot give you an answer about how those other matters can be dealt with but I am advised that most of the matters on which you are seeking clarification can be dealt with under the Fair Work Act. I can only reiterate that for the issues we are trying to deal with here, the threat of coercion deals with the right to be here in the country, not with any particular right to work. I acknowledge that in some of the circumstances you describe, an employer can coerce someone to work outside their visa conditions, but the mischief we are trying to ameliorate specifically in this legislation is where the coercion lies with their right to be in the country. I understand the connection you make is that you put your right to stay in the country at risk because you have been coerced to work longer. I accept that that is a mischief which may occur but again I reiterate that the recommendations which come with this legislation are specifically to deal with those matters where an employer or a sponsor is put in a position where they can exploit and coerce other people who wish to have a visa or outcome.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2015-11-24,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:42):  In broad terms there are a number of ways by which coercion can be provided. There are three classes. There is a class where the sponsor or the mischief the sponsor would indicate that they would seek to have some benefit to the sponsor: 'You'—the applicant—'will pay me a certain amount of money and I will provide the sponsorship.' It can be an existing sponsor. In my opening remarks I related to where an existing sponsor had a job or has work rights in this country, the sponsor can say, 'For a number of reasons I am able to breach my sponsorship or close off my sponsorship unless you continue to maintain or start paying funds' or some of the benefit to the employer. It may also be the case, and I suspect it is in a small number of cases, were a potential applicant offers funds to coerce a sponsor into ensuring that they provide the right sort of evidence so that the applicant for that visa class is successful. I hope that is of assistance, Senator. It is a broad range of the mischief that this legislation is trying to ameliorate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:44):  I fully acknowledge that the government is doing the right thing in regard to that particular matter. That is not the issue. The opposition is supporting that aspect of the bill. The concern I have is that there have been too many examples now where there have been groups of people on visas other than 457s subject to exactly the same problem. 


For instance, take the recent case where the Australian Federal Police have laid charges against three individuals relating to alleged fraud in the vocational educational system. The example that has been brought to our attention is of Australia Post. This is a government agency employing subcontractors—in this case, St Stephen Institute and Symbiosis, two colleges that were registered here. In fact, I think one of them was just recently given a seven-year extension on their registration without any site visit. Yet this college has been employing people to work for Australia Post and treating them very badly, to the point where fraud charges—which we know have a very high threshold for criminal proceedings—have been laid by the Federal Police against those colleges. There is another one, TK Melbourne Education and Training, which, as I understand it, has also been the subject of these actions by the Federal Police. 


These examples are not historic. They are very much happening now. They are examples of people with visas other than in the 457 class who have been mistreated by employers. The 7-Eleven example has now become infamous across this country, and of course there are many others. My attention has been drawn to a raid that I understand Border Force officers undertook just last Wednesday at a house in or near Brisbane. According to reports that I have seen, the house contained up to 30 people from Taiwan who were operating what has been described as a 'boiler room'—that is, a high-pressure sales call centre. The boiler room was discovered when residents in the house tried to prevent the real estate agent from entering the facilities. Workers in this call centre probably could not be called employees because, as described, they were effectively slaves.


This is happening here and now, and this parliament has an obligation to do something about it. We all know that 'slavery' is a pretty ugly word, and I am sure it shocks many Australians for us to use it. But that is the reality of what is occurring. As I understand it, the Border Force raid saw four persons expected to be deported for violating their 417 visa conditions. There needs to be attention paid to prosecuting employers who misuse these provisions.


I think it is reasonable to assume that these circumstances are just the tip of the iceberg. It demonstrates why it is necessary to broaden the scope of this bill. We can commend the government for taking action on 457 visas, in terms of payment for results. I acknowledge that that is a step forward, but it is nowhere near as good as we could get by simply acknowledging that there is a range of other visas where similar practices are occurring. In particular, I think the actions with regard to the backpacker visas have seen widespread abuse of those workers. The student visa provisions have been widely acknowledged to have been grossly abused by unscrupulous employers. That is why I am suggesting there needs to be action taken, consistent with the provisions that we are proposing, to extend protections to students and working holiday visa holders so that they can be treated properly.


It is no good saying, 'Take it up to Fair Work Australia.' That makes an assumption about the power relationships, and that people have standing and union protection, because it is often the case that unions play a vital role. If you are a student and you are placed in these circumstances, you are put at a complete disadvantage if you want to stay here. I did not come down in the last shower—I know that people do things that they should not do in terms of breaching their visas, but there have to be measures put in place so that people can come forward. That is why I argued in the 7-Eleven case that there needed to be an amnesty to allow us to get to the bottom of what was a systemic rort. The way this company was operating—their business case depended on it—suggested to me a fundamental corruption of the system which required quite strong and deliberative action by this parliament.


That is why I am urging the chamber to examine these matters. I would ask you, Minister: when you say that these questions can be taken up before Fair Work Australia, what history do we have of that being a successful course of action for students or backpackers who are placed in this situation? How often does that occur and what are the results? I am sure the department has some statistical evidence. Given the level of abuse that the department knows is going on, what percentage of those people end up before Fair Work Australia and how long does it take to get your case heard?

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:51):  I would just reiterate the motivation and the mischief that this legislation seeks to ameliorate. There is currently conduct that is lawful in Australia. All the circumstances that you have described, Senator, are currently unlawful in Australia. The motivation for this legislation is to ensure that those things that are obviously odious to the Australian public but currently lawful in Australia are now made unlawful by this piece of legislation.


You make a few references to circumstances where you wish to make amendments to include them in this legislation. As you would know, Taskforce Cadena, which is a taskforce made up of both Fair Work Australia and the department, is acting to ensure that those circumstances, as they come to bear, are investigated.


You did refer to boiler room activities and they are horrendous circumstances. I do not want to go into any great detail. Those issues are currently under investigation. The authorities are moving to provide a brief of evidence to prosecution, as they should under these matters, because those matters are lawful. But where a matter that is equally odious to us comes to the attention of the Australian government or the authorities, we cannot act on it because it is currently lawful in this country. So this legislation specifically seeks to ensure the right to remain in this country. As a sponsor, people are using coercion, at one level or another, to ensure that they can gain access. After this legislation, that will be unlawful. Where one party has been coercive in their behaviour, that will be unlawful and various authorities will now be able to act.

There may be circumstances where a clear benefit does not flow to that visa holder. The minister then has the discretion to look at all those circumstances to ensure that there is ample evidence that the person who is the applicant for the visa is a beneficiary of some of those transactions. That will be a discretion held by the minister for those reasons.

It is very difficult for someone in those circumstances to put their hand up and say they are in those particular circumstances. I acknowledge that. But in the nature of these crimes that is often the case. But once discovered, which is the circumstance we are talking about, if we were able to establish that the sponsor was actually providing the coercion to the worker—if we talk about the circumstances of the workplace, I think I have covered that in my answers to the last couple of questions from my colleague opposite. The clear intention of this legislation is to prevent the mischief of the sponsor coercing the individual who is applying for the visa.

 (Victoria) (18:07):  I seek leave to move a second tranche of amendments—to increase penalties for sponsors—amendment Nos (20), (21), (24), (31) and (38). 


Leave granted. 




Senator KIM CARR:
  I move opposition amendments (20), (21), (24), (31) and (38): 


(20) Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (line 12), omit ""2 years or 360 penalty units"", substitute ""4 years or 720 penalty units"".


(21) Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (line 16), omit ""240 penalty units"", substitute ""480 penalty units"".


(24) Schedule 1, item 6, page 6 (line 29), omit ""240 penalty units"", substitute ""480 penalty units"".


(31) Schedule 1, item 6, page 7 (line 21), omit ""360 penalty units"", substitute ""720 penalty units"".


(38) Schedule 1, item 6, page 8 (line 20), omit ""240 penalty units"", substitute ""480 penalty units"".


The current bill has a criminal offence of a maximum of two years in prison or a fine of $64,800 for individuals, or $324,000 for a corporate body, and civil offences with a maximum fine of $43,200 for individuals and $324,000 for corporate bodies. It is my view that this penalty regime is too lenient to be an effective deterrent. 


The evidence is that financial gains from committing offences against visa holders can be as much as $70,000 for an individual visa holder and up to $700,000 for a sponsor dealing with multiple visa holders. It may well be that people feel there is an advantage in terms of profiting from the exploitation of cheap labour under these circumstances. It clearly is not a humane approach for this parliament to take to allow such actions to continue. Clearly the government recognises this; that is why they have proposed changes to the 457 visa arrangements.


However, the penalty regime remains far too low and will undermine the intent of this bill—by a simple measure: an employer that wants to exploit these people in this way will still be able to make very substantial profits out of it. So Labor's amendments provide for penalties set out in the bill to effectively be doubled.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:08):  Before I address these particular amendments, I would like to thank all crossbench senators for their thoughtful approach to the bill. In particular, I would like to thank Senators Lazarus, Wang, Lambie, Muir and Madigan for approaching the government with concerns and assisting the government to address those concerns to pass the legislation. 


The minister has agreed with the crossbench to review certain aspects of the legislation 18 months after the commencement of the legislation and to make that review public within 24 months. I understand the minister will be writing to the crossbench senators, Senators Lazarus, Wang, Lambie and Muir later this evening, but a form of words has already been agreed to for the minister's undertaking. The government considers this an extremely important bill and thanks the crossbench for supporting this bill through the parliament. 


In regard to the penalties, the maximum 360 penalty points and a two-year term of imprisonment for the criminal offence is already greater than the standard ratio of penalty units to imprisonment prescribed in the Attorney-General's Department's Guide to framing Commonwealth offences infringement notices and enforcement powers,which is five penalty units, which is one month imprisonment, which would equate to a maximum of 120 penalty units for a two-year term of imprisonment. The current level of penalties attracted the attention of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills when conducting their recent inquiry into the bill. We acknowledge that, however, the high penalty units are commensurate with the anecdotal evidence as to the upper limit amount paid in payment for visa cases. 


As you indicated, Senator Carr, in your contribution, the penalties for this bill are for in fact each criminal offence and each civil penalty contravention. So a person convicted of charging two visa holders for sponsorship would under the criminal offence be liable for up to 720 penalty units, which may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, a maximum term of four years imprisonment.

My experience here suggests to me that it implies that some arrangement has been entered into. Is that the case?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:21):  I would like to thank Senator Xenophon for his support on that last amendment, because, clearly, he was not party to that arrangement. With that being the case, it does alter the way in which we proceed here. It is a disappointment that these issues of such profound significance to so many people should be treated in this way. I am sure others will be able to speak for themselves about that question. But it does point to the question of whether I call for divisions on each of the tranches of amendments if they are not likely to affect the vote of the chamber. I would be interested to know if anyone has a view on that question. We may well be able to get further advice on that score. It would be very helpful if the crossbenchers, when entering these arrangements, did actually advise the chamber as well. And I will take this opportunity to seek leave to move the third tranche of amendments—amendments (1) and (2), which go to the issue of Australian business numbers.


Leave granted.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7807:


(1) Title, page 1 (line 1), after ""Migration Act 1958"", insert ""and the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999"".


(2) Schedule 1, page 3 (before line 3), before the heading specifying Migration Act 1958, insert:




A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999





1AA


After subsection


8(1)



   Insert:


   (1A) Despite subsection (1), *you are not entitled to have an Australian Business Number (*ABN) if:


      (a) you hold either of the following visas granted under the Migration Act 1958:


         (i) a student visa (within the meaning of that Act);


         (ii) a temporary visa referred to in regulations made under that Act as a Subclass 417 (Working Holiday) visa or a Subclass 462 (Work and Holiday) visa; and


      (b) you were not registered in the *Australian Business Register before the commencement of Schedule 1 to the Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Act 2015.


And I take it that we are not likely to get any further advice to the chamber from the crossbenchers on these matters. Is that the situation?



The CHAIRMAN:  I am looking to the crossbenchers, and if anyone seeks to make a contribution I will give them the call, but—




Senator KIM CARR:
  Perhaps I could just indicate, while people are thinking on that matter, that the amendments we are proposing prohibit workers who are on student visas or backpacker visas from obtaining an Australian Business Number, or ABN, and therefore prevent them from being employed as contractors or subcontractors. That of course would mean that they would have to be employed directly as employees and receive their full entitlements. In the case of students, prohibiting ABNs would also make it easier for regulators to check that people who are being employed are able to do the work within their visa conditions, which limit work to 20 hours a week. On that, I would commend the proposition to the chamber.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (18:23):  I would firstly point out that sham contracting is already unlawful under the Fair Work Act and certainly this government is not of a mind to stymie innovation from those wanting to pursue that course. And I can indicate to the chamber that the government does not support this amendment. The suggested amendment is not consistent with the purpose of the bill and is better pursued as amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 and/or A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999. Barring international students and working holidaymakers from obtaining an ABN may adversely impact on legitimate employment activities. The Fair Work Ombudsman has existing responsibilities under the Independent Contractors Act 2006 in conjunction with the Fair Work Act 2009 to prevent employers from disguising an employment relationship as an independent contracting arrangement, including for international students and working holidaymakers who may hold an ABN. The Australian Business Register is the responsible administrative entity for ABNs, not the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I just want to indicate, firstly, in relation to the issue of some of my colleagues negotiating with the government, that I commend them for doing so. For a whole range of reasons, partly because of other commitments, I was not part of that. I think my colleagues did invite me to be part of it. The reservation I had was in relation to the amendments to do with human trafficking and coercion. I have some questions to ask of the government in respect of that when we get to those issues. I think my colleagues on the cross bench have acted in good faith to get the best possible outcome. I am certainly not critical of them; good on them for going down their path, and I commend them for their initiative. I do have some reservations, though. For instance, I supported the opposition in terms of the increased maximum penalties. It is still at the discretion of the court as to what the penalty will be, but I think you do need to have strong deterrence in respect of that.


I cannot in good conscience support this particular amendment. I can understand Senator Carr's intent in respect of it. In terms of issues of backpackers being potentially exploited, I think the issue is one of enforcement through the mechanisms that have been set out by the minister. So, if there is an issue of exploitation of the use of ABNs at the moment, then that ought to be a subject of rigorous and robust enforcement. That is the preferred course, and I think that it is more appropriately dealt with under that. But I am interested in asking some questions about human trafficking and coercion, because I have some concerns about that and some real sympathy for Senator Carr in moving those amendments. I commend him for moving them, but we will get to those in due course.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:27):  My concern is not whether or not people negotiate with the government, which is entirely consistent with what all of us do. My concern relates in part to a practical consideration that people want to know whether or not they can go to other functions, and I am being asked how many more divisions we are going to have. I do think, though, that no matter what people are doing, the chamber is entitled to know. If there is an arrangement in place, they should tell us, because it will affect whether or not we call the divisions, particularly given the other circumstances that are on. I also think it is good grace that if senators are engaged in conversations with the opposition then they tell us that they already have an arrangement or have changed their position. The chamber is entitled to know where people stand.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7807 be agreed to.

Subsections


486R(1) to (4)



   Repeal the subsections, substitute:




Eligible court may make civil penalty order



(1) An eligible court may, on application under subsection (3), order a person to pay a pecuniary penalty that the court determines to be appropriate if the court is satisfied that the person has contravened a civil penalty provision.


Note: Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the eligible court may order the person to pay.


(2) An order under subsection (1) is a civil penalty order.




Application for civil penalty order



(3) An application for a civil penalty order may be made within 6 years of the alleged contravention by:


   (a) the Minister; or


   (b) for an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision in Subdivision C or D of Division 12 of Part 2:


      (i) a person affected by the contravention; or


      (ii) an industrial association (within the meaning of the Fair Work Act 2009).

Subsection

   Omit ""The Commonwealth"", substitute ""A person to whom a pecuniary penalty is payable"".


(56) Schedule 1, page 16 (after line 16), at the end of the Schedule, add:




19


Application—civil penalty orders



   Division 1 of Part 8D of the Migration Act 1958, as amended by this Schedule, applies in relation to a civil penalty order that is applied for on or after the commencement of this Schedule, whether the contravention or alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision occurs before or after that commencement.




20


Requirement to make regulations—approval of nominations



   As soon as practicable after the commencement of this item, the Minister must recommend to the Governor‑General the making of regulations under the Migration Act 1958 to ensure that, if the Minister reasonably believes that an employer of a holder of a visa has contravened Subdivision C or D of Division 12 of Part 2 of that Act, the visa holder is not disadvantaged in connection with the approval by the Minister of nominations by approved sponsors under section 140GB of that Act, as compared with other visa holders.


These amendments are intended to ensure that whistleblowers who report instances of charging for migration related events are properly protected. You simply cannot have a situation where there is a racket going on and someone blows the whistle and is then subject to punitive action. The minister would be required, if these amendments were accepted, to amend the migration regulations so that a visa holder whose sponsor is reasonably believed to have contravened the provision of the bill is not disadvantaged for reporting the matter. For example, a 457 visa holder would be given sufficient time to find a replacement sponsor and would not have to reset the clock on the path to a permanent residency.


These amendments further protect workers by allowing unions to instigate proceedings both for existing civil offences under the act and for the new civil offences created by this bill. Allowing unions to bring civil penalty proceedings will increase the resources available to ensure compliance and the integrity of our visa system.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (18:29):  I can indicate to the chamber that the government does not support these amendments. The amendments could potentially reduce the discretion of the department to pursue visa cancellation, infringements or take civil action should it be assessed as appropriate. This could occur in circumstances where, despite the whistleblower having volunteered information, their conduct was sufficiently repugnant that they should not be afforded protection. Noting that decisions about pursuing visa cancellation, infringements or taking civil penalty action are discretionary, the department will prescribe under policy that the intent of a person is relevant when consideration is given to whether to take action against them, and what form that action might take. Policy guidance for cancellation consideration already states that a person's individual circumstances should be taken into consideration.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-11-24,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:30):  I rise to speak in support of amendments (3), (45) and (56), as moved by Senator Carr, to ensure that whistleblowers are protected. This is not just an effective change to the law here. We will only be able to ensure that we crack down on people who are misusing and abusing these sponsor visas if we have people who are willing to speak out and give information about what is going on in workplaces. We have seen this over and over again, particularly in relation to exploitation of foreign workers—whether it is those under 457 visas, whether it is more short-term working visas, study visas or, indeed, working holiday visas. The one barrier to people speaking out and alerting authorities to things that are happening that are wrong, to the abuse of visas, to the abuse of workers in the workplace and the exploitation of vulnerable people, is the fear of not being protected if they come forward. The 7-Eleven example is another, but there are many others, such as those on sponsored visas—they may be seasonal workers—or in other industries.


There is that vulnerability, particularly if you are a migrant, if you do not speak English as your first language, if you do not have a strong social and family network around you and you are unsure about what your rights would be if you spoke up. It is absolutely crucial that people who are putting themselves in a vulnerable position by blowing the whistle are indeed fully protected by the law, and there is no ambiguity about that. These amendments go some way to strengthening the assurance that the people who are going to be coming forward and exposing unscrupulous behaviour can do so with the full confidence that they themselves will not be hung out to dry or left in the lurch. It is important that we build a culture across all of our workplaces, but in particular in those areas where we have foreign workers who are already vulnerable because of their visa status, in which they can get an understanding of and information about what their rights are as workers in Australia. They need to feel confident that they have every right to stand up to exploitation and every right to alert the authorities, without the fear of being deported, without the fear of being intimidated, and without the fear that if they do not give the right information as to what the Australian Federal Police might deem to be important they are then going to be thrown on the pile and left to fend for themselves.


If we want this legislation as a whole to work in terms of cracking down on the business model of dodgy rorters, then we have to give support to the people who are going to be the witnesses to that. These amendments help to bolster that and to give more protections, which I think is absolutely warranted. I would be surprised if the crossbench senators would not support the idea of protecting these people, so that we can ensure that, when employers are doing the wrong thing, people will have faith that speaking out and giving that information means they will not be hung out to dry.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Could I get clarification from the minister in terms of the existing regime that applies to the protection of whistleblowers? I think the minister said in her explanation on the opposition to the ALP's amendments in relation to this that there was a system in place where you look at the issue of purpose, or the intent, of a whistleblower. The issue I have with that is how you gauge that intent, and whether you also look at the effects of the information that was conveyed and whether it was usefully acted upon. For example, you might have a person who may not have the best of motives, but the information they provide is useful in exposing a rort or malfeasance in this space. I am trying to understand what protections there are at the moment, and why this would not strengthen that. I am trying to understand what the government's position is in respect of this.

As already noted, any consideration to cancel a visa is discretionary. All visas covered by this legislation have an English-language requirement, so we are not talking about persons who do not speak English and are not inclined to be aware of the work arrangements they have entered into.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:36):  Senator Carr can correct me if I am wrong but, as I understand it, his amendments relate to strengthening the penalties for whistleblowers. What does the government say in relation to why this is unnecessary in the context of this bill or what is being proposed? So if I can narrow it down. What does the government say, that this amendment is either unnecessary or counterproductive? And what does the government say about what it has in place at the moment that gives at least some measure of protection to whistleblowers? My understanding is that there is some measure of protection for whistleblowers, but Senator Carr is seeking to add to that. I need to understand why the government says that this will not help the situation, that this will not improve protections for whistleblowers or will have unintended consequences in respect of that. I am just trying to fairly understand the amendment. It is complex and I think it is fair that we understand why the government says this will be unnecessary or counterproductive or will have unintended consequences. I would be more than happy to hear from Senator Carr if he has anything to add on this.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (18:38):  I think it is important to understand that if the whistleblower is an innocent party in this sort of situation, there is going to be no penalty. I think that should be well understood. What we do need to take into account, though, is if the whistleblower has done the wrong thing then that obviously needs to be given consideration. My understanding is that giving indemnity in legislation to somebody who is doing the wrong thing would be unusual. It is very much in the capacity of the determination to weigh up those things and measure whether it was an innocent party and, if so, there would be no penalty.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:38):  I thank the minister for the answer. The issue is this: it is a question of degree. Sometimes a whistleblower may have done the wrong thing and, of course, that is to be condemned. But if the transgression of the whistleblower pales into insignificance with the information that the whistleblower is providing, then I wonder whether that ought to be taken into account, and also the circumstances for the transgression on the part of the whistleblower if, for instance, there was coercion, if there was intimidation or a whole range of other circumstances that led to the whistleblower doing the wrong thing, to put it colloquially. I wonder whether that should be taken into account. I am just wondering whether the ministerial discretion is now excluded in terms of the protection of the whistleblower by virtue of a transgression on the part of the whistleblower which may really pale into insignificance compared with the information that is being disclosed, information that may well be acted on by the department if there is malfeasance or other wrongful conduct involved.

It is very important that we do recognise, as you queried, that this is discretionary.

It is very important to note that it is also subject to full review by the AAT.

Senator Nash:
  Neither am I.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Neither is the minister, but she has some very, very capable advisers to her left—and I mean that sincerely. In terms of what Senator Carr is trying to achieve in his amendment, is the discretion so constrained that if a person who is a whistleblower has broken a rule or some rules, has committed a transgression, has done the wrong thing, to put it colloquially, but the information they provide is incredibly valuable in disclosing a wrongdoing, that the circumstances of that person's transgression may have been brought about through some coercion or intimidation, what are the parameters for the exercise of that discretion? I am not sure whether Senator Carr wants to jump in here.




Senator Kim Carr:
  I do.




Senator XENOPHON:

We do not want to give unlimited protection in legislation to people who are coming forward to blow the whistle. That is point 1. I need to also point to the fact that the visa cancellation ground is discretionary, as I have indicated, and it requires consideration to be given to a range of factors such as the person's complicity in payment for arrangement of visas. We need to understand that that is why this is done on a case-by-case basis, because it is not a simplistic process. There has to be that discretion by the decision maker to look at those instances I have outlined and look at this on a case-by-case basis.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:43):  The opposition intent here is to deal with the reality of what happens in the workplace as distinct from the theory of the way in which it is explained, particularly in this town. I have been dealing with immigration cases, as many of you here have, for many, many years. When it comes to the question about abuses of 457 visas, the power is all in the hands of the employer, particularly where a person has a serious complaint but wants to actually stay in this country, especially if they have an aspiration for a permanent residency. So there is an enormous pressure on any complainant in terms of what they reveal. The minister is quite right: there is discretion within the current act. What we are trying to do is not about providing a blanket indemnity; in fact, what we are talking about here is that the minister has to have a reasonable belief. The minister has to show some judgement. 


You do need to improve the level of protection for whistleblowers because the current legislation does not and the current practice does not. I have come across meatworkers over many, many years who have been faced with the extraordinary power of the employer to actually throw them out of the country if they complain, let alone report an employer to a government agency. That is one of the reasons that employers use these particular visas because of the control they have over people on the shop floor.


Make no mistake about it: we are not dealing with some idealistic legal principle here. We are dealing with the power of people to ruthlessly exploit workers under the most adverse conditions. We recently saw the case of the student visa arrangements in regard to 7-Eleven. How long did it take for this government to say, 'By the way, we will consider people being given an exemption from their obligations under the student visa arrangements'? It took so long, and in that time police needed information, I think, about how the scam was working. That is what troubles me about the government's position. They rely on a legalistic approach which history has shown does not work given the power relationships in regard to the way people are treated. That is why I say whistleblowers are entitled to more protection—not a blanket indemnity but more protection—and that is what these amendments do.



The CHAIRMAN:  Just to be clear, there are three amendments before the chair. Those are amendments (3), (46) and (56). We may have indicated that it was amendment (45) earlier in the proceedings, but that is not correct. The question is that amendments (3), (46) and (56) on sheet 7807 be agreed to.

Reports on operation of this Subdivision



(1) The Minister must, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a report on the operation of this Subdivision, and any other provision of this Act to the extent that it relates to this Subdivision, during the year ending on 30 June.


(2) The report must contain the name of each body corporate:


   (a) convicted of an offence against this Subdivision during the year ending 30 June; or


   (b) against which a civil penalty order was made during the year ending 30 June for contravening a civil penalty provision in this Subdivision.


As this bill is currently drafted, there is not a reporting obligation on the minister. This amendment will enhance the transparency of the system and the accountability within it by requiring the minister to table an annual report on the operations and the impact of the provisions that are being introduced by this particular instrument. That report would include the names of companies found to have been in breach of the provisions, which would be a further deterrent for sponsors who do not give workers their full entitlements. This is a straightforward transparency measure, and I commend the amendment to the chamber.

These amendments go to the issue of coercion, criminal offences and civil penalties in relation to visa holders. As this bill is currently drafted, the minister will have the power to cancel the visa of someone who has received a benefit. An unintended consequence could be that the visa of someone who was coerced into making or receiving a payment might be cancelled.


These amendments ensure that penalties cannot be applied to a visa holder who has been coerced by the sponsor or a third party into offering or making or receiving or requesting a benefit. The amendments also prevent the minister cancelling the visa of someone who has been subject to human trafficking, forced labour or slavery offences. Vulnerable workers should not be placed at risk of deportation because of the criminal conduct of their employer.


I say this again: these are not blanket indemnities that we are proposing; they require judgement by ministers as to what they have a reasonable belief is happening. We know that in these circumstances in this country these types of behaviour, including slavery, occur. The question is whether under those circumstances, when faced with the prospect of reporting an offence, people who feel sufficiently intimidated or coerced would actually do so if they know that for their benefit they have the very strong possibility of deportation. It strikes me that there is a need to deal more explicitly with that matter. I will have more to say on this matter. I understand that others want to say something on these questions.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (18:57):  I can indicate to the chamber that the government does not support these amendments. The intention of the bill is not to target employees who have been coerced into making payments or have been subject to human trafficking or slavery, and I make that very clear to the chamber. As payment-for-visas cases are usually complex, involving multiple actors, the government does not support enshrining this aspect in legislation. These amendments could potentially reduce the amount of discretion open to the department to change its approach should the initial appearance of the case change during the course of the investigation.


The department will prescribe requirements under policy that it is not appropriate to pursue visa cancellation, infringements or civil penalty orders against a visa applicant or holder where payments have been extracted under force of threats or other forms of exploitation. Cancellation is discretionary, as I have indicated, and consideration about whether or not a person has been subject to coercion would form part of the decision about whether or not cancellation should occur.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2015-11-24,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (18:58):  These amendments go to one of the main concerns that the Greens have and that I spoke about in my speech on the second reading. I am extremely concerned that the way the government's current bill has been drafted leaves wide open the opportunity for those visa holders to be the ones who cop the brunt of the crackdowns in relation to these unscrupulous employers. I absolutely support the idea that we need to stop the rorting. I absolutely support the idea that we need to ensure that people are not being exploited or misled in relation to getting a migration outcome.


But rather than going after the employer, what this bill consistently does is capture the employee, the visa holder. As it is currently drafted, with the minister having the power to cancel the visa of someone who received a benefit, whether or not there is any proof the individual was aware of the situation or indeed sought that particular outcome. It may be that it is an unintended consequence of the legislation, but let us clear it up. My office has been speaking with the minister's office today about this issue in particular, and I am not sure why the government is so intent on not tweaking it. If it is not the intent of the government to penalise the visa holder but rather to catch the employer, then they should not have legislation in place that is going to unfairly impact on the visa holder.


The government and the minister's office have been in communication with my office—and I am sure it has been the same with others on the crossbench and possibly even the opposition—saying that it should be the minister's word that is strong enough in the explanatory memorandum. We have dealt with this minister for a little while now and, frankly, his word means zilch, when it comes to this particular issue of trust. I do not trust the minister on this. If we actually want to protect people through this legislation, if we do not want employees and visa holders to be unfairly targeted and caught up in this process and if they are not the ones that this legislation is targeting then let us fix it so there is no ambiguity and it is not simply left with the minister as a matter of trust.


It is a simple fact that the only reason we need a review of how this law is going to be enacted over the next 12 months is that everybody in this place, it seems, except for the minister, is concerned that the people who are the most vulnerable are the ones who are going to cop it. There is not enough protection for them, and we have seen the other amendments not be supported in terms of people not being protected for speaking out. Now we have a situation where we are trying to ensure it is not the visa holders who have been exploited in the process by these dodgy business models and that it is in fact the employer who is held responsible.


Let us fix it, and let us make sure it is clear. These amendments do that. Vulnerable workers should not be placed at risk of deportation in response to this law coming down on the criminal actions of their employers. Why should someone who is employed be culpable for the actions of their employer? It is just not fair. We have heard the minister and the advisers of the department say that the intention of this legislation is not to crack down on the employees, that they do not want to make the visa holder responsible for the actions of their dodgy and criminal employers. Good. So let us put that in the legislation and make sure it is crystal clear. Of course, in saying all that, the Greens would like to see these amendments passed, because we do not believe it should simply be left to a matter of trust of the minister.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-11-24,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (19:03):  I would like to follow through on some of the remarks that have just been made. It deeply concerns me that we are being asked to take this government on trust when it comes to such profound questions. If we had a record we could rely upon on the issue of trust it might be a different question, but this is a government that has made secrecy and the ability to hide the truth a hallmark of the way these programs have been administered. So I would ask the minister a pretty simple question, because I am particularly concerned by what the explanatory memorandum actually says when we talk about trust. I ask the minister to explain how ministerial discretion is going to be used on the issue of cancellation of visas? Page 6 of the explanatory memorandum says:


The visa cancellation ground is discretionary and requires consideration to be given to a range of factors such as the person's complicity in the 'payment for visas' arrangement, strength of ties to Australia and contribution to the Australian community, in considering whether or not to cancel the visa.


We have a situation here where a person may well be subject to slavery, trafficking, gross exploitation, demands for sexual services in return for employment, or a whole range of offences which we know exist and are quite widely reported. But we are asked to take the government on trust when it comes to consideration of these matters. So I ask the minister: can you explain what those words mean—in regard to the explanatory memorandum—and will this include, in discretion—




Senator Xenophon:
  What paragraph is that?




Senator KIM CARR:
  This is in paragraph 18 on page 6 of the explanatory memorandum. I have quoted from the second half of that paragraph. There might be a student who has recently arrived and has been caught up in a visa scam of this type, or there might be a 457 visa holder from the subcontinent or from the horn of Africa, where we have seen entire meatworks boning rooms populated by people on 457 visas, straight off the plane, claiming to be responding to a skills shortage, grossly underpaid and under the threat of immediate deportation if they complain, let alone report an abusive employer. I come back to the proposition, Minister. Can you please tell us what those words mean?

 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (19:07):  I think the government have been very clear in how this is going to operate. I appreciate your asking again, Senator Carr, and I understand that you have concerns around this, but it really does seem that we are traversing ground that has already been traversed. I make the point, firstly, that without this bill the government has no powers to stop this behaviour. I think there is a significant concern out in the community that requires the government to act, and that is what we are doing. 


Within the discretionary power we need powers for both the visa holder and the sponsor. I indicated to the chamber in my earlier comments how that discretionary power will be used, and I indicated that reasonably clearly, I hope, to Senator Xenophon in answer to questions from him earlier. I can also indicate to the chamber that, if there were an error, there are already safeguards through review mechanisms, including the courts, to deal with that. I appreciate the senator's questions in this regard, but certainly the government is of the view that this bill gives us the appropriate mechanisms, in responding to significant concerns in the community, to deal with this issue.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (19:09):  Perhaps I could draw your attention to the Migration Act itself, at section 116(2), which indicates:


The Minister is not to cancel a visa under subsection (1), (1AA) or (1AB) if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa is not to be cancelled.


That is what the act actually says. Minister, why would it not be a prescribed circumstance if a person were subject to slavery or to trafficking under the Criminal Code? Why wouldn't it be a prescribed circumstance if there had been coercion of the visa holder by the sponsor or a third party—such as a labour hire company? These are practices that go on, day in and day out, in this country.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Minister for Rural Health) (19:10):  Firstly, Senator, quite simply it is not possible for a person to be coerced into receiving a benefit, and clearly benefit is part of the basis of this bill and what we are doing here. It will only be an offence if the visa holder or potential visa holder sought to obtain or obtained a benefit, and clearly in this circumstance they would not. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.


I also indicate to the chamber that it will be made clear under policy that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will only pursue cases where the visa applicant or holder, or other third party, has initiated or is complicit in the payment for visas arrangement. And—I need to be very clear about this—it will not pursue a civil penalty against a visa applicant or holder where payments have been extracted under force or threats or other forms of exploitation, such as those who have been coerced into making payments or have been subject to human trafficking or slavery. I think that is very clear. Indeed, Senator Xenophon, that may well pre-empt some of the questions you were going to ask around the issue of human trafficking. I hope it does, but I am very happy to address further questions if you have them.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:11):  Could I just say: sorry, Senator Hanson-Young, but I think it is unfair to impugn the minister's character by saying his word is 'zilch'. I have dealt with him and I have found him to be very decent to deal with. We have our disagreements but I have found him decent to deal with when he has given undertakings in respect of certain matters.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  It's a different relationship.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is a civil and courteous relationship. We have our disagreements, as I have had tonight with the government. I understand that the minister has the discretion not to cancel the visa of an individual who provided or received a benefit in exchange for a sponsorship in terms of coercion or was a victim of human trafficking or slavery. What I am concerned about is in respect of the explanatory memorandum at clause 18 on page 6. It refers to circumstances as to the cancellation ground being discretionary. I am concerned that the wording in the explanatory memorandum—which, of course, is an aid to statutory interpretation—is such that it may be quite narrow in the circumstances where a person may not have a long link or contribution to the Australian community but they have been the subject of out-and-out coercion or a scam or human trafficking. That is a genuine concern. I do not raise this to be difficult; I raise it because I think that Senator Carr, in his amendment, raises some genuine concerns about circumstances where it seems unclear as to how the department will facilitate visa holders coming forward to report that they are victims if there is no guarantee that their visa will not be cancelled or, at the very least, that there is a guarantee that they will be dealt with fairly and reasonably. Obviously there might be some people who allege coercion where there is not a reasonable basis for that allegation. I understand that. But how do you have a fair framework so that, if it is a reasonable allegation, there is some protection for those people who have made those allegations of coercion, human trafficking or slavery?

I know that the great majority of people hold him in very high regard. So thank you for those comments, Senator.


Firstly, I want to indicate that there will be a fair framework. I intentionally picked up the phrase that you used, Senator Xenophon, because that is precisely what we are doing with this bill. We believe that the fair framework is absolutely in the bill. I hope it will go some way to alleviate your concerns. As I indicated earlier—and I completely understand that you may well have been distracted—we will make it very clear, under policy, that we will not pursue a civil penalty for people that have been coerced into making payments or have been subject to human trafficking or slavery. I do not know how I can be any more clear about that. I understand from your reading and your perspective of those words that it has created some concern for you. I hope my very genuine response to you indicates that the government will not be pursuing civil penalties in those instances.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:15):  I accept the genuineness of the minister's response, but I can only rely in part on the wording in the explanatory memorandum, which appears to be quite narrow. In terms of civil penalty and maybe a nod might allay this—and I am sorry that I do not have the expertise that your advisers have or maybe you have after tonight—but, if there is a situation, does civil penalty include the cancellation of a visa? Is that what is defined? You may not be subject to a penalty in terms of being prosecuted for this particular provision, but, if you are going to lose your visa, that is a pretty significant penalty. I just want to clarify that. I guess that is where my reservation is. I know that some of my other crossbench colleagues are negotiating a review, which is very welcome and which will be very useful. But, sticking to the words of the explanatory memorandum, I am worried that the policy framework is going to be constrained by those words. What can the minister tell us about how, if there are reasonable allegations where on the face of it there appears to be coercion, human trafficking or human slavery and where that is established, that person's visa will not be cancelled notwithstanding that they were involved in an illegal payment?

 (Victoria) (19:18):  I might come in on that point. First of all, I come back to the question of trust. I do not think it is wise for us to work on the basis of legislation predicated on whether or not the minister is a nice person. Right. I think there is a suggestion here that the minister here is a man of integrity, and so be it. That is not the basis on which we legislate, because ministers do not stay forever. One of the harsh realities of political life is that we will all be replaced. The fact remains that we have to rely on what these documents actually say. Senator Xenophon is quite right: the explanatory memorandum is used as an aid to interpretation. These words are at best ambiguous and at worst quite deceptive, because they suggest that there has to be a consideration of a person's contribution to the Australian community. That is what the words actually say. If the minister's discretion is dependent on that in the circumstance where a person is actually brought to the country for the purpose of exploiting them on a 457 visa then of course their connections with this country are going to be, one presumes, quite limited.


So it strikes me that we do have to rely on what is before us, not just on the good intentions of the minister of the day.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2015-11-24,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:22):  I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. The purpose of the Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Bill 2015 is to amend the Migration Act 1958, to introduce a new criminal and civil penalty regime that will make it unlawful for a person to ask for, receive, offer or provide payment or other benefits in return for a range of sponsorship related events. The bill also allows visa cancellation to be considered where the visa holder has engaged in such conduct, referred to as 'payment for visas' conduct.


This bill reflects the key integrity recommendation of the independent review into integrity in the subclass 457 program: that it be made unlawful for a sponsor to be paid by visa applicants for a migration outcome and that this be reinforced by a robust penalty and conviction framework. This bill will apply to a range of temporary sponsored work visas and skilled permanent employer sponsored visas, where payment for visas conduct is known to occur, including the 457 visa and the 186 and 187 permanent employer sponsored visas.


The practice of giving or receiving a benefit in return for a visa sponsorship can have serious detrimental effects. These include making vulnerable non-citizens liable to exploitation; reducing employment opportunities in Australia and putting downward pressure on wages and conditions for citizens and permanent residents; allowing persons who receive a payment in return for sponsorship to inappropriately make significant financial gains; and adversely affecting the integrity of Australia’s migration program.


Payment for visas conduct is not currently unlawful. It is, however, unacceptable to the government and the Australian people because it undermines the genuine purposes for which visas are intended to be granted. This bill will strengthen the integrity of Australia's migration program by deterring payment for visas conduct and allowing action to be taken where such conduct has occurred. The regime of offences, civil penalties and discretionary visa cancellation provided for in the bill will allow the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to take action against unscrupulous people across a broad spectrum of payment for visas conduct.


The proposed amendments protect Australian workers, because they ensure that overseas workers who are employed in Australia and who may eventually gain permanent residence do so on the basis of genuine skills and need rather than because they have paid their employer. The proposed amendments protect overseas workers from exploitation by sponsors who threaten to withdraw their support in the visa or employment process if payment is not forthcoming. Employment opportunities in Australia should be earned not sold, and the employment of foreign workers should not act to undercut Australia's wages and conditions.


I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee have recommended passing the bill without amendments. They have also recommended the government undertake a broad information campaign to ensure that migration agents, sponsors and visa applicants understand the requirements of the bill. The government accepts and will implement this recommendation. I would like to thank the committee for their work. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (19:20):  Some people have unkindly suggested that I have not always been entirely generous to the Labor Party, the Greens and the crossbench senators in this chamber. Some have even more unkindly and inaccurately suggested the same lack of generosity on my behalf to some of my own colleagues. That is no doubt mischievous scuttlebutt put out by the unions!


But tonight I want to demonstrate how inaccurate these suggestions are by letting senators have advance notice of a wonderful event in the far north of the country, in the Cassowary Coast region south of Cairns, early next year. You can all be part of this unique event celebrating the very best of North Queensland produce. Tonight I want to, generously, give you all the inside running.


This is an attempt to break the world record for the biggest banana split. It will, understandably, feature lots of North Queensland bananas, and by 'lots' I mean some 40,000 bananas along with 2,500 litres of ice-cream, 1,500 litres of topping and lots of cream—lots of decadent Mungalli Creek cream. If you have not experienced the joy of cream and milk from the award-winning Mungalli Creek Dairy on the Atherton Tablelands in North Queensland, it is fair to say you have not lived. The Mungalli Creek Dairy, established in 1920 and run since 1964 by the Watson family, is a biodynamic farm and manufacturing facility set against the backdrop of Queensland's highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere. I am reliably informed by one of my local regional newspapers, the Innisfail Advocate, that next year on 20 March—and mark that date now in your diaries—this world record attempt will be the highlight of the region's annual Feast of the Senses, a 10-day celebration of the region's food, culture and community in and around Innisfail, the Johnstone River and the Cassowary Coast.


The reason why I am bringing this novel concept to your attention is not only that I am a proud North Queenslander and always ready to sing the praises of that part of the world but also to pay tribute to the North's banana industry, which this year has faced some significant challenges. In March, the industry was devastated by news of an outbreak of the deadly soil disease Panama tropical race 4 on a Tully farm. A second outbreak on another farm soon followed, and this led to an immediate and sustained effort to contain the disease, which has the potential to wipe out the North Queensland banana industry. This is the same soil fungus which wiped out the Northern Territory's plantations nearly 20 years ago. Last month, a third outbreak was detected, and, whilst we all remain hopeful that the efforts of our ever-diligent biosecurity officers have kept it contained, it certainly has been a difficult and challenging year for our farmers.


Many of you may not realise that the value of the banana industry to Australia is around $600 million, with North Queensland banana farmers producing about 95 per cent of the country's production. Based on these figures, it should come as no surprise that the humble banana remains the country's single biggest horticulture industry. More than five million bananas are eaten every day, which equates to about 370,000 tonnes each year, or 28.6 million 13-kilogram cartons, and the industry employs some 10,000 people directly and indirectly. This makes the attempt to create the world's biggest banana split even sweeter. To lend support to an industry that contributes so much to our national economy, particularly in the North, by indulging in this world-record-breaking effort is a small price to pay.


In closing, I urge all senators to mark your diaries for 20 March 2016, a date which coincides with the 10th anniversary of another natural disaster which tore through the region, in the form of Cyclone Larry, an event which almost destroyed the industry, but the silver lining of which was a catalytic change in the way the industry operates. I invite you all, my Senate colleagues, to journey to North Queensland and to witness the unfolding of history in the making, when our region adds another feather to its cap, as the new home of the world's largest banana split. Bon appetit!
