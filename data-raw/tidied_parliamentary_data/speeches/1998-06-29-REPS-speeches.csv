"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the report of the committee entitled Deportation of non-citizen criminals , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—Over the past 18 months, the committee has been conducting a comprehensive review of criminal deportation arrangements, which are under the control of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, MP, and which are administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The committee found that the existing scheme was adequately managed, although aspects of the scheme should be strengthened to improve the protection afforded the Australian community. The committee has responded to the 58 submissions and over 300 pages of transcript evidence it received with recommendations to ensure that the criminal deportation scheme remains what parliament intended—a fair and 
 effective scheme protecting the community from further crimes by non-citizens.
For 15 years the current deportation scheme has sought to protect society from criminal non-citizens whose actions have demonstrated their unsuitability to remain part of the community. In that time, several developments have affected the operation of the scheme. Although the committee is convinced that the existing arrangements operate adequately, it nevertheless recommends strengthening the process to reflect the goal of protecting the community. The recommendations are based on evidence of a widespread consensus that aspects of the scheme should be modified and updated. The changes recommended, however, do not overturn the fundamental elements of the existing system.
The committee's 21 recommendations go to all areas of the existing scheme: refining the existing legal framework; suggesting amendments to the ministerial and departmental policies; and strengthening liaison between the department and state and territory agencies.
The major recommendations involve changes to the review arrangements to reflect the central role of the minister as the criminal deportation policy and decision maker; the statutory time limit on non-citizen liability to deportation to ensure serious crimes after 10 years residency can still be considered under the deportation arrangements; the information exchange with state and territory justice and prison agencies to ensure that each non-citizen prisoner is considered in a fair manner; and the ministerial deportation policy statement to specify all relevant community views and the weight to be given to those views. These changes will improve the balance between the sometimes competing objectives of the scheme, protecting the community against the risk of further criminal acts by non-citizens and ensuring that the rights of the non-citizen are taken into account.
The committee concludes that, subject to the changes recommended in the report, the criminal deportation scheme must continue. The absence of the power to deport non-citizens who commit crimes offensive to the wider community would strike at the heart of 
 community acceptance of Australia's migration programs. It is also important that non-citizens who have abused their residence in Australia by committing serious crime are not permitted to remain in Australia. The community has been served well by the existing arrangements but the revisions unanimously recommended by the committee will instil greater community confidence that the scheme operates effectively, efficiently and fairly to protect society.
My thanks go to all the members of the committee, especially the deputy chair, Senator Jim McKiernan, for their support throughout the inquiry. As chair, I appreciated the efforts of members from all political parties to achieve a consensus on the direction and scope of the changes necessary to strengthen the scheme. My thanks go to the secretariat staff: the original secretary, Andres Lomp; the interim secretary, Judy Middlebrook; and the current secretary, Margaret Swieringa, and her staff—in particular, Shane Holt, Gim Del Villar and Penne Humphries. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,2,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—This comprehensive report, Deportation of non-citizen criminals , was completed over an 18-month period by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. I congratulate all members of the Joint House and the secretariat on the preparation of a very worthwhile report.
The preparation of the report has been an important process which all parliamentarians should note with care. It is about effectively protecting our society from non-citizen, overseas, criminal influences. The committee found that we need to maintain policies on criminal non-citizens which are clear, unambiguous, consistent and transparent. As such, the committee believes that the existing scheme is adequately managed, although aspects of the scheme should be strengthened to improve the protection afforded the Australian community. The major concern is that the minister should have the power to control the program.
The committee received 58 submissions and took more than 300 transcript pages of oral evidence. It was clear to members of the 
 committee from that evidence that the Australian community wants to see a fair and effective scheme protecting our nation from criminal non-citizens.
Since the current scheme was established 15 years ago, there have been minor changes which affect the operation of the scheme and which, it may be argued, give concern to the community about the protection of our nation. I believe the most important change in the last 15 years has been the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as a review body, now having the right to overturn even decisions by the minister about deporting non-citizens.
The committee has come up with some important recommendations which I believe have successfully struggled with what are sometimes complex and competing objectives—how do we protect the Australian community against criminal elements who are non-citizens while at the same time uphold the rule of law and respect the rights of the non-citizen?
The 21 recommendations cover all aspects of the scheme, but the most important are those which maintain and strengthen our criminal deportation scheme. These recommendations include: firstly, the need to reflect the central role of the minister as the criminal deportation policy and decision maker; secondly, the statutory limit on non-citizen liability to deportation to ensure that serious crimes after 10 years of residency can still be considered under deportation arrangements; thirdly, the information exchange with state and territory justice and prison agencies to ensure that each non-citizen prisoner is considered in a fair manner; and, finally, the ministerial deportation policy statement to specify all relevant community views and the weight to be given to those views.
I congratulate the chair, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and the deputy chair, Senator McKiernan from Western Australia, on the hard work they have put into the report and thank the secretariat for assistance given to the committee.
In conclusion, I think this is a fair report, supported by all on the committee. It is about maintaining a fair and effective scheme. I urge all members of the House to consider 
 this report on merit, because it is about solutions and it is about strengthening complex arrangements concerning very difficult issues. We do not need further empty rhetoric from some sections of the backbench on a very complex issue. Let us make sure we deal with these issues in a proper way and that we put on the table reasonable proposals to strengthen the operation of the scheme. We should not attack it and suggest that it is really not carrying out an effective system of protecting Australia from criminals who are non-citizens. I commend the report to the House. I ask all members of the House to clearly consider it in the proper way and not look  for empty rhetoric and non-solutions.
—Does the member for Hindmarsh wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated later?
—I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.
—In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier this day, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—The purpose of the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998 is to entrench in legislation the existing administrative curfew at Adelaide airport. I have introduced this bill with the concurrence of the Howard government, on behalf of the residents in the suburbs surrounding Adelaide airport in my electorate of Hindmarsh.
The current administrative curfew has no legal standing. This bill will change that and give security to the residents who live near Adelaide airport. At present there is no guarantee that permission will not be given to large aircraft to fly into Adelaide when residents are trying to sleep at night. This legislation provides that guarantee.
Twenty-thousand Adelaide airport residents live next to the airport. It is incumbent on any government to ensure that, if they have allowed airports and houses to exist near each other, the residents must be protected from excessive noise. I have always maintained that it is unacceptable for residents to be woken during the night by aircraft noise. It is a fundamental right that people should be able to get a proper night's sleep; residents near an airport do not forfeit this right.
Under existing administrative arrangements, the minister has total discretion to grant a request by any air carrier to access the airport any time during curfew hours. Once this present legislation is in place, the minister will no longer have this discretion.
The current administrative arrangement designates the curfew from 11.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. However, exceptions have already been made and, as this bill seeks to reflect the current situation at Adelaide airport, these exemptions will remain. In 1993 the then Labor state and federal governments decided to allow exemption within the shoulder hours of the curfew for international passenger aircraft to come in over the sea. Since then such flights have been allowed to come in over land in poor meteorological conditions.
The legislation makes it clear that large domestic passenger aircraft do not have access to the curfew shoulder hours of 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to midnight, except in emergencies and other extraordinary situations. International passenger aircraft that have access to the curfew shoulder hours of 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to midnight must be the new generation of quieter jets; must not use reverse thrust greater than idle; and must come in over the sea unless meteorological conditions make the alternatives unsafe. This legislation strengthens the existing conditions so that, if a permitted international passenger aircraft comes in over the city in the curfew shoulder hours, its pilot will be required to document why it was necessary. It is well known that carriers and pilots dislike paperwork, and the requirement to document reasons for a different approach will effectively stop aircraft coming in over the land unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
Currently five international passenger flights per week are allowed into Adelaide airport during the curfew shoulder hours. The regulations limiting the number of international flights that can access Adelaide airport during the shoulder hours of the curfew will be published following the Governor-General's assent to the bill and will limit the number of flights to the current number of five.
As exists at present, freight and passenger aircraft below 34,000 kilograms will be able to use Adelaide airport during curfew hours. For heavy freight aircraft the bill contains two exemptions. This is to allow the continuation of the flights by the BAe146 and DC9 aircraft which currently use Adelaide airport during the curfew. The number of flights by heavy freight aircraft in the curfew period will be restricted by the legislation to eight flights per week, as is the present situation. Further, the number of flights by DC9 aircraft during curfew hours is limited to four, and there is a total exclusion of movements of B727 aircraft during curfew hours.
This legislation could not have been brought forward without the support of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and I wish to express my gratitude for his assistance in this 
 matter. On behalf of all residents affected by noise at Adelaide airport, I wish to express their gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) for his assistance. I would also like to acknowledge that the state government has played a constructive role in getting the curfew legislated. After initial objections to a legislated curfew, Premier John Olsen has supported the bill in the interests of the health and quality of life of residents who live near the airport. While a legislative curfew will place some restriction on the owners of the airport, they have recognised the need for the curfew and, in the interests of good relations with their neighbours, have supported the placing of the curfew in legislation. I commend the bill to the House. I seek leave to present the explanatory memorandum.
Leave granted.
Bill read a first time.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-06-29,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes with concern the plight of Australian pork producers;
(2)	 calls for an inquiry into the structures, marketing, domestic pricing and exporting of pork;
(3)	 draws the attention of government to the need for an efficient and effective dedicated pork abattoir and processing sector; and
(4)	 in commending the Government for industry aid given thus far, seeks access to sustenance and carry-on finance for farmers experiencing economic hardship during this period of adjustment.)
Let me be blunt: I do not accept the conventional wisdom on the pork industry. By `conventional wisdom' I mean that which holds that there is nothing government can do to ease the plight of pork producers without damaging Australia's interests. As a cog in the wheel that helped form the very successful 
 Monto Pork Enterprises, a cooperative in Monto near Bundaberg in my electorate, and having followed it closely since, I have a very good understanding of the pork industry and the problems facing it.
Clearly, there is much more that can be done to help producers in this industry. The first step we must take is to place on record in this parliament our genuine concern for ordinary Australians at a time of immense difficulty for their industry. That is the first point of our motion. In commending the government for its assistance to the industry thus far—a total of $19 million—I think it is a good start but there must be a greater focus on people not just on exports. I believe we can go a lot further. Direct financial assistance to pork producers is an absolute necessity. That can be delivered under the rural adjustment scheme—and I do not accept the RASAC recommendation—or under a special program that could be dubbed the pork industry assistance package. I do not agree that this would create a precedent.
The pork industry differs from other rural enterprises in that you prepare a beast for a particular window of opportunity and, if you miss that window of opportunity, you cannot put the animal in the back paddock for six or 12 months, as might be the case with other livestock. You either hit the market during the window of opportunity or you might as well start shooting the pigs, because feed bills are enormous and, once a piggery starts to slide, the momentum gathers quickly. The banks are not patient. Too many families have invested substantial amounts of money, sometimes hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars. Their futures, livelihoods, family security and the education of their children are all under immediate threat. This is not some idle thing. The end of the financial year is tomorrow.
It staggers me that we accept blithely on both sides of the House that all male average weekly earnings translated into an annual figure come to $37,000, but we expect Australian farmers to survive on $11,000 or $12,000 a year. What makes it even worse is when you expect people in an industry like this in a negative income circumstance to be 
 offered no aid at all. I think that has to be reversed. That is very much the essence of the fourth point of my motion. It is well and good to ask people to adopt world's best practice, as Monto producers have, and it is well and good to ask them to perform a highwire act competing on a level playing field with the rest of the world, but what people in this country expect is that there will be a safety net, especially when an industry is doing the right thing and is knocked off its perch because of factors beyond its control.
The pork industry is slowly shrugging off its role as a domestic supplier and is nearly ready to join the throng of successful Australian exporters. In fact, it has done so quite successfully with small quantities. There is a major impediment to this, and that is the lack of capacity and efficiency and standards in our abattoir and processing sector. Government needs to kick-start this sector of the industry urgently if exports are to be the hope of the pork industry and we are to compete effectively on the world stage. It may be that the whole structure of the industry needs to be changed to reflect the 3,300 producers of 1998, not the 49,000 of 1960.
A review with recommendations in this regard would be invaluable in mapping the future of the industry. I do not mean an inquiry that drags on for a year or more but something over a matter of months. It is apparent, when farmers are receiving $1.40 a kilogram and the end product appears on the supermarket shelves at $14 a kilogram, that the retail sector needs close scrutiny. For that reason I think it is timely and I call for the ACCC to be directed to look closely at the retail sector to ensure there is no opportunistic profiteering or predatory pricing.
Monto Pork Enterprise producers, who met with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on Thursday night with me in Kingaroy, and coming from Biloela, Monto and the Burnett, have been actively looking at positive solutions throughout this difficult time for their industry, unlike some industry members.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—It is important that the government support this private member's motion as there are some real concerns out in the pork producing regional areas. I am assuming it is pork the honourable member from Hinkler (Mr Neville) was talking about. In the motion I received mixed messages on pork and then pickled pork that he was perhaps talking about.
I agree with the general terms of the review of the industry, provided that it can take place quickly. Our industry in Tasmania is already in its death throes. Over the weekend we were advised that the 25-year-old pig cooperative was closed in Tasmania with the loss of at least six jobs. The reason given was the dramatic decrease of market share in recent years. Tasmania's pig herd carried 10,000 sows over 10 years ago. At the start of this year there were still 2,500 sows in the state, but that number is expected to drop by another 750 by the end of the year. We are looking at a situation where about one-third of the industry in Tasmania has gone broke this year.
Pork producers in Tasmania believe that the reason behind this demise is subsidised pork imports from Canada at rock bottom prices. This in turn has pushed Victorian pig meat onto the Tasmanian markets at prices that local growers cannot match. The other problem with the Tasmanian situation is that there are fewer butchers and smaller processors, with the majority of meat being handled by the supermarket chains and with the same number of wholesalers chasing the markets.
The part of the motion I cannot agree with is that the government has dealt with this issue satisfactorily. Some may remember that, at the end of 1995, the then Labor government had just about signed off on labelling legislation and looked at really developing this industry. The current government came along and dismantled everything that we had done. This government came in too late. It put in some aid. It really was a bit of a bandaid for this industry when it should have been dealing with the industry in a better and 
 more substantial way. They did not really deal with the problem until it was too late.
We cannot, nor should we, simplify this issue by merely saying that bringing back tariffs will solve the problem, that we should protect our industry at the expense of exports. If we did, Australia would not survive economically; we would become a mendicant country to the World Bank. But, on the other hand, nor do we have to be at the very forefront of removing trade barriers. Australia should work within its means under the World Trade Organisation. Australia has the ability to set its own barriers against others where other countries are setting theirs. We do not have to be out there in front leading the charge. And we should do that in a positive way.
We have also to be careful about how we trade off, for example, beef against pork or a pristine water environment against imported salmon. Those sorts of issues worry me greatly, and I think I have spoken of them before, where smaller industries and fledgling industries, especially in regions, start to get pushed down because trade ministers—and I am not having a go at our Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) at the moment—may not have the big industries on their agenda when they are talking to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Nor may our negotiators when they are in negotiations dealing with the export industries. There are hundreds of examples which one could put up in relation to that.
We have to be conscious of dumping and the health risks to our own industries. Trade should not be detrimental to the country. However, we do have to become more competitive. We have to help our producers become better. Our growers need to get together and set their goals for the industry. We need to have strategies in place to deal with wholesalers and the bigger players in the industries so that the individual grower can get top price for their best meat regardless of whom they sell it to.
Now that this has been done, it is best left to the growers and their representative organisations. Parliamentarians are not farmers, although one or two may be ex-farmers. It is 
 not our role to set the vision; our role is to help our constituents achieve their goals. The politicians can help facilitate, help raise the funds for research, help the ongoing development of the market and look to help the export situation, but it is up the industry to pull itself up by its bootstraps.

"Reid, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—I wish to support the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). I understand the motion will also be supported by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). I also want to register the strong interest of my colleagues the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and the member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) in this motion also, because they have pork industry interests in their own electorates, as I do in the seat of Bendigo.
The pork industry has a very prominent place in the Bendigo electorate. We have Bunge industries, which runs a big production facility in the area. We also have Castle Bacon at Castlemaine, and Ridley, the stock food providers for most of north central Victoria, providing rations to the pork and poultry industries. We also have a very high-tech company called Ausvac which provides vaccine for the pork industry. It is very prominent not only in the national pork industry but also in international terms in providing vaccines for the protection of the pork industry. No doubt there are also a large number of pork producers in Bendigo, Ballarat and McEwen. At the moment, the industry certainly is in desperate trouble.
I agree wholeheartedly with the honourable member for Hinkler's call for an inquiry into the structures, the marketing, the domestic pricing and the exporting of pork. It would appear from the work I have done and discussions I have had with the Pork Council of Australia that there are a number of problems in the pork industry, not all of which relate to the importation of pork. Some of them may well be to do with the marketing and exporting of pork, and the lack of an adequate export market. I understand that they are making strenuous efforts to develop their export markets into countries like Japan, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Korea. I encourage 
 them in this. I think it helps the industry to have not only sound domestic production and a sound market but also a very vigorous export market.
The interesting part is that a number of piggeries in my electorate are expanding. The City of Greater Bendigo recently approved an expansion of one piggery at Bagshot from 4,800 to 7,200 pigs. Also, in Loddon Shire, just to the north of me, the council has just approved a new piggery holding 2,500 pigs. So there are some different signals coming from the industry. Some are expanding and others are feeling enormous pressure. I can understand Mr Neville's comments about the family farm, particularly if people are trying to produce pork and run smaller piggeries with the sort of pressure they are under at this time.
There are a number of factors. It simply does not just relate to pork being imported. The government is recognising the difficulties of the pork industry. Back in November 1979 we implemented a package of $10 million. That was followed recently by a further $9 million of support into the pork industry. As the member for Hinkler indicated, this can be done under the rural adjustment scheme but I would like to say, particularly to the ministers and to the government, that we should move ahead with this inquiry, do it quickly and find out what the reasons are behind the difficulties being experienced by the pork industry.
It is a very important industry for a wide area of Australia, not only my electorate—and I am speaking about that today. Certainly it covers a lot of different areas. My electorate is quite different from that of the member for Grey, who is going to follow me shortly. No doubt, many grain growing areas see the production of pork as a very good adjunct to their activities in the grain industry. This is important but it is particularly important that the export markets be developed in the future.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—Just over 2½ years ago the Australian Labor Party was comprehensively defeated at a federal election. There is no doubt in my mind that the single greatest contributor to 
 that defeat was change fatigue. In many ways the Australian community has experienced more change over the last 15 years than it did in the 30-year period prior to that. Technological change, better and more efficient transport, and the mobility of international capital have thrust change upon us. As a nation we have had two choices: we could adapt to change and position ourselves to secure the maximum possible benefit or we could resist change, isolate ourselves from the rest of the world and deny our export industries opportunities and the jobs that go with them.
Of course, option one was never an option at all. The real challenge for government over that period has been to manage that change effectively and efficiently to make sure that as a nation we derive the maximum possible benefit from change. Also, we have needed to ensure the pace of change was correct and that those who were potentially adversely impacted upon by that change were taken care of. In the modern economy, governments have few of the traditional macro-economic tools available to them. Fiscal policy and the discipline placed upon it by a more internationalised economy give us very little room to move. The government basically has jettisoned wages policy with the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act, and monetary policy is done pretty well independently by the Reserve Bank.
So the government report card in the future, as has been the case in the last 10 years, will feature that government's ability to manage change. I think the Hawke-Keating government managed change pretty well. It got a few things wrong; indeed, it got plenty of things wrong. That demonstrates best why the electorate shifted so markedly at the last federal election. They were looking for something better but, in my view, they found something worse. That best explains the rise of One Nation. People are still concerned about their security and the level of that concern can best be found in the pork industry at the moment.
On that basis I support the motion put forward by the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), but like the member for Lyons (Mr 
 Adams) I think a much more aggressive approach can be taken. I think we as a nation should be invoking every opportunity available to us under the GATT rules to take the maximum possible advantage of this new internationalisation. Out there in the electorate, `globalisation' is a dirty word. Governments need to sell change better, explain themselves better and at the international negotiation table be much tougher.
As with chicken meat imports, where we had available to us legitimate quarantine rules to allow us to proceed cautiously, in the pork industry we have legitimate opportunities to put in place temporary tariffs to assist this industry. This option must be taken. It is no good telling pork producers that they must just wear it on the chin for the benefit of another industry; they need to be told why they have to take their produce to the market and sell it for less than what it costs them to produce it. Governments must be far more aggressive. Pork producers, chicken producers and so many others deserve nothing less.
Sure I support the member for Hinkler's motion, but it does not go far enough. It is time the government took the issue on, listened to what people were saying in the electorate and went to that negotiation table with a far more aggressive approach. If it is not prepared to do that, I can promise that we will see again the shift we saw in the electorate at the last election but next time the shift will be back the other way, to the Australian Labor Party. I am confident of that because the Labor Party will be offering the only alternative available to the Australian electorate.

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—There are very few things in life that are more frustrating and depressing than selling a product below the cost of production. The previous speaker, the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), spoke about change fatigue. I went into the pig industry in a very modest way in 1970. The number of sows in the industry peaked at 460,000 and three years later, in 1975, the number had dropped to just under 311,000. So in three years when I was in the pig industry the number of sows actually fell by around a third.
That was a very dramatic time. Too many times have I sent off the property mutton, prime young hogget and lambs for below the cost of production. It is never an easy time. So I can express a very genuine concern for those families that are in the pork industry that are going through these times now.
I want to bring to the discussion the actual figures for import, export, domestic consumption and domestic production. My understanding is that domestic production currently is around 350,000 tonnes. In the last 12 months we have seen something like a 20,000-tonne decline in domestic consumption. If you look at the import-export amount, you will see that exports have actually doubled from April 1996 to April 1998—from about 6,500 tonnes up to in excess of 13,000 tonnes. At the same time imports—I understand predominantly from Canada—have gone from something like 4,000 tonnes in May 1996 to 9,500 tonnes in May 1998. So we have about three or four per cent of that import component of the total domestic consumption at the same time as we have doubled the amount in exports. I think it is quite important that we get those facts on the table.
South Australia is doubly affected by these very serious downturns in that, as I understand it, there is not a very strong processing industry there. I know that the South Australian government is absolutely determined to see a major development in that area and I look forward to that coming on-stream. The government has been caught with this very difficult situation and I do not underestimate the difficulty. It has done all that it can do as far as the labelling laws go—and I understand they are in the Senate. I can only endorse the comments of the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) on the ACCC. Have we got to the stage in this country where certain operators are enjoying, if not monopoly practices, certainly practices which give a market dominance which may not be giving people a fair go?
Another issue that has not been touched on in this discussion is the degree of protection which may be available to our importers. I always want to be thoroughly reassured— 
 more reassured than I am currently—that those who export into our country, importers, are genuinely playing the game. I agree with the previous speaker that we have to be absolutely reassured that there is a genuine no protection, no subsidy operation for those people who want to export into our country.
In conclusion, I believe we should be very sympathetic to our pig producers at a very difficult time and at the very least we should be looking at our income support program to see whether, through the state agencies, that can be given to those people, particularly if the majority of their income is coming from the pig industry, so they can be given greater sustenance.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—Last Friday, I attended a meeting in my electorate of Greenway of the Doonside Estate Resident Safety and Action Coalition. The coalition is devoted to ensuring a good quality of life for residents of the area. The report by the President, Warren Hardy, to this meeting indicated the role of the coalition. Reference was made to the police department's role in conducting a safety audit and the response to the safety house program, the efforts of the Department of Housing in locating areas for the introduction of parks and gardens where children and parents can spend some time and the Blacktown Council's role in a local clean-up campaign. This is a community project with the Blacktown Council providing equipment such as lawn-mowers to enable the residents to complete the project.
The coalition aims to set up four working parties to address the various projects that have been identified as areas of concern to the Doonside community. These four working parties relate to the community safety audit, 
 the community pride program, the safety house program and the neighbourhood watch program.
I would like to congratulate the President, Warren Hardy, the Secretary, Val Moorehouse, and the DERSAC committee on the wonderful work they are performing on behalf of the residents of Doonside.
It is intended that the community safety audit will have representatives from the police, housing, council and Integral Energy. There will also be two representatives from DERSAC and one from the general public. The aim of this audit is to identify all the problem areas around Doonside and establish who is responsible for having these problems solved. The community pride program has been set up to increase community  pride within the Doonside Estate.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that the Hon. Helen Sham-Ho MLC has resigned from the Liberal Party and is contesting the presidency of the New South Wales Legislative Council because:
Certain members of the Liberal Party have advised that my candidature cannot be supported by the Liberal Party because it would offend One Nation supporters.
Are you aware that she is further concerned that these
. . . remarks follow the debacle in Queensland where Liberal preferences elected One Nation candidates?
Are you further aware that she says:
Only the ALP has shown it truly believes in equality for all Australians.
Will you now, in the light of this action, finally determine that all Liberal Party divisions and the National Party follow Labor's lead and put One Nation last?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>One Nation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—I am aware of the remarks made by Mrs Sham-Ho. It is a very strange stance to take, given that only last Friday night the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party to which Mrs Sham-Ho belongs unanimously resolved to place One Nation last on every how-to-vote card in the forthcoming federal election.
Any suggestion that Mrs Sham-Ho would not have been chosen as the opposition's candidate for the vacant speakership in New South Wales on account of the attitude of 
 another party, I find quite astonishing. Of course, it is entirely a matter for the New South Wales parliamentary party. It is not a matter on which I have been consulted or would expect to be consulted or indeed wish to be consulted. It is a vacancy which, as everybody knows, arose rather suddenly and unexpectedly.
In the brief time that I have had to look at the news reports and assess the situation, I think the principal reason Mrs Sham-Ho has resigned and is contesting the position from the cross benches is that she thinks she has a better chance of winning through doing that. It is rather disappointing, even verging on the ungracious, for somebody who has had great loyalty from the Liberal Party for a long period of time to seek to raise the matters that she has raised.
I do not think for a moment that the allegations she has made have any foundation at all. I quite believe that the New South Wales coalition has chosen somebody else as its candidate and that is the reason she has resigned—and there is no other reason.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>One Nation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1998-06-29,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives: 

(1)	 welcomes the statement on 1 June 1998 by Indonesian Justice Minister Mulyadi that the Indonesian Government will consider an investigation into the circumstances of the deaths of 6 Australian based journalists in East Timor in 1975;
(2)	 welcomes news of the possible release of up to 12 East Timorese political prisoners by the Government of Indonesia;
(3)	 notes that the UK Minister of State at the Foreign Office, Mr Derek Fatchett, acting as Prime Minister Tony Blair's special emissary, recently met with jailed East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao and called for his release; and
(4)	 requests that the Government of Indonesia give serious consideration to the release of Xanana Gusmao, noting that this would be a vital confidence building measure that could be an important step leading to a peaceful resolution of the East Timor conflict.
The situation in Indonesia is changing almost daily and, indeed, since this motion was drafted there have been substantial changes in the positions of the major players in the East Timor issue. I do indeed welcome statements from Indonesian Justice Minister Mulyadi that his government will consider an investigation into the deaths of the six Australian newsmen during the Indonesian invasion of the Portuguese province in 1975 and subsequently.
According to information from the office of our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), Mr Mulyadi is understood to have said that he would have to clarify the sort of investigation after seeking information from the head of the armed forces. According to information on the public record, the captain of the Indonesian Red Beret commandoes who led the Indonesian assault on Balibo on Thursday, 16 October 1975 when five newsmen died was Yunus Yosfiah, later promoted to general and now a member of President Habibie's new ministry. I register my concern that any promise of an inquiry into these killings may mean little if the brotherhood of the Indonesian military gets in the way of a truly honest attempt to bring to justice the perpetrators of this war crime.
Indonesia owes a full and frank explanation to the relatives of Brian Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Gary Cunningham, Greg Shackleton and Tony Stewart who died at Balibo, and Roger East who died in Dili. They owe it to 
 the world, just as we all owe the victims of the Santa Cruz massacre and those 100,000 to 200,000 other victims of this 23-year-old war a peaceful and just resolution to their struggle.
Having said that, I sincerely welcome President Habibie's apparent willingness to open a new dialogue on the East Timor conflict and his gesture of sincerity by the release of 15 East Timorese political prisoners. However, at last count there were something like 140 such prisoners. I note weekend press reports of comments by Xanana Gusmao, the gaoled East Timorese leader, who suggests he could serve his country better by remaining in detention. He also says a referendum for self-determination in East Timor could occur in five to 10 years.
With the forbearance and courage of a Nelson Mandela, Gusmao says, `Be patient, the wind has already changed direction.' And so it has. But how confident can we be that the tenure of President Habibie will last five years? How accommodating will the Indonesian military be in this post-Suharto Indonesia?
We must never forget that up to 200,000 East Timorese have perished in this conflict. We must never forget the regime that perpetrated these crimes, including the torture and violation of human rights. It is one thing to withdraw some troops in the short term, it is another to offer real hope to the 800,000 East Timorese. That can only come through a referendum or, at the very least, a non-binding plebiscite as a first step with its results determining a program for East Timor's future status.
The Catholic Archbishop of Dili, Carlos Belo, has suggested a transitional solution along the lines suggested by President Habibie where East Timor is given special status within the Indonesian republic, but with an act of self-determination and a vote on independence within 10 to 15 years. Australia has a vital role to play in this, being the only country in the world to recognise Indonesia's unlawful annexation of the former Portuguese colony. Australia can now redeem itself in the eyes of the Free World by assisting Indonesia and East Timor along this difficult path.
After the Asian economic crash Australia achieved added status in the region. It has provided help through the IMF and its credibility as a good and caring Asian neighbour must be greatly enhanced, despite my reservations on the record of this House about the way this funding was approved without any debate. Nevertheless, we have a golden opportunity to take a proactive role in brokering a fair and humane outcome to what has been a very black blot on our foreign affairs record. Let us never forget the assistance the East Timorese gave our troops when sheltering them from the enemy during World War II. One digger, Cliff Morris, said recently, `They gave me my life.'
It is time Indonesia and Australia put aside their fears of instability from some independent or quasi-independent state on their borders or set aside their greed over access to Timor Gap resources and offered these brave people a say in their own future. That future may well be, with goodwill of the sort displayed by President Habibie—and I think all Australians welcome his very proactive and positive stance—integration with Indonesia while retaining some special status. That may be the choice. It also might be independence, but they must be given the choice. I commend this motion to the House. (Time expired)

"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—I am pleased to speak to this motion, and I have to say that I support the comments of the member for Calare (Mr Andren).	 It seems to me that we have a unique opportunity at this time to influence events in Indonesia generally, and particularly perhaps have some influence on what is a festering sore—the situation in East Timor. Therefore, I am pleased to see the member for Calare introduce this motion into the chamber at this time and to encourage the government, which has already been doing a fair amount, to do more to try to influence the outcome.
Obviously the previous speaker and I read some of the same newspaper articles at the weekend. I notice that Mr Gusmao also talked 
 about the fact that, from his point of view, it is not just a question of wanting independence—although that is his private view. He also accepts that, if there were a referendum and the people of East Timor chose to be integrated in some shape or form or to look at some form of local autonomy, that is something which he is prepared to  live with.
It seems that we have recently had an outstanding example of how quite difficult, long-running situations in the world can be resolved by people talking. I refer, of course, to the situation in Northern Ireland, where the result of the bloodshed, the history and the acrimony over a great many years has been a quite appalling tragedy. We have seen, in the last few days, democratic elections in Northern Ireland and, hopefully, Northern Ireland will now go from strength to strength. Similarly, I am very encouraged by this motion which is about encouraging the Indonesians to move in the same direction.
We have seen discussions with Archbishop Belo and we have seen a new direction from the new president in Indonesia, President Habibie. If the parties concerned can get together and talk and if Australia can use some of its newfound influence in the area to encourage a resolution of the East Timor situation, I think we will, indeed, make headway.
It is obviously of concern that, when we hear things in the media, they be accurately reported. I sometimes worry that the things we read in the media raise hopes when there really should not be or that they do not tell us the true situation. The reported comments of Justice Minister Mulyadi have, I think, been somewhat overstated. My understanding of what he said is that he does not have much information about the case we are talking about—the Australian media people who were killed. He expressed a willingness for the incident to be investigated and noted that Indonesia would have to clarify the position in terms of international confidence. It worries me that he might only want the incident to be clarified in terms of international confidence rather than investigating it and doing something about it in its own right as an issue. Perhaps we really do need to apply a bit more 
 pressure there to make sure things are done for the right reasons rather than just for international PR.
With regard to what sort of investigation there would be, Minister Mulyadi went on to say that he would have to clarify this with the head of the armed forces and seek information from him. Again, I think I would support the position of the member for Calare in saying that one is nervous about the armed forces. The perception is that there may be some changes under way, but history bodes badly in this regard and so one needs to treat these sorts of statements with some caution.
On 3 June, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas referred publicly to the Justice Minister's comments on an investigation into the deaths of the Australian based journalists. When asked about it, Minister Alatas reportedly said that Justice Minister Mulyadi's comments were not reported in their full context. Minister Mulyadi had indicated that, if there is strong legal evidence, the case would be reconsidered.
It seems to me that there are a few doubts and perhaps they were just a few words having it each way that should not make us too enthusiastic that things will finally be sorted out. Hopefully they will be. But I think there are indications that the government needs to continue to apply pressure, as it has been—subsequent speakers will, I am sure, refer to this—for a great period of time. Particularly at this juncture in Indonesia's history, I think we have a unique opportunity to apply more pressure in terms of the investigation into the deaths of our journalists who were killed there and undertake support for East Timor.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—As a person who had a deep interest in this matter long before I entered this House, I express pleasure in being involved in the motion. The situation has been summarised by a number of previous speakers. The reality is that the essential outcome of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor was the death of 200,000 people. That is not a figure invented by activists on this matter; it is not a figure constructed by proponents of the Timorese 
 cause. It is the figure that the federal parliament's foreign affairs committee has adopted on the basis of evidence and in particular from census statistics before the Indonesian occupation.
Two hundred thousand people were starved or shot or died in some other way as an outcome of their forced relocation. To some degree people might say it was unavoidable because of our geographic location but Australia, unfortunately, has not played the best role in this matter. Despite the deaths of Roger Easson and the six Australian journalists, Australia—alone in the world—has given de jure recognition to Indonesia. Whilst Indonesia has been able on occasion to avoid resolutions in international fora that are very critical of it and despite the way in which a number of Islamic countries have put religion first in supporting the Indonesians, the fact of political life, the fact of international diplomacy, is that the lone country that has recognised this occupation is Australia. Whilst I do not think that the Second World War's events should necessarily dictate policies in the 1990s, this is ironic because of the support given by the Timorese to Australian causes during that conflict.
I want to put on record my appreciation of groups like the East Timor Human Rights Centre, which today has forwarded to me a document which itemises the people who are being incarcerated for political opposition to this regime in regard to Timor. On their estimates they note that 141 people are still being held as prisoners in regard to this matter, some of them since 1991.
There have been gestures by the Indonesian authorities. There has been the release of some individuals associated with this cause. But all of them should be released. In particular, Xanana Gusmao should be released without any conditions. There should not be a requirement that he admit his guilt in resisting the Indonesian authorities. There should not be a requirement that he adhere to any particular solution that Indonesia desires.
It is important that Indonesia actively associate itself with a number of human rights conventions. Amongst those that Indonesia should sign are the Convention Against 
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The time is certainly now for the Indonesian authorities to press beyond the minimal reforms that have occurred in the last few weeks. It is time they repudiated the use of torture. It is time they put their name to these international conventions. It is time they associated themselves with the human rights principles that this country adheres to.
Parallel with this is the future of the country, and, whilst Australia has given de jure recognition, the Indonesian authorities should consider the rest of the world's views on this matter. The United Nations has never recognised their occupation of the country. The United Nations has certainly given them no comfort in its analysis of what happened since 1979, when Indonesian forces, under the pretext of supposed civil war or internal civil dissent, intervened in the military sense.
There has to be a recognition by the Indonesians that the time is over when they can be protected by the ASEAN countries on a policy of non-interference in internal matters. The time is over when they can avoid giving the Timorese people some say by way of plebiscite. Whether it comes at a certain point after giving it special status is a point not to be debated.

"Dondas, Nick, MP",CLP,1998-06-29,"—I rise to speak on this motion brought before the parliament by the member for Calare (Mr Andren) at a time of great change in Indonesia's political and economic structure. I would say to the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) that this is probably the best chance in 25 years that the East Timorese have had for a lot more say in what is happening within their own community.
Indonesia's proximity to the Northern Territory means that events there impact on the social and economic life of many Territorians. Many Territorians have family and business connections in East Timor and in 
 Indonesia. I can remember quite well—it was just after cyclone Tracy—that a lot of people from East Timor came as refugees to the Northern Territory and to other parts of Australia. I understand that the Australian government is using the opportunity presented by the significant political change in Indonesia to urge the Indonesian government to make some progress on the issue of East Timor. I believe it is very important that they use this opportunity to start a dialogue with all parties concerned about the future of East Timor.
I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) has said in this place that the Australian government is of the view that the military presence in East Timor should be reduced and that the people of East Timor should have a greater say in the management of their own affairs. The Minister is working to urge the Indonesian government to make the sorts of changes Australians would like to see. However, while we can express our opinions and outline our concerns to foreign governments, there is little we can do to force another country to undertake reforms. This is a matter for the Indonesian government and the people.
I am heartened by the announcement by President Habibie of the introduction of a five-year plan to revamp Indonesia's human rights processes. This action plan will include an education process for government officials in dealing with the rights of individuals. The plan has four components: the ratification of human rights agreements, the dissemination of information and education on human rights, measures to address human rights issues determined as national priorities and the implementation of ratified international human rights agreements. The Indonesian government has pledged to protect all citizens regardless of their race, ethnicity, language, religion or political persuasion. This is a positive step and we will be watching these developments closely.
Bishop Belo has recently stated that he believes the Indonesian government will gradually withdraw the troops in East Timor. His discussions with President Habibie have led Bishop Belo to believe that reform is 
 possible in the territory. I hope he is right. Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, has stated that Indonesia may be prepared to offer East Timor special status in an attempt to resolve the problems. The Indonesian government is prepared to enter discussions with United Nations negotiators to formulate a system of autonomy for the region.
I welcome the recent release of political prisoners by President Habibie and I am hopeful that this will continue. I understand that 15 prisoners have been released in recent weeks. I am also aware that President Habibie is carefully considering the future of other well-known East Timorese political prisoners, including Xanana Gusmao. The Australian government would welcome the release of Xanana Gusmao and other activists as a step towards the resolution of the East Timor issue. However, I understand that this may be conditional on discussions relating to political freedoms being extended to the East Timorese. I note the scepticism of many East Timorese activists of the sincerity of the Indonesian government's proposals. However, as I said in my opening statement, I think this is the best chance that any of them have had in the last 25 years.
I would like to point out that I believe the Indonesian government is seriously addressing the issue of the future of East Timor and I look forward to a result in the near future that satisfies all parties. The fact that these reforms have come only one month after President Habibie took over in Indonesia leaves me optimistic about the future of human rights in that country. Like the member for Calare, I also welcome the decision by the Indonesian government to consider an investigation into the deaths of the five journalists in East Timor in 1975, announced by Justice Minister Muladi on 1 June 1998. This has always been a bone of contention in the relationship between Australia and Indonesia and I hope that, with the support of the Indonesian government, we will be able to find out what really happened all those years ago.
In conclusion, I commend the member for Calare for bringing this matter before the parliament at such an important time in 
 Indonesia's political history. I am optimistic about progress and will be watching developments with interest.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>East Timor</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—Like the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) and a number of other members in this place, I have had a fairly long involvement in the question of East Timor—going back in my case as far as 1975. My involvement ranged across a number of activities including participation in political activities and demonstrations and, more recently, speaking at those demonstrations. I also have the privilege to represent quite a substantial East Timorese population, as does the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas), who has just spoken. One of the key things that I have said recently when I have spoken at demonstrations is that the solution ultimately to the East Timorese question would come as a result of change within Indonesia. I note that there are a number of people in the gallery who have been activists in the East Timorese cause and who would have been at some of those demonstrations. In some respects it looks likely that my words are being proven true quicker than even I anticipated. We are seeing events beginning to unfold which I believe will eventually lead to what is clearly necessary and what has always been necessary in the East Timorese question and that is a genuine act of self-determination on the part of the East Timorese people. I applaud the efforts over so many years of the people who have kept alive the battle for justice for the East Timorese in this country and elsewhere—some of whom, as I said, are present in the gallery today.
On this issue we in Australia are indeed prisoners of our history; prisoners of the fact that when the invasion of East Timor occurred in December 1975 we were in the midst of a constitutional crisis and an election campaign and, unfortunately, effectively did nothing to avert that invasion. We are prisoners of the fact that we gave de jure recognition to the Indonesian conquest in 1978, signed the Timor Gap Treaty over East Timorese oil in the late 1980s and continued to provide military training for Indonesian officers. We are still seeing substantial human rights 
 abuses in East Timor even today. Just recently we have seen another person die. I commend to honourable members the East Timor Human Rights Centre report that has just been circulated, which indicates how these problems continue to this day.
We now, however, do have a historic opportunity to finally do something to address this issue. It is very important that Australia play a major role in ensuring that there is a just resolution to the East Timor question. President Habibie, the new President of Indonesia, has released some prisoners and there is now a genuine and open debate occurring in Indonesia on human rights issues and the nature of a future Indonesian democracy. There is clearly a new mood afoot in Indonesia which we should capitalise on and continue to remind them that Indonesia will not be able to stand proud amongst the nations of the world as a genuinely just and democratic nation until it resolves the East Timor question.
This requires them first to release Xanana Gusmao unconditionally and to undertake serious negotiations with him and other leaders of the East Timorese people, such as Bishop Belo, on the question of the future status of East Timor. It is the Labor Party's position and my position that we do not believe that a resolution of this issue is likely to be possible without some form of genuine self-determination, which should have occurred back in the mid-1970s and needs to occur as soon as possible to allow final and full resolution of the issue. It may well be that we see some form of association with Indonesia emerge as a result of a genuine act of self-determination and negotiation by East Timorese leaders that leaves East Timor less than fully independent, for a range of reasons. That is entirely a matter for the East Timorese people.
I note with some concern that recently we have seen the emergence of supposed pro-integration, pro-Indonesian forces on the streets in Dili engaged in potential conflict with pro-independence forces. It is interesting to see that development. It is disturbing and I would ask questions about the precise 
 origins of these forces and what their agenda actually is.
Australia should be involved in putting substantial pressure on Indonesia now that the opportunity has arisen to release Xanana Gusmao and engage in serious dialogue and negotiations about a final conclusion to this very sad and sorry affair in our region. Australia should be putting pressure on Indonesia to withdraw its troops to allow the East Timorese people to take a much more substantial interim role in their own governance, their own activities and their own economic development. Australia should ensure that some strategy for reconciliation be pursued which does at least create the possibility that alternatives of association and some degree of friendship can be there for the future, rather than prolonged enmity, hatred and bitterness, which clearly have very substantial reasons for existing. Australia is very well positioned to correct its previous mistakes and to put pressure on Indonesia to finally give justice to the people of East Timor.

"Taylor, Bill, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—First of all, let me commend the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) for his motion before the House today. It is a commendable motion. Like everybody else in this place, I welcome the strong bipartisan nature of this debate on the points that he has made in that motion.
I do not think anybody either in this place or the other  place or anybody involved in the political spectrum in Australia welcomes what happened two decades ago in East Timor. Nevertheless, it is now part of sovereign Indonesia and it is for the Indonesians and the East Timorese to solve the problem. Australia can apply pressures, and there is no doubt that East Timor is a deeply divided and troubled place.
The bipartisan nature of this debate, of course, strengthens Australia's approach to the bilateral relationship with Indonesia. Here is an opportunity—as indeed has happened from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) down—to make sure that the East Timorese have the ability and the wherewithal to make their case. It is very pleasing to consider—as indicated in this motion—what, in fact, is 
 possible in the coming months as a result of a change of administration in Jakarta.
A satisfactory resolution of the problems will require dialogue not only with the government in Jakarta but also amongst the East Timorese themselves. The Australian government does not think that there are simplistic solutions to this problem; it is a delicate, very complex situation. Nevertheless, it is something that we should not shy away from and we should provide the appropriate support we can as a nation in our bilateral relationship with Indonesia.
We have made it very clear that the strength of that bilateral relationship includes the ability of Australia from time to time to be critical of the Republic of Indonesia on some of these issues. There is no doubt that is what this government—from the foreign minister down—has done, and I have to say that in the previous administration there were criticisms made as well. The strength of our bilateral relationship is the degree to which we have the ability to objectively criticise things that are abhorrent to everybody, irrespective of the sovereign country to which one belongs.
The Australian government particularly welcomes the discussions between President Habibie and Bishop Belo and agrees that these talks hopefully will lead to resolution of the issues in East Timor. I have to agree with the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) who drew attention to Minister Muladi's comments and put a caveat on what he had to say about strong legal evidence. I do not want to start the hares running and to put a stopper on anything that might happen, but I think we have to be realistic about this and understand that there is a lot of groundwork to be done before substantive progress can be made.
The Australian government has continuously argued for a reduction in the military presence in East Timor. It is pleasing, of course, that the President has indicated that he is prepared to reduce the number of troops in East Timor and  indeed to explore avenues of greater autonomy in that particular region. I am very pleased to provide support to the commendable motion of the honourable member for Calare. Let us hope that in the 
 interests of stability in this region, particularly for the East Timorese people, this situation can be resolved peacefully and quickly.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—A general grievance from many people in Australia over the last 40 years must surely be the lack of attention to balanced and complete infrastructure spending at all levels of government. I will try to explain what I mean by `complete' a little later.
City engineers and state and federal transport ministers have largely suffered in silence, excluded from real power, and been subjected to the `advice'—if you could call it that—from a motley collection of bureaucrats and consultants and plans that somehow did not quite get completed. Take for example the standardisation of Australia's railway track 
 from Brisbane to Perth, celebrated rightfully a couple of years ago. The concept of the transition from the inefficiencies of different gauges to standard gauge was celebrated, as I said, rightfully. But the celebrations are a bit flat really when passenger and freight trains between Melbourne and Adelaide have to slow down to speeds of 20 to 40 kilometres per hour on large sections of track in Victoria. I suspect the train was faster 100 years ago—and I know it was faster 50 years ago.
The Commonwealth standardised the track, which is a good thing, but it did not do it properly. That story, as far as infrastructure is concerned, is repeated ad nauseam all over Australia—and some people wonder why people have lost faith in the political process. Certainly it is an old cliche, but most people subscribe to the adage that `if you do something, at least do it properly and completely'.
Unfortunately, that does not seem to apply to rail infrastructure in Australia. Successive Australian governments for 80 years have promised to build a railway from Adelaide to Darwin, but still the Alice Springs to Darwin link remains unfinished. The coalition has promised $100 million to the project; the Labor opposition has promised $300 million. The message to politicians—not just from South Australians and also Territorians in your state, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the wider Australian electorate as well—is quite simple: build the dammed thing! Have a little faith. It will work. On defence grounds alone, it is justifiable. Get on with it, is the message. Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand that one-third of Australia's population lives in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. But why do so many people forget that two-thirds, the overwhelming majority, of Australians do not live there. Some people still do not seem to get the message.
One bright spot, as far as infrastructure expenditure in Australia is concerned, was completed by a Labor government in Western Australia—and of course I refer to the northern suburbs railway. This is an overwhelming success, and congratulations are due to former ministers Bob Pearce, Julian Grill and Professor Peter Newman. They outfought, outwitted and beat all the knockers—and there were 
 plenty of them—in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. But, unfortunately, that example in Western Australia does not fit the general pattern.
The major industrial areas in Adelaide form a semi-circle arc from the Port of Adelaide at Outer Harbour through Port Adelaide, Wingfield, Dry Creek, Regency Park, Salisbury to General Motors-Holden at Elizabeth, taking in two federal Labor electorate seats of Port Adelaide and Bonython and two currently Liberal—probably next time Labor—seats of Adelaide and Makin. In this area during the last 10 years the federal Labor government, to its credit, completed three major road infrastructure projects. The Port Wakefield highway was duplicated, two lanes each way all the way from Gepps Cross to Port Wakefield; the South Road connector was built in 1994, connecting the Port Wakefield Road to the South Road; and the Salisbury Overway Bridge, connecting all of the above to the Salisbury Highway, was completed in 1996.
They were great projects. Business, manufacturing industry and transport, in particular, increased their efficiency dividend. But the efficiency dividend, although increased, was not maximised. As is so often the case in Australia, one part of this infrastructure to complete what would be one of the best transport hubs in the world let alone Australia was not completed. That part—a state government responsibility but one which needs Commonwealth leadership and some money—is the third river opening rail and road crossing. This would connect a dual highway from the Port of Adelaide, Outer Harbour, bypassing the city of Port Adelaide by road and rail to link up with the South Road connector and the Dry Creek rail yards.
The all-up cost is in the vicinity of $60 million to $80 million. Even if it were about $10 million more, it would still be a worthy project. The efficiency dividend for business would be enormous. The transport hub would be outstanding. Access to road, rail, airport and port would be second to none in this country. Sometimes this very fact seems to bring out prospective envy from other states, particularly from that fellow in Victoria called Mr Kennett. This aspect alone would prove 
 very attractive for businesses to locate in my electorate. It is a boost that South Australia desperately needs.
When the federal budget came down in May, one of the things I examined was the roads of national importance program in the Transport and Regional Development portfolio. I understand that the Liberal state minister, Diana Laidlaw, and the Major of Port Adelaide/Enfield, Johanna McCluskey, had lobbied the minister on this particular project, and I was hopeful that a decision would at last be made. What a disappointment. Not only was the third river opening road and rail bridge crossing sadly overlooked but not one dollar of national roads of importance funding was coming to South Australia—not one measly dollar. Two-thirds of Australia's population live outside Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, but that very real fact seems to be overlooked by this federal government whilst the state government in South Australia consumes itself with leadership divisions. For the time being, heavy industrialised traffic will continue all so slowly to rumble through the streets of Port Adelaide, inefficiently delivering a dividend in transport, hampering local efforts to breathe life back into the heart of the port and its suburbs and not completing what would be one of the best transport hubs in the world.
For the record, I repeat that South Australia did not receive one dollar from the roads of national importance program. On this particular matter Premier Olsen, his transport minister, Diana Laidlaw, and all the Liberal federal members have so far failed to convince the federal coalition of the most urgent infrastructure needs for South Australia. We did not get two submarines by the way either. It is not only transport and business that would benefit from the third river opening road and rail crossing. Port Adelaide has more historic buildings preserved but not yet fully utilised than any other port city in Australia. It is a gold mine being rediscovered but held back because investors in waterfront housing and development are rightfully deferring investment until they are certain that the third river opening rail and road bridge will go ahead. 
Port Adelaide needs a critical mass of some 3,000 to 4,000 people again living within its historic precincts to breathe some life back into its considerable retail, financial, shipping, manufacturing, educational and transport heart. Some 140 houses are currently in the process of being built on the upper reaches of the river. Those developments need to be duplicated over and over again. Wharf shed two has been removed, opening up the soon to be built wharf development at Lipson Street in Port Adelaide.
They are indeed most welcome developments, but they are just a beginning, as were the Port Adelaide TAFE and markets built on the waterfront adjacent to the Birkenhead Bridge, on which heavy truck traffic should be removed and in a time sooner than most imagine will for several reasons have to be closed to heavy traffic. I hope it is not because a disaster occurs. Retail and leisure developments, like movie theatres, restaurants and niche strip shopping, are urgently required on Commercial Road from Dale Street to the Black Diamond Corner to Church Place on St Vincent Street. The third river opening rail and road bridge will be just the catalyst to secure that necessary investment.
I began this speech stating that too often in Australia infrastructure projects are not fully completed, thus minimising the efficiency dividends that I believe taxpayers demand and this country needs. The third river opening road and rail bridge in my electorate of Port Adelaide, affecting the electorates of Bonython, Adelaide, Hindmarsh and Makin, is a prime example of continued partial failures of governments at both the federal and the state levels.
I hope that this government or the next—hopefully Labor—applies 20/20 vision, a dose of commonsense and a bit of intellect to this particular matter. If so, then we can look forward to a model transport hub at least being set up in Australia that just might be the appropriate model to transfer something that we can learn to larger hubs in the eastern states. Mr Deputy Speaker Dondas, I remain forever the optimist. However, I do know, as I suspect you do, living in the Northern Territory, that out there in the electorate 
 patience is wearing very thin and infrastructure projects once touted by governments and oppositions alike ought to be completed. One I hope that you would agree with is the Alice Springs-Darwin railway. One for me in my electorate in South Australia and for South Australian industry and manufacturing, in particular, is the third river opening bridge crossing in Port Adelaide.

"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998  and the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998  were passed through the Senate on Friday, 26 June 1998 with a number of minor amendments to the collection bill. I commend the amendments to the House.
When the coalition took office we said we would act to fix the waterfront. We committed ourselves to actively seeking to achieve waterfront reform. We have never wavered from our resolute determination to eliminate overmanning, tackle labour inefficiency, and improve the productivity and reliability of our wharves—and we have delivered on our promises. With the passage of this legislation, we have taken another major step in reforming workplace relations on the Australian waterfront. The bills will facilitate fundamen 
 tal restructuring by assisting stevedores to meet the costs of redundancy benefits associated with reducing the size of their work forces, improve training, lower the appalling level of workplace injury and introduce new technology. The settlement between Patrick Stevedores, its employees and the MUA will be the first instance of reform and modernisation supported by the legislation.
The bills will enable the Commonwealth to provide funds for at least 738 redundancies. This will be associated with reforms by which Patrick will be able to subcontract services such as maintenance, cleaning and security; to introduce annualised salaries and productivity bonuses, based on targets of 25 crane moves per hour; and to replace double-headers, the order of pick, the nick and all the other rorts and scams with new, flexible rostering and working arrangements. The settlement also provides for genuine freedom of association on the waterfront, where employees will have a choice of whether to join a union or not.
This, of course, is only the beginning. The bills will encourage other stevedores to sign up to the government's seven benchmark objectives so that they will have access to assistance for approved purposes. P&O Ports have already indicated that they will soon be seeking to introduce similar reforms. I anticipate that other employers, including the smaller stevedores, will also want to take advantage of the reform agenda. I have been informed as such by some of them and I certainly encourage them to do so.
I said that we would fix up the waterfront by Christmas, and I am still working to that timetable. The MUA cannot procrastinate. The same is expected not just of P&O but also of Sealand in Adelaide. For Sealand, it is just as important. That company is a monopoly in the Port of Adelaide. It is very important that it reduce overmanning so that its customers in South Australia can see, and reap the benefits from, a more efficient waterfront.
Let me turn briefly to the amendments. I will commence with new clause 19A, `Reports by the Minister'. The Senate committee sought changes to ensure a proper level of scrutiny of the Commonwealth funding of 
 reform and restructuring of the industry. The Senate inserted a new clause 19A, which requires the minister to report to parliament on a range of matters. Reports which must be presented to the parliament will be approximately quarterly during 1998, and annually after that. We support the principle of parliamentary accountability.
Clause 18 is the minister's power to authorise expenditure in connection with stevedoring industry reform. Clause 18 of the collection bill allowed the minister to authorise payments in connection with, or incidental to, reform or restructuring of the industry. The minority report of the Senate committee recommended that the power of the minister to authorise expenditure be clarified. The amendments moved by the opposition were unworkable for a number of reasons.
However, in line with the government's intention that payments under clause 18 only be used to support reform initiatives consistent with the government's objectives, the government proposed its own amendments to clause 18 to specify more precisely the matters to which the minister may authorise payments. As amended, the clause will allow the minister to authorise payments in connection with what are termed `qualifying redundancies'.
The minister may also authorise payments connected with the following reform initiatives: occupational health and safety programs, training programs that aim to improve performance of work, the introduction of new technology and improvement of wharf facilities. These reflect aspects of the seven benchmark objectives. I should also note that, if other reform related activities not included in this list are to be funded, this can only occur if those are prescribed by regulation and the statutory disallowance period has passed.
I emphasise that payments may be for a broad range of reform initiatives and not just redundancies. The legislation is available to benefit all stevedores, including those smaller stevedores who have indicated that they have no present intention to reduce the size of their work force.
As time is getting away from me, I reiterate the government's intention to exempt local 
 cargo from the levy. I announced on 12 June that we would do so. We intended to do so by legislation. However, after further consideration, the exemption will be by way of regulation. I have spoken to the Premier of Tasmania, the Hon. Anthony Rundle MHA. He is satisfied that proceeding by regulation is reasonable in the circumstances, and a regulation has already been drafted to that effect to be brought into effect as soon as possible.
In conclusion, I thank members and senators—and you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your patience—for dealing with the legislation quickly and efficiently. There remain fundamental differences between the parties and between the government and the opposition on reform of the waterfront. We also see differences on reform of the shipping industry. We are determined, however, to achieve real and lasting reform in the interests of the national economy and the country generally. This legislation is one part of that program.",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—The opposition continues to oppose the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998, which have been brought back to the House today by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). However, we will not divide on the two amendments that have come back from the Senate because they do slightly ameliorate what we see as bad legislation. We have no wish to return this legislation to its original form, which was even worse.
I will comment on the three issues that we find objectionable in the legislation, each one having been referred to by the minister. One was the level of parliamentary scrutiny provided for in the legislation over the operations and dealing with money of MIFCo. That largely has been corrected by one of the amendments that the minister has put forward today. Although it is not quite as strong as the version we put to the Senate, it is nonetheless acceptable as a means of ensuring that the operations of this body and its dealing with money are sufficiently subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
Of the other two issues on which we have very considerable differences with the govern 
 ment, the first is the question of the scope of the activities for which money may be paid out of the funds at the discretion of the minister. In our view, this should have been limited purely to a situation of bona fide redundancies in the entitlements of workers made redundant. The minister did seek to add a number of areas to that. Although rather suspicious of the ministers' motive, given the performance he has put in on this issue so far, we were prepared to accept an extension to issues such as health and safety and technological change disbursements.
However, subclause (c) in the amendment was ultimately adopted by the Senate in spite of our opposition. That empowers any payment with respect to `reform or restructuring of the stevedoring industry', provided that that is made by regulation. That, in our view, is far too broad and opens up the possibility that a variety of dubious payments may be made. For example, if you look at the recent past, the Dubai exercise could have been funded or the legal costs of Chris Corrigan paid for on that basis. Although there is a minor improvement in the sense that any such payments now have to be the subject of regulations—which therefore are disallowable—that is insufficient protection from the sorts of things that the minister and this government may wish to do in the wake of this legislation.
We do not accept their analysis of the Australian waterfront. As the minister indicated, we have a fundamental disagreement not only as to the current situation on the waterfront but also as to what is the right approach to bring about further improvement and ongoing productivity increases on the waterfront. We think that recent history has shown their motives to be malignant, that their approach to this issue is a devious and mendacious approach and that, therefore, they cannot be trusted to have carte blanche with respect to public money—money that is paid in taxes on containers and vehicles being transported across Australia's waterfront for these sorts of purposes.
The other issue which the minister mentioned, for which we unsuccessfully sought to have the legislation amended in the Senate, is the question of which stevedores this legisla 
 tion should apply to. The two main stevedores in Australia, P&O and Patrick's, both signed up to the minister's seven supposed benchmarks for reform in the industry. They both supported the legislation, in effect. Therefore, we have no problems with the legislation applying to them and their containers and with their vehicles being the subject of the levy.
We do, however, have a very big problem with the legislation applying to other stevedores without their consent—in particular, stevedores such as Strang in Melbourne and Sealand in Adelaide, who made it very, very plain that they were opposed to what the minister was doing. They did not intend to have redundancies. Contrary to the accusations of the minister, they are not overstaffed at the moment; that is an absolute untruth. They have no intention of using this legislation, and they do not wish to be bullied by the minister into going down the path that Patrick's is going down.
I notice with some amusement that the minister announced on Friday that Labor had caved in to his demands on these issues. We have heard nothing more of that because we did not cave in. We maintained our position all the way through in the Senate on this issue. We continue to maintain our position that this legislation should not apply to stevedoring companies that do not wish to be part of it and that those companies should have an opt out provision. Unfortunately, we were not successful on that in the Senate. As far as we are concerned, this remains bad legislation. But, as I have said, of the two amendments that have been put forward today, one is a good amendment which we accept to improve parliamentary scrutiny and the other marginally improves the scrutiny with respect to what the money can be used for, but nowhere near as much as it should.",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—I think it is appropriate that there be some response to some of the points that have been made. Firstly, in respect of having a uniform levy, this is the same approach that the Labor Party took when they were in government with the WIRA process in 1989. 
 The levy was applied uniformly across the industry, and it is rank hypocrisy for them to say now that the world is different and therefore there should be a different arrangement.
The fact is that Sealand have been very close to the MUA, and the MUA want a special deal for their mates. That is not a proposition that this government accepts. It is no surprise that the Labor Party would stand here and advocate the case as directed to them by the MUA. From the government's perspective, a uniform rate is consistent with what Labor did when they were in government. It is obviously the appropriate way to go. As far as Sealand are concerned, they are overmanned in Adelaide. They are a monopoly. They have a hidden deal with the state government in South Australia which is passing costs on to consumers. As far as the federal government is concerned, we expect higher productivity from Sealand, as we do from others. They ought to be taking advantage of this scheme. The fact that they will now be paying the levy will hopefully put some pressure on them to provide a far better service than we have seen so far. It would be in the interests of South Australia if they were to do so.
Secondly, the opposition says that these funds should be entirely limited to redundancies and that they are opposed to the amendments. No-one should forget that, when they were running their reform process, I think $500,000 was paid out to the union as part of a secret sweetheart deal done with the MUA back in 1989. So they do not come to this debate with clean hands. The government does have some wider discretion which this legislation provides us with to pursue our reform agenda, and that is a sensible power for the government to have, as the reform process is an evolutionary one.
Lastly, my opposite number says that the government's motives are malignant. This, I must say, brings a smile to my face. As I was reading the press reports in 1994 of the relationship between the MUA and the federal Labor government, it was said by one independent commentator that the MUA had demonised Laurie Brereton and put him in the pantheon of stars along with Stanley Mel 
 bourne Bruce and somebody else that the MUA did not like at the time. The reality is that the MUA finds malignant the motives of anybody who is attempting to reform the waterfront, whether it is a coalition government as it is today or a Labor government as it was back in 1994.
Why is it that governments of both political persuasions have looked to reform the Australian waterfront? The reason is that productivity levels have been very poor, and that has imposed a very great cost on the Australian community. Governments of both political persuasions have had a national responsibility to do what they can to fix up the waterfront. What we now know from reading the Australian this morning is that the then Labor government looked at all the range of options which we as a government have looked at. It was a Labor government that received legal advice on cancelling the MUA's awards and agreements. What incredible hypocrisy for the Labor Party to accuse us of malignant motives when they had a subcommittee of a federal Labor government that looked at getting rid of the MUA's awards and agreements.
They also looked at the deregistration of the MUA. Why would they look at the deregistration of the MUA? Because they shelled out a huge amount of taxpayers' money to reform the waterfront, got nothing for it and then found themselves subject to an industrial campaign of blackmail by the MUA years after they were supposed to fix up the waterfront. What else did they seek legal advice on? They sought legal advice on the dismissal of the employees. What was omitted from the documents, I am reliably informed, the one thing they did not look at, was a proper redundancy program for the people who might have been dismissed as a result of such action.
The hypocrisy of the Labor Party revealed in the Australian this morning reinforces in the end that this has been a government determined to fix up the waterfront. This is not a government that caves in, as Labor always does, to the unions. That is why ultimately there will be no divisions here, as there were no divisions in the Senate—because the Labor Party knows that it is about 
 time the waterfront was fixed up, and this legislation is part of it. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—There are many points in the contribution of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that I would take issue with, but given the time that is available to me I will address only two. The first is the purported analogy between the current stevedoring levy legislation that he is seeking to impose and the levy that was imposed on the stevedoring industry by the Labor government in 1989. There is one fundamental difference between the two situations which makes the analogy totally fallacious, and that is that in 1989 you had pooled employment. There were no employees of the individual stevedoring companies; you had pooled employment. If you were going to have a stevedoring industry levy to fund redundancies, by definition it had to be on everybody because there were no separate employees in individual enterprises.
Therefore, the analogy is totally redundant. It is totally inappropriate, because in order to have a levy and a pool of money to fund redundancies clearly that had to be on everybody because you could not distinguish between individual employees and say, `This person is an employee of P&O; this person is an employee of Sealand,' which you can now do. To the best of my recollection, there were no stevedoring employers at the time seriously kicking up a major fuss about the levy proposal, as there are now. There was no equivalence then, to the best of my recollection, to Sealand and Strang now saying, `We don't want to be part of this. We don't want to make any of our workers redundant. We don't believe that we are overstaffed. We believe that we are operating in a reasonable way.' So it is a totally false analogy.
The second point I would like to take issue with is this incredible beat-up: this suggestion that, because somebody in the departmental bureaucracy a few years ago put a paper together to the minister of the time—whoever it was—along with all the various things that go backwards and forwards, saying, `You have these options,' that in some way means 
 there was some sort of culpability on the part of the minister or the government at the time.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—What we have here is somebody who has actively conspired over 18 months with a major stevedoring employer to engage in dodgy corporate restructuring, to sack en masse their entire work force, and has got up and lied to the Australian public about it and said, `No, I didn't know anything about this.'
—Order! The honourable member should withdraw that comment.
—I withdraw the word `lied'.
—And apologise.
—Oh, you must be joking!
—When he withdraws he has apologised.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—You must be joking. On 8 May, at a doorstop, the minister said, `I do not know anything about what Chris Corrigan's plans were.' If you look at a minute which was submitted to the cabinet on 7 July 1997, almost a year previously, you will see that under his own name is a statement of detail of the specific strategy that Chris Corrigan and Patrick were then to pursue. He did not know anything about the strategy, but he has actually put a submission to cabinet telling everybody about it.
Then we subsequently discover that there is a minute of discussions that have been held on 14 April between his own departmental officials and Patrick that goes into great detail, including on the corporate restructuring, about what is going to be done, and there is a notation on that minute saying that he was advised of this on 19 April 1997. So I will withdraw the specific word, Mr Deputy Speaker, but if the cap fits wear it. And that is precisely what we are talking about here.
You have got a situation where this man has done those things and then he says that, because there was a former Labor government that some bureaucrat sent advice to and said, `You could do these things,' that somehow means that Laurie Brereton, the then Minister 
 for Transport in that government, is in some way culpable for that thing when he has got no evidence whatsoever that there were any decisions made of any nature along the lines that he has indicated. Of course, no action was taken by the former government along the lines that he has indicated—none at all.
I suspect that that piece of advice was probably consigned to the round filing cabinet, as should have been the advice that this minister received from his department about the corporate restructuring—about the dogs and the balaclavas and the mass sackings. But he did not do that. He actually went ahead and did the things. That is the fundamental difference.
Our former government got a bit of advice about this and it did not act on it. It did not do anything. It got a bit of departmental advice, but this minister got that advice and he orchestrated it and he did it. He orchestrated the mass sackings. He went in there and said, `Don't worry, forget about your jobs, you're gone,'  and that is the fundamental difference. That analogy is the biggest beat-up of all time and I think that the former ministers in the Labor government can sleep easily tonight about that claim because I do not think they have anything to worry about.",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—I realise that in this parliament we are not allowed to use that word which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, just required to be withdrawn, but can I say with regard to this matter that this minister has said one thing, consciously knowing the facts to be otherwise. Consistently, he has made public statements contrary to what he knows the facts to be.
He made an interjection about hypocrisy earlier. Nobody cared about it being withdrawn because nobody would care about what he says. But I have to say that is one area in which I acknowledge the minister's undoubted expertise. Hypocrisy is the one thing in this discussion about which I am prepared to say that he is an expert beyond all others and deserves the proper recognition of this House and I am prepared to acknowledge that.
—Is this really relevant, Mr Deputy Speaker?
—It has been a fairly wide-ranging debate.
—They are the only two things which I think this minister has done well with regard to the matters covered by this legislation.
There are two other things that I wish to refer to. They have been covered already, but I want to speak to them more specifically. One is that the proposal that people who do not wish to draw on the fund should be required to contribute to it is simply another stage in a saga whereby this minister has set out consciously to assist Patrick and use the taxpayers' resources, and now the competitors' resources.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—Oh, you have used taxpayers' resources in other regards, but in this matter you are using the competitors' resources to assist Patrick in return for their engaging in a series of actions designed to serve the political cause of this government. The taxpayer is underwriting this proposition, but it is worse that it is the competitors of Patrick that are being required to fund their operation.
People should not have the right to draw on a fund to which they do not contribute. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition. Nor should they have the right to draw on a fund to which their competitors are compulsorily required to contribute, but on which those competitors do not wish to draw. This is a clear indication that, as part of the deal with Patrick, the government had to commit to requiring the competitors to contribute, whether they wished to draw on the funds or not. It is an extraordinary and unreasonable proposition. The second extraordinary and unreasonable proposition is that because somebody sends a file across to you with a memo, about which you disagree and which you reject—
—Oh yeah!

 I rejected quite a few recommendations from my department that came across in three years—none of them with as much gusto as I might have rejected this particular one. But I was prepared to disagree with my department on a number of occasions, and that is not a reflection on them. It is their responsibility to send across a range of options. The fact that a minister rejects them and finds them unacceptable—they send them up to the next one and the mug accepts them.
—Who asked for them?
—You do not always have to ask for things to get them. You know that. But you have to be a mug to fall for them, and we are delighted that you were. The best thing for us is this: we do not think that the next time you are surveyed you will even get three per cent. That is the thing that encourages us most about this whole debate.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—I move:
That the requested amendments be agreed to.
I can advise at the outset that the government accepts the amendments requested by the Senate. The bill contains a number of measures announced by the government in last year's budget, including the extension of carer payment to carers of profoundly disabled children and significant reforms to the way social security means tested retired people's income streams.
Members may be aware that this bill was before the Senate at the end of May, but the Senate made amendments that were at that time unacceptable to the government. The government was disappointed at that time that parties in the Senate had put at risk all of the beneficial measures in the bill that would have helped carers of older Australians as well as the disabled. However, we have since been heartened by the more constructive attitude taken by these same parties in coming to a compromise that enhances the bill in a way which is affordable. I would like to thank the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) for her cooperation in achieving this outcome. 
I will outline the requests as I understand them: (1) to (6) relate to the mobility allowance. Mobility allowance is a payment designed to assist disabled people undertaking training. Centrelink was paying mobility allowance in cases where people were travelling to life skills training but, unfortunately, that was not technically permissible under the act. The government recognises such training is valuable and these requests will make it possible.
Requests (2) to (5)relate to the carers of profoundly disabled children measure. The government has been willing to listen to concerns raised by care and disabled groups, and in the Senate, about the targeting of the measure. These requests expand the availability of the carer payment to more carers, in particular to cases where there are two or more severely disabled children being cared for. Carers are one of the most under-recognised groups in our community and this measure, as well as other aspects of the government's carer package, goes some way to addressing their very special needs. Obviously, this is an important measure. It is good to have the amendments before us which can be accepted and therefore have the bill and the budget measures in place. I therefore commend the requests to the House.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—We are pleased that the government has supported the amendments that were moved in the Senate, even though there was quite a bit of disagreement over some of the issues. People would be aware that the government put a lot of people with disabilities through a lot of misery at the end of last year by taking their mobility allowances away from them, and we are very pleased that that issue has been cleaned up and people can know that they will get their mobility allowances to ensure that they get to their activities without being any further out of pocket.
As far as the carer issues go, we were very concerned—and I made some very critical remarks on this part of the bill when I was making my speech on the second reading in the House—that very few carers and their profoundly disabled children would benefit from this important reform. To a degree the 
 problem remains, and the child has to be extremely disabled. There are a number of children who, from our point of view, are extremely or profoundly disabled and who still will not qualify for this payment. Nevertheless, we are pleased that the government has accepted one amendment that we made to at least benefit some children who by any definition would be considered to be profoundly disabled.
Under our amendment it is no longer necessary that a child have both urinary and faecal incontinence day and night. Under our amendment it is sufficient for the child to have faecal incontinence day and night. This amendment will be welcomed by those parents who are caring for children in this situation. The government also moved an amendment under which the condition of profound disability is satisfied if the child is under three, and we welcome that amendment as well.
The Democrats moved an amendment, which I am pleased to see the government has accepted, that provides for payment where a person is caring for two or more disabled children, each of whom does not satisfy the criteria by themselves but where the level of care required in respect of the disabled children taken together is equivalent to that required by a profoundly disabled child. We were very pleased to support that amendment by the Democrats.
There was one other important thing which I would just like to put on the record. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) made an undertaking that the effect of the provisions would be subject to a review after 12 months. She said in a letter to me—and she also said this in the Senate—that the government would undertake a review of the carer payment measure after 12 months, focusing in particular on whether any profoundly disabled children are not benefiting from the measure, and that the review would be tabled in the Senate. She did repeat that undertaking before the Senate for the record. Given our earlier concerns that very few children would benefit from this important reform, I am very pleased that the government has agreed to undertake such a review.
The other issue I want to touch on is seasonal workers. I foreshadowed in my earlier remarks in the House the need to take into account the fact that some seasonal workers do stints of work and live on their savings in the intervening periods. I am pleased to say that the government moved amendments to address this point. The government has agreed to our amendments under which work-related expenses can be deducted from a person's seasonal work earnings where the worker shows that they are allowable tax deductions.
So there have been some improvements made to this bill. There will also be some protection by administrative review of those people who bought income stream products prior to 1992. I certainly hope that those people will be protected by that process of administrative review.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,1998-06-29,"—On behalf of the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: CSIRO National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research, Bentley, WA.
The National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research is being established by the Western Australian government and CSIRO to substantially increase Western Australia's technological capability and its capacity to support the sustained development of its resource industries. Located at Technology Park in Bentley, the national centre will 
 provide a focal point for research excellence and collaboration between CSIRO, cooperative research centres, university researchers, government agencies, resource companies and associated technology suppliers and providers.
The national centre will provide a unique opportunity to bring together world-class scientific and engineering research groups to work closely with the petroleum and minerals industries. Collaborative research will embrace a wide range of activities aimed not only at providing solutions to current industry issues but also at providing the research leadership necessary to address the key research needs and research issues of these industries now and in the decades ahead.
The concentration of capability and expertise at the national centre will also provide a major incentive for leading edge companies and organisations to locate their operations in Western Australia, further enhancing the prospects for research collaboration and technology transfer and the delivery of innovative research solutions, services and products to the petroleum and minerals industries. The centre represents a marriage of the leading edge research in minerals and petroleum exploration and production with the industry sector.
The proposed development will include laboratories and research facilities, process bays, support and stores areas, staff amenities, public facilities, associated site works, roadworks, car parking, engineering and communication services and landscaping.
The estimated outturn cost is $31.8 million. It is anticipated that construction will commence early in mid-1999 and be completed by late 2000. I commend the motion to the House.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-06-29,"—This is certainly a fascinating time in Australian politics, a time when perhaps we are witnessing the disintegration of the traditional left-right divide on the political spectrum. It is a time when, in the Melbourne Age  this morning, Ken Davidson can praise Pauline Hanson's economic policies, a time at which the conservative National Civic Council and the hedonistic Australian Democrats can form a unity ticket on the question of economic rationalism. Perhaps the most significant aspect of this time of change in Australian politics is the fact that we are witnessing the fragmentation of the traditional conservative side of Australian politics; we are witnessing the way in which the coalition vote is being stripped away on both sides, losing some of 
 its more socially conservative supporters to One Nation while its small `l' liberal constituency is fleeing to the Australian Labor Party.
It needs to be remembered in this context that, among the senior ranks of the coalition parties, there was only ever a complaint about One Nation when it became a threat to them politically. Indeed, it should be remembered that the initial response of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the maiden speech by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) was to go to Brisbane and praise this as an example of freedom of speech under his government; not that she was wrong, not that she had erred in her economic or social prescriptions but, rather, we could welcome a new era of freedom of speech in Australia. Indeed, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), who sits opposite, made a similar point in an article in the Australian on 28 September 1996. He wrote:
Undeniably, however, she—
Pauline Hanson—
has struck a chord in middle Australia.
How that chord has now turned to a sour note being struck for the member for Warringah! In this context it needs to be remembered that the origins of One Nation lie very much within the Liberal Party. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) made a fundamental mistake recently when he said that One Nation policy was coming out of the League of Rights. It comes out of two former members of the Liberal Party, Pauline Hanson and David Oldfield. The one thing they have in common is that they are former members of the Liberal Party of Australia. They are now seeking a constituency that the Prime Minister himself cultivated from 1995 onwards, the constituency engaging in downwards envy, the belief that the newly insecure group at the middle of society could prosper only if government took things away from those lower on the social ladder than themselves.
It was defined as the Howard battler constituency but now the Prime Minister in that political appeal has been well and truly trumped because the constituency he has sought to cultivate do not want accountability measures for ATSIC, they want it abolished; they do not want a 10 per cent cut in 
 migration, they want the whole program wiped out; they do not want a tariff pause, they want the erection of tariff walls in Australia. So the Prime Minister, cultivating this constituency, has now found that the Howard battlers have gone the full monty, over to One Nation.
In this regard the coalition parties are playing catch-up politics, only ever complaining about One Nation when it started to hurt them politically, and this applies especially to the member for Warringah. We will hear his complaints later on, I suspect. I bring to the House's attention something that he wrote—I know he takes an interest in things I write. I was interested in a document of 2 May 1997, describing David Oldfield as someone with high ideals and immense ability. He was, in short:
. . . an absolutely outstanding staffer, the kind of lieutenant every politician needs and hopes for, and perhaps only properly values when he is about to go. Anyone who needs a job done—and the tougher the job, the more David will revel in the task—will find him a great friend and excellent colleague.
I think the member for Oxley took the reference quite seriously; if you need a job done, who are you going to call? David Oldfield. The reference also mentioned that the member for Warringah was pleased to discover that:
David had learned a great deal from his experience as a candidate and as a counsellor, and helped me to avoid the unnecessary point scoring and needless creation of enemies which often demeans politics.
So the man who was helping the member for Warringah to avoid enemies is now public enemy No. 1. How the wheel turns in politics. The man stopping him from having enemies is now public enemy No. 1. I am sure we will hear words to that effect later from the member for Warringah.
As you know, Mr Speaker, I have always had a keen interest in the history of these matters. The parliament and the public record need to know the history of who cultivated One Nation in the first instance and where these ideas came from. They came out of the office of the member for Warringah in the form of David Oldfield and out of the mind and politics of someone endorsed by the Liberal Party in the 1996 election, Pauline Hanson.

"Smith, Warwick, MP",LP,1998-06-29,"—The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions:
(1) Optus announced in February 1997 the investment of $25 million on digital satellite technology, known as Aurora, and that the transition to digital operations would be completed by the end of 1997.
(2) Optus has advised that the Aurora platform is operational in that all necessary testing, trialling and other modelling has taken place. Optus has advised that there has been a delay in the commencement of services from the Aurora platform due to the initial delay in finalising the agreement for the use of a conditional access system, which offers compatibility with certain pay TV services.
(3) Optus has advised that it demonstrated decoders from the following manufacturers at the Cable and Satellite Exhibition in Sydney:
.	 Comstream/Panasonic
.	 UEC
.	 SunMoonStar
.	 Pace.
Decoders from the following manufacturers have also been demonstrated separately on the Aurora system:
.	 Nokia
.	 Hyundai
.	 Annan. 

Optus has advised that Comstream/Panasonic and UEC have been endorsed for use on Aurora. Optus has selected the UEC decoder to replace existing analogue decoders for direct-to-home reception in the context of the digital conversion of remote area broadcasting services. Optus expects that these decoders will also be suitable for many retransmission sites. Optus is finalising arrangements in respect of retransmission sites requiring professional model decoders.
While Optus considers that selection of the UEC model is desirable to facilitate the smooth transition of viewers to digital RABS reception, it intends that other endorsed decoders will be made available in the future to increase consumer choice in accessing the range of services being developed on the Aurora platform. The UEC decoder will, of course, also be able to access these services.
(4) Optus has advised that it has not guaranteed a price of $750 for decoders.
(5) (a) Optus has advised that the recommended retail price of the UEC decoder will be $999.
(b) Optus has advised that it will be sourcing Aurora decoders from all endorsed suppliers.
(c) Yes.
(6) Optus has advised that the price of decoders represents the final cost to consumers, including the cost of the smart card, conditional access module and dealer and distribution charges. I understand that decoders used primarily for reception of remote area broadcasting services, on a non-profit basis, are exempt from sales tax.
(7) Optus has advised that it plans to commence digital services in Western Australia by the end of June 1998, but that this could be delayed until July, depending on progress with the ABC's purchase of encoders. Optus has advised that it will provide an extended dual transmission period in Western Australia, through to the mid October 1998, to minimise any disruptions to consumers.
(8) Optus has advised that it obtained permission in December 1997 for the use of the Irdeto conditional access system on the Aurora platform. The initial delay in negotiating this agreement has resulted in a consequential delay in the commencement of services from the Aurora platform.
(9) Optus has advised that there are no software problems that have required special modification of the decoders. Optus has further advised that there will be multiple suppliers and, therefore, competition in the provision of the Aurora decoders, some time after the initial RABS digital conversion.
(10) Optus has advised that it neither made, nor authorised, any official statements that it would meet any difference between the Commonwealth subsidy and the price of the decoders. Optus has further advised that it is not aware of any advice 
 provided to the public that the company would meet any such cost difference.
(11) I understand that the rights to use the Irdeto conditional access system to deliver satellite pay TV services in Australia is currently the subject of commercial negotiation within the context of the liquidation of the assets of the Australis Media group of companies.
(12) Telstra has advised that the Scientific Atlanta PowerVu system is capable of being engineered to work with the Irdeto CA system, and that preliminary discussions on this matter have taken place between Scientific Atlanta and Irdeto. I understand that, at this stage, the two companies do not consider that there is a commercial imperative to progress integration of the CA systems.
(13) Telstra understands that there has been adequate stocks of domestic digital decoders available for sale in Western Australia since November-December 1997. Telstra has advised, however, that there was a temporary shortage of commercial decoders for retransmission sites due to the late arrival of one shipment in late February 1998, rather than mid-February as scheduled. I understand that Scientific Atlanta provided interim decoders to affected customers during this period. Telstra has also advised that there may have been some instances of delays in supply of decoders to viewers where orders were placed very late, or where some local dealers failed to act diligently in filling orders.
Optus has indicated that it accords a high priority to ensuring an adequate and consistent supply of decoders for the digital conversion of remote area broadcasting services. The company has advised that it has appointed a master distributor, Nationwide Antenna Systems, is arranging multiple distribution points in each State/Territory and direct links to a network of retailers/installers, and is ensuring the adequate availability of equipment for the commencement of digital conversions.
(14) At this stage, it is not possible to draw a final comparison between Optus and Telstra-delivered broadcasting services to remote areas in WA.
Optus has contracted to digitally transmit ABC and SBS television and radio services nationally, including local time ABC TV services in WA, and the Westlink and Horizon services. I understand that Optus has not yet reached a final decision as to what other services it might provide to RABS viewers in WA.
Telstra has contracted to digitally transmit the GWN television service in WA, and is providing companion ABC and SBS television services in local time, and has undertaken to provide all ABC radio services in WA, and the WA FM radio service.  

Transmission arrangements are yet to be finalised in respect of the second commercial television service for remote and regional WA for the operation of which the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) allocated a licence to WIN Television on 1 April this year.
Elsewhere in Australia, all RABS operators have contracted with Optus for the digital transmission of their services. In total, Optus has contracts for delivery on the Aurora platform of nine out of the ten RABS services, and for delivery of the Westlink, Horizon, Centrelink, CITEC and Sky Channel services.
Both Optus and Telstra have indicated that their digital decoders potentially afford access to a range of other communications services including data transfer, Internet access and pay TV.
(15) Optus has advised that satellite systems in Australia, South Africa, Continental Africa, Middle East, Thailand, Scandinavia, Greece and Eastern Europe are compatible with the Aurora platform.
(16) Optus has advised that it has neither a technical nor legal difficulty in providing a satellite based platform for the delivery of pay TV in Australia. Its Aurora decoders will potentially afford access to any pay TV service provided using the Irdeto CA system, although such a service is not currently available in remote areas.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Project Aurora</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,19,1,answer
