"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I present the interim report of the committee entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2003, together with the minutes of proceedings. In August 1996, the Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, agreed that the governor would appear before the House economics committee twice each year to report on the conduct of monetary policy. The public hearings are the only occasions on which the governor is obliged to publicly answer questions about bank policy, including on interest rates. The hearings have therefore played a valuable part in increasing community understanding of the Reserve Bank's role.
This report is the first in the committee's review of the bank's current annual report. In support of the review, the committee conducted a public hearing in Brisbane last December. The hearing was well attended by the public, students and others and, as always, attracted considerable interest from the financial markets and the media. The hearing was held at an interesting time for Australian monetary policy. The value of the Australian dollar was rising rapidly, household debt had increased to an all-time high and there was continued growth in the Australian economy. Just before the hearing, the Reserve Bank increased interest rates twice—in November from 4.75 per cent to five per cent, and in December by another quarter of a per cent. These were the first increases in 17 months. As reasons for the increases, the bank cited improving conditions in Australian and world economies, the possibility of rising inflation once the effects of the current high exchange rates faded and continuing expansion of domestic credit. Mr Macfarlane defended the rises at a time when other countries are holding their rates steady by pointing to the strong growth of Australia's economy compared to other countries. He put it in the following terms: 
... I know which one I would prefer to have—a good healthy economy with normal interest rates, rather than a sick economy with low interest rates.
Much of the focus of the Brisbane hearing was on the decision to increase rates this time and the tension between the rising exchange rate and the rapid rise in household debt when determining monetary policy settings. Happily, pressures on both these fronts seem to have eased slightly since the hearing. The exchange rate for the Australian dollar has recently retreated from the highs of US80c, and figures released last Tuesday show the biggest one-month decline in investment property loans since 1991. The committee has long been concerned about the high level of speculative investment in housing. The recent data would appear to confirm Mr Macfarlane's judgment at an earlier hearing that `a degree of commonsense' is finally returning to the housing market. 
On other matters, an ongoing issue is whether voting at the board's meeting should be disclosed. In Brisbane, Mr Macfarlane asserted that disclosing voting patterns would place undue pressure on board members to be advocates for their particular industry sectors rather than making decisions for the economy as a whole. The committee has not recommended any changes to the composition of the board or publication of its deliberations.
Reform of the payments system has been a priority area for the Reserve Bank in recent years. In the area of credit cards, reforms which came into effect recently have achieved an almost 50 per cent reduction in interchange fees for Bankcard, MasterCard and Visa. The bank advised that it is now monitoring the flow-on of these savings to merchant service fees, and the committee will ask for an update at the June hearing.
In their previous report, the committee noted their concern with the apparently high level of interchange fee applied to BPay. We expressed the view that the bank should undertake an immediate review of this fee. The bank advised that it intends to conduct a thorough study in order to determine whether the current BPay interchange fee is reasonable or whether there should be a fee at all. The committee look forward to the conclusions.
Finally, I would like to thank all committee members—particularly the deputy chair, the member for Chisholm—for their active participation in these important public hearings. I would also like to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, and his staff and to congratulate Mr Macfarlane on his recent appointment as a Companion of the Order of Australia. Also, I would like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Russell Chafer, for their professional support, as always, in the work that we do. In conclusion, the hearing in Brisbane again demonstrated the value of the committee's hearings with the Reserve Bank, and we look forward to our next hearing in Sydney on 4 June.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I also rise today to welcome the interim report of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2003. I want to start my speech by thanking the staff instead of being cut off at the end and never getting around to it. I want to sincerely thank all the staff from the committee—Russell Chafer, Susan Cardell, Ryan Crowley, Katie Hobson and Sheridan Johnson—for the phenomenal work they do, especially when we go on the interstate trips. A lot of work is involved in setting up the hearings and making them happen. I would also like to sincerely thank David Richardson from the Parliamentary Library for his work, because without that I am sure none of us would really know what the hell is going on. So I want to thank Dave for all the work he does.
I want also to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank for making himself available and to thank his team for the spirit in which they appear before the committee. I have noticed over my five years of appearing with this committee that the governor is becoming far more open and keen to engage in the public debate, and I think at the last hearing we saw him on numerous occasions expanding his comments to us. This can only be a good thing for the transparency and openness of our economy.
The hearing in December came hot on the heels of two recent rate rises that took the cash rate to 5.25 per cent—the first such move in over 17 months. These increases were met with howls of criticism from many quarters, especially from politicians and real estate agents. I am not terribly sure what that says about either profession, but somehow we are now lumped in together. The governor, in his opening address, commented on these criticisms and again tried to make it clear that interest rate rises are not put in place to smooth the housing market. I would like to quote from his opening address:
Two increases in interest rates were made in mid-2002, then there was a 16-month gap to the next two increases. I have explained in previous meetings the reason why this long gap occurred.
It is clear that, despite our best endeavours to explain ourselves, a number of people think that the bank tightened monetary policy to cool down the property market. In fact, I have more than once received unsolicited advice that it would be better for us to explain our action in this way because people could more easily identify with it. The overheated property market is something that people can see around them; it is much more concrete than such concepts as inflation targeting or returning interest rates to normal.
However, such an approach would not be consistent with the truth. For a start, signs of overheating in the housing market were clearly evident through the second half of 2002 and all through 2003, yet the bank did not change monetary policy. It was only when it became clear that good economic growth had returned both globally and domestically that rates were raised.
So the governor has gone to extreme lengths to demonstrate that rates have not risen to smooth the housing market, yet the rate rises have had that impact. There was a great deal of discussion about the impact of the rises on households and the governor's desire to send a message to those speculative borrowers who are purchasing properties as investment instruments.
The warnings that the governor has been sounding about overexposure in the investment market, the influx of apartment developments and dubious lending practices—I cite deposit bonds as one example—have sadly all come home to roost with the collapse of Henry Kaye. The governor's previous statements and his comments at that hearing about the lack of regulation in the property investment market still continue to be ignored, with the federal government trying to shift blame to the states and, sadly, with investors being left exposed. Things urgently need to be done in this area to ensure that there is a regulatory framework for property investors.
The governor would not be drawn on the actual discussions at the board meetings which resulted in the rate rises or on whether the decision to raise rates was unanimous. This again highlights the concern about the lack of openness of the board process. Given the Treasurer's and the Prime Minister's negative comments about the rate rises, and the presence of the Secretary to the Treasury on the RBA board, there is a perception of unease about the board process. Whilst the members of the board who are not from the RBA or Treasury are captains of their respective industries, they are not experts on monetary policy. As we know neither what transpires at board meetings nor the voting intentions of the members, we can conclude only that the debate about economic fundamentals or the forecasting relied on by the board is limited. I mean that there are fundamentally only two people on the board who can actually engage in that level of debate. The governor did state at the hearing that there was no disagreement about forecasting or fundamentals, but he would not expand on that.
Subsequent to the rises, rates have been put on hold, and again that decision was announced with deafening silence. The practice of providing no comment when rates are placed on hold is at odds with an open economy. There has to be a reason why rates are not moved and this should be provided to the market. The governor has now expanded on his notion of natural rates at several hearings. Given that the fundamentals seem to be in place for rates to return to those settings, it seems curious that the governor has not explained why rates remain on hold. The governor was quizzed about the impact of a rate rise of half a per cent on households. While the governor said that he did not believe the impact would be felt by many, he did say that some households would feel it. Again, we need to see more information about the level of household debt.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—I too am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration report on the Reserve Bank. I would also like to congratulate Russell Chafer and the committee on their fine work. I was absolutely delighted that on this occasion the committee came to my home city of Brisbane. One of the good things about these hearings has been that the Reserve Bank governor has now visited a number of areas around Australia. The hearings in Brisbane were very well attended by a large number of members of the community, as well as schoolchildren. Many members of the community who came along commented to me that it was a wonderful opportunity and it was not every day that one could go to a hearing and hear the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia speak about his economic forecasts and a variety of topics.
At those hearings I was very pleased to see that a number of issues were raised, including the economic forecasts. The world has seen terribly uncertain times in terms of SARS outbreaks and economic weaknesses in the first half of the year. In the June quarter most countries saw a decline in their GDP. That caused many central banks, including those in the USA, Canada and Europe, to reduce interest rates. The governor was very optimistic, however, about our domestic situation, and our forecasts for GDP are predicted to be higher in the second half of the year. When he spoke to us at a public hearing in Melbourne in 2003 he forecast that GDP would grow by three per cent in real terms. However, GDP in this country is now expected to grow by four per cent over the course of 2004. It is growing much more strongly than the Reserve Bank had anticipated.
Overall, inflation targeting and monetary policy were areas that were raised by the Reserve Bank governor. He was very happy to keep his objective of two to three per cent inflation in the consumer price index and to ensure that it was maintained within those manageable levels. A number of topics came up. From the viewpoint of many of my constituents who came along, interest rates clearly were an area of interest, particularly in the housing market. In the state of Queensland we have probably had one of the largest increases in housing prices. Where other states have tended to even out over long periods of time and have had gradual increases, we have had increases of between 30 and 40 per cent over the past year. This has particularly been the case in South-East Queensland, where we have had a large economic boom and a large number of people have moved up from southern states. It is an area that is causing quite a bit of contention.
The real estate industry itself and some of the practices that are occurring in that industry are currently under investigation by the ACCC. The member for Chisholm mentioned investors and property speculators such as Henry Kaye. I think that greater controls do need to be put on people like Henry Kaye, and the ACCC has clearly taken a very strong stance against the Henry Kayes of this world.
With regard to monetary policy, I want to quote the Reserve Bank governor. He said that the Reserve Bank had increased interest rates—and there were two interest rate rises that occurred over this period, taking the rate to 5.25 per cent. On the subject of why he had done that, he said that the Australian economy had been `growing better than comparative countries around the world' and that that was something to be very pleased about. He continued:
I think we should in some sense rejoice in that rather than look on the gloomy side of things and say, `Oh, but our interest rates are higher.' The two things go together, and I know which one I would prefer to have—a good healthy economy with normal interest rates, rather than a sick economy with low interest rates.
That really says it all. We are in good shape, even though there a few problem areas such as household credit. Credit debts have risen over a period of time, but our economy is going along very nicely. Our GDP is growing at a healthy rate and the Reserve Bank governor certainly did not indicate to the committee or the hearing that he was alarmed about any aspect of that. He indicated that we were tracking well. As I said earlier, I was particularly pleased that the hearing was held in Brisbane. I look forward to the next hearing, which will be held in Sydney, and I thank the secretariat once again.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration report on the Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2003 highlights a number of areas where I believe the government has failed to act to protect the interests of consumers. Property investment advice or so-called wealth creation seminars have been a real matter of concern, particularly with some high-profile cases such as that involving the Victorian based Henry Kaye. At the Brisbane public hearing in December, the committee raised the issue of whether there is a need for both Commonwealth and state regulation in the area of property investment promotions.
In response to this issue, the RBA governor, Mr Macfarlane, has made a number of comments. On 8 December 2003 he said:
I am not sure what the final solution to the problem should be, whether it should occur at the federal or state level. But there has to be a means of regulating people who are essentially giving financial advice.
Earlier on, in June 2003, Mr Macfarlane called on the Howard government to fill the regulatory gap relating to property investments. He also said:
... I think there is a need to extend the capacity for ASIC—
that is, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission—
to do that.
Mr Macfarlane's comments seem to have been ignored by the federal government, who have refused to take any responsibility for this issue. In light of this government's refusal to take action to clamp down on property investment scams, the state and territory consumer affairs ministers met with me and Senator Stephen Conroy, our financial services spokesman, on Friday, 12 March in Sydney to look at this issue. This meeting was called due to concerns that the Howard government was hampering efforts by a joint working party to deliver a report into national regulation of the property investment advice industry. At the meeting, Senator Conroy said:
Currently, there is a gap in the regulatory framework. Federal Regulatory bodies such as ASIC, have limited powers to crack down on property spruikers. In addition, the Howard Government is trying to pass the buck on this issue to the states and territories. The result is that, in a buoyant property market, thousands of consumers are being ripped off by property spruikers. The Howard Government's inaction on property spruikers has had a devastating effect on many Australians.
As a result of the meeting, Senator Conroy announced that a Labor government would introduce a national regulatory regime administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to regulate the property investment advice industry. In addition to this, the state and territory ministers signed for the first time a joint consumer protection agreement under which they agreed to establish a national register of property investment scheme promoters, collate and exchange complaints against property investment promoters and assist ASIC once a national regulatory regime is introduced.
Another issue raised at the 8 December public hearing was the issue of bank fees, particularly credit card fees, which have risen rather dramatically since the RBA reforms to credit card interchange fees were introduced. Australian consumers were told that they would see real benefits from the cut in the credit card interchange fee announced two years ago. In parliament on 27 August 2002, the Treasurer himself said:
... it is estimated that this will reduce interchange fees which are charged by banks by $300 million to $400 million per annum. I call on the Australian banks to accept that decision and, as a consequence, to allow the users of credit cards the value of that reduction in their fees, which is estimated at $300 million to $400 million once the reforms take effect.
At the time, Labor raised concerns that the banks might seek to recoup lost revenue by increasing credit card and other bank fees. Labor's predictions were proved right. We have seen the banks increase credit card fees and charges, swallowing up the savings that consumers should have received. The Reserve Bank believes that increased competition will bring down the fees and charges that consumers pay on their credit cards. So far, we have not seen much evidence of this. However, consumers need action right now. The government should immediately act on Labor's repeated calls for the ACCC to be directed to monitor bank fees and charges.
The third issue I wish to raise is that of foreign ATM fees. I spoke on this issue before when the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report entitled Money matters in the bush and the supplementary report on ATM fee structures were released. At that time I raised concerns that the coalition members on the committee had signed off on a report that would allow banks to charge people in rural and regional areas a higher rate for using an ATM. Currently, banks charge their customers a foreign ATM fee when they use an ATM owned by another institution. This fee is the same whether you live in Melbourne or Bairnsdale. However, the Reserve Bank is proposing to allow banks to charge rural consumers higher fees to use an ATM. International experience has shown that, when differential fees have been allowed, people in rural and regional areas have been hit with massive price hikes. Foreign ATM fees have already risen 262 per cent since 1995. This is clearly an issue which needs to be dealt with.

Earlier on, in June 2003, Mr Macfarlane called on the Howard government to fill the regulatory gap relating to property investments. He also said:
... I think there is a need to extend the capacity for ASIC—
that is, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission—
to do that.
Mr Macfarlane's comments seem to have been ignored by the federal government, who have refused to take any responsibility for this issue. In light of this government's refusal to take action to clamp down on property investment scams, the state and territory consumer affairs ministers met with me and Senator Stephen Conroy, our financial services spokesman, on Friday, 12 March in Sydney to look at this issue. This meeting was called due to concerns that the Howard government was hampering efforts by a joint working party to deliver a report into national regulation of the property investment advice industry. At the meeting, Senator Conroy said:
Currently, there is a gap in the regulatory framework. Federal Regulatory bodies such as ASIC, have limited powers to crack down on property spruikers. In addition, the Howard Government is trying to pass the buck on this issue to the states and territories. The result is that, in a buoyant property market, thousands of consumers are being ripped off by property spruikers. The Howard Government's inaction on property spruikers has had a devastating effect on many Australians.
As a result of the meeting, Senator Conroy announced that a Labor government would introduce a national regulatory regime administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to regulate the property investment advice industry. In addition to this, the state and territory ministers signed for the first time a joint consumer protection agreement under which they agreed to establish a national register of property investment scheme promoters, collate and exchange complaints against property investment promoters and assist ASIC once a national regulatory regime is introduced.
Another issue raised at the 8 December public hearing was the issue of bank fees, particularly credit card fees, which have risen rather dramatically since the RBA reforms to credit card interchange fees were introduced. Australian consumers were told that they would see real benefits from the cut in the credit card interchange fee announced two years ago. In parliament on 27 August 2002, the Treasurer himself said:
... it is estimated that this will reduce interchange fees which are charged by banks by $300 million to $400 million per annum. I call on the Australian banks to accept that decision and, as a consequence, to allow the users of credit cards the value of that reduction in their fees, which is estimated at $300 million to $400 million once the reforms take effect.
At the time, Labor raised concerns that the banks might seek to recoup lost revenue by increasing credit card and other bank fees. Labor's predictions were proved right. We have seen the banks increase credit card fees and charges, swallowing up the savings that consumers should have received. The Reserve Bank believes that increased competition will bring down the fees and charges that consumers pay on their credit cards. So far, we have not seen much evidence of this. However, consumers need action right now. The government should immediately act on Labor's repeated calls for the ACCC to be directed to monitor bank fees and charges.
The third issue I wish to raise is that of foreign ATM fees. I spoke on this issue before when the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report entitled Money matters in the bush and the supplementary report on ATM fee structures were released. At that time I raised concerns that the coalition members on the committee had signed off on a report that would allow banks to charge people in rural and regional areas a higher rate for using an ATM. Currently, banks charge their customers a foreign ATM fee when they use an ATM owned by another institution. This fee is the same whether you live in Melbourne or Bairnsdale. However, the Reserve Bank is proposing to allow banks to charge rural consumers higher fees to use an ATM. International experience has shown that, when differential fees have been allowed, people in rural and regional areas have been hit with massive price hikes. Foreign ATM fees have already risen 262 per cent since 1995. This is clearly an issue which needs to be dealt with.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2004-03-22,"—On behalf of the delegation to the general conference of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific—CSCAP—held in Jakarta between 7 and 9 December 2003, I have pleasure in presenting this report to the House. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has for some time noted CSCAP's work and achievements in promoting dialogue in the areas of security and international affairs in the Asia Pacific. In April 2003 the committee visited New Zealand as part of the New Zealand parliamentary committee exchange program. As part of that visit, the committee examined in detail the objectives and achievements of CSCAP. In addition, the committee received a briefing from Australia's representatives to CSCAP about their work and the future program. CSCAP is seen as an ideal track two organisation to develop ideas and policies.
The committee considered that there would be merit in seeking approval for two members to attend the general conference of CSCAP, which was held in Jakarta between 7 and 9 December 2003. The committee was fortunate and thankful to receive support from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and from the Minister for Defence, and the approval for the visit from the Prime Minister. In addition, I would like to note the support of the Presiding Officers. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was represented by Mr Price, who is the Deputy Chair of the Defence Subcommittee, and me.
CSCAP was established in 1992-93 to provide `a more structured regional process of a nongovernmental nature to contribute to the efforts towards regional confidence building, and enhancing regional security through dialogues, consultation and cooperation.' Mr Des Ball, a co-chair of Australia CSCAP, commented that CSCAP:
... confronts immense difficulties in promoting multilateral security cooperation in a world in which national interests count for more than the common good and power politics ultimately. But it is an organisation with enormous potential, comprised of representatives from the leading academic centres and other research institutes specialising in Asia-Pacific security matters, as well as government officials (retired and current) with great practical experience in international affairs involving the Asia-Pacific region.
Membership of CSCAP includes almost all countries in the Asia Pacific region. CSCAP produces a series of newsletters which contain articles on a range of current issues. The working groups are the primary mechanism for CSCAP activity. The five working groups will address confidence and security building measures, concepts of cooperative and comprehensive security, maritime cooperation, the North Pacific and transnational crime. In addition to the efforts of the working groups, a general conference is held every two years. In 2001 the general conference was held in Australia.
The theme for the 2003 general conference was the strategic outlook for the Asia Pacific. The key sessions focused on the Indonesian defence white paper, the rise of China and its impact on the Asia Pacific, developments on the Korean Peninsula, security challenges for Timor Leste, the world after the Iraq war, comprehensive measures to counter terrorism, Islam in the region, and security challenges in South-East Asia and the South Pacific. The range of speakers was diverse and included people from academia, public servants and ministers. The keynote address was given by His Excellency Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs. As part of the session on developments in the Korean Peninsula, the former Vice-Minister of Defence for the Republic of Korea, General Park Yong-Ok, addressed the conference. In relation to the security challenges facing Timor Leste, His Excellency Jose Ramos Horta, Minister for Foreign Affairs for Timor Leste, addressed the conference. Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, gave a luncheon address on the world after the Iraq War, which was widely reported. The discussions dealt with a range of pressing issues which affect the security of all countries in the region and more widely.
Global security has been fundamentally changed since the events of 9-11 2001, and tragically the rise of terrorism has been experienced closer to home through the Bali bombings and other terrorist atrocities. The conference therefore focused on meeting and responding to terrorism through effective counterterrorism measures. A view was conveyed at the conference that, during the 1990s, governments and intelligence organisations did not understand the level of terrorist training or the threat that it posed. The challenge now exists to develop counterterrorism measures that are effective yet sensitive to cultural and religious needs and preferences. Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, during his address to the conference, discussed counterterrorism and the role of Islam in the region. I present a copy of my statement.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I rise to support the remarks of the honourable member for Maranoa in relation to the CSCAP conference. CSCAP—the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific—is a nongovernment organisation established to provide a dialogue on security issues in the Asia Pacific region. Basically, it was established to complement government discussions on security. As a nongovernment organisation it utilises the expertise of academics, private security experts and specialists.
The idea for CSCAP first emerged in November 1992 when representatives of two dozen strategic studies centres from 10 different countries, including Australia, decided it would be in their mutual interest to establish `a more structured regional process of a nongovernmental nature to contribute to the efforts towards regional confidence building, and enhancing regional security through dialogues, consultation and cooperation.' Just over eight months later, on 8 June 1993, CSCAP was formally established at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur. The CSCAP charter was endorsed at a meeting in Lombok in December of that year and subsequently amended in August 1995.
The 10 original countries with full membership status were Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States, and in the intervening years they have been joined by China, New Zealand, North Korea, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea and the European Union, while India has associate member status and the Pacific Islands Forum is an observer. CSCAP activities are guided by a steering committee which meets twice a year and is co-chaired by one ASEAN and one non-ASEAN member nation, currently Singapore and Canada. I would like to congratulate our Indonesian hosts on the success of the CSCAP conference in Jakarta. As the member for Maranoa has said, the opening address was given by Bambang Yudhoyono, the minister for security.
The working groups of CSCAP are the primary mechanism for its operation. Topics include confidence- and security-building measures, concepts of cooperation and comprehensive security, maritime cooperation, the North Pacific and transnational crime. The key sessions of the conference that the member for Maranoa and I were able to attend were those on the Indonesian Defence white paper, the rise of China and its impact on the Asia-Pacific, developments on the Korean peninsula, security challenges for Timor Leste, the world after the Iraq war, comprehensive measures to counter terrorism, Islam in the region, and security challenges in South-East Asia and the South Pacific.
One of the great advantages of CSCAP is that it is a track two organisation, so ideas and solutions which are sometimes difficult for ministers and governments to embrace first off can be canvassed by the participants. It is a very successful organisation and one that is strongly supported by the Australian government. In that respect, I would like to thank the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the opportunity to be in Jakarta.
The highlight for me was seeing our American friends and representatives from North Korea in one session at the front table arguing strongly about what was happening in the Korean peninsula and, in the next session, sitting alongside one another and chatting quite amiably. One would never have thought that that was possible, given the earlier session. I strongly support the concept that Australia, through members of parliament, should be represented at the next CSCAP conference. I thought it was of great benefit both to me and to the honourable member for Maranoa.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the General Conference of the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific, Jakarta, 7-9 December 2003</title>",Delegation Reports,1,1,speech
"May, Margaret, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises that:
(a)	poverty and hunger remain the most important challenges facing the international community;
(b)	the United Nation's World Food Program (WFP) remains the most effective way of alleviating world poverty; and
(c)	the WFP's mandate and mission are strongly relevant to Australia's overall humanitarian object-ives;
(2)	also recognises that:
(a)	the alleviation of poverty assists the building of political stability, aids in the provision of education and training, and lowers levels of sexually trans-mitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS;
(b)	the work of the WFP in its “Food for Work,” program assists in the provision of much needed infrastructure in some of the world's poorest nations;
(c)	the “Food for Life” program is the quickest and most effective way of providing displaced persons and those affected by natural disaster with lifesaving food when their own nation state is unable to provide assistance; and
(d)	the “Food for Growth” program is a vital means of providing food to pregnant women, school children and babies who would not otherwise receive adequate food to aid their growth;
(3)	understands that the Federal Government:
(a)	has a large financial commitment to the World Food Program on both an ongoing and an occasional basis; and
(b)	has committed $56.3 million since March 2002, including a contribution of $12.8 million to help ease the food crisis in southern Africa and a contribution of $1 million to assist the survivors of the Bam earthquake; and
(4)	congratulates:
(a)	the Federal Government on its ongoing support of the World Food Program; and
(b)	the World Food Program on 40 years of fighting hunger and poverty.
It has been said that the single greatest issue facing the world in the modern age is hunger. Hunger affects nearly 800 million people worldwide and contributes substantially to increased incidence of the AIDS virus, civil unrest and an ongoing lack of infrastructure in some of the world's poorest nations. Before beginning, I would like to thank my colleague the member for Pearce for seconding this motion. I understand that the member for Pearce, like me, has a longstanding interest in this area, and I congratulate her on joining me in recognising that the World Food Program is the world's most important and effective tool in the war against hunger. The WFP was created for only one purpose—to fight hunger—but in its 40-year history this aid program has surpassed its initial mandate and surprised even its creators with the length and scope of its effect on the lives of some of the world's poorest people.
In September 1960 the United States President, Dwight Eisenhower, proposed to the United Nations General Assembly that `a workable scheme should be devised for providing food aid through the UN system'. The World Food Program was scheduled to go into operation in 1963 as a three-year experimental program. The first session of WFP's governing body, the intergovernmental committee, was held in February 1962. Two months later, Addeke Boerma was appointed as the WFP's first executive director.
Recently, here in parliament, I had the privilege of attending a lunch with special guest Mr James T. Morris, who is the current Executive Director of the WFP—a remarkable man who, through his organisation, has achieved some remarkable results through three simple yet effective programs. The WFP has introduced far-reaching reforms and implemented a wide range of initiatives at the policy, strategic, administrative, program and project levels. Mr Morris and the WFP understand that productive communities cannot be developed when people are hungry, therefore the WFP has implemented some exciting and well-targeted programs for those special needs areas and communities. Today I would like to touch briefly on some of those programs.
There is the WFP food for work program. In this program, food is provided in exchange for work on the building of community assets and improving rural infrastructure. Food is often a more attractive form of payment for manual labour than cash in countries with poorly developed markets and sharply fluctuating food prices. Prior to this program, workers could be paid in the local currency and, by the time they could buy food, the local currency would have been devalued to such an extent that they might only buy a few morsels instead of the feast they had worked for. The food for work programhas removed any problems the devaluation of currency causes by paying workers in food, allowing major infrastructure projects, which will be beneficial to the whole community, to be built much more effectively, with a great benefit to those who are employed on these projects. I believe the WFP is to be congratulated for helping poor people build and preserve productive assets—assets which will lead some of the world's least developed countries on the road to self-reliance and diversification.
There is also the food for life program, which is the quickest and most effective way of providing lifesaving food to displaced persons and those affected by natural disaster, when their own nation or state is unable to provide assistance. Catastrophic events and natural disasters, sometimes on a daily basis—like an earthquake, a flood, civil unrest, armed conflict or drought—often require the WFP to act quickly and urgently to respond to these emergencies as they happen. From Armenia to Indonesia, from Bangladesh to Sierra Leone, from the Sudan to Afghanistan, the WFP has been there, because the WFP is an institution that for over 40 years has embodied the principle that food should reach people when they need it, wherever they need it.
There is also the food for growth program—a program that is vital in providing food to pregnant women, schoolchildren and babies who would otherwise not receive adequate food to aid their growth. It has been said that the future of all countries can be found in our children. It is for this reason that the WFP has school feeding programs in more than 60 countries around the world, helping some 15 million children per annum. That is some record. This program allows children to grow, attend school and eventually become productive members of society. Millions of people around the world would not have survived childhood and gone on to raise healthy children of their own had they not been fed, with the WFP's assistance, at critical moments in their lives. But even with so many children helped, there are around 12 million deaths of children under the age of five from malnutrition every year around the world. The food for growth program also targets expectant mothers, allowing pregnant women to have a much better chance of giving birth to a healthy child.
The WFP's work is not just about food. It is about the future and the type of world we all want to live in. Too often we bury our heads in the sand. Life is very comfortable here in Australia. We are a wealthy country in many ways. We need to remind ourselves of our obligations to those in our world who do not enjoy the standard of living we do. Hunger is a tragedy that kills not only individuals but also the creativity, productivity and hope of those who continue to survive. 
As I have said in my motion, the alleviation of poverty assists the building of political stability, aids in the provision of education and training and lowers levels of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV-AIDS. I am sure it is easy to see how food programs are beneficial to political stability, which in turn is beneficial to the long-term development of a nation, but I would like to highlight an interesting aspect of the WFP which attempts to halt the spread of AIDS. The WFP has collaborated with its partners to implement 16 different HIV specific projects. Among them is a pilot project in Armenia, where the number of newly infected people is rapidly increasing. The WFP provided food as part of a package of services that includes counselling and medical examinations. Another program is in China where the WFP worked closely with UNAIDS to bring information about the AIDS virus to over 200,000 farmers. In both of these cases, these programs have been remarkably effective. 
Mr Morris and his team deserve to celebrate the past 40 years of the WFP. They have a right to celebrate the many lives saved and the communities and countries that have been rebuilt with rehabilitation and development activities that help sustain populations after the onset of a disaster. But Mr Morris and the WFP need our support. They need the continuing support of countries around the world to continue this work. I am proud to say that Australia has contributed and will continue to contribute to the WFP. It is part of Australia's aid program. In 2003-04 Australia is providing $61.1 million in core contributions to UN development and humanitarian organisations. To the WFP, we are contributing $31 million. Our investment in WFP is an investment in a hunger free world.
The statistics speak for themselves. There is enough food in the world today for every man, woman and child to lead healthy and productive lives, yet one out of every seven people on this earth is suffering from hunger. The WFP's vision is a world in which everyone has access at all times to the nourishment they need for a full life. It believes that the issue of hunger belongs at the top of the international agenda. I too believe that is where the problem should stay. I have seen for myself the poverty, hunger and disease of developing countries. I have seen what happens to young children and nursing mothers when they do not receive the proper nutritional requirements they need for growth and development. Hungry children cannot be expected to learn—to sit in a classroom and achieve—and a nursing mother without proper nutrition will give birth to an underdeveloped child. 
The WFP needs help from us all. It has waged a war against hunger for 40 years and I have no doubt this will continue for another 40 years. We all need to get involved, to become aware, and of course the Australian government needs to continue its support through our overseas aid program of the World Food Program. It is important for the future of our world, our children, that this support is not only rhetoric. Words will not feed a hungry child. Food, however, will build a strong, healthy child who will become a productive member of the world community; food will help an expectant or nursing mother raise a healthy child; food will help a society build vital infrastructure; and food will help stop the spread of AIDS and civil unrest. 
Congratulations to the WFP on the occasion of their 40th anniversary. To James Morris and his team, I hope they enjoy another successful 40 years, but I hope they will have both moral and financial support from the international community, including Australia, so that the programs can continue to ensure a future for our children and the children of the world.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I thank the member for McPherson for moving this motion and bringing the work of the World Food Program to the attention of the House. This is an important debate and one where we must recognise that hunger and poverty remain the greatest challenge to face the world. We cannot ignore that the shortage of food and wealth among the majority of the world are a factor in heightened levels of terrorism. The United Nations World Food Program began 40 years ago to combat hunger in disaster areas and where poverty and illness act as an obstacle to socioeconomic development. While millions of people would not have survived childhood and grown into adults with families of their own without the assistance of the WFP, still too many millions of others continue to go hungry. The WFP's 40 Years of Fighting Hunger publication states: 
Hunger is a tragedy that kills not only individuals, but also the creativity, productivity and hope of those who continue to survive.
Today, in a world where wealth and economic growth prosper, it is a tragedy that millions of people still go hungry. The WFP continues to work to reduce levels of hunger and starvation. Success of the program's efforts can be seen in the reduction in the number of children who die from starvation. In 2002 the WFP assisted 72 million of the world's poorest people—14 million people were helped through development programs, 44 million people benefited from emergency operations and 14 million people were assisted through protracted relief and recovery operations. This included the provision of 3.6 million tonnes of food for hungry men, women and children.
In the 1960s almost one-third of children in developing countries died before reaching five years of age. Today this has been reduced to 10 per cent. However, this is still far too many. The WFP's 40 Years of Fighting Hunger publication also cites other significant successes in combating hunger. The number of chronically undernourished adults has dropped from more than 950 million in 1970 to 815 million in 2000. The number of underweight children has fallen from 221 million in 1980 to 160 million today, with expectations of a further decline to around 120 million by 2020. This is rather remarkable given that the world's population almost doubled during this period. However, we cannot forget that there are still around 24,000 people who die from hunger and related causes every day. In the developed world, where we waste so much food, it is time we reflected on the extravagance of such waste.
I will turn to comments made by the Executive Director of the World Food Program, James Morris, concerning the challenges that the organisation has faced in recent times: 
Widespread drought and natural disasters ... collapsing economic and political systems and HIV/AIDS have caused a dramatic increase in the demand for food aid. The numbers are telling: in 2002, the international community struggled to feed an additional 25 million people in Africa alone. WFP rose to this challenge, providing life-saving and livelihood-saving food to 72 million people in 82 countries. But the numbers do not tell the full story. Each number represents a person in need: a mother struggling to feed her family, a grandparent caring for orphans, a child hoping for a school meal, a returnee seeking new opportunities and assets. I have seen their faces and know that we can help.
Seventy-eight per cent of people helped by the World Food Program are women and children. The WFP runs the Into School, Out of Hunger program. Children are provided with meals at school to encourage those who go without food to attend classes. Children who attend school and have not had a good feed beforehand have a lower concentration level and are distracted by hunger. This can seriously affect their learning and over the long term it has a terrible effect on their life chances. Often they do not go to school at all—it is more important to a starving child to get enough to eat. In 2001, the World Food Program fed over 15 million children in schools in 57 countries.
Finally, I must comment on the last part of the member for McPherson's motion. I cannot support a call that the House congratulate the government for its ongoing support for the World Food Program when it has failed to maintain its overall obligations to overseas development assistance and population program funding. Australia's level of assistance is currently 0.25 per cent of GNI, having fallen from 0.36 per cent. The World Bank has advised that this figure needs to be doubled immediately if we are serious about addressing the issues of poverty, gender equity, women's empowerment and global health. The goal for OECD countries is 0.7 per cent. We must all make that commitment—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Food Program</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—I would also like to join in congratulating the member for McPherson for bringing forward this motion to the House. It is, as my colleague has said, a very important issue. On this 40th anniversary celebration, the motion draws attention to the very high level of poverty and hunger in the world today and the terrible things that ensue from that. I think it certainly continues to be one of the most persistent and challenging problems that the world faces. The fact that there are 800 million chronically undernourished people in a world that actually does have the capacity to produce sufficient food for all people is, I think, the greatest tragedy of all. This problem could be solved if everyone took responsibility for it and if all of us who have food on our plates every day were willing to perhaps consider just sharing a little with those who do not have it. It is a very persistent and challenging problem. It is one that can be solved only if everyone participates in contributing to the solutions.
Australia is a significant contributor of food aid and, importantly, food security. One of Australia's great strengths, I think, is in providing its agricultural expertise to many countries in the world to encourage them to grow their own produce. You will find Australians working in many parts of the world, some of which I have travelled to. There are some outposts in Tibet where Australian aid money was helping to provide water, because, without water and wells, people are unable to grow their own produce very successfully. So Australia's contribution is not just in hard, cold cash and sometimes in produce; it is also in practical programs to help people to become self-reliant and self-sufficient. I know that is one of the major thrusts of the UN World Food Program. It promotes self-reliance through food for work projects such as terracing hillsides, repairing irrigation and other major infrastructure works. I too join in congratulating James T. Morris, the Executive Director of the World Food Program. I also had the pleasure of meeting him recently, when he visited Parliament House. The work they do is immense. It started a long time ago, back in 1960, when then President Dwight Eisenhower set this program in train.
I spoke in this House earlier about the war in Iraq. I made the point then that if, in the longer term, we seriously think that we can tackle terrorism and maintain peace in the world, we will have to look deeper than we already have for some of the answers. I feel really quite certain that crippling debt and poverty mean that the desperate and dispossessed provide easy targets for those who are intent on recruiting people from poverty stricken areas—those who play on that desperation and dispossession to create additional conflict and division between peoples, countries and religions. So a commitment by us to work towards the eradication of poverty has become vital, I believe, in ridding the world of the threat of terrorist acts and future wars.
Equally vital should be our commitment to rehabilitating countries like Iraq that have faced hard times. According to the figures that I got from UNICEF around the time of the Iraq war, almost half of Iraq's total population are children, with 11.3 million under the age of 18. Of 3.5 million children under the age of five, more than one in eight died before their fifth birthday. This is in a country that is actually a wealthy one. A lot of that problem comes from not having an adequate diet, as my colleague has already very ably pointed out. There is much more I could say about this, but it is important that we all work together to eradicate poverty and food shortages throughout the world. I congratulate the World Food Program and James T. Morris on this 40th anniversary and for the contribution they make in fighting hunger and poverty in the world today.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Food Program</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Despite rising poverty levels in Australia, extreme life-threatening hunger is almost invisible here. We rarely encounter it face to face. However, global problems of hunger and malnutrition are actually getting worse, not better. Roughly 10 million people die each year due to hunger and malnutrition. The vast majority of these victims are women and children. Tragically, in the next five minutes alone, 62 children will die from hunger and malnutrition. Fortunately there are many valuable organisations, such as the United Nations World Food Program, working towards alleviating this tragic situation. Established in 1963, the World Food Program is the United Nations' front-line agency in the fight against global hunger, feeding over 72 million people in 82 countries every year, and providing millions more with much-needed education and infrastructure.
Labor supports and wholeheartedly congratulates the government for its financial support of such a worthy organisation. I would also like to congratulate the member for McPherson for introducing this motion and giving us the opportunity to speak about the world food bank in the parliament today. However, despite the government's recognition that the World Food Program's mission and mandate are strongly relevant to Australia's overall humanitarian objectives, and despite the member for McPherson's recognition that the World Food Program remains the most effective way of alleviating world poverty, fighting AIDS, promoting education and building political stability, the government's overall financial support of this program and associated humanitarian agencies has decreased. 
The government's recent announcement to withdraw from the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a partner organisation of the world food bank and the only development bank with a specific charter to alleviate rural poverty in developing countries through agricultural development, is a good example of this. Such withdrawal is extraordinary, given the government's vocal support for poverty alleviation and agricultural development. It is extraordinary, given that all other OECD nations have significantly increased their contributions to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, with the US boosting its funding of the fund by 50 per cent.
It would seem that much of the government's talk on the value of humanitarian aid is in danger of being merely rhetoric. Even more extraordinary is the government's lack of adequate assistance in the reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Responding to these politically induced crises, which have left millions without essential food and infrastructure, has increased the demands on the World Food Program's limited budget by some 20 per cent. Australia's financial contribution to the World Food Program's Iraq reconstruction fund has not increased by this same proportion. 
The extent of the Howard government's minimal commitment to the humanitarian and economic reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan was apparent at the international donors' conferences following both conflicts. Seventy governments attended the conferences, each represented by ministers and senior government members. The Australian government, in contrast, sent only low-level and junior representation. This lack of high-level representation is reflected in the dimensions of its financial contribution to economic reconstruction. If the government is serious about humanitarian aid, and truly values the role played by the UN, it has to be consistent in its approach to aid and to the United Nations. Lip-service will not save lives, and will only diminish our international reputation as good citizens and good neighbours.
It is imperative that the government reprioritises humanitarian aid and the value of the United Nations. Fortunately, there are plenty of opportunities for it to do so. It is not too late to contribute more funds to the World Food Program or reverse our withdrawal from the International Fund for Agricultural Development. If the government is serious about liberating the people of Iraq it must increase its support of the reconstruction effort.
Labor recognises that it is both our moral responsibility and in our national interests to provide greater financial support to the WFP, and specifically to the reconstruction efforts in Iraq. We recognise that alleviating hunger and poverty is the most effective way of fostering stability, education and health in poverty-stricken nations. In this era of international political volatility, promoting stability in such nations is of more importance than ever. Indeed, it is a matter of national and international security, and our best weapon in the war against terror. Filling the stomachs and educating the minds of African or Middle Eastern children is our best weapon against recruitment by terrorist organisations, such as al-Qaeda, who use poverty and seeming Western arrogance and nonchalance as a major recruiter. The terrorist attacks on New York, Washington, Bali and now Madrid are a chilling indication of what can happen when prosperous nations ignore the plight of the world's disadvantaged and marginalised people. It is in fact our moral responsibility as a stable and prosperous nation to look after those countries that are less fortunate.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—It is a pleasure, as always, to speak in the chamber of the House of Representatives. First of all, I want to commend and congratulate the member for McPherson for bringing this motion to the parliament for discussion and debate. I also want to congratulate her on her unanimous endorsement for the seat of McPherson by Liberal Party members in her electorate. I want to speak on this motion wearing three hats. Firstly, of course, I want to speak as the federal member for Ryan, representing my constituency; secondly, I want to speak as the chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Population and Development; and, thirdly, I want to speak as an Australian—a resident and citizen of this country. I think this is a fantastic motion and it is something that members of parliament must discuss, debate and provoke some discussion about in the community.
Poverty and hunger certainly remain an absolutely critical challenge for all countries of the international community and of course for this country as well. Over 800 million people are chronically undernourished in a world that can actually provide them with food. This world of ours does have the capacity and the resources to feed us all. But we see on many continents of the world people suffering through malnourishment and poverty. It is something that this government and this country must do something about in our own small way.
Poverty reduction is certainly a key objective of the Australian aid program, and the United Nations World Food Program is a vehicle by which this can be done. I understand that the World Food Program plans to assist some 65 million people in 2004, of whom an estimated 54 per cent will be women and girls. The corresponding projected food aid needs are estimated at 5.1 million tonnes and valued at nearly $US3 billion. As we know, the current world climate is not pleasant. In fact, it is an indictment of our world and all those who are leaders of governments and nations around the world.
As a citizen of this country, a member of the House of Representatives and the federal member for Ryan, I encourage all governments around the world to come together to address this issue because of the number of people that are afflicted by something that is completely unnecessary. It is an absolute shame. I want to call on those of us who are leaders in our community, particularly those of us who are leaders of governments and nations, to come together and maybe try and bring together something like the Marshall Plan, which the world witnessed after World War II. If we had a war on poverty and hunger we might not have some of the terrible issues that we face today. We might not be having a war on terror. If we try and address some of the root causes of poverty and hunger, we might be able to make a difference in our world.
This financial year, the Australian government announced a $1 billion food security pledge over five years. That is one way in which this country can make a difference, and I want to commend the government for that. Over one billion people—one-fifth of the world's population—live in extreme poverty. Two-thirds of them live in our own Asia-Pacific region. Reducing poverty in our region is the key challenge for Australia's aid program. As a small country with 20 million people we cannot do everything, but we can certainly play our part. As a member of the Howard Liberal government, I am certainly very much encouraging those that lead this government to continue to act very strongly and keep their eye on that important aspect of Australian government policy.
Australia has supported the World Food Program since its establishment over four decades ago. We have been a good international citizen in that respect. I want to comment on one country in particular—Vietnam, where Australia's regular contributions over the last five financial years have been substantial. I say that because I am the chairman of the Australia-Vietnam parliamentary committee and because it is something that we should be very proud of. There is, of course, much more that we can do—there is always going to be much more that we can do. I know that members of the parliament would want us to do as much as we can and to acknowledge that there is probably much more that we can do. Feeding the people of the world who are less fortunate and privileged than us is our obligation.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—The motion sponsored by the honourable member for McPherson gives the House an opportunity to discuss something which is very important if we are to achieve world peace. The eradication of poverty and hunger must be the utmost aim if we are to achieve that worthwhile goal. The work of the World Food Program is, quite rightly, acknowledged by this debate. Over its 40 years of existence the World Food Program has done quite a lot. In 2002, it assisted 72 million people in 82 countries. In its 40 years of existence it has invested something in the order of $US27.8 billion and has contributed more than 43 million tonnes of food to combat hunger and promote economic and social development and provide relief assistance in emergencies throughout the world.
But, despite that, the challenge is quite enormous and continues. In 2000, under the UN umbrella, 189 countries endorsed eight millennium development goals. The first of these was to halve the number of poor and hungry people by 2015. If we look at the progress three years on, much of this dream remains unfulfilled. In order to achieve the goal, the number of hungry people must be reduced by 24 million people each year from now until 2015—almost 10 times the pace achieved since the early 1990s. Simply put, in the 45 minutes allotted to this debate today something like 750 people will die because of hunger. We need to support the United Nations World Food Program. We need to support their work to give people a chance to break the cycle of daily deprivation, to encourage education, self-sufficiency and stability, to help refugees return home and to give children the chance to escape exploitation.
Last December, in a delegation led by you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I visited two projects sponsored by the World Food Program in urban Jakarta. They were samples of the work that the World Food Program does which give an indication of its importance. In Jakarta, behind the streetscape that gives some image of prosperity, we found the slums beside the river in Cipinang Besar Salatan. We saw the work of the implementing partner—a non-government organisation known as PaRaM, or Food for Poor People. We saw the way in which the 600 or so families that lived in this area received subsidised rice. But importantly, the undernourished children that lived in the community were given a soy based nutrition supplement and mothers were given assistance through a nutrition program. We also went to a slum that, chillingly, was erected in a cemetery in Menteng Atas, where the dwellings were over graveyards. Here, a consortium called the Consortium for the Empowerment of the Poor is the implementing partner. Here, it tries to give some self-sufficiency to those people that find themselves as urban poor or internally displaced people.
This type of work, to which Australia has contributed funding, is very important, even in a near neighbour of ours such as Indonesia. As has been discussed in this debate, even though the World Food Program as a multilateral effort under the auspices of the United Nations is most important, regrettably, I suppose, each of the contributing nations needs to have a look at the way in which they can increase their contribution. Whilst it is acknowledged that Australia contributes to the World Food Program, regrettably the $31 million that will go to the WFP this financial year is a figure that indicates the way in which our support is tracking downwards from 1996-97, when it was nearly $54 million, and its peak in 2000-01, when it was $92 million. The percentage of GDP that is devoted to overseas development aid in total is now 0.25 per cent. This is down from a peak in 1974-75 of half a per cent of GDP and 0.32 per cent in 1995-96. The ALP's national platform accepts the internationally agreed aid target of 0.7 per cent of GNP, but, in the interim, Labor hopes to go, as quickly as circumstances permit, back to the 1995-96 target of 0.32 per cent of GNP. This criticism is not only of the present administration; I acknowledge that the Labor government that I was a member of reduced this aid—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Food Program</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NATS,2004-03-22,"—I would like to thank the member for McPherson for bringing this motion to the chamber's attention, giving us all an opportunity to talk about our aspirations. The member for Scullin was quite right in his opening remarks: a world of peace cannot have such people enduring poverty and hunger in such large proportions. It is very much a substantial part of what we can do. I wanted to contribute to the debate, because I often hear a mean-minded spirit in the Australian community with the inference that charity begins at home. I have absolutely no support for that position at all. Surely from our position of affluence we can meet the needs of others, particularly of near neighbours, whose fortunes are not as prosperous as our own.
It is interesting to look over the 40 years of the history of the World Food Program. It was instigated in 1960 in an initiative of United States President Dwight Eisenhower. He proposed to the UN General Assembly that `a workable scheme should be devised for providing food aid through the UN system'. The WFP was scheduled to go into operation in 1963 as a three-year experimental program. The first session of the WFP's governing body, the intergovernmental committee, was held in February 1962. Two months later Addeke Boerma was appointed as the WFP's first executive director and it was on its way. Now, 40 years later, we can discuss its successes.
I am pleased to see that the WFP's mandate and mission have been strongly relevant to the Australian government's overall humanitarian objectives over the years. The WFP continues to perform well, under strong leadership that is committed to the reform process and improving efficiencies and the impact that food has in vital regions around the globe. Over the past 10 years the WFP itself has been through a period of major change and has transformed itself into a more strategic organisation, capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to emergency situations. It has introduced far-reaching reforms and implemented a wide range of initiatives at the policy, strategic, administrative and program level. In response to points that both the member for Calwell and the member for Scullin have made about Australia's reduction of its regular contribution to $31 million, this has been done in order to assist that flexibility, so that where immediate crises occur—such as the earthquake in Bam or other crises that communities are confronted with—Australia can play its part in making contributions.
Australia has contributed $7.7 million to the WFP though the UN flash appeal for Iraq, including $3 million to support food distribution, $2.7 million to support logistic services and $2 million to support the UN humanitarian air service, which provides support for WFP and other UN agency operations. WFP fed the bulk of Iraq's 27 million people for a period of seven years under the UN oil for food program, which used Iraqi oil revenues to purchase and manage $46 billion worth of humanitarian supplies and projects. Since 21 November last year the WFP has been assisting with the handover of the oil for food program to the coalition provisional authority and to new Iraqi ministries.
I am really pleased to see that Australia's latest cash contribution of $12.8 million will be used by the WFP to provide urgent assistance to millions of Africans. Certainly, Africa—and you think of the Horn of Africa all the way down to the south—is vulnerable to severe drought, which we know a little about in Australia, having endured the worst of our own in 100 years; failed harvests; and, in some cases, very poor governance, particularly in Zimbabwe, which is the worst affected country, with 7.5 million people, including 65 per cent of the urban population, needing assistance. So things are bad under poor administrative governance—very bad government—in Zimbabwe.
So I join with other members to congratulate the WFP on 40 years of strong activity. They are well respected by governments around the world. I am pleased the Australian government places such a high priority on assisting developing countries with food security under the range and variety of programs that other members have described. I am proud to stand here and see that Australia and Australians are playing an important part.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>World Food Program</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Why do many in this House today support this motion regarding the World Food Program and why has the member for McPherson raised it in the House today? I would like to think that it is part of our social conscience to raise many of these issues which are not necessarily up there in our faces in the media at the moment. It is rather appalling that, despite the belief to the contrary, there is enough food in the world today for every man, woman and child to lead a healthy and productive life and yet, unfortunately, hunger is still dispersed around the whole world.
Some people in their speeches on this topic have mentioned some of the statistics: let me give you some appalling ones. According to the UN, nowadays hunger afflicts one out of every seven people on earth—more than 800 million people. Each day 24,000 people die from hunger and related causes. Around the world 77 million people were sustained by World Food Program food initiatives in 2001. The frightening thing is that 78 per cent of those were women and children.
The World Food Program's vision is a world in which everyone has access at all times to the nourishment they need for a full and sustainable life. WFP believes that the issue of hunger belongs at the top of the international agenda. At present, the war against terrorism has centre stage in most international forums. In the case of Iraq, the agency will bring some 2.5 million tonnes of food aid into Iraq during the next six months, at a total cost of $US1.735 billion. That is the biggest challenge in the agency's 40-year history. I am pleased to say that Australia has donated $US3.8 million to Iraq's reconstruction.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Last Wednesday, I wrote to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, Mr Andy Becker, drawing to his attention the fact that there are 14 people enrolled on the Commonwealth electoral roll at 43 Leylands Parade, Belmore, in my electorate of Watson. This address is not a block of flats or a boarding house; it is an ordinary suburban home. How can 14 people—who have three different family names and all of whom are of voting age—possibly reside in the same suburban house? Where do they sleep? Remember, these are all adults. What about the children under voting age? Where do they sleep? I have to say that the morning bathroom queue must be very busy.
One of the people enrolled at this address is Councillor John Koutsouras, who is standing as a candidate for the position of Mayor of Canterbury in the local government elections to be held this coming Saturday, 27 March 2004.
—A rort.
—This is a rort and it is electoral fraud. These are not itinerant voters or people in hospital. This is a cynical manipulation of the electoral laws by Mr Koutsouras. These people have been on the electoral roll at 43 Leylands Parade since before the last federal election was held. Did they vote then or are they just on the roll to vote for Mr Koutsouras in the mayoral election on Saturday? I urge the Australian Electoral Commissioner to take urgent action on this matter.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to comments on the Sunday program on 14 March by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, who said:
The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq. 
Given that the Prime Minister immediately called his chief of staff and told him to contact Mr Keelty, what did the Prime Minister instruct his chief of staff to tell the commissioner?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Terrorism</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—While I will perhaps not say I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question, not surprisingly the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question on this matter and I will take a moment to reply. Could I start by saying that, as both the Leader of the Opposition and I said in our remarks a few moments ago, the Madrid attack has been a brutal reminder that all nations, irrespective of their stance on particular issues, are vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Madrid is another warning to Australia that it could happen here. Madrid in Spain has now joined Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Turkey and the Philippines as countries that have seen terrorist attacks on their soil in the past 12 months. In addition, there is of course Iraq. These attacks have, as I noted earlier, taken the lives of many hundreds of people without regard to their race, their nationality, their religion or their political beliefs.
As I know the Leader of the Opposition would appreciate, particularly at a time of greater focus on security issues, not only is there regular contact between my office, my department and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police but there is also extensive communication and collaboration between relevant agencies concerned with intelligence and security matters. Such contact is of necessity confidential. There were discussions last week between me, my chief of staff, the secretary of my department and the commissioner. Those discussions arose from the commissioner's interview on Channel 9 on Sunday, 14 March 2004. There was nothing at all improper about those discussions. They respected fully the operational role and the independence of the Australian Federal Police. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police continues to enjoy the full confidence of the government. Under his leadership the Australian Federal Police have shown great professional competence. This was particularly the case in the investigations which followed the Bali attack.
It remains the government's view that Australia was a terrorist target before we joined military operations in Iraq. Immediately prior to the war in Iraq the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation advised the government that, in the absence of specific and credible evidence, Australia's involvement would not warrant a raising of the overall threat level in Australia. Threat levels in respect of some foreign interests in Australia were raised and so too in respect of some Australian interests overseas, especially in the Middle East. I put this on the public record here in parliament almost a year ago, on 24 March 2003. This is why at the time of the Iraq war the overall threat level in Australia was not lifted. At no time—and I stress this to the House—since the conclusion of the war in Iraq has the government received any contrary advice from any relevant agency. The Director-General of ASIO said last week:
... we ... know that al-Qaida had an active interest in carrying out a terrorist attack in Australia well before 11 September and that we remain a target.
ASIO has informed the government that there is intelligence that Australia was a potential terrorist target before 11 September 2001. In 2001 a planned attack on our high commission in Singapore was uncovered. On 3 November 2001 bin Laden made reference to Australian involvement in East Timor. The Bali attack took place months before the war in Iraq. Whatever the causes of terrorism and whatever rationalisations terrorists may seek to ascribe to individual acts of terrorism for propaganda purposes, the reality of dealing with terrorism remains the focus of my government's attention. I hope that I speak for all members of the House in declaring again that Australia will never be intimidated into altering its attitude on any issue by threats of terrorism.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I seek leave to move the following motion:
—Is the member for Fraser aware of the fact that I have already warned him? Leave is granted.
—I move:
That this House censures the Prime Minister for:
(1)	political interference in the work of the Australian Federal Police, in an attempt to compromise the public standing and inde-pendence of its Commissioner;
(2)	failing to rule out further political interference with the Australian Federal Police in the future; and
(3)	jeopardising Australia's national security by playing politics with the Australian Federal Police, rather than putting Australia's national security first.
This is a desperate government led by a desperate Prime Minister who will say and do anything to get himself out of trouble, even muzzling and trying to humiliate the head of the Australian Federal Police. What happened to Mr Mick Keelty last week was an absolute national disgrace that compromised the role and independence of Australia's chief law enforcement officer. Even worse, it compromised the integrity of those who purport to make Australia's national security policy. It compromised the right of the Australian people to know the truth during these troubled these times and to know the truth about the threat to Australia and the foreign policy failings of the Howard government.
And what was Mick Keelty's sin at the end of the day? His sin was nothing more than honesty. His sin, in the eyes of this Prime Minister, was nothing more than telling the truth. What was it that drove the Prime Minister to reach for the phone and tell his chief of staff to get on the phone and harangue and complain to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police? What was it that was so offensive to this Prime Minister that came from the mouth of Mick Keelty on that Sunday morning? This is what the Commissioner had to say on the Sunday program on 14 March. He said:
The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.
That is all: the simple, plain truth—simple, plain honesty in what the commissioner would have thought was in the best interest of the Australian people. And it is a truth that the Australian people themselves understand. If you went to any shopping centre in this country and read those words out, people would say, `That is a statement of the obvious.' If you went to any playgroup around Australia and read those words out, people would say, `Well, that's fair enough. That is a totally unremarkable thing for someone like the Australian Federal Police Commissioner to say.' If you went to any workplace in the country, they would say, in Australian language, `Oh, Mick Keelty's being fair dinkum. He's being fair dinkum. He's calling it as he sees it. He's doing nothing more than that.' Yet this was the thing that was so offensive to the Prime Minister.
The commissioner had not even left the green room—he had barely got his make-up off—before he received the haranguing, complaining call from the Prime Minister's chief of staff. And what was it that was so offensive to this government? Well, Commissioner Keelty said it himself in the same interview a few sentences later. He said:
... I think there's a level of honesty that has to exist here in terms of what the problems are ... not only in Australia but in our region.
That is the thing that this Prime Minister finds so offensive. That is what has driven him to harangue and try to publicly humiliate the Police Commissioner: a level of honesty he has not got himself and has not got in the attitudes and policies of this government. The truth is that Mick Keelty has earned the right to speak publicly on these matters. He, more than any other Australian, has earned the right to speak honestly about these matters. He is a fine police officer respected right around the country. He played a magnificent role in the Bali investigation—a magnificent role in every respect. He is, indeed, one of our national champions, and he did not deserve to be treated this way by a government that did not like the truth, that did not like honesty, that wanted to put its own narrow political interests ahead of Australia's national interest, and that wanted to play politics with Australia's national security.
It is a level of honesty that has offended the Prime Minister, but, quite frankly, it is no great surprise in this place, because this is a Prime Minister who finds it hard to handle the truth. We know that from the kids overboard; we know that from the ethanol scandal; we know that from the ministerial scandals that have led to the junking of the code of conduct; and we know that from weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It is a pattern of behaviour by this Prime Minister. With this Prime Minister there is always a missing piece to the puzzle; there is always something that he never tells the Australian people. He is always loose with the truth. That is the defining characteristic of his prime ministership—
—I warn the member for McEwen!
—and the way in which his government tries to run national security: always loose with the truth. In this case, it was something that he did not want Commissioner Keelty to say to the Australian people—not something that was surprising to the Australian people, not something that they would have regarded as out of the ordinary, but something that he did not want Commissioner Keelty to tell the Australian people—and that is that, while Australia was a target at the time of September 11, the government's policy on Iraq has made things worse. That is the thing that this Prime Minister did not want the Australian people to be told by the commissioner: that, while Australia was a target at the time of September 11, his government's policy on Iraq has made things worse.
The Prime Minister did not want the truth out there publicly, so he attempted to muzzle and disparage the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. Within minutes of the commissioner being on the program, the Prime Minister reacts, his gut instinct: `Let's cover up the truth. Let's try and manipulate the situation, manipulate the information for narrow political advantage.' It is the reflex action of someone who has been in politics too long, playing an old style of manipulating and trying to control the truth and the flow of information at any cost. So he is straight on the blower to his chief of staff and within moments the chief of staff calls, complains and harangues the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to try and make him retract, to try and make him toe the government line. He had not even left the green room. And by Tuesday the commissioner had been forced into a so-called clarifying statement about which we are still trying to get answers. Was it urged by and perhaps even written in the Prime Minister's office? These are the questions the Prime Minister would not answer in question time today.
In fact, it is a funny thing: I read in Alan Ramsey's column on Saturday in the Sydney Morning Herald a more revealing account of what happened, straight out of the Prime Minister's press office, than what the Prime Minister gave the parliament today. What has happened to our democracy when there is a higher level of accountability in an Alan Ramsey column on a Saturday than from the Australian Prime Minister in question time in the House of Representatives? This is what Ramsey wrote:
And when this column phoned Howard's senior staff spokesman, Tony O'Leary, later that day, he confirmed Sinodinos had phoned Keelty about the Iraq remark - a “potential media problem”, he called it - and said Sinodinos had made the call only after a “conversation” with Howard.
There is greater accountability from Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald on a Saturday morning tossed on your front lawn than from the Australian Prime Minister in question time in the House of Representatives. This is political interference with an independent statutory officer. This is political interference of the worst kind with the top law enforcement officer in the land. I have to say this—and all Australians know it: politics has no place in the management of Australia's national security. Politics has no place in trying to keep the Australian people safe and sound from the threat of terrorism. This should be about the national interest, not the narrow political interests of a Prime Minister who has been around too long and whose reflex action is to try and manipulate and control the information rather than have the truth out there available to the Australian people.
This is a government of control freaks that has gotten well and truly out of control. Their first tactic, of course, was to disparage, to criticise and to try and run down the credibility of the Police Commissioner. On the Monday, the Prime Minister was out there implying that Mr Keelty did not know what he was talking about. This is what the Prime Minister said:
There is a difference between the intelligence judgments that are brought to bear in relation to these organisations and the operational functions of police commissioners and police forces.
He nods his head in agreement. Why then, Prime Minister, has the Attorney-General placed the following answer in the Hansard today? The Attorney-General has said in answer to a question from the member for Barton that Australian Federal Police officers seconded to the National Threat Assessment Centre will be `fully integrated NTAC analysts and, as such, will be directly responsible for the preparation of threat assessments'. That appears in the Hansard today, directly contradicting the Prime Minister's statement last Monday when he said that the Police Commissioner and his organisation are not involved in intelligence judgments. No, they are involved in the preparation of threat assessment on the admission of the Attorney-General in the House Hansard today. And, of course, after Bali and after the outstanding work of the Federal Police in Bali, they received extra intelligence analysis that confirm the point that Mr Keelty was well qualified and well capable of making these comments off his own bat—well qualified and well capable in the eyes of the Australian people in making these comments.
Then the campaign of criticism of and disparaging a good man, Mr Keelty, continued into the Tuesday. If you had to run a lottery, if you had to guess, about who was going to be the lowest of the low, of course you would turn to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When they need to go in for the low blow, when they need to go in for the lowest of all comments, they can always rely on the member for Mayo. This is what he said on Tuesday before the issue of the so-called clarification statement:
I think he—
Keelty—
is just expressing ... a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we're getting from al-Qaeda.
What a disgraceful thing to say about a good man. Here is a man, Mick Keelty, dedicating his working life to stopping al-Qaeda, being compared by the foreign minister to their propaganda.
—A complete misrepresentation. That is a disgraceful thing to say.
—A man who is dedicating his working life to protecting the Australian people from al-Qaeda—
—Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs! 
—I warn the Minister for Foreign Affairs!
—and he is being compared by the foreign minister to their propaganda. You disgrace, you rotten lousy disgrace, to say that about a good man—Mick Keelty. It is an absolutely shocking thing to do.
—The Leader of the Opposition! I will not tolerate remarks being addressed other than through the chair. I would point out to a number of members on both sides of the House the obligations under standing order 55.
Honourable members interjecting—
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will resume his seat. I have already had occasion to warn the members for McEwen, Blaxland, Ballarat, Fowler, Lingiari, Fraser and Swan.
—And Mayo.
—and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would point out to the House that whoever has the call is entitled to be heard, as standing order 55 provides. I have applied the standing order fairly and have not prevented members from being supportive of speakers, but I will not have people interrupted by interjection. I intend to continue to apply that fairly.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I think, through previous precedents as well as commonsense, it is perfectly clear that for the Leader of the Opposition to descend to such vile language as calling somebody a `rotten lousy disgrace' definitely demands a withdrawal, is way over the top and is language that demeans this parliament.
Honourable members interjecting—
—The minister will resume his seat. If it is necessary for me to remove one of the people I have warned, including those on the frontbench on both sides, in order to get order I will do so. The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the reflection on the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
—At your insistence, I will withdraw, Mr Speaker, but I do point out that I do regard it as a disgrace that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would compare Mick Keelty to the propaganda we are getting from al-Qaeda. That is a disgrace, and it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. This is someone who has dedicated his working life to stopping al-Qaeda and he ends up being compared to their propaganda by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is indicative of a government of control freaks—muzzling, disparaging, all about a statement of the obvious. The only sin that has been committed by the Police Commissioner is the sin of truth in the eyes of the government. He got outside the Liberal Party line. He got outside the Liberal Party line, and they are still at it.
Not having learnt from the experience of last week, there was the Attorney-General on the Meet the Press program yesterday, and when he was asked about the public having a right to see the Police Commissioner as an independent figure, not just like any other public servant, and to hear from him direct, the Attorney-General said, no, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner has no right, no public role, he is just an adviser to the government with no independent role and he has spoken directly to the Australian people. That is unlike every single Police Commissioner in this country. Independent statutory officers have the right to speak directly to the Australian people on matters of concern when it lies within their judgment. And the great irony in this is that it is all about the government's decision to send Australia to war in Iraq, and they did that in the name of freedom and democracy. Freedom and democracy was the justification this government gave for going to war in Iraq. Yet now the Commissioner, Mr Keelty, has not got the freedom to speak publicly in his own country. They have denied him the basic democratic freedom of speaking his mind directly and honestly to the Australian people. It is an absolute disgrace and it is being condemned by police commissioners and former commissioners around the country. 
Why is it that this government has so much trouble facing up to the reality of its Iraq policy? Australia was a target on September 11, but the government's decision making in relation to Iraq has made the situation worse. We know that the situation has worsened. The member for Warringah, the Minister for Health and Ageing, the third-ranking Liberal in the House of Representatives, said prior to the conflict:
I have no doubt that there is a sense in which our actions have put us more clearly on the radar screen of terrorists.
Why is it so hard for the government to acknowledge that truth when it came from the mouth of the minister for health, the third-ranking Liberal in the House of Representatives, prior to the conflict? Then just last Tuesday, Paul Wolfowitz, the US Deputy Secretary of Defense—wouldn't you think he knew something about it?—and one of the architects of the war in Iraq, said:
So Spain has been a real standup country, and I suppose maybe that's one of the reasons why they came under attack.
So this is a truth that is acknowledged around the globe by people on the conservative side of politics, but it is not a truth that this Prime Minister will allow Commissioner Keelty to utter on national TV for the benefit and information of the Australian people. It is a truth that has been repeated in this country by Ken Moroney, the New South Wales Police Commissioner. So why can't the government face up to reality? Why is it that they always need to put politics into our national security? Our national security in fact needs to be based on the truth. It needs to be based on an honest assessment. The truth is that the government did not go to war with Iraq for regime change—the Prime Minister said as much at the National Press Club on 13 March last year; they went to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction that do not appear to exist. It is a failure of intelligence and a failure of policy.
This was the side of politics, the neoconservative side, that said that they had one big thing to offer in the war against terror—the doctrine of pre-emption. It is a policy failure now barely mentioned—hidden away in the attic like a mad uncle. The doctrine of pre-emption is barely mentioned by any of the neoconservatives. All the rhetoric about the axis of evil—
—The member for Canning is warned!
—was their big neoconservative contribution to the war against terror, and now they cannot stomach the truth. They cannot stomach the truth of their policy failings. Having committed Australia for a core purpose that was not realised—a core purpose that was not true in Iraq—they now cannot stomach the truth when it comes from the mouth of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner.
The real truth, Prime Minister, is this: the war against terror is primarily an intelligence war. It is not a war primarily against nation states. We have to target the terrorists. In fact, the conflict in Iraq diverted resources away from that process of targeting the terrorists—al-Qaeda and bin Laden. The capacity of intelligence to track them down and do something about them is the key to winning the war against terror. It is not the folly of Iraq; it is not the errors that this government made in committing Australia to that conflict. Now the government should simply accept the truth of what Commissioner Keelty has been saying—the truth that, sure, Australia was a target at the time of September 11 but the conflict and policy making for Iraq has made the situation even worse.
This is the thing that we need to appreciate. This is the reason why the Prime Minister should be censured by the House. You cannot trust the Howard government with Australia's national security. It is always playing politics, instead of putting the national interest first. The Prime Minister's actions have disgraced the high office that he holds. He should not put narrow political interest ahead of the national interest—never. That is never in the best interests of our great country, and he should be censured by this parliament accordingly.
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—This is the first censure motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition in his new capacity, and of course it is a new experience for me and a new experience for him. It is a censure motion from the Leader of the Opposition—
—The member for Hotham is warned!
—which will be best remembered for a red-faced, over-the-top denunciation of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This House will remember that the crescendo, the piece de resistance, of the Leader of the Opposition's attack was to go red in the face, lose control, hurl abuse at the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and then, of course, proceed in a very repetitious way and go over and over again, using essentially the same language, the same accusation for 20 minutes.
Let me go to the essence of what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. What the Leader of the Opposition is obsessed with—and what many of those opposite who sit with him are obsessed with—is not the reputation of the Federal Police Commissioner, not the independence of our intelligence agency, not the role of the Australian Federal Police in providing protection to the Australian people but the decision that this government took to commit Australian military forces to the coalition operation in Iraq. The one phrase that the Leader of the Opposition used that really leapt out at me was `the government's policy on Iraq has made things worse'. If you look at the substance of this debate, that is a statement that bears a certain amount of examination, because it really goes to the basis of the obsession that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party have with this issue.
Before I come to that, let me say something of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner. It is predictable, of course, that the Leader of the Opposition should flounce in here and say what a magnificent person the commissioner is. The Leader of the Opposition should go through the motions of saying how magnificent the Australian Federal Police are. Lest there be any doubt about it, I hold the Federal Police Commissioner in very high regard. I have enormous respect for the work that he has done. Over the last 16 or 18 months, in the wake of the tragedy in Bali, nobody has done more in a leadership role in any of the government agencies to prosecute the will and indeed the wishes of the Australian people than the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The operational cooperation that occurred between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police in tracking down those who murdered 88 of our number in Bali deserves the gratitude of this country and parliament and has received that gratitude through me on numerous occasions. Let us put aside any suggestion at the beginning of this debate that I as Prime Minister, or anybody in this government, is anything other than enormously respectful of the role of the Australian Federal Police as an effective operational force.
But let us also understand that, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, in advising the government there are different roles for different agencies. There can be no argument that the prime adviser to the government on security assessment issues is the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. In asserting that, I am not in any way denigrating the role of the police.
—I warn the member for Hasluck!
—I am not saying that Mick Keelty is not up to his job; I am simply stating the obvious. Everybody knows the difference between operational police work and intelligence work. The Leader of the Opposition is quite correct when he says that, in fighting terrorism, your most important weapon is intelligence.
—The member for Denison!
—In making judgments as Prime Minister about the threat assessment that might be important to this country—
—Under standing order 304A, the member for Denison will excuse himself from the House.
The member for Denison then left the chamber.
—In making judgments about the threat assessment, the organisation that I will listen to most is the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. But let me remind the Leader of the Opposition yet again that, when the government took the correct decision, in my view—a decision I will never apologise for and never retreat from—to commit this country to military operations in Iraq, we sought the advice of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. We asked whether, as a consequence, we had to lift the general threat level in this country. We were told: `No, you do not lift the general threat level in this country. You lift the threat level for certain foreign assets in Australia. You lift the threat level for Australian assets overseas in certain parts of the world. But you do not lift the general threat level in Australia.' That is what I was told by the Director-General of ASIO back in March 2003.
Nobody in the intelligence or security community dissented from that advice. ASIS did not dissent. ONA did not dissent. The Australian Federal Police did not dissent. That advice has remained constant ever since. At no stage have I received contrary advice. I say to this House: the moment I receive contrary advice, the Australian people will know about that contrary advice. I reject completely the suggestion that in some way, to protect my political position, I am holding back from the Australian people information which is vital to their security. Let us be very clear that at no stage has that advice been altered.
It has not been altered since the tragedy in Madrid. We have not received any advice from the Australian Federal Police—I say this again: we have not received any advice from the Australian Federal Police—that, as a result of what happened in Madrid, we are more at risk of a terrorist attack. We have not received that advice. We have not received that advice from ASIO. We have not received it from ONA. In other words, the general threat level has not altered as a result. That does not mean to say that we are not all feeling a little more nervous. Of course we are. Any attack on any of our number anywhere in the world naturally makes us all feel more insecure. That is only natural.
But our responsibility at a government level is to deal with threat assessment. That is the view that was taken by the Leader of the Opposition himself. When he was being interviewed only four days ago on the Neil Mitchell program, he said, `You've got to listen to the intelligence agencies when it comes to threat assessment.' I have listened to them. I have listened to the Federal Police, I have listened to ONA, and I have listened to ASIS. And none of them is saying that the assessment made a year ago—that the threat level should not be raised as a result of the involvement in Iraq—should be altered. None of them has come to me and said, `As a result of what has occurred in Spain, we have credible evidence that there is going to be an attack in Australia.' None of them has said that. It is against that background that this issue has to be assessed.
It is against that background that you see, in everything the Leader of the Opposition has said, this overweening preoccupation of the Australian Labor Party with the military operation in Iraq. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition said at one stage in his speech that going into Iraq was meant to be about democracy and liberty. In fact, the people of Iraq have more hope of democracy and liberty as a result of what we did in Iraq. They would not have had any democracy or liberty if they had listened to the Australian Labor Party. They would have had no democracy or liberty at all. I have no doubt that the people of Iraq, a year on, have a brighter future. They feel that they have a better hope of a life for their families and for future generations than was the case before that operation.
The Leader of the Opposition has, not surprisingly, given me many character references in his censure motion. He has said that I have heavied the police commissioner. He has traduced members of my staff. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, in dealing with these issues, I have behaved no differently in terms of communication with the police commissioner from any of my predecessors. The proposition is that every time there is some kind of communication about a sensitive issue between a Prime Minister, a minister and a police commissioner or the Director-General of ASIO or the Chief of the Defence Force—name any number—it has to be documented and it has to be paraded. I do not notice the Leader of the Opposition parading the discussions in shadow cabinet, for example, on parliamentary superannuation, and I do not notice the Leader of the Opposition running around giving us chapter and verse on what he said to Nick Sherry after the superannuation blooper. It is perfectly normal and perfectly proper for there to be communications between them and me, and I do not deny those for a moment.
But the Australian Federal Police Commissioner was not rebuked. The Australian Federal Police Commissioner was not treated improperly. The Australian Federal Police Commissioner made a statement which he subsequently indicated expressed his view of the situation. When you look again at the sequence of events—particularly if I can return to what he said on the Sunday program and what was subsequently said by one of the major news bulletins in Australia—you can see the need for clarification. This is what was said—and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to listen to this carefully:
Well, I think we've said all along this is an uphill battle. This is a marathon, not a sprint. The reality is, if this turns out to be Islamic extremists responsible for this bombing in Spain, it's more likely to be linked to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq.
That prompted the following, that evening on the Channel 9 news bulletin, which has the largest audience of any news bulletin anywhere in Australia. The newsreader had this to say:
... other allies—that includes Australia—
and he went on to say, crucially—
Put another way, our top cop believes our involvement in the Iraq war has made us a possible al-Qaeda target.
I repeat to the Leader of the Opposition that our top cop had said no such thing. Our top cop had not said that. The Leader of the Opposition knows it is inaccurate—and he himself has said it is inaccurate—to say that our involvement in the war in Iraq made us an al-Qaeda target. On the Neil Mitchell program he acknowledged that we have been a terrorist target since 11 September. The truth is that we were, according to ASIO, a terrorist target before 11 September 2001. It is in that context that the reference to a clarification was both understandable and, I think, desirable.
I said last Friday and I repeat here today that the Australian Federal Police Commissioner will be fully entitled to express his views, within his areas of responsibility, in any way that he thinks appropriate. There has been no muzzling of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner. There has been no interference with his operational independence. There have been no improper exchanges between me and the Australian Federal Police Commissioner or anybody acting on my behalf or with my authority. It is a perfectly normal, natural thing in relation to issues of this kind that there should be discussion and communication with the police commissioner.
The Leader of the Opposition is the last person who can come into this House with any kind of real authority and start lecturing us about standards, honesty and values. We heard the Leader of the Opposition talking last Friday about parliamentary standards. Today he gave a dramatic illustration of what needs to be done to lift parliamentary standards in this place when he went completely over the top with his attack on the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The great challenge that we have in this country is to effectively fight terrorism. The causation of terrorism is important, but the causation of terrorism is less important than the unity of the fight and the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism. In that we need the united support and professional commitment of all our intelligence and security agencies. We have them now, we have had them in the past and we will continue to have them in the future. I reject the censure completely.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I rise to support the motion. The Prime Minister's speech would have us characterise this incident and these events as simply a debate as to whether we have specific—I underline the word—advice to lift the general—and I underline that word as well—threat level facing Australia. We have heard for the first time that other specific levels may have been lifted as a consequence of Australia going into the war in Iraq—namely, the threat level faced by foreign interests in Australia and Australian interests abroad. Apparently, those specific threat levels are not regarded in the Prime Minister's description of a general threat level.
We have also heard the Prime Minister say that he acted entirely appropriately and that he did not interfere with the operational independence of the commissioner for police. Again, we are seeing some of the propaganda that is demonstrated by those comments. Take the words `operational independence'. Take out the word `operational' and what we see effectively is an admission that what occurred last week was political thuggery towards the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. Why? It was simply because he expressed his honest opinion, effectively to tell the people of Australia that we had to take the incidents that occurred in Madrid very carefully because there may have been a correlation of factors that applied to that event and circumstances faced in Australia. Not to do so, one would legitimately argue, would have been grossly irresponsible. But he was subject to political thuggery because he departed from the script.
If Australians could choose whom they wanted to protect their families and if the choice were between someone of the calibre of Commissioner Mick Keelty or those sitting opposite, I know whom they would pick every time. They would pick Commissioner Keelty every time, and justifiably so. As the Leader of the Opposition said, he is one of our nation's real champions. Indeed, the Prime Minister acknowledged Commissioner Keelty's tremendous achievements in terms of not only his general policing responsibilities, his toughness and his determination but also the impact that he had as a national figure in the terrible events that confronted the nation in the form of the Bali bombings.
To see a man of Commissioner Keelty's character driven to consider his resignation is, quite frankly, appalling. Consider the comments and the approaches that were made to this man last week when he was in the middle of participating in a vitally important conference with the most senior police officers of the land. Consider the number of phone calls that he must have received and the dilemma that he was in. He actually considered resigning from his position. If the approach to him was so appropriate, why would a man such as Mick Keelty consider resigning from his position? The fact that such a man was placed in that position is nothing short of an outrage. Indeed, I echo my disgust at the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he said:
Now, Mr Keelty makes a point that, you know ... al Qa'eda are running around saying that this is all because of the Spanish position in relation to Iraq—
effectively accusing the Australian Federal Police Commissioner—the highest law enforcement officer of the land and someone who, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, has devoted his career to protecting the security of Australians and Australian families—of espousing propaganda. To accuse a man such as that of mouthing al-Qaeda propaganda is nothing short of disgusting. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stood up and asked the Leader of the Opposition for a retraction of his comments condemning the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should stand up and be man enough to withdraw his comments and apologise to Commissioner Mick Keelty for that suggestion. It was nothing short of an outrage.
Commonsense says that, if you connect the dots, you would be naive to dismiss a connection between the role of the Spanish government in the war in Iraq and the events that occurred in Madrid. But Commissioner Keelty was not saying whether it was a good thing or a bad thing that Australia participated in that conflict. That was not his turf. He was saying: `Let's look at the dots. If they are connected, we have to be aware.' For him to do other than that would have been to ignore his responsibility to the Australian people. His comments echoed those of Mr Pistole, the head of the FBI's counter-terrorist mission in the United States, who was also out here last week at that important conference, and they echo comments by the deputy secretary of the Department of Defense in the United States. Those comments have also been supported by a number of people.
I note that, at one stage in an answer to a question today, the Prime Minister suggested that the issue was something that would be left open. Of course, it would be naive, as I say, not to draw the dots and to try and con the Australian people by silencing the Commissioner of Police. To prevent him from making such comments was grossly irresponsible. The Prime Minister said in an answer today that the focus of the government was dealing with the reality of terrorism. If that was the focus of the government, why didn't they allow the commissioner for police to participate unimpeded, unhindered and not harassed at a time when he had a responsibility as Australia's prime law enforcement officer to participate with the leading law enforcement officers of this nation and with myriad experts who had come out to Australia at a crucial time—that is, immediately after the Madrid bombing? Why wasn't he allowed to participate in that conference unimpeded? You can imagine the pressure on that man starting not with this all-important news bulletin at 6 p.m. on Sunday night, as the Prime Minister suggested, but immediately after he stepped out of the studio on Sunday morning to express his honest opinion to the Australian people. If the government's focus was on dealing with the reality of terrorism, why didn't they get out of the way and leave an honest and determined champion of Australia's security interests to participate in that conference without being harassed? The fact that they did not do so shows what this government's priority is. Their priority is their propaganda, not the security of the Australian people. The government's priority is spin, over protecting the families of Australia. There is no other conclusion that can be drawn from these events. It is unquestionably the case that what we have seen are political standover tactics of the very worst kind.
As I said, the pressure of the government was such that they were prepared to sacrifice Commissioner Keelty because he dared utter words that were inconsistent with the government's spin. But, to justify those standover tactics, the Prime Minister talks about `operational independence' or `operational responsibilities'. We know what the Australian Federal Police's operational responsibilities are, because we heard of them as recently as 18 March of this year, when the Attorney-General answered my question on notice. With regard to the Australian Federal Police's involvement in the new National Threat Assessment Centre—which I understand will be starting up next month—he said that the Australian Federal Police will be fully integrated in the National Threat Assessment Centre analysis and, as such, will be directly responsible for the preparation of threat assessments. If the Prime Minister says, `I will listen to ASIO and no other about the threats faced by Australia,' why have we even set up a National Threat Assessment Centre at all? Why have we brought experts in these agencies together to advise the Australian people of threats faced by the Australian people because of myriad circumstances, including events overseas such as those in Madrid? Clearly, it is part of the operational responsibilities of the Australian Federal Police to participate in those national threat assessments, to consider the likelihood of a terrorist event in Australia as a result of a number of factors. To dismiss that, as the government has sought to do, as not being part of Commissioner Keelty's operational responsibilities is simply wrong and it is, again, misleading the Australian people.
You have to ask whether this was simply pressure exerted on Commissioner Keelty, who you have to say is probably one of the toughest of all public servants. It was a statement and a warning shot across the bows of all public servants to toe the government's line in this election year. That is what it was about. It was the intimidation of someone who can probably be regarded as the toughest of our public servants in order to warn other public servants that they had better toe the government's line or wait and see what will happen to them.
I ask the government: how can Australians, in those circumstances, have confidence in the impartiality, frankness and sincerity of Australian Federal Police officers—and, indeed, others—confidence that they will give their honest and frank advice in the national threat assessment process, given the consequences if they dare utter words that are inconsistent with the government's spin? How can the people of Australia have confidence that this government's priority is their security rather than the government's spin? If you look at the government's response with respect to security issues, you see that that is what it is about.
—I was just prompted by the minister at the table. Under regulations in his portfolio, over 400 individuals and terrorist organisations have been listed as terrorist organisations, to make it illegal to contribute to those organisations and to be able to confiscate their assets. How many organisations have had their assets confiscated? Two: one case involved a Melbourne record company called Shining Path—they had to withdraw from that; the other case involved a grand sum of $2,100. In the context of other countries confiscating and freezing over $100 million of assets, this government has frozen some $2,100. We have passed—and we have seen tremendous debate and fanfare, as part of this government's rhetoric—a myriad of legislation. How many terrorists have we seen prosecuted in Australia, despite dramatic headlines regarding the activities of Willie Brigitte in Australia? Not one terrorist has been prosecuted in Australia.
This government is about the propaganda of security—muzzling, restricting, intimidating—and, indeed, writing statements of retraction for a very decent and dedicated man. The national security of Australians should be above politics. Our national security depends on the dependability and independence of those charged with our national security. That independence has been fundamentally breached and so too, potentially, has our national security. This government should be ashamed of the pressure and the intimidation that it applied to a very decent, determined and dedicated man. It should apologise to that man and it should apologise to the Australian people for attempting to pull the wool over their eyes.
Opposition members—Apologise!
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member for Barton was heard in relative silence. The fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is rising is not an excuse for that sort of behaviour from my left. Those who wish to listen to the debate shall do so silently. Those who cannot see that way clear should remove themselves from the chamber under their own volition, or I will act.",REPS,<title>PRIME MINISTER</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—The first observation I would make is this: he is back. The old Leader of the Opposition that we knew three months ago is back with us again today—a man who aspires to be the Prime Minister of our country but does not have the presence of mind and the calmness needed to run this country. I think that has been very clearly demonstrated today with the extraordinary outburst of the Leader of the Opposition. If we wanted to get hold of a conversation and see what was in it, the conversation we would like to see is the one between the Leader of the Opposition's advisers and the Leader of the Opposition. It is clear that they have given him advice to calm down, try to relax and bring himself under control, because otherwise, politically, it might be damaging. We have had three months of him listening to and adhering to this advice, and then suddenly, today, on 21 March, he breaks out and the old Leader of the Opposition comes back. Why do I think this is important?—
—Today's the 22nd.
—The 22nd, is it? I think this is important—
Honourable members interjecting—
—Yes, of course, he is back again. I think this is important because the great negative about the Leader of the Opposition was that he would not have the calmness, he would not have the personality, to be able to carry off the job of being the Prime Minister of Australia. Today we have had it revealed for all of us in the House of Representatives and for those who were watching the House of Representatives that, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition does not have the essential calmness that is needed for the job, that just bubbling beneath the surface is this tempestuous personality. His Kurtz—we read about it in the Age;out it comes. This is an extraordinary revelation and it is an important day from that point of view.
Secondly, we have a Leader of the Opposition who said he wanted to bring higher standards to the parliament. That is what the member for Hotham said as well when he became the Leader of the Opposition. I remember it only too well. He was going to bring higher standards, and we had the ranting and the raving from the dispatch box for two solid years. It sounds as though we are about to get it for one more year, in the lead-up to the next federal election—the ranting and the raving of the opposition from the dispatch box, the party political points.
—Order! Member for Griffith!
—The opposition are accusing the government of playing politics with national security, while they have moved a censure motion today that is playing politics with national security! I do not think that would be lost on anybody with a triple-figure IQ. I think anyone would be able to work out that that is exactly what the opposition are doing today. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has abandoned his apolitical position—the position he took when he once rose way above politics for three long months. He is back where he was last year, making all sorts of grotesque allegations, sinking into the political gutter and pretending that somehow I am associating Mick Keelty with al-Qaeda. As if Mick Keelty would believe that of me. Nobody is going to believe that. No-one does believe that.
Everybody knows that I have worked day in and day out with Mick Keelty ever since he became the commissioner of the police. We have had a very close and—if I may say so—a very important relationship for this country, particularly because of the work we have done in South-East Asia and in the South Pacific. The relationship between me and Mick Keelty has been very important to our foreign policy. As if I would think Mick Keelty was somehow associated with al-Qaeda. For the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that is to remind me of some of the more loathsome statements that I have heard from the opposition while I have been in this parliament and is to sink to an extraordinary new low in party political debate.
—Order! I warn the honourable member for Griffith.
—And for him to blow up and scream across the House—eyes dilating, face bright red—about members of the House of Representatives being rotten, lousy disgraces is, I think, an awful indictment of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who aspires to be the Prime Minister. Of course, I remember the Menzies years, McMahon and Gorton. I remember all of those eras, and it is an old Labor Party tactic—
Opposition members interjecting—
—Yes, just like the McClellands and the Beazleys and all those people. And what a disgrace you think that is, as well, I suppose—but I thought his father was a pretty good senator. Former Senator McClelland was the President of the Senate. He was the High Commissioner in London. I reckon he was a good man. As for his son—well, I do not always agree with his politics, but he is not a bad bloke. So, excuse me, but do not be rude to the member for Barton. He is not a bad bloke, and I encourage the gallery to believe me.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What has this got to do with the motion before the chair?
—The honourable member will resume his seat.
—The point that I have been making that I think the House needs to understand—and I think it is the point that Mr Keelty makes as well—is that there are people, in particular al-Qaeda people, who are out there—
—The member for Griffith, who has been benched again for this debate, who is not even allowed to ask questions in question time, asks them by way of interjection, which is disorderly—
—Order! It is quite disorderly, and I hope that the minister will ignore the interjections and that the member for Griffith will cease interjecting.
—It is very hard to ignore the member for Griffith because he is so garrulous, although what he says is very seldom associated with the truth. My point is this: people like Mr Keelty, me, the Prime Minister and the head of ASIO are all perfectly aware that al-Qaeda and associated organisations are running around there at the moment, running a line. The line is that acts of terrorism—in particular, the Madrid bombing—occur because Spain, for example, participated in the war against terrorism. That is the only point I am making.
—Mick Keelty said that—
—But I say exactly the same thing. I say that al-Qaeda are going around and making this claim. That is what I say. Of course he says it, and so would the head of ASIO. Mick Keelty knows I am not accusing him of being a member of al-Qaeda. That is a rather fanciful proposition. The point that I make is very important: we need to understand the facts here. One of the facts is that Spain was not actually a member of the coalition of the willing. Spain did not have troops in Iraq. The second thing is that Spain was one of 48 or so countries that supported the overall effort of the coalition of the willing, and we welcome its support. It has troops in Iraq now. It is one of 35 or so countries that have some troops in Iraq now, and I think it says a lot for the international community that so many countries are prepared to do that.
This is the point we are making: when it comes to terrorist organisations, al-Qaeda is the most egregious. Al-Qaeda will use any argument it can to push its cause, but you do need to remember what al-Qaeda is fundamentally about and what Jemaah Islamiah is fundamentally about. These are organisations that were not established to deal with the issue of Iraq—or East Timor, for that matter—or Israel and Palestine. These are organisations that were established to try to achieve a fundamentalist vision of Islam throughout the Islamic world—in Indonesia, our next-door neighbour; in the southern part of the Philippines; in Malaysia; in Brunei; and in the southern part of Thailand. That is what these organisations were set up to do and that is their objective. They see the moderate leaders of these countries as apostates, as people who are betraying the message of Islam. That is how these people see them, and they see apostates as worthy of death. They also see infidels—that is, of course, predominantly but not exclusively Westerners, non-Muslims, nonbelievers, as they would say—and heretics. They say these people—
Opposition members interjecting—
—Well, you may think it is funny, but these people thinking that infidels are worthy of death is not, for me, a laughing matter.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The inference by the Minister for Foreign Affairs—and I was laughing at his last remark—is plainly inaccurate and an offence, and I ask that he withdraw it.
—Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.
—The fact is—
—Order! The honourable member for Griffith will sit there in silence and avoid the necessity for any comments across the table.
—The fact is that that is what these terrorist organisations are out to achieve, and it is very important that we understand that. I also think it is very important that we show a great deal of strength when we confront these organisations. I know we can have our debates in Australia, and we can have debates between and within countries, and that is perfectly legitimate, but the aim of al-Qaeda, amongst other things, in order to achieve its objectives, will be to weaken our resolve in the war against terrorism. We have to be careful that we do not do that.
I think it is enormously important that we remain strong and resolute in everything we do to fight terrorism, that we remain united as much as we can with countries in the European Union, with America, with Canada and with our Asian neighbours—the Japanese, the Chinese and importantly the moderate Muslim leadership in Asia—and that we do not allow arguments being pushed around the world by all sorts of organisations to be used to divide us and to weaken our resolve. 
I made it clear last week that I did not think it would be a good message if Spain withdrew their troops from Iraq. I do not think that would be a good message. Even if the government does not hold this view—and to be fair to them, the incoming government made it clear that they had this policy long before the Madrid bombing—I would like them to reverse their policy because they are in danger of sending a message to the international community, particularly to al-Qaeda and their fellow travellers, that a bomb can have effect, and we do not want to see that. 
Let me conclude by saying what I said in question time on Iraq. I appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition thinks the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein's evil regime was a mistake. I just do not happen to share that view, and nor do the people of Iraq, importantly. It is important what the people of Iraq think about these things, and the people of Iraq are delighted that Saddam Hussein has gone. We have found over 250 mass graves with between 300,000 and 400,000 bodies in those mass graves. 
—So are we.
—My response to the member for Lowe is: yes and no. Yes, of course you are not in favour of the brutalities committed by Saddam Hussein, but if your policy had been pursued he would still be in office. That is the point. That is not a problem we have on this side of the House. We do not wear the incubus of having pursued a policy which would have kept Saddam Hussein in power. Do not get too sensitive. I am not accusing you of supporting him, but I am accusing you of supporting a policy which would have kept him in power.
—Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair.
—The fact is that he did have weapons of mass destruction programs. That is perfectly clear. The Iraq Survey Group has made that perfectly clear. It is true that the stockpiles have not been found, but he certainly did have programs and activities—and there is no question of that. This is a man who has used these weapons against his own people and he has still got programs in defiance of Security Council resolutions. Mr Speaker, excuse me if I say so, but I do not think that is all right. I do not think that is acceptable. 
I think it is a great thing that we got rid of this regime, and I think history will judge us as having done the right thing and a strong thing. We did not do a populist thing. Remember populist? We did not do a populist thing. No, we did the right thing. Sometimes the right thing is not very popular. Sometimes it requires a bit of courage and you have got to be tough. Going down to Tasmania and saying `I'm all in favour of trees and the environment' and `I'm all in favour of chopping trees down and logging jobs' is not strong. That is playing both ends against the middle, walking both sides of the street, trying to create images and perceptions which belie a truth which is a vacuum. When it comes to Iraq, we have made no secret of the fact that this was a tough decision and we have made no secret of the fact that it was the right decision.

Transparency and accountability are essential features in a democratic and free society. That is the basis for requiring members of parliament to make public disclosures of their pecuniary interests. This motion creates an obligation on members of the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery to make a disclosure of their pecuniary interests in the same way as MPs and for the same matters. That register would be open to public scrutiny as is the MPs register.
Similar requirements are applied to people in occupations outside politics, usually where one or more of the following applies: where someone is in a position of trust; where someone has the capacity to affect others either directly or indirectly; where someone plays an influential role in the democratic process or in our financial or social institutions; where a real or perceived conflict of interest would result in a detriment to others to whom they owe a duty; or where a person stands to gain by exercising their role in a particular way, especially where that would at the same time disadvantage others to whom they have an obligation.
We see these principles applied in the disclosure obligations placed on companies in reporting to their shareholders; on company directors exercising their powers; on financial advisers who are required to disclose commissions and payments; and on parliamentarians who must disclose pecuniary interests. Only last week, Labor leader Mark Latham spoke of the need for a similar system to apply to lobbyists—another worthwhile initiative in improving transparency and rebuilding public confidence in our system.
The need for this transparency to apply to those in the media, who play a central role in the political process and in informing the public, rests on these same principles and is at least as important as the application of similar accountability in other professions. For example, if a journalist writes about the benefits or problems associated with a particular business venture surely the public have a right to know whether that journalist has shares in the companies in question, is being paid by them, has a loan with them or one of its competitors or some other interest that may give rise to a conflict of interest. If a journalist is given a first-class airfare, five-star accommodation and feted for a weekend trip to a corporate event and then writes an article about that product, the need for tax concessions for it or public infrastructure associated with it, the public surely have a right to know.
The independence and freedom of the press is vital. But with that independence and great influence come obligations and responsibilities. These are not simply obligations of employees to their employer; they are obligations to the society whose members rely on them for information. None of this in any way restricts what a journalist can write or say. It simply imposes a transparency in their conduct so that their readers or audience are able to make better informed judgements about the matters they report on. Indeed, if any journalist believes that disclosure provisions would inhibit what they would write or say they should take a long hard look at whether they already have a conflict of interest.
Some members of the gallery have suggested that this motion is wrong because, unlike MPs, they are not paid by the taxpayer—excluding, I assume, those employed by the ABC—and because, they claim, the journalist's code of conduct upholds standards that make this unnecessary. As one head of bureau wrote:
Journalists are not elected public officials. Their only responsibility, apart from their responsibility as citizens to uphold the law, is to their employer and their own conscience.
Such a view ignores even their own code of conduct and journalist ethics. It demonstrates why this motion is necessary. It also ignores the realities of disclosure already applying in private enterprise and is clearly bogus. Strangely, the same person also noted:
Media bias or corruption can take place at any stage leading up to publication or broadcasting. Your motion addresses only the initial stage.
It is far better to start here with this small measure than either place our collective heads in the sand or run from the issue for fear of criticism or revenge from aggrieved media identities. How many times in the last 10 years has a journalist been disciplined for breaching their code? I understand the answer is zero.
This motion gives some transparency to those journalists who work most closely and directly with national political affairs. Members of the gallery have special access throughout this parliament. It is a privilege not extended to other journalists let alone the public. The sanction my motion proposes is removal of the pass that provides that special access, to be enforced by a five-person committee including two members of the gallery. It does not, nor could it, prevent someone outside the parliament ignoring the disclosure requirements. Some will see that as a shortcoming, others as a blessing. It will establish a benchmark for journalistic best practice—a standard that serious minded journalists throughout Australia should all want to adopt. It will increase public confidence in the media. I encourage all members to support the motion. I am indebted to the Herald Sun editorial today that says:
What makes the news media different from all other industries is that it lives by disclosure, by stimulating debate and a free flow of ideas.
I encourage them to practice that in their backyard. (Time expired)
 (Mr Jenkins)—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—This is a seemingly innocuous measure and a seemingly innocuous resolution but, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, it has huge implications: there is indeed a sting in the tail. The simple argument from my side of this debate is, `Why not?' MPs disclose their ownership of shares, their interests in bank accounts and mortgages and therefore, by implication, they disclose who might have some influence over them. Since we do that, why not, as the member for Brisbane proposes, have those that report on us and comment on our words and policies do the same thing? Let me ask these rhetorical questions: why not have our security staff in Parliament House do the same thing too? Indeed, why not have the deputy clerks at the table do the same thing, and the cleaners as well? What about the people in the gallery before they come in—perhaps they should declare their interests in other places before we let them into this House, just as we make sure they do not have weapons of any kind of destruction. There is no question that this is a bit over the top.
A complex argument put very simply is this: a democracy, founded on essential freedoms, only works well, as has been proven over and over again around the world, if you have freedom of the press. That is one of the basic foundations of our democracy. I would maintain that Australia probably has the most outstanding, pre-eminent example of a functioning democracy in all the world, and we have never put limits on our press—never ever—and I sincerely pray that we never do.
The fourth estate must be able to report openly and without threat to their independence. I ask you: suppose a member of the gallery—and there are not many of them up there at the moment—has shares in NAB, the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Western Mining or BHP, if they report favourably, what implication does that have and, if they report unfavourably, what implication does that have? The pressure you would put on the fourth estate would be absolutely intolerable.
I point out to the member for Brisbane that there are reports that democracy has a good chance of working in Iraq today because springing up all over that country now is free and independent reporting. It may not be right, but it is free and independent for the first time that we know of in modern history. There is no Saddam Hussein to tell them what to say—none at all. I also remind members that the resistance in Afghanistan to terrorism actually began with TV. Now that they have television openly through the country, people can see that Westerners like us debate these kinds of issues and they are coming more rapidly to democracy. I remind you that the fall of East Germany began with East Germans watching on television scenes from the West. That is very important imagery.
I interviewed a few journalists before I came in to do this debate. That is a bit unusual, and I will make sure that I quote them accurately if they want to be quoted. Gerard McManus, of Melbourne's Herald Sun, said:
Journalists are not paid public officials and have only one fig leaf to hide behind and that is the maintenance of their own independence. Journalists are judged on their trustworthiness, integrity and the accuracy of reporting and not on what they own or don't own.
Malcolm Farr, of Sydney's Daily Telegraph, said:
The way Mr Bevis has proposed this makes it look terribly close to registration of journalists. If you start saying who can and who cannot report on parliament you leave open abuse of powers and the censoring of reports on parliament.
Perhaps someone on the other side who supports the member for Brisbane can explain why this motion should not apply to journalists who do not reside in Canberra. I mention John Pilger, Robert Manne—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—It gives me great pleasure to second this motion and I would like to commend the member for Brisbane for bringing it before the House today. It has long been the practice of this House for members to declare any pecuniary interests they, their spouses or dependent children might hold. In fact, it was the Keating government who introduced the members' register back in 1984. There was greater reluctance from coalition senators reagarding the introduction of a similar register in the other place, but by 1994 even they finally relented and adopted their own register system. The reasons for these initiatives were abundantly clear.
I should start by saying that I have the utmost respect for the press, television and radio journalists based here in Parliament House. Their role is critical. Some suggest that there is a symbiotic relationship between politicians and journalists. However, there is a strong argument to suggest that those who report on the happenings of the federal parliament should abide by the same rules as MPs and senators and declare all registrable interests, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Their reporting should not only be free from any conflict of interest but also from any perception of a conflict of interest.
The role of a journalist in this place is a critically important one. It is through them—through their newspaper articles, their television packages for the nightly news, their radio crosses and their news reports—that most Australians learn what is going on in this place. For that very reason, it is in the interests of fair and unbiased reporting that they should declare any interests they might have. I have every confidence that the great majority of press gallery members would not allow a pecuniary interest to impinge on their journalistic integrity under any circumstances, in the same way that I am confident that the vast majority of members and senators would not attempt to derive a personal benefit by abusing the powers of their office. However, as we have seen on the odd occasion since the introduction of registers of interest in both houses of parliament, it can and does happen. Similarly, it can happen in the media.
As hooked-on viewers of the ABC's Media Watch program would know, failure to disclose sponsorship arrangements has been a bugbear for Australia's commercial radio industry for nearly four years now. The Australian Broadcasting Authority's cash for comment investigation back in 2000 has been widely described as the biggest scandal in Australian commercial broadcasting history, and justifiably so. The ABA found that 2UE presenters Alan Jones and John Laws failed to disclose major sponsorship deals to their listeners and then gave those companies favourable treatment on air. The ABA has since made it a licensing condition for commercial radio stations to establish pecuniary interests registers outlining all deals between their announcers and sponsors. It is still subject to criticism for not proceeding against the new arrangements at 2GB. `Why?' you might ask: because it is an abuse of that licence if they do not. Equally, it is an abuse of a listener's trust. Many listeners would take a talkback host at his or her word. If, for example, he or she was defending a particular company from media or public criticism, or talking up a new commercial offer from that company, or even attacking one of its competitors, the listener would assume, rightly or wrongly, that these opinions were the announcer's own and that he or she had not been unduly influenced.
In the same manner, readers, listeners and viewers should be able to expect unbiased, even-handed reporting from the press gallery. When they pick up their newspapers of a morning and read a story on the full privatisation of Telstra, they should be able to find out if the author holds Telstra shares or is on a retainer from Telstra. Perhaps an even better proposal would be to create a pecuniary interests register for their bosses, the wealthy media proprietors. While I am confident in the independence of the bulk of our friends in the press gallery from their billionaire bosses, it is entirely possible that a journalist—particularly an inexperienced or aspiring scribe or reporter—would shy away from writing pieces that might directly or indirectly impact on the interests of their bosses or boss. As anyone who has worked in the media would know, job security can be tenuous at best. The Prime Minister has made his feelings known on this issue in an answer to a question on notice from the member for Lowe. He rejected the idea of a register for press gallery journalists, because the 1979 Bowen inquiry had rejected it, instead recommending self-regulation. A lot has changed since 1979, and it is about time we looked at having a register for all members of the press gallery.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—Freedom of the press is vital to a democracy, and no-one argues with that. The great thing about Australia is that there is very little corruption in public life. We all understand the profound influence of the media. There are probably not many of us who have not felt the sharp and cruel hand of a journalist who has either got their facts wrong or in a minority of cases has had some other vindictive approach. But generally our media works very well. I thank the member for Brisbane for the opportunity to canvass these issues again, because I think it is a wonderful opportunity to discuss them, bring them out into this chamber and perhaps, if nothing else, allow MPs to rethink them a bit.
I can remember very well being attacked on page 3 of the Adelaide Advertiser and then taking it to the Press Council, and getting a retraction about four months later on—on page 26. That is what we are dealing with all the time. The media have the luxury in this country of never really having to provide the solutions. I will not say they sometimes create them, but they certainly only ever have to report on them in a somewhat colourful way from time to time to ensure the commercial success of their respective operations or, in the case of the ABC, to ensure its continued funding. That is a little too cynical—I accept that—but nevertheless there is a reality and a marketplace out there in the public that we need to be conscious of.
As I say, there is very limited corruption in this country. Therefore I do not support the full registry concept. But I do think we need to have further discussion about what we should be doing to bring the media into better balance. Where it is actually within the material that they write and report on, they have the requirement to declare their interests immediately, as they write it. I accept that some of them do, but I am sure that in many cases they do not.
I really enjoyed the mention Mr Price, the member for Chifley, made of the issue of radio and cash for comment, which is clearly an excessive and wrong use of the media, in my view. I do think that sort of thing needs a much stronger hand and there need to be stronger laws which actually have some teeth and which create an opportunity for people to have greater respect for the truth. We have gone from the 1979 inquiry and the rebuttal or rejection of the need for this sort of regulation—let's have a code and let's have a more gentle approach and something not too draconian. I do not think that that is sufficient, but I cannot offer the chamber today a sufficiently strong alternative.
I do not favour this very regulatory method, because I agree with the member for La Trobe that having a very regulated system is not acceptable at all. But I do know that we do need a significantly stronger brake on the media so that they at least have greater respect for the parliament in which they have the privilege of working—as we do. To conclude, I believe that the standards of the media are probably bumping around where they have always been, I think the commercial interests are stronger than they have ever been, I think there is a need for further discussion on this subject and I think there is a much stronger need for the media to have far greater respect for the laws of the land and for the people who endeavour to represent Australians in this place.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I would like to congratulate the member for Brisbane for bringing this very important motion to the House. In doing so, I wish to place on record my absolute support for the independence and the rights of the media to print, write and put out there to the public whatever they believe is the right thing. This motion is not about attacking the press—it is not about any of those issues. It is not about placing any restrictions on what they write—it does not discuss any of those issues whatsoever. Rather, it is about the credibility of the media and the removal of the scepticism that often surrounds the media. I see this as an excellent opportunity for us in Australia to adopt practices similar to those overseas. It also gets around any perception of conflicts of interest.
As I mentioned, this is a very important motion. It places on journalists who work within this place requirements similar to those placed on those of us who are members of parliament. I do not have a problem with that, because they are involved in the intricate workings of this place and, as I mentioned earlier, I think all members of the gallery should actually support the provisions of this motion. It is about improving the way we operate here in parliament, it is about transparency, openness and accountability and it is about making sure that here in Australia we have the best operating democracy that is possible.
As I mentioned, the underlying principle of this motion by the member for Brisbane is the fact that, just as we, as members of parliament, are accountable, so too those who report on us should be. We should—and the Australian people should—be able to understand if there is a conflict of interest and, alternatively, be able to see that there is no conflict of interest, that what is being put forward is the opinion of the journalist or what that journalist believes is fact. In such a way, it ensures that we have a better informed constituency.
I referred a little earlier to similar situations overseas. Since 17 December 1985, journalists in the House of Commons have been required to register their pecuniary interests. I want to refer to something I took from the web site of the UK parliament. It says:
... those holding permanent passes as lobby journalists accredited to Parliamentary press Gallery or for parliamentary broadcasting be required to register not only the employment for which they had received their pass, but also any other paid occupation or employment where their privileged access to Parliament is relevant.
If it is good enough for the United Kingdom—for the House of Commons—I think it is good enough for us in Australia. I believe that it will improve our system. We only have to look at company directors outside this parliament: they also have to be prepared to disclose their interests.
I think that this motion fits in very nicely with what the Leader of the Opposition released last week—a proposal for lobbyists to disclose their pecuniary interests. I think that this is a natural progression. It is a system that I think is best practice, as outlined by the member for Brisbane, and it is a fair system. Any changes to a system should improve it and make it better. The proposal set out in this motion by the member for Brisbane does just that. The media—as we all are—are in a very privileged position, being able to work in this parliament. I believe that that privilege places obligations and responsibilities on all of us—the obligation to be accountable and for transparency. The structure outlined in this motion will ensure both accountability and transparency and improve the operation of this parliament. This motion puts in place a structure that will ensure that accountability and transparency.

"Forrest, John, MP",NATS,2004-03-22,"—In my willingness to speak to the motion, I want, firstly, to thank the member for Brisbane—his motion has opened up the issue. I have some reservations about the structure that is proposed in the motion as it stands, but at least it opens up the debate. We do live in a tremendous democracy in Australia, and we should be grateful to those who went before us to ensure that we had freedom of speech and liberty and, most particularly, freedom of the press—and independence of the press. These are cherished safety valves, if you like, of democracy, and we ought to be very careful about any measures that undermine those. My problem with the structure of the motion that the member for Brisbane has put to the House is that it seems to focus entirely on the reporting of events that happen in the chamber. For example, it is only for journalists who attend in the press gallery and report on the events of the chamber. The problem with that approach is that it creates a them and us situation; whereas we are all in this together.
Members of parliament rely on the media to accurately report the things they do and say. If that does not occur, the parliament offers processes in order for an individual member or senator to correct that. The standing orders provide for that, so I am uncomfortable with a situation that creates a them and us approach and further separation between the reporters of what is said here and the members who attend and speak here.
My purpose in speaking to the motion is, in a sense, to make a kind of a plea. We have all been subject to some quite inaccurate—and in my case, a few times, some quite malicious, inaccurate—reporting. There are measures available to me to correct that, but it hurts. When the reporting is not quite true and based on inaccurate information, it hurts. And it hurts our families. I can remember an incident not long after I had been in this place when my children refused to go to school because the local comment in the media had followed them through the school gate. It makes it pretty tough when you are involved in public life, but nobody champions more than me the capacity of the press to have that liberty. It is a safety valve, and it does enforce accountability, and for any members or senators feeling impugned they have a process by which anything that is reported inaccurately can be corrected.
My plea to the gallery is for unbiased reporting. It seems that the nature of journalism has changed over the last 10 or 20 years. It is not so much about reporting events that occur—not only in this place but at sporting events or anywhere else; it is a matter of expressing opinion. You see this more and more, and the most well-read articles in some of our newspapers are those where the journalist is expressing an opinion. These are the things that we cherish, as long as that opinion is respected as opinion and not reported as the so-called opinions of other people.
The Australian populace are wise enough to see through the kinds of things that I think the member for Brisbane and other speakers have highlighted and are worried about. For example, the member for Chifley made mention of reporting on the activities of Telstra. I have enormous respect for the members of the journalistic profession who do write on Telstra and have made, voluntarily, a comment that they do hold shares. I think that is a safety valve that is more self-regulated. If there is going to be an exchange between the gallery and us—and I am disappointed that there aren't a few more journalists around; I have no doubt they are listing on monitors—our plea is for unbiased and fair reporting. My position would be that we need to rely on the journalistic profession to monitor that amongst themselves.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—The current Prime Minister of Australia is the No. 1 enemy of anything public in the lexicon of contemporary Australian politics. He hates—he loathes—`public' in all forms, whether they be education, health, transport or communications. Of course, on all four he has considerable form, but today I would like to concentrate on just one—education. I will use a quote:
The baseless attack launched by the Prime Minister on public schools shows the extent to which the government is out of touch with the realities of schools.
Now, who said that? Was it Jenny Macklin, Rod Sawford, the AEU or the state Labor education minister? No, it was none of the above. To the government's eternal shame, the statement came from the Independent Education Union of Australia, which represents 55,000 members in 2,600 non-government schools and other educational institutions.
Who said this:
Howard's recent assertion that public schools were `value-free', or alternatively dominated by `politically correct' values was indicative of the divisive policies and practices adopted by the federal government and a cynical attempt to direct attention away from its lack of support for all schools.
Did Mark Latham say that? Was it said by Kim Carr or Pat Byrne? No. Again it was the Independent Education Union of Australia. Lynne Rolley, the secretary of that union, said that it was time for the government to treat its central institutions and the people who work within them with respect: hear, hear to that. In fact, Lynne Rolley had some good advice for the government. She said:
... instead of criticising schools for doing their job, the government should concentrate on developing fair and just policies that include equitable funding and support for all schools.
That cannot be achieved by increasing support for the richest non-government schools by up to 240 per cent or by keeping increases to the majority of poor non-government schools to around 30 per cent while basically ignoring public education altogether.
This nation does not need a mindless debate about public or private schools. As Lynne Rolley says, the debate ought to be about equitable funding for all schools. The Prime Minister has a case to answer. His divisive policies, biased against public education, are evident from 1977, when he was then Treasurer in the Fraser government. Then the public-private ratio of Commonwealth funding for schools was 63 to 37. It probably should have been 70 to 30, as that would have closely matched the numbers in each sector. Nevertheless, on a per capita basis it was roughly a nonpartisan approach to public and private schools. What did the current Prime Minister, in his former life as federal Treasurer, do to the 63 to 37 public-private ratio? He did what he does now: he applied the wedge, he exercised deliberately divisive politics, he damaged public education, he damaged this nation's future and he damaged cohesion in this nation.
Based on no educational rationale whatsoever he changed that 63 to 37 public-private ratio to 46 to 54 by the beginning of 1983. But just prior to the 1980 election, Treasurer Howard momentarily increased public education funding back to the 1977 leve1 for opportunistic, cynical electoral reasons only. It was the first and only time John Howard, in any capacity, increased funding for public education. However, that was all a brief aberration. The Independent Education Union has stated that since 1996 federal government education policies have exacerbated divisions within the Australian community. It has stated that the enrolment benchmark adjustment wrongly penalised government schools and that the SES model of funding non-government schools was flawed, in that it ignored the actual capacity of individual schools to generate resources and income and provided large amounts of additional funds to the most highly resourced schools in the country.
Those who were saying this were the people who knew non--government schools inside out—not us, not public education teachers, but non-government teachers. Responsibly, they want measures introduced to enhance cooperation across schools rather than the growing culture of competition. But what John Howard did on resuming power as Prime Minister in 1996 had no subtlety whatsoever. He reverted again to the wedge. He reverted again to divisive policies between public and private education. He took the existing ratio, then 46 to 54, which had been maintained during the Hawke-Keating years, and changed it to 33 to 67. And what was the educational rationale? There was absolutely none. There was no educational rationale whatsoever. But there was a rationale, and the Independent Education Union of Australia has rightly recognised it as divisive and of no connection whatsoever to the intrinsic worth of education, whether public or private.
This government believes in blurring the distinction between public and private schools. Its central strategy has been the establishment of an education quasi-market, according to a former associate professor of the University of South Australia, Alan Reid. This government believes that one of the impediments to the operation of an education market is the existence of both public and so-called private sector education systems. The current government policy is to create a single market where all schools, public or private, compete for custom. That means that any consolidated education system, public or Catholic, is in grave danger—and that is despite the plugging of the Catholic system a couple of weeks ago.
If this government's logic of marketisation were to be followed, all government and Catholic schools would be abolished, as a dollar spent in a so-called private school could be argued as being more cost--effective. The language of the simple market in education is simply wrong. Choice in its raw form means segregation, not freedom. Choice means according to the ability to pay. That is the only choice. It has nothing whatsoever to do with freedom. Schools do not operate under similar circumstances. Private schools select students; public schools cannot. Schools that cater to location, socioeconomic disadvantage and intellectual, physical and behavioural disabilities require affirmative action, not a simple market. A simple market in education means the abandonment of rural children, and people in the country know it. It means the abandonment of children in financial disadvantage, and people know it. And it cruelly means the abandonment of non-mainstream disabled children, and their parents damn well know it.
A single market in education is antidemocratic. The supporters of a single market argue for what they call the freedom of maximum choice. It is no such thing. It sets parents and their children into competition with each other so there are winners and losers—and the big losers are the poor, the rural and the disabled. The marketisation of education values education only in financial terms. The only sector of the community that can be advantaged when that is the case is that of the privileged elites—and they are of course the great beneficiaries of this government. The government does not appear to understand that encouraging competition between inadequately resourced schools will simply result in alienation, resentment and anger.
Markets have an obvious important role in our economic system, but the rules of the market are simply insufficient for the government of a society—particularly one of a social democratic variety. That private schools get assistance from the federal government is not argued. So they should. That exclusive private schools for the rich—those that charge twice the public cost of tuition—receive assistance is simply criminal. To argue that these parents pay taxes too is the height of financial arrogance. They pay taxes for lots of things—public transport to name one. Do they receive subsidies for private transport and chauffeur driven vehicles? Do they receive subsidies for communication costs—phones, faxes and so on? Of course not. If private single market purposes are allowed to be determinants of education, democratic purposes and the recognition of merit in this country will be seriously compromised and undeliverable.
So that is it. The intrinsic worth of education for all citizens under this government is simply sidelined. And who has achieved that in the end? None other than the soulless lawyer we knew as the federal Treasurer in the Fraser government and who is now the current Prime Minister. Some achievement. When history judges—and it always does—the Howard years will be right down there with the Fraser government: years and years of squandered opportunities repeated over and again. Playing favourites does not work. It never did. It never will. Labor has a better way. The chance for Labor to govern may come a lot sooner than expected.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCES</title>,<title>Education: Funding</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003 proposes a number of amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 relating to the operation of Dairy Australia, the industry services body that took over many of the activities of the Australian Dairy Corporation on 1 July last year. Dairying is one of Australia's great agricultural industries and, in so many ways, is one of Australia's great export success stories. It is a highly productive industry that more than doubled its output between 1979 and 2003. The industry today produces around 10 million litres of milk every year from a national herd that totals just over two million cows. The number of cows has increased only marginally over the last 14 years, while milk production has doubled. This is testament to the way dairy farmers and the industry have taken up the challenge of working smarter, improving herd quality, introducing smarter breeding practices and, especially, adopting on-farm advances in the science and technology of dairying.
The gains have not come without some pain and cost to the industry. For example, in 1979 there were 22,000 dairy farmers milking an average 85 cows each. By 2003 the number of dairy farmers had fallen to 10,500, whilst the average herd size had more than doubled to 195 cows. I have personal experience of this process of adjustment in the dairy industry because I am the son of a Western District dairy farmer myself. I can recall milking the cows by hand and being around when we introduced milking machines to our property. I have also seen great changes in the design of dairies as well as herd improvements, and the advent of irrigated pastures. There are many ways in which the productivity of the industry has been dramatically improved, to the point where we have not only a significant domestic industry that is important to regional Australia but an export industry that is important to the whole nation. Today there are some quite important examples of farms milking over 1,000 cows. I note the presence in the chamber today of the honourable member for Corangamite. The honourable member is one of those squatters from the Western District. He was raised on a sheep farm and would not know what end of the cow the milk came out of. Be that as it may, it is good to see him in the House tonight and I am sure that this debate will be an education even to him.
A decade ago, less than 40 per cent of production was exported while today more than 60 per cent of production is exported. About two-thirds of our dairy exports are going to Asia, and Japan is our single most important market. I can recall a time when the exports from this industry were, in relative terms, quite minor at some $200 million. Now, of course, we have a significant export industry which is earning Australia around $3.2 billion per annum, although the drought and lower international prices have eaten rather savagely into this figure over the last 12 months. Most farmers currently receive 22c to 34c per litre of milk, depending on their location. The low prices received have been blamed largely on external factors such as drought and the strong dollar. For some farmers these prices are close to their 20-year average price, but for many, and especially for those who in the past mainly produced whole milk for the domestic fresh milk market, they represent a significant decline in price.
The single biggest problem for dairy farmers recently has been the drought, which is estimated to have cost dairy farmers in a number of areas around $1,000 per cow per annum. Rainfall in many dairying regions has been below average for seven years straight. I note that the honourable member for McMillan is in the chamber tonight. His electorate of Gippsland has been hardest hit in that respect with a paucity of rainfall in recent times. Drought has reduced production and forced up the price of feed and other inputs. It has highlighted the need to clarify a range of issues for farmers in irrigation areas. Many of these farmers face rising costs and cuts in water allocations. They are asking for a water policy that clarifies their rights and their futures. 
Despite the problems currently facing the industry, ADF President Alan Burgess was quoted in last week's Weekly Times as predicting a strong future for the industry based on strong demand for milk products and lower input costs. That is a vision of the industry that I share, and which I know is shared by many in the industry even though they are currently experiencing some difficulty.
It is less than 12 months since Dairy Australia was established as a Corporations Law company and already the parliament is being asked to make amendments to the legislation as a result of oversights, omissions and mistakes made at the time Dairy Australia was established last year. With this government and with this particular minister this has become an all too familiar pattern, especially where previous statutory authorities have been converted to Corporations Law companies. The most important amendment in this bill relates to the administration of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. Under current arrangements, the directors of Dairy Australia as trustees of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program could be held to be personally liable under the Corporations Act for any liabilities that arise that could not be satisfied by the fund. This bill proposes to retrospectively fully indemnify the directors of Dairy Australia against such liability.
The minister advises that these amendments do not serve to indemnify the industry services body against liabilities that arise from acts of negligence, fraud, breach of trust or any other actions not in accordance with the principles of trust law. In addition, there are provisions in the Dairy Produce Act and requirements imposed by the statutory funding agreement between the company and the government that impose accountability requirements in relation to the management of the fund. Given that the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program is fully funded from the 11c a litre that consumers pay whenever they purchase a litre of milk, it is highly unlikely that liabilities will ever exceed available funds and that these provisions will be needed in practice.
It is also highly unlikely that members of the current board of Dairy Australia would ever allow themselves or the company to be placed in a position where these provisions are needed. The board is led by Pat Rowley, a tireless champion of the dairy industry, who personally made great sacrifices to guide the industry through the murky waters of a deregulation that was forced on it by the Howard government and by the minister.
—By the states.
—The parliamentary secretary says, `By the states.' She should read the Hansard and not come into this House trotting out that blatant untruth. Every dairy farmer around Australia knows exactly that the gun was pointed by the Howard government at the dairy industry's head.
While the amendments are sensible and I am advised that such provisions are normal practice when a statutory authority is privatised, I am concerned that we are making retrospective amendments to legislation for an entity that is less than a year old. We should ask this question: if these provisions are so important, why didn't the minister include them in the original legislation that set up Dairy Australia?
We on this side of the House have become used to being asked to revisit government legislation to fix up omissions and problems. Sloppily drafted legislation has become a hallmark of this minister and of the government. This minister has had previous problems relating to the accountability of boards and executives of Corporations Law companies set up to replace statutory authorities. Dairy Australia receives and expends a considerable amount of money provided by the Australian community and by dairy farmers. It is vitally important that the public and the dairy farming community can have absolute confidence that this money is being managed appropriately.
I say that again: I have every confidence in the current board of Dairy Australia, and I have every confidence in Pat Rowley as chairman. But there will come a time when these individuals will no longer fill their current roles and others will replace them. I want to be absolutely sure that the legislative structure that we have in place provides for an appropriate level of accountability to this parliament, to dairy farmers and, indeed, to Australian taxpayers.
In his second reading speech, the minister said that the accountability provisions of existing corporations laws and the statutory funding agreement provided adequate protection of moneys provided by taxpayers and dairy farmers. But this is the minister who also thought that he had the accountability structure right in the case of Australian Wool Innovation—another agricultural authority which was made into a Corporations Law company by the government. In the case of AWI, an all-party report of the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee—and I quote from the report because it is relevant to what the government has done in the dairy industry—found:
Any concern that there was no effective accountability through the board to both the minister and levy payers and that there was no system of internal controls in place should have been quickly and fully investigated.
As with Dairy Australia, there was a statutory funding agreement between AWI and the Howard government, setting out appropriate accountability and internal controls. In the case of AWI, the minister was handing this company $55 million collected from wool growers as levies and $16 million collected from Australian taxpayers. As early as February 2002 the minister was told that there were inadequate accountability and control systems in place, yet he did not act. This was not an internal problem for the company, as the department suggested to the committee. This was clearly a problem for levy payers and, importantly, for taxpayers. It was a direct and immediate problem for the minister. It required clear and decisive action. Unfortunately, as was the case with the US beef quota issue and the live export situation, the minister failed once again to take timely action. It is important that the lessons of the AWI fiasco are taken on board so that they are not repeated in the future with other bodies such as Dairy Australia.
In his second reading speech on the legislation related to the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program we are debating here today, the minister referred to corporations laws and the statutory funding agreement as ensuring:
... the fund continues to be prudently and professionally managed into the future.
In the case of AWI, it is clear that the equivalent provisions in legislation and funding agreements relating to that body did not provide adequate protection for either levy payers or taxpayers. The Senate committee's AWI inquiry highlighted a number of problems in the government's preferred industry service model. These are the problems that we want to avoid here with the dairy industry. The committee formed the view that all expenditure by these private companies should be spent in accordance with the terms of their statutory funding agreements and it recommended that all statutory funding agreements should include a requirement mandating that expenditure be consistent with the strategic plan, the operational plan and the research and development guidelines. I believe that there is a need to revisit all statutory funding agreements with a view to incorporating these changes. We need to be sure that the problems encountered in AWI are never repeated in organisations such as Dairy Australia. 
This bill also amends the act to enable the company to borrow or raise money by dealing in securities. The definition of `borrowings' is also expanded to include activities such as raising finance by way of acknowledgement of debt and hedging through currency or other types of contracts. Labor also supports these amendments. 
In the time remaining to me, I will make some comment on the current state of the industry, because despite the recent package of assistance to the dairy industry, which totalled some $2 billion, there are many dairy farmers—especially young ones who entered the industry and were not eligible to receive the package—who are doing it tough in the current environment. On St Patrick's Day and at the invitation of the great member for McMillan, I travelled to Trafalgar in Gippsland to meet with dairy farmers and their families to discuss the difficulties many of them are experiencing as a result of low prices received in the marketplace for their milk. I met with 12 dairy farming families on a farm at Willow Grove. I would like to publicly thank all who attended for their kind hospitality and for the way in which they entered into the productive discussions that took place on the day.
Many important issues were raised, and they will certainly be debated in the context of this bill, but there is one matter that I want to put front and square before the minister tonight, and I urge him to immediately respond to this situation in good faith. On 2 February, dairy farmers from this area wrote to the Prime Minister on matters of concern to them and their families. They were informed by the Prime Minister that the letter had been forwarded to the minister for agriculture for consideration and reply. The farmers waited patiently for four weeks, and when a reply was not forthcoming they contacted the minister's office and received little satisfaction as a result of their representation. I urge the minister to at least make contact with these farmers and to make some effort to understand their concerns. 
Let me briefly outline the main elements of those concerns. The member for McMillan will expand on them in more detail when he follows in this debate. The central concern is that the price they currently receive for their milk—which ranges between 21c and 28c a litre and averages around 23c to 24c a litre—is simply not covering many of their production costs. Given their high debt levels and production costs, many are considering their future in dairying. The alarming thing for me was to see quite young farmers, who were not able to access the structural adjustment package and who are currently carrying high debt as a result of their entry into the industry, openly talking about whether they have a future in the industry. Because of the high average age levels now in the industry, this was perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of the discussions that we had with those farm families.
The pressure on families of long hours of work without getting an adequate return have led some to question their future in the industry. Many of those operating farms are surviving only because one or two family members have been fortunate enough to secure off-farm work and income to sustain the enterprise through this period of stress resulting from drought and the high currency. The conventional wisdom from consultants and accountants is for these farmers to increase their herd size. But that is easier said than done, because that would bring a heavier workload and an increase in their current high debt levels.
The farmers expressed further concerns about the market behaviour of their cooperatives and retail outlets, their own level of return from the marketplace for their efforts, and the drop in milk prices that they expect on 1 July. I appreciate that there are no easy answers to the situation they currently face and the added difficulty of fronting governments with their problems in the face of the industry receiving around $2 billion in structural assistance via the Howard government's tax on milk, but there is a responsibility on government to hear these grassroots concerns and explore with farmers ways to secure the industry's future.
The minister, over a period of time in considering a package of assistance to this industry, professed to be concerned about its future. We met with young dairy farmers who are very concerned about their futures. They have made representations to the government, and the least the government could do is respond to those concerns. The member for McMillan, who will follow in this debate, will outline some of those concerns in greater detail. I urge the minister to take it upon himself to get out of Wide Bay—get out of his pork-barrelling mode in Wide Bay—and go down to Gippsland and speak to these dairy farmers. In that face-to-face contact, the minister not only will be able to hear their real concerns but also may be able to offer some assurance to those farmers that they are being listened to and are being heard. The Labor Party will be supporting the passage of this legislation through the parliament.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2004-03-22,"—I rise in this House tonight to discuss the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. As the federal member for a very large rural electorate in Queensland, covering some of the most remote parts of Queensland, I represent many dairy farmers, and I am very sympathetic to their concerns. Since the early days of settlement of Australia, dairy farmers across Australia have provided the very basic foods that we all need—milk and dairy products, which are essential to our daily lives. The dairy farmers in my electorate are in a dairy region in Queensland which overflows into other federal electorates. It is actually one of the largest—if not the largest—dairy region in Queensland. It is not all in my electorate of Maranoa; it flows into the geographical area of the electorate of the member for Groom and down into the Lockyer Valley.
For the public record, I am not just sympathetic to the concerns of my own dairy farmers but also very sympathetic to the concerns of all Australia's dairy farmers and producers, who continue to experience a lot of difficulties post deregulation. They are suffering a lot of pain and are considering their future in the industry. Of course, post deregulation, we saw the rise of the Australian dollar, which certainly did not help the dairy industry in Australia. The exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the US dollar, which is the benchmark—as much of the export products in the dairy industry are sold in US dollar exchange rate circumstances—has risen to levels that have certainly had an impact on the farm gate price. The other thing that has impacted on the dairy industry is the exceptional drought. The drought meant that production was going to fall in Australia. Without supplementation of feed for dairy herds, the product that they are producing would have fallen to unsustainable levels. Of course, they had to maintain production, and that resulted in additional costs that were not budgeted for pre deregulation.
Of particular concern to me, post deregulation, is the inability of many individual producers to negotiate a fairer price for their product with our large processors and retail supermarkets. I am still not convinced by the argument that the market is working. I do not believe it is working effectively. To see that, you only have to look at the price differentials that some farmers are receiving in Victoria, New South Wales or Queensland—anywhere between 22c or 23c a litre right through to 33c, 34c and 35c a litre for basically the same quality milk. So I do not believe the market is working effectively.
To help in this regard, in very good faith the federal government recently sought the approval of the ACCC to allow dairy producers to collectively bargain for a fair farm gate price for their product. I suppose there are many members in this House who thought that this may have been an opportunity for dairy farmers to get together to be able to negotiate a better arrangement with the processors, but I think that too is an issue that is still yet to bear fruit for our dairy families.
Last week saw some dairy farmers protesting around Australia at federal members' offices. Indeed, the member for McMillan, who is in the House at the moment, and the member from the other side who spoke previously on this bill, the member for Corio and opposition spokesman, spoke of this. The dairy farmers are angry and I know that. I have met with the dairy producers in my own electorate and I certainly understand their plight very clearly. But it is wrong of these farmers to point the finger at this federal government in terms of deregulation. I want to remind the House that it was the state Labor governments who were responsible for the introduction of the legislation to deregulate the dairy industry, and it is the state Labor governments who then walked away from any responsibility to assist the industry through the very difficult and painful process of adjusting to deregulation. I urge those producers to go and see their state Labor ministers for agriculture, who introduced the legislation into their state parliaments to deregulate the industry, in any future protest. I respect their right to protest; they have the democratic right to do that. But if they want to protest on this issue they should take their anger to the state Labor governments who initially introduced deregulation legislation into their parliaments.
By comparison, the coalition government listened to the industry leaders—I must say it was their call—who saw that one day the industry would be deregulated. They sought from the federal government to have a coordinated approach to a compensation and restructuring package for the industry. It was this government that introduced legislation, to the tune of $1.8 billion to nearly $2 billion, as a compensation package that is going out to the dairy producers and regions across the nation. I believe that in terms of farm gate price for the dairy farmers of this nation the market is not working. I fail to see where the price of milk in the supermarkets has gone down post deregulation. In many instances I think it is at the same price or slightly more expensive, and yet the farmer is receiving less.
I also want to talk a little bit about the free trade agreement with the United States and the benefits that will flow to the Australian dairy industry, provided we can make sure we have a viable dairy industry in the future, under the free trade agreement that has been negotiated between Australia and the United States. This is a package of measures that is yet to be officially signed off. We hope we are going to have the support of the Labor Party. We have not heard from them lately but I would urge the member for McMillan, who is on the other side of the House at the moment, to go to his leader and get him to support the free trade agreement with the United States that is on the table at the moment and to stop playing politics with one of the most important trade agreements that this country has ever negotiated. We have negotiated an agreement with the United States of America, the largest single economy in the world, and I ask members of the Labor Party to stop playing politics with it and to show that they will support this free trade agreement.
From day one it is going to bring immense measurable benefits to the dairy industry in Australia. For instance, the Australian dairy industry can send nearly three times as much of current tariff quota products from year 1, with an ongoing growth in the quotas at an average rate of nearly five per cent per annum. The increase in year 1 is worth $55 million to the industry. Isn't that worth pursuing for the dairy industry, the producers and those dairy farmers we have spoken about tonight? It is $55 million in the first year. That is across the board for all dairy products that are constrained currently by quotas. It is also going to provide significant new market opportunities for dairy processors and producers. I am indebted to the Minister for Trade and his office for providing me some material in relation to the free trade agreement, and it is available on the Internet more widely for producers out there. For the benefit of the opposition, I urge them to go onto that site and look at the initiatives and what this free trade agreement will mean for Australia.
The deal includes access for dairy products that have been previously excluded from the market of the United States of America. The agreement provides for a significant increase in duty-free access to the United States market for Australian dairy products imported with tariff rate quotas. In addition, the in-quota tariffs in existing dairy quotas will be reduced to zero immediately the agreement enters into force. However, over-quota tariffs on dairy products subject to quota arrangements will not change under the agreement, except for gruyere cheese. The dairy products subject to tariff rate quotas are divided into a number of product categories. The exact products contained in each category are set out in a table which people can see on the Internet, or they can go to the minister's office and have a look at it to see the comprehensive range of products that will be affected by this free trade agreement.
I would like to read into the Hansard some of the products that will be affected. For instance, under the existing WTO arrangements with the United States, the quota for milk and ice-cream is zero. There will be an additional 7.5 million litres in year 1 of the free trade agreement, and that will grow by six per cent year on year for the life of the agreement. Condensed milk, under the WTO quota as it is at the moment, is a mere 92 tonnes. Under the free trade agreement, there is 3,000 tonnes in year 1. For butter and butter fat, there is zero quota at the moment under the WTO and 1,500 tonnes in the first year of the agreement, which will then grow by three per cent year on year. Skim milk powder is at 600 tonnes today. There will be an increase of 100 tonnes and then an increase of three per cent year on year. For other milk power, including whole milk powder, a mere 57 tonnes is allowed under the WTO quota today. That will rise to 4,000 tonnes in the first year, with an increase year on year of four per cent. In the interests of time, I seek leave to table the balance of that table of arrangements for the free trade agreement with the United States, because it is comprehensive and it highlights the importance of the free trade agreement with the United States of America.
Leave granted.
—I thank the member for McMillan. In conclusion, let me say that the dairy industry has gone through extremely difficult times. I have highlighted some of the concerns that I have on behalf of dairy farmers in my electorate and, more broadly, dairy farmers across this country. I am yet to be convinced there is a market that operates that is free and that delivers a sustainable price for the dairy farmers across this nation. The government abhor any of Australia's industries coming unstuck through deregulation. That is why we are completely committed to ensuring the long-term viability of not just the dairy industry but all industries. We will continue to seek a better way for dairy farmers to do business so that they can not only negotiate at a local level with their processors but be there in the long term to make the most of the free trade agreement which we want to sign in the course of this year—a free trade agreement which will bring benefits across many industries, including the service industries, and also to the agricultural sector.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I want to pick up on some of the remarks made by the member for Maranoa in his contribution to the debate on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. It is all well and good for people in this parliament to stand up and say things like the member for Maranoa said. He said that he is very concerned about all dairy farmers and went on to say that there is a market in the dairy industry that is not working effectively. But it rests upon members who make such statements when they are in government to actually do something for their constituents.
You would never get a better example than the dairy industry of where the National Party has let down its constituents. The National Party used to be the party that stood up for country people, the party that was unashamed to stand up to the Liberal Party and any other party in this place and defend the interests of rural and regional Australia. But all we have today is the National Party turning its back on its traditional constituents—just like the member for Maranoa is doing now, as he walks out of the chamber. He is like so many of the other National Party members of this place who have the opportunity to do something for their constituents but do not do anything at all. People do not want hand wringing; they do not want pious statements; they do not want sombre speeches in this place about how one member has a great love for farmers or for a certain industry. What they want is action. They want people to stand up and fight for them in this place. And, when it comes to standing up and fighting, the National Party is the great disappointment of the Australian parliament and a great disappointment to all Australian rural and regional communities.
I want to pick up on a few of the comments that the member for Maranoa made on the issues affecting the dairy industry today. They are not mickey mouse issues that he is talking about. When the member for Maranoa says that he does not think there is a proper, functioning market in the dairy industry, he is the king of understatement. There is something very crook in the dairy industry—very crook indeed. When you, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, and I go down to the local milk bar, we pay $1.60 per litre. Yet, when a hardworking dairy farmer in my electorate of McMillan gets the milk tanker to come round from the cooperative or the milk company, that farmer is only getting between 21c and 28c per litre, on average. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the other members of this place: is that fair? Is it fair that the farmer—the person who does the hard work, takes the personal risk, has their money and their family's future invested, and has made all of that commitment—gets paid so little from the final product? And what a huge difference there is. There are many agricultural industries where there is a very large gap between what the producer gets and what the consumer pays, and the dairy industry is a very good example of this.
I make the point that the milk companies are not turning gravel into gold; they are turning milk into milk. There are processes which take place; value adding is done and some science is applied. There are some important stages in the process once the milk leaves the farm in the tanker. I have to ask myself what is going on when a litre of milk costs $1.60 and the farmer in my electorate gets only between 21c and 27c per litre. Something is wrong in the dairy industry. I think there are serious market issues in relation to how the sector operates.
It is interesting to observe that the milk price available to dairy producers is similar from milk company to milk company to milk cooperative. On average people in my electorate are able to get 23c or 24c per litre from the milk companies they are able to supply to; there is not a great deal of difference. When you add into the equation the fact that there are substantial barriers to entry to and exit from the industry, it becomes very clear that we have some serious market distortions which are having a direct effect on the lives of farmers and their families.
The member for Corio mentioned in his contribution today that he had recently visited my electorate to talk to some dairy farmers in West Gippsland and in the South Gippsland district. The farmers we met in West Gippsland, in a little place called Willow Grove, north of Trafalgar, told us very plainly how hard they are doing it and how tough things are for them and their families. The group was largely made up of younger farmers.
Everyone in this place agrees that the dairy industry has great potential. It is an industry which has gone through substantial restructure and change, an industry where we have seen greater focus on value adding over the course of the last 10 years. Members of this parliament must not forget that the dairy industry has no future at all if we do not have farmers who are prepared to be in the industry, contribute the efforts of their labour and make enormous personal sacrifices in order to produce the milk we rely on so heavily. That applies not just to the products we take for granted in the domestic market but also to Australia's export performance.
We need to be conscious of the needs of dairy farmers. We need to understand that they do not have meetings with their neighbours and discussions with members of parliament, shadow ministers and ministers for no good reason; they have these meetings because they are very concerned about the future of their industry. There are no greater stakeholders in the dairy industry than ordinary dairy farmers, wherever they may be.
During the discussion last Friday, when the member for Corio visited my electoral district, a number of farmers in the dairy industry in West Gippsland and South Gippsland mentioned to us that quite a few people had been able to obtain support through the federal government's $2 billion dairy adjustment package, which the government gets from the milk tax they have levied. At that meeting the point was made that a lot of the farmers who took that money have got out of the industry. Many of the people sitting around the table talking to us did not get a brass razoo out of that package, because they did not have a long enough history in the industry to qualify for a grant. That meant they were behind the eight ball straightaway.
A number of young farmers are finding themselves in the same situation as the farmers we met at Willow Grove. Many members of the group told us that they are having to go off farm to earn enough money to keep their families afloat. We heard stories of farmers and their partners who have been working upwards of 80 hours each week, as well as holding off-farm jobs, to try to keep the farm going and keep their families afloat during the particularly difficult period they are going through.
People expressed concern at the failure of the government's package to reorient the industry. They genuinely felt that the package the government has come up with for the dairy industry is not so much a dairy package as a dairy exit package. I think that is a fair enough criticism to make of the package the government brought in. There was a lot of money allocated for people to leave the industry but there was not too much made available for people to make substantial changes to their practices or to substantially change the orientation of the dairy industry towards value adding or perhaps new export markets. This was clearly understood and felt by the people involved in the discussion at that meeting.
The people at that meeting felt overwhelmingly that their families were suffering substantial negative effects from all the hardships the dairy farmers had been experiencing. Some partners told me of the difficulties they were finding in making ends meet with the amount of income being generated from their farm and made plain what this means to them and their prospects in the dairy industry. They made it clear that, unless things improve in the dairy industry, they will get out of it altogether, as many people in my district have done.
In many cases the people who have got out of the dairy industry are the younger farmers. They find themselves in a particularly difficult situation. They have invested a lot of money in farms which are the size and scale that they need to be in order to be competitive, and that has required them to take out substantial loans. You cannot be a dairy farmer in this day and age and run around after 80 cows. Those days are gone. For a dairy farm to be competitive and productive, it has to have at least around 200 cows. Many of us in this place know of herd numbers much higher than that.
People have to make very big financial investments. We have seen that the people who have been prepared to come into the dairy industry and make those investments, that financial commitment, are now very disappointed by the circumstances in the dairy industry and the effect on their weekly income and their ability to plan for a future. It is very hard for dairy farmers to plan for their future when they are getting so much less this year than they did last year, despite the fact that many people's farms are producing substantially more milk. It is not a good market signal when people do everything right, are efficient, are productive and are very good environmentally and yet the return from all of that effort is substantially less than that of the previous year, with the prospect of a lower milk price the following year.
There has been speculation in the Weekly Times that milk prices might fall by another 25 per cent before the end of the year. Dairy farmers in my electorate are saying plainly to me and to other people that they will not be able to get by if the milk price stays the way that it is, because it is not covering their costs, and it is likely that they will have to get out of the industry altogether. Imagine how severe the repercussions will be if milk prices fall by another 25 per cent. I suggest that we might see a very substantial number of people exit the industry if those circumstances eventuate.
There has been a call by the dairy farmers in my electorate—and I think that this call is supported by dairy farmers in other parts of the country—for the federal government to establish an inquiry into why the dairy industry is in such difficult circumstances in terms of the amount that farmers get versus the amount that people pay for a litre of milk at the supermarket or the corner store. I support their call for an inquiry. I think there should be a proper inquiry into issues confronting the dairy industry. In particular, the Howard government should look at why we do not have a proper functioning market in the dairy industry right now. It is important that the Howard government looks at why dairy farmers in my electorate and other electorates have to choose between milk companies and dairy cooperatives, who all happen to be prepared to pay almost identical prices for a dairy farmer's milk. They offer 23c, 24c or 24½c. It is uncanny.
As I mentioned before, there are very substantial barriers to entry and exit, and dairy farmers find themselves in a very weak bargaining position in their ability to negotiate a fair price with milk companies. Every day tens of thousands of litres of milk are produced by their cows and, if there is no tanker to come around and pick it up, dairy farmers cannot very well pour all their milk in the creek. I am sure that the EPA in Victoria would have something to say about that, and probably the farmer would very quickly be stung with a very large fine. Dairy farmers are in a vulnerable bargaining position. It is very evident that the competition that characterises a lot of other agricultural industries is not there in the dairy industry. They have made a very persuasive case to the Howard government to get off their hands in relation to this issue and actually do something to make sure that we have a proper functioning market in operation.
When we talk about the dairy industry it is important that we understand that it is heavily export oriented. In that context, it is very important that we are as productive as we can be. For this reason, I think that it is important not only that we have a proper functioning market in Australia for the milk which our dairy farmers produce but also that we have good infrastructure in place—including roads as well as telecommunications infrastructure—so that our dairy companies and dairy corporations are competing in the most efficient way possible. I used the example today of the Pakenham bypass, which is part of the Princes Highway system and which many farmers and milk companies use. It is a very important road in getting milk products out to the export market. I say to the Howard government: build the Pakenham bypass. Honour your promise and match the state government's $121 million to make sure this project is completed.
It is also important that the federal government address the issue of high-speed Internet to some of these country districts where the dairy industry is also strong. For example, I was just down at Burra Foods in Korumburra in the south Gippsland region. They told me that they are unable to get broadband to their dairy factory because Telstra has decided that it is not going to roll out broadband to Korumburra, despite the fact that the town is almost exactly the same size as Leongatha, which does have broadband. They tell me that it would make an enormous difference to them if they had access to high-speed Internet as opposed to the old dial-up connection which they are forced to use now. An important issue is to make sure that the dairy industry has access to good infrastructure and modern telecommunications and to make sure that it can compete effectively with other countries, regions and cities which have access to that type of quality infrastructure, whether it be roads or high-speed telecommunications services.
The issues that we are discussing today are very important to farmers. We must not allow the parliament to lose sight of the fact that when we talk about the dairy industry we are talking about people. You cannot have a good dairy industry unless there is a proper return delivered to the people who are most important within that industry: the farmers. Farmers work hard. They invest a lot of their own money, time and effort in the farm, they take huge personal risks in the work they do and they work in physically tough occupations. I think the least the Howard government can do is to make sure that the market farmers are operating in functions effectively and that farmers get a decent return for the hard work they do and for the sacrifice that they and their families make.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—Tonight I rise to speak on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. The dairy industry is not in good shape—it is not in very good shape at all. In fact, if I look at statistics from Dairy Australia, the number of dairy farms in Australia has halved over the past two decades—from 22,000 in 1980 to fewer than 11,000 in 2003. It will be very interesting to see, when that statistic is updated, the number of people that are left in the industry.
To understand the plight of the dairy industry, we need to understand a few basics. As you go down the supermarket aisles, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will see two types of milk. You will see generic milk, which retails at around $1.99 for two litres, and then brand milk, which retails at around $2.94, yet my dairy farmers are receiving less than 25 per cent of that margin. The member for McMillan wants an inquiry to work out who is making the money. If the farmers are making 25 per cent, let me tell you the people making the money are the retailers.
To give you an example of how bad it is and how tilted in the wrong direction it is, if we took a 600-millilitre carton of milk, a 600-millilitre bottle of Coke and a 600-millilitre bottle of water and then priced each item in the supermarket, we would find that the milk would be around $1.10, the Coke around $2 and the water around $1.25. It defies logic that water that is simply taken out of the ground and put into a bottle would retail for more than milk. To produce milk, you have to manage animals, you have to irrigate, you have to fertilise, you have to transport, you have to process and then you have to package; yet it is cheaper than water. These are the things that are unfair to the farmers, the people that put in the effort to keep this country going.
Last year I complained in this House about milk being 26.5c a litre and that my farmers were going broke and going broke at a rate of knots because at that time it was costing them around 30c a litre to produce the milk. Recently it was announced that farmers were going to get 32c a litre. If they are going to get 32c a litre and it costs 30c a litre to produce the milk, you would think they would be back in a profit situation. But, as we move through the seasons and different times, the cost of producing milk varies as well. I am informed that the current cost of producing milk is around 35c a litre. So it would seem that the processors, people like dairy farmers, keep driving this margin that is just unprofitable for them. We are seeing farmers exiting the industry like never before. In fact, 32c a litre is just over half what they were getting prior to deregulation. My dairy farmers were hoodwinked when it came to deregulation of the dairy industry. Dairy deregulation was put up as the saviour of the industry. Members have talked about guns being put to farmers' heads.
The member for Corio came in here tonight and misled the House. He misled the House because he said that the federal government had deregulated the dairy industry. I challenge the member for Corio to come in here and produce one section of Hansard that shows legislation introduced by the federal government that called for deregulation of the dairy industry. There has been legislation involving industry assistance packages, but there has never been any legislation forcing the deregulation of the dairy industry. The fact is that the dairy industry was deregulated because the dairy farmers voted as groups for deregulation, under pressure—
—In Victoria.
—Yes, from the Victorians, as my friend the member for Leichhardt says—from the state governments. You might ask: why did the state governments want to deregulate the industry? Because there were incentive payments of a few million dollars. What we saw was deregulation of the dairy industry by the state Labor governments for a few dollars. They sold out the industry for a few dollars. The management of the industry, by the organisation groups, sold out the farmers at the gate because it was expedient for them.
As I searched through all of the databases, the only federal involvement I could find pertaining to dairy deregulation, or any deregulation at all, was of none other than former Prime Minister Keating when he introduced the national competition policy that Professor Hilmer had advised him on so well. The reality is that the deregulation of the dairy industry was driven by the state governments. In New South Wales, Bob Carr's state Labor government could not get to the gate quickly enough: they wanted that incentive payment. The interesting thing is that not one cent of that incentive payment was ever paid to the dairy industry. Carr took the incentive payment and pocketed it—and that is exactly what we are seeing happen now with the deregulation of other industries in New South Wales.
The reality is that there is a huge imbalance of power between supermarkets and the small amount that farmers receive for their milk, which is, as I have said, less than 25 per cent. My farmers cannot continue to produce milk when the cost of production is greater than the price they are getting for their product, because all they are doing at the end of the day is eating up their assets to prop up a large organisation. From what I have read, I believe the free trade agreement will be good for a lot of industries, and it will be good for the dairy industry. But only five to 10 per cent of the milk from my area of Paterson is actually exported; the rest is for Australian consumption. Yet my farmers are having to compete with corrupt overseas markets.
I have brought to Canberra three gentlemen whom I have a lot of respect for: Dallas Clarke, Bob Koppman and Keith Watkins. Dallas Clarke is weighing up his options as to whether he continues in the industry. He has invested large amounts of money installing free-stall feedlots, upgrading his dairy. He took the punt, but that punt is very marginal and it looks like he may have done his dough. Keith Watkins is about to increase his herd. He has about 270 cattle and he is about to invest some money to see if he can make a go of it. And I hope he can. Keith Watkins—or `Bluey', as we know him—is a decent, honest, hardworking man who puts in the hours, puts his back into it and is battling to try to eke out an existence.
But there is one bloke, Bob Koppman, who has decided to pull the pin on the industry. Bob Koppman has a property in Nelson Plains that was running around 130 head of cattle. With the reductions in the milk price, he was losing around $40,000 per annum. he has had to take that exit and that has had a fairly deep effect. It means that local jobs have gone—people who were working on his farm. He is now just running beef cattle. There is one simple message: it is impossible to make money running beef cattle on a dairy farm, given the size of it, because you cannot get the number of cattle per acre that you need to make it survive.
At a recent roundtable in Sydney, which was put together by Andrew Stoner and Duncan Gay, Bob Koppman gave an address. I will now read that address into Hansard, because I think it is fairly pertinent: It states:
It is indeed a privilege to have been asked to address this round table discussion into the state of the dairy industry.
I along with other concerned farmers called a meeting at Dungog some sixteen months ago, many meetings have followed since that date. It appears that we have been treated with contempt until the National Party conference in Forster last year, a mutual friend and national party delegate spoke to a senior woolworths representative about dairying in particular. This conversation resulted in a meeting of grass roots farmers with two senior woolworths executives and was most fruitful. The results of that meeting were reported back to Duncan Gay. This resulted into a request from Duncan to visit some dairies in the Hunter. We took him to a variety of farms, some state of the art, others tidy dairies but in need of an update and some that would be forced to close and have in fact done so. Four of the more modern dairies recently upgraded with state of the art technology and managed by young men and women, heavily in debt and because of the price being received for their product, unable to see their way clear under the current circumstances. In January I received a request from Duncan to go to the Lachlan Valley and visit dairies suffering the same consequences with the added burden of no water but required to pay 65% of their license fee to the State Government.
Last week I attended the dairy delegates conference at NSWF and listened intently to the speakers, namely Dr Mike Ginivan, Alan Burgess ADF, Ian Langdon DF, Arthur Burns PNSW Dairy Div, Associate Professor Fredoun Ahmadi Esfahini. All speakers except the good professor spoke of persons talking the industry down and that it has to cease. The professor stated that there were sufficient money in the system for all of agriculture it just had to be distributed more fairly and clawed back from the retail sector and reduce their market power. Whilst I agree that talking the industry down is not good, it has to be clearly understood that the truth needs to be told. We are going broke at a fast rate, no longer having the ability to pass on or absorb ever increasing costs.
Please let me give you a view glaring examples of farmers in trouble.
In the M/G Valley, farmers are selling their machinery to second hand dealers, then leasing them back to create cash flow. Many have sold their heifers to the export market and are now short of young dairy stock. One very senior industry leader and adviser to government I understand has borrowed $500,000 at the rate of $1000 per cow to remain viable. Another has told me in private, I am hurting badly as the rest of you but as an industry leader I can't be seen to be talking the industry down. This farmer operates a share farm operation and his share farmers wife has recently returned to her profession because of financial problems.
To the retail sector may I say you do a sterling job in retailing all farm produce. However it must be clearly understood that if you wish to continuing during the quality of produce supplied (the best in the world) you have to make sure suppliers are paid more than the cost of production alone.
After serious and when the discussions with my financial adviser, Agri Business Banker, and our cooperative pricing section, I have taken the decision to exit the industry. I have no forward family succession plan and even if I did I do not see my operation being financially viable in the medium term.
The only way forward for the industry is in my view, full and frank discussion in relation to price. This will need to be sanctioned by the ACCC. Our milk supply management has and for me to expect downward pressure soon. And the price three years out will continue to remain flat.
It is my opinion that industry leaders have let the farmers down, our cooperative in particular needs a full and thorough ergonomic study into its Board of Directors and Senior management as we have not received a dividend for compulsory share payments for some time. My company has a modest share portfolio in National Foods and we are during a good dividend return, however in my opinion this has been at a disadvantage to their farmers suppliers. I wish the industry well particularly young farmers in my area.
I would like to thank Duncan and his staff for the mammoth effort in putting this round table discussion together, thanks also should go to my local Federal member Bob Baldwin who arranged meetings with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture at the federal level late last year.
To hear a very proud man like Bob Koppman having to deliver that speech rips your heart out. This is a man who put his heart and soul into building up a farm with world's best practices so that it could be competitive. But you cannot be competitive when the industry insists on paying you less than your cost of production.
I note that according to a press release from Dairy Australia Pat Rowley, the Chairman of Dairy Australia, has switched from milking cows to raising heifers. What message does it send when the Chairman of Dairy Australia gives up dairying to produce heifers? Something needs to be done; otherwise, under a free trade agreement we will be drinking milk imported from overseas. There will be no dairy farmers and there will be no milk processing companies because they will have driven the people off the farms and there will no longer be a product to sell.
There is talk about competition. If you are in the Hunter Valley in my electorate of Paterson, you have got Dairy Farmers. If you want to sell to National Foods or even to Bega, who were paying more per litre last year than other companies, the reality is that it costs 1c per litre per hour in a truck to move milk. So for Bega—which is about an eight- or nine-hour drive from Paterson—that is 8c or 9c per litre that you have to make up. The price advantage was only 1c or 2c greater than what Dairy Farmers was paying their farmers. To access other markets with competition meant that the farmers were, yet again, subsidising the price of their milk to be able to achieve markets. I do not think deregulation was the right answer for our dairy industry. As I see the number of farmers who have walked off the farms in my electorate, I know it was not the right decision. 
There has been talk about reregulating the industry. The only people who can reregulate the industry are the state governments, and they would have to put up a very good case to be able to do it. But the people in control of the state governments are the Labor Party, so it is hypocrisy for the member for Corio and the member for McMillan to come in here and talk about how they stand up and represent their farmers. It is their Labor Party and their Labor governments throughout Australia that introduced the deregulation. 
I do not want to get into who is to blame; I am more focused on what we can do for our farmers. I demand that Dairy Farmers, as my local processor, looks at the price it is paying for milk. If it does not, before too long it will be importing milk, at 1c per litre per hour in a truck, from other areas just to get the quantity to be able to keep up with the throughput it needs to keep Hexham operational. Over the years, I think Dairy Farmers has done the wrong thing by my electorate. It closed down the butter factory at Gloucester—and that cost jobs that were very much needed in Gloucester—and it had a rationalisation at Hexham. But how long will it be before it decides that is not viable because there are not enough farmers in the area? The question needs to be asked: why aren't there enough farmers? The reality is that it is because it has not managed its business affairs in a way that was conducive to people staying on their land producing milk. The irony in all this is that Dairy Farmers is a cooperative that is owned by people like Bob Koppman who have had to pull the pin on their dairy business because their own company could not pay them the money that they needed to survive.
What I do notice is that there is always enough money in companies like Dairy Farmers to pay their directors and their senior management large licks of money so they do not feel the ill effects of their decisions. Their decisions have caused serious havoc in towns in my electorate like Gloucester, Dungog and Nabiac, to name but a few. The damage that has been done by this dairy deregulation has been immense. Yes, there is an adjustment package, but that does not fix the fundamental and structural problems in an area, because it does not matter how much money you pump into trying to prop up and support an area. The reality is that without a core industry like the dairy industry, a town loses a little bit of its heart. And we have been doubly hit, because in those same areas we have lost our timber industry because of Paul Keating's wanton desire to make sure that no trees were chopped down. In some areas I support that, but in areas like Gloucester, Dungog and surrounding regions, which have been logged over years and years and the trees keep regrowing, it did not damage the area. That was one of the reasons why the Gloucester butter factory closed. They say it was due to the inability to get the sawdust to fire up the boilers.
Where do we go from here? I think that I would support an inquiry. We do have a primary industries committee, which is a bipartisan committee of this parliament. Perhaps it could take on, as terms of reference, looking at the future direction of the dairy industry. But it is not hard to work out who is making the most money out of the hard sweat, dollars and investment of my dairy farmers, and that is the major retailers. They should have a look at it and they should develop a social and moral conscience towards my dairy farming community.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—I am very pleased to speak tonight on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. As someone who represents many excellent rural areas where there are quite a number of dairy farms, I have a very keen interest in the dairy industry. I have worked with local farmers and rural communities to help them overcome some of the extreme difficulties they have had to face over the past few years due to deregulation of the dairy industry. It has been a tough and challenging time for many, but I am very proud to report that local farmers have risen to this challenge. There has been a huge amount of endeavour, creative thinking and old-fashioned hard work by many people to adjust to the changed conditions and, very often, to find new and innovative ideas for their farms. I will go into more detail about what has occurred in my own electorate later in my speech.
This bill basically makes minor administrative amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 which facilitate the functioning of Dairy Australia Ltd. Dairy Australia is the company that was created in July last year and was formerly known as the Australian Dairy Corporation. Dairy Australia has been responsible for administering the government's Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, just as the Dairy Corporation did before it. This bill contains indemnity provisions for Dairy Australia in relation to the fund. These provisions are standard in commercial environments and are totally necessary to ensure the proper functioning of this company.
The bill also allows Dairy Australia access to additional financial instruments such as options, agreements, securities, currency and futures contracts and currency hedging. This will enable Dairy Australia to more adequately fund the operations of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. This bill was developed in consultation with Dairy Australia and the amendments were previously widened and widely discussed in the lead up to their conversion from the Australian Dairy Corporation.
These amendments make sense. They are necessary for Dairy Australia to properly carry out its responsibilities and I am pleased to support them. I am also pleased to take this opportunity to reflect on the changes the dairy industry has undergone in recent years. It is an understatement to say that they have been massive, but it has been a process of change that began well before deregulation. Since 1980 the number of dairy farmers in Australia has halved but the number of dairy cattle has increased, with the average herd more than doubling from 85 to 195. While milk production fell last year for the first time in 50 years, as a result of our drastic drought, it was still nearly double the amount that it was in 1980.
The dairy industry has also greatly expanded its export market. Ten years ago exports accounted for about 40 per cent of production. Today it is a massive 60 per cent. In fact, deregulation was, in a sense, an inevitable part of ongoing changes to that industry. This is evidenced by the words of Pat Rawley, who was then chairman of the Dairy Industry Council. When the Senate report into deregulation of the dairy industry was released in 1999, Mr Rawley's press statement of 21 October 1999 said:
Today's Senate report is a significant document because it ... recognises the inevitability of the deregulation of the dairy industry and the need for a financial package to manage the transition to a fully commercial environment. 
He said the Senate rural committee had:
... reached conclusions broadly in line with the AIDC's own analysis of the situation confronting dairy farmers after the end of the domestic market support (DMS) scheme.
He went on to say:
The fact that the report's recommendations were unanimously supported by Liberal, National, Labor and Australian Democrat senators on the committee should be noted.
...	...	...
Its conclusions should finally put to rest the arguments about alternatives to deregulation which have been advanced by a minority section of the industry in recent months.
The fact is that, contrary to some of the scuttlebutt and attempted political point scoring at that time, deregulation of the dairy industry was not something driven by the Howard government. It was not something we initiated or pushed. It was industry driven and ultimately necessary for the long-term good of the industry. The process by which it took place was actually initiated by the various state governments, but we, as the federal government, recognised the importance of the dairy industry to Australia—in value added terms it is our largest rural industry, employing around 60,000 people.
We recognised that dairy farmers would need a great deal of help and support to get through the period of deregulation. We were very determined to do all we could to make sure that farmers had every opportunity to make these adjustments and, if necessary, look at new opportunities in other areas. The $1.8 billion dairy industry adjustment packages consisted of four key programs: the Dairy Industry Adjustment Program, the supplementary dairy assistance program, the Dairy Exit Program and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. The first three programs provided payments directly to farmers; the last one—Dairy RAP funding—provided assistance to our local communities to help them adjust.
I think the whole package was, and continues to be, a very practical and successful response to a very difficult situation. It reflects the Howard government's focus on local communities. Building communities is a cornerstone of our policy approach. It underpins everything we do. Whereas Labor in government have always been about helping special interest groups and peak bodies, our aim has always been to get support where it is needed most—on the ground in local communities, where the real work is done.
We believe in local solutions for local problems and we believe in backing local initiative and drive. All of our programs—Landcare, Greencorps, Work for the Dole and the job training network—are about local approaches. We also believe that such an approach brings better value for taxpayers' dollars and more practical results. Dairy RAP funding has been about supporting local communities to deal with the effects of deregulation each in their unique, appropriate way. It was community driven. It really makes sense to take this approach. The way that best suits the dairy farmers in my electorate may not necessarily work in Tasmania, for instance.
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the area consultative committees around Australia for their hard work in helping the Howard government deliver practical assistance where it is most needed. They are our local eyes and ears and work closely with businesses and community organisations to really make a difference. In my own electorate I thank the past chairman, Brian Gassman, and the incoming chairman, Dennis Chant, as well as Annie Norton-Knight and the entire committee for their fine work over the years. When it comes to Dairy RAP funding, they have had some wonderful success stories in Forde.
As well as funding for ongoing counselling and financial advice to directly assist dairy farmers, there has been a wide range of funding support for other initiatives for our local rural businesses. There was $55,000 for the new crops options project in Boonah to help identify new crops that would have the greatest chance of success in the Boonah shire and to help provide advice to dairy farmers thinking of diversifying. Consequently a further $220,000 was provided to a local company to facilitate the processing of Ebisu squash for the Japanese market and provide local farmers with an opportunity to diversify their business.
Another announcement saw $220,000 for an eel nursery in the Beaudesert region to create a new industry. This has provided 18 new jobs and they are now an export manufacturer. There was a further $223,500 for the Plasvac expansion project, which assisted small companies specialising in veterinary plasma supplies to expand their laboratory, creating 17 new jobs and another new industry for our rural region. Then there was $55,000 for the Gold Coast hinterland wine country marketing plan to help promote and expand award winning local wineries at Tamborine Mountain. There was $44,797 to increase export opportunities for a local company called Ironbark Recyclers, specialising in fine furniture created from recycled timber in our rural area. Another round of Dairy RAP funding provided $750,000 to establish a game meat export plant in our rural town of Beaudesert, again to create new jobs and greatly increase export opportunities.
The list goes on. There was funding of $242,000 to Standfast Enterprises to help them manufacture their unique safety harness and to market it around the world. It has been very successful and two new factories have been built in our rural towns because of Standfast. There was $220,000 to help establish the world-class Beaudesert equestrian centre, which is now a reality and a tremendous facility that acts as a hub for the growing horse related industry in the shire of Beaudesert. Again, it is a new industry with new spin-off enterprises and a lot of new jobs for the community. This is what Dairy RAP funding has been about: creating jobs and helping local communities secure a better economic future in the wake of deregulation.
There have been many more examples in my own electorate over the last few years, but I do not have the time today to list them all. The thing to remember is that, on top of this new industry, there has been over $1.63 billion in direct payments to dairy farmers—a huge assistance package by any measure. Again, it reflects the government's commitment to rural and regional communities. That said, I do not want to play down the problems that many dairy farmers have faced. Some farm families that have been in the dairy industry for generations have left. That is sad for the industry and very distressing personally for those involved. While there is no denying that deregulation has brought great difficulties for some, it has also presented great opportunities and challenges for many. As I said, I see many inspiring stories in my own electorate of individuals taking on new ideas and of communities striving together to support their industries.
It is widely acknowledged that the Australian dairy industry will be much better off in the long term as a result of deregulation. History, of course, will be the best judge of that, but I believe that the Howard government has done everything possible to make sure the adjustment period has been as manageable as possible for farmers. Change is generally stressful, but we have worked hard to minimise the stress when deregulation inevitably came about. We did that because it is the right thing to do and because our farmers deserve our support.
I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak in support of this bill and to place on the public record my strong support for the dairy industry, especially the dairy producers in my electorate. I congratulate them for the way that they have handled themselves through some very difficult times. I have always been there to support them and I have made sure that the minister has come into my electorate to talk to them in person. This bill will ensure that Australian dairies can continue to effectively manage the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program in the interest of the industry. I commend the bill to the House and also congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for his ongoing work in support of our farmers.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—I am delighted to rise and speak on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003 because I have within my electorate of Flinders a large number of incredibly capable, committed and passionate dairy farmers. Not long ago, I met with a representative from the office of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry who came with me to Lang Lang, a rural town in my electorate. There we had dairy farmers from Lang Lang, Caldermeade, Yannathan, Kernot—all of these towns within my electorate of Flinders which are primarily dairying towns. There are people there who have given their lives to the service of the land and who have a passionate commitment to the land, to dairying and to the whole notion of providing a sense of backbone to rural and regional Australia.
The first thing I want to do in supporting the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003 is to give my thanks and appreciation to those farmers who have given such service. Through organisations such as the Lang Lang Pastoral, Agricultural and Horticultural Association, they bring together a sense of community: they provide an economic base and a social base to the rural and regional communities of the Bass Coast shire. In looking at the role of the dairy community and the steps that this bill takes in order to help them, I also want to acknowledge that there are many dairy farmers, not just throughout Flinders but throughout Victoria and throughout Australia, who have done it incredibly hard through the drought, the adjustment program and the general climate of conditions that face rural Australia. We do extraordinarily well, but there are individual farmers, in particular in dairying, who do it hard. I have met many of these people at Lang Lang on numerous occasions, and they have talked of the hardships and challenges they face. They have genuine difficulties. In many cases, their concerns have led to family breakdown and tragedies on the land. So we must do everything we can to provide these farmers with a fair go and an equal opportunity. Where they are unable to make a living, we must help them make the transition into other opportunities. But we must never, ever leave or abandon these people who have done so much for the country. 
I want to focus now on two elements of help for dairy producers. Firstly, before moving directly to the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill, I want to focus on the benefits which the government has just managed to secure for dairy producers under the United States-Australia free trade agreement. Under the free trade agreement, the Australian dairy industry will be able to send nearly three times as many current tariff quota products from year one, with ongoing quotas growing at an average yearly rate of five per cent. That is nearly three times as much from year one. This increase will be worth $55 million to Australian dairy farmers in the first year of the agreement. It is across the board for all dairy products, which are currently constrained by quotas, and will therefore provide significant new market opportunities for dairy processors and dairy producers. Upon signature of the free trade agreement, there will be real and immediate benefits for dairy producers in places such as Caldermeade, Lang Lang and throughout the area.
In addition, the biggest market access gains are in products where the Australian dairy industry is most competitive and sees great prospects for substantial growth. The deal includes access for dairy products previously excluded from the US market such as certain cheese, butter, milk, cream and ice cream products. Examples include 7½ million litres of milk, ice cream and cream, and 2,000 tonnes of European style cheeses. All of those are real benefits which should accrue in a short period to Australian farmers and, in particular, to dairy farmers from throughout the Western Port and Bass Coast areas. 
That leads me to the particular elements in the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. The bill seeks to amend the Dairy Produce Act 1986 in response to changes in the status of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the way in which it is transitioning into Dairy Australia. The bill does three things. First, it enables the company to be fully indemnified out of the assets of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. That is an important structural step. Second, it enables Dairy Australia to enter into and perform financial arrangements other than borrowings. Third, it enables Dairy Australia to enter into and to perform contracts and other arrangements for managing risk associated with the administration of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. These may seem technical reforms, but in essence they are about assisting farmers in the transition and in their ongoing dairying activities. As part of that, the bill seeks to assist Dairy Australia in its ongoing management of the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program to ensure that there are prudent and genuinely practical financial management arrangements for the fund.
What does that mean in terms of benefits to farmers and to other stakeholders? First, the indemnification of the company means that normal practices will be in place so that directors bear no personal risk in their role of administering and managing the fund. Intrinsically, if a company is not indemnified and directors face personal risk, that will lead them to be overly cautious in their activities, which might not mean good and prudent administration and management of the fund. They have to be able to take genuine steps, as normal managers, and of course there are consequences if they fail to live up to their responsibilities. However, this is about professionalising the management and marketing of Dairy Australia.
In addition, the benefits include setting out the activities that the fund can engage in. That lessens the ambiguities as to how the fund is to be administered and managed. The activities it can and cannot engage in are clearly defined. That is important because the fund collects levies and dispenses assistance payments to farmers and that in itself is about the fund being properly managed and well established for the future of the industry.
I want to raise a few issues about the background and about the importance of the bill. With regard to the background, Australia has been through a process of structural adjustment in the dairy industry. For farmers in Flinders and for people in the Bass Coast region who rely on the dairy industry there have been many benefits. However, one of the complaints that many of them, including the manager of the Caldermeade dairy, made was that they sell their milk at a price, but receive it back if they purchase it on the open market as a finished product at a multiple. There is a need to take into account the challenge faced by producers and perhaps we should be encouraging more competition in the completed production side as opposed to the dairy side. That would be a very important step. We should do everything we can to encourage competition on the production side to give dairy producers the chance to shop around and to sell their milk at the best possible price; that is something that we owe our farmers.
In conclusion, the bill is important because it provides indemnity to the company to ensure that the directors act with a genuine force and commitment on behalf of the farmers and the dairy industry. Therefore, the company will be able to carry out genuine risk management activities; the industry will be able to move forward as a modern professionalised industry and, in turn, that is a step towards helping farmers, many of whom have done it hard. I make no apologies for putting forward on the floor of this House the concerns of my dairy farmers. Some of them have struggled. Some of them have done exceptionally well and, as a result of structural adjustment, the industry as a whole has performed better. However, there are dairy farmers who have done it hard. 
Ultimately I thank my dairy farmers from Lang Lang, Caldermeade, Kernot, Almurta, Yannathan and so many different parts of the Bass Coast and the electorate of Flinders for their passion and commitment to the land, and for their work and contribution to the community. Beyond that, I commend the bill to the House because it is part of an ongoing process of ensuring that Australia is prepared to compete in the world, that we recognise the challenges that we face and, by making the structural adjustments that we have made and continue to make, we will be in a position to take advantage of agreements and outcomes such as the US free trade agreement. As I have said, from year one, the US free trade agreement will deliver a benefit of $55 million to Australian dairy farmers. I commend the bill and the agreement to the House and I thank the dairy farmers for their work and contribution to Flinders, to the Victorian economy and to Australia as a whole.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2004-03-22,"—It is a real pleasure to speak in the debate on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. I have been struck by some of the comments made by the two previous speakers and I am interested in reflecting a little on their comments. In the last week or so, we have seen a concerted protest by one of the dairy organisations, the Australian Milk Producers Association. It has been around knocking on the doors of the offices of members of parliament, including most notably in Queensland, the door of the member for Fisher, who I think unfairly copped a real spray from that association. 
I am very proud of the efforts that I and my colleagues on this side of the House have genuinely taken, to do the best we possibly can by the Australian dairy industry at a time when huge changes are occurring in the dairy industry. By way of background, people in the dairy industry in my electorate who are listening to this should reflect on some of the words that the member for Flinders just had to say, because he represents an electorate in Victoria which the dairy industry covers a lot of. 
Quite a lot of nonsense is being put forward by some people in Queensland who are determined to say that the dairy industry is on its knees Australia wide and that there are great difficulties with it. I do not doubt that there are many traumas in the dairy industry and that people are facing some absolutely tough decisions, but the comments we heard from the member for Flinders show that there are dairy farmers not only in Victoria but also in many other parts of Australia—certainly in my home state—who are working flat out to build a better industry, who are as efficient as they can possibly be in their production, who are focused not only on building a better industry here in Australia but also on looking at export potential, and who represent the future of this industry. There are others who are working just as hard but, through no fault of their own, are facing great difficulty. Those are the people who really have tough decisions ahead of them. These are not easy decisions, and for many of them it can mean the end of a lifetime of work—not only their lifetime but also that of their family, their father and, in some cases, their father before that. These are family traditions that we are talking about here, so when we come to a situation where people are forced into a position of change, it is incredibly traumatic.
So on the one hand you have in the industry incredible dynamism, tremendous change and tremendous ability to manage and control change. On the other hand, you have people who are struggling just to keep their head above water. I raise these two cases because those people who have to make the tough decision about whether they are going to continue struggling on in an industry where they are only just surviving do, at the end of the day, have to make a living, and if they are not making a living then they do have to change. That has been the subject of a whole compensation scheme put together by this government, at the request of the industry, to manage the process of change and to provide funds whereby people, if they are being forced out of the industry, have options that are a heck of a lot broader than they would have otherwise been. If there were no compensation package, there would be no options. There would basically be a scorched earth outcome for those people.
But an effective compensation package was put together. Indeed, we have had two of those. The second one combined with the first meant not only that we focused in broad terms on the Australian industry but also that we then zeroed in and focused on some of the most affected people—some of those who really had their backs to the wall and who were facing difficult circumstances. We did both those things, and we did produce a system whereby they were assisted. Not only that, as the member for Forde pointed out, through the Dairy Regional Assistance Program we also sought to assist the communities that those dairy industries had been supporting. That program provided funds for other industries to be able to take up the slack—to fill the chasm left by the departure of dairy producers from a region.
I know that is incredibly galling, because at the weekend I had a very long heart-to-heart chat with a dairy producer from the north-eastern part of my electorate, who was telling me just how tough it has been for her, her husband and her two sons, who are trying to make their way through this industry. The fact is that they do have tough choices to make, and without the kind of assistance that the government has put together they would have no options at all. As it is, they have chosen to stick with dairying and to try and bolster their base by providing additional irrigation to support their farm. That has been, to some extent, a contribution, but of course it is yet to come to grips with the basic underlying problem. If you are, as she said they are today, making a daily income of only $5, that really is a very tough life that you are talking about. I hope that through their efforts they are able to fight their way through, but if they have to make that decision to get out then I would urge them to think clearly and to take those steps. So much weighs on you when you are talking about a change like that. This is land which could be suitable for horticulture or some other use, but when you do not have the equipment and your capital is run down it is very hard to make such a choice. But they are brave and are doing the best they can in difficult circumstances, and my heart really goes out to them.
However, the dairy industry in Australia is growing. It is growing strongly, and it will get bigger. The comments of the member for Flinders bear me out on that. One of the uncomfortable facts that are being faced by dairy producers in Queensland is that, in many respects, sometimes it is not possible for them to get down to the cost of production that allows them to be competitive on the same level of cost of production as other producers in Victoria. I am not talking about other producers in New Zealand or any other country. I am talking about producers here in Australia—in the state of Victoria in particular. If you are not able to be competitive at that cost of production then, as every small business operator in this country knows, you do not have a business. Unless you can compete effectively you do not have a business. That is the tough issue that we are talking about.
As I said, the member for Flinders pointed out the opportunities coming with the free trade agreement. Today in my electorate, Stephen Deady, the chief negotiator of the free trade agreement, supporting Australia's trade minister, Mark Vaile, spoke to a roomful of concerned farmers and other producers, as well as students from the local schools who are concerned about these issues, about the outcomes of the free trade agreement. A large part of the discussion was about agriculture and, within that, significantly about dairy.
The point was made by the member for Flinders that we are facing a situation where, from day one of the free trade agreement, we go to a much greater quantity of dairy products into the United States—nearly three times as much. In year one it is worth an additional $55 million to Australian dairy farmers and dairy processors—to the dairy industry as a whole. Today there is a very limited range of dairy products that Australia is able to send to the US. But, as soon as the free trade deal comes into force, there will be a significant improvement. For all of those people who are doing it tough, who are fighting their way through these changes in the dairy industry, this represents a huge new incentive, a huge new opportunity and something that I am very pleased that I am here to see, because I know how tough they have done it. We as a government must always be looking for ways to encourage them in their endeavours, and the free trade agreement with the United States is certainly something that will provide that encouragement.
I looked at the speaker's list this morning, because out there in the community quite a debate has been raging about the dairy industry. I was pleased to see that I was listed to speak immediately after the member for Flinders in the debate on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. Just ahead of him was listed the member for Kennedy, who was due to have spoken by now on this bill in this House, and I wish he would come into the House and do it. In this place and out in the community, when issues like the pain in the dairy industry come along, the member for Kennedy leaps into these debates with incredible vigour and personal zeal, but without regard to the facts and without regard to the pain that some of his false protestations on these issues cause. And what happens after that? We have to come along and clean up.
We on this side of the House care about the facts and care about the aid that has been given to the dairy industry—and the aid that will always need to be given to Australian primary production when it gets into difficult circumstances, because we are still an economy that derives much of its benefit from the farming community. I am afraid that the member for Kennedy is a person who makes his living off the misery in this. That is my view, and I know it is a controversial view. There are many people who laud him and say that the member for Kennedy is speaking up for these farmers. I see it as exactly the opposite. I do not think he would have a living if he were not flapping his trap on these questions.
We on this side of the House, in the government, have to find policies that can work for farmers and provide the best way forward for them, whether by way of trade agreements, such as the US free trade deal, or whether through programs of assistance such as the dairy support package and the subsequent package that followed on that—I think it was a total of $2 million in support that went in there—or the Dairy RAP, which supports the community where those dairy farmers have been. These things are the responsibilities of a government that cares about farming in our country.
We care deeply about farming in our country, and we are doing everything we can to advance it in the world today. The world does not owe you a living. The world does not, by some holy writ, provide to you a free lunch. You have to constantly change. Any farmer and businessperson knows that you have to constantly change, you have to be constantly on your game and you have to be constantly improving the way you farm. And, at the end of it all, if there is a problem, if you do not have the cost of production you need, you know that you are going to have to get out, you are going to have to find a new source of income and you are going to have to make those changes. Today, many Australians are making those changes.
That brings me back to the central point about the changes contained within this bill. This bill, once again, provides an important support mechanism for the Australian dairy industry. Dairy Australia Ltd is the industry services body that took over from the Australian Dairy Corporation as at 1 July 2003. This bill encourages the prudent management and protection of the industry services body of this great Australian dairy industry, Dairy Australia Ltd. The key stakeholders are the dairy farmers and the peak industry bodies. More than 53 per cent of dairy farmers nationally are members of the industry services organisation. That is 5,693 dairy enterprises and 11,111 members. In my state, Queensland, we have one of the highest rates of membership, with nearly 64 per cent.
This bill provides indemnification arrangements for Dairy Australia, and it is appropriate that this industry services body be properly indemnified. The changes restore to Dairy Australia arrangements that were available to its predecessor and they encourage prudent management for the benefit of the dairy industry of this country. The aims of Dairy Australia are set out on the Dairy Australia web site. They are:
1. To promote the development of Australian dairy resources
2. To contribute to the promotion and development of the Australian dairy industry and Australian dairy produce by: 
Carrying out research, development and extension activities for the benefit of the Australian dairy industry and the Australian community generally
Carrying out activities to develop the Australian national market for, and international trade in, Australian dairy produce
Providing information and other services
Carrying out other activities for the benefit of the Australian dairy industry
3. To act as industry services body ...
So this is an important structural support for the dairy industry, and it is important that as a government we make sure there is adequate support and that bodies such as this do have mechanisms by which they can carry out their affairs and work more effectively in support of the dairy industry. Australia now exports more than 55 per cent of its annual milk production. I think that is a very good record. The inward-looking criticisms that have come from people such as the member for Kennedy, which I referred to earlier, would negate that and try to gainsay the effectiveness of our industry in export markets. It is a backward-looking philosophy that says that dairying today is basically about doing what your father did et cetera and that, somehow or other, by doing that you should be able to make your way in the world and that, somehow or other, support should be given for you to be able to do that, whether or not it is viable anymore and whether or not it is realistic. The lady with whom I had that long heart-to-heart over the weekend about the future of that industry recognises all these things. She recognises that you can only fool people with sugar for so long.
Of that 55 per cent of our milk production that is exported, 66 per cent of the total is concentrated in Japanese markets; Japan alone accounts for nearly one-fifth by value of our exports. The Australia-US free trade agreement means the opening up of access to US markets for an additional 7.5 million litres, which will continue to expand. I think the member for Flinders said it will expand at five or six per cent a year. That is something that farmers in Australia can really do something with. It is something that their industry bodies can work effectively to capitalise on, and Dairy Australia plays a key role in that process. Australian now ranks third in terms of world dairy trade, making up 16 per cent of all the dairy product exports in the world. That is our industry; that is this wonderful industry which is providing employment, innovation and wealth in communities right around this nation.
There are many opportunities in the dairy industry in Australia at present and they are getting stronger as the days go by and as the changes that had to work their way through the system become evident and have their impact. There is no doubt that the dairy industry is becoming stronger by the day because of those changes. As I said, I feel very impassioned about the need for us to continue to monitor progress in that industry and to continue to provide it with incentives, support and guidance and all those important things that will help to develop its place in export production and on the domestic market as well. But we cannot allow continued backward thinking to interrupt and to downplay the great value of this important Australian industry.

"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2004-03-22,"—I also rise to speak in favour of the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 2003. As you have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill is about regulating the powers of the new company known as Dairy Australia Ltd and giving it the ability to do what the Australian Dairy Corporation previously did. I have to say that in the electorate of Parkes in my region, the central west of New South Wales, there are big dairy areas, and up until the drought it was an expanding dairy region. More and more not only were the smaller farmers on the coast leaving the industry but the big ones on the coast were finding the conservation movement and local government making their lives particularly difficult. The upshot of that was that, more and more, anyone looking to expand or even continue a dairy herd was moving across the mountains and into more friendly country, as it were.
Deregulation, after all, was something that was called into the industry by the Tasmanian and Victorian dairy farmers, and then the governments of all states around Australia agreed to deregulation. The Commonwealth government were merely part of that. It was not a decision we made nor a decision we were really involved in. But, once it happened, as the member for Blair has said, the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program was put together by the Commonwealth government under Warren Truss as minister and something like $1.94 billion was put into helping the dairy industry to restructure. It has been a painful process, more so in recent times in some ways than when deregulation actually took place, because at that time, fortuitously, world markets took an upturn and in fact export markets at that stage were better than the domestic market in Australia.
There was a lot of pain, and people along the coast especially did sell out to other interests and there was a contraction in the number of herds in Australia, if not in the number of cows. It seems that herds under about 200 cows have disappeared—not in all cases but in the majority. Some of those are finding their way out into the central west of New South Wales. Certainly some of the biggest and most modern dairies in Australia are around Gulgong, running towards Forbes, and in the Dubbo area as well there is quite some dairy structuring going on.
The picture has certainly changed in recent times, with a downturn in export prices. In our region in particular, probably the biggest limiting factor, the one which has wrought the most devastation upon the industry—fight it as it has, in a very forthright way—has been the drought. It is not just the fact that there has been a lack of rainfall or that normal pasture growth has been nonexistent or very hard to come by; the biggest threat to the dairy industry in my region has been the fact that very little irrigation has been able to take place in the last two years. The Lachlan River in particular, as well as the Macquarie River, has basically had nothing to offer to dairy farmers for something like 18 months. That looks set to continue, with some talk that that river could cease to flow towards the end of 2004.
Some months ago we had a large meeting in Forbes of all the dairy farmers in the region. Minister Warren Truss was good enough to stand in front of that meeting for some three hours. While we have been able to get exceptional circumstances relief for the dairy farmers in our region for quite some time now, when we looked at all the factors affecting the economics of the dairy industry we found that at the end of the day the one thing the industry could not deal with was the drought—and they are still having enormous difficulties in doing so.
At the moment the dairy industry are dealing with the downturn in the international price, the drought and the fact that the river has little to offer by way of relief, be that for pasture or for direct feed. Obviously, the price of feed in the last couple of years has been out of sight for normal purchase and budgeting factors. When you add to that the fact that, as somebody mentioned earlier—it may have been the member for Blair—the wholesalers totally misread their pricing signals and have absolutely dropped the bottom out of the domestic price, things have not added up, particularly in the last 18 months or so, to any joy for our dairy farmers, particularly those affected by drought, as the farmers in my electorate of Parkes quite obviously are. I do not think all is doom and gloom in the future of the dairy industry; far from it. But at the moment dairy farmers are certainly facing as tough a road as they are likely to face in their financial and commercial lives.
Let me touch on the effects of this bill and why we need to pass it. I hope it will not be too controversial. I take the point of the member for Blair: those who speak loudest, if they cannot find something to be controversial about, do not seem to want to speak about anything which is a normal process and which, one would hope, will not strike any trouble in this House or in the Senate. But the member for Kennedy has been particularly voracious on water issues, and I have noticed that, over the past six months, he has tried to extract totally misleading attitudes from dairy farmers, right from Queensland through to Victoria. I think he has done so with little effect. Perhaps those people he has spoken to have started to wake up, as I think they did in the Queensland election, to the fact that loudness of voice does not always equate to commonsense of mind.
In July 2003 the Dairy Corporation was converted into a private company limited by guarantee, known as Dairy Australia Ltd. Basically, it is becoming the industry services body, as declared by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Its job is to undertake research and development for the benefit of the Australian dairy industry. It is also required to manage the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program in the form of a trust. It has to do all the procedures that used to be done by the Australian Dairy Corporation, and obviously it will do them as a company limited by guarantee. It will be fully indemnified, as the member for Blair mentioned earlier. This will allow it to deal in securities, administer the structural adjustment fund and enter into contracts. It will be able to raise money other than by borrowing. In other words, it will be able to act as a commercial entity. It will finalise the dairy industry statutory reform process that resulted from the decision by state governments around Australia to deregulate farm gate milk pricing from 1 July 2000.
As I said earlier, the Australian government, as a result of all that, put a $1.94 billion package together on behalf of the dairy industry, called the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program. This bill will allow Dairy Australia Ltd to better administer that adjustment program. We need to remember that the dairy industry is worth some $3 billion to Australia's GDP. It runs third behind wheat and beef in agricultural terms in output value at the farm gate, and it adds about $2.5 billion to Australia's export income. Allowing Dairy Australia Ltd to better manage the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program is just one part of the process that is needed to secure the future of Dairy Australia and the industry in general.
I will finish with a few positive things, such as the fact that the US free trade agreement will allow Australia to multiply by 2½ times the value of its current exports to that country. That is $55 million on top of the $36 million it currently exports to the US. We must also remember that we have recently done a free trade agreement with Thailand, which currently takes $150 million worth of Australian dairy exports. This bill must be put through. It is necessary to allow Dairy Australia Ltd to provide an efficient service on behalf of the dairy industry. I commend this bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I was concerned to hear last Friday that Community Television Sydney, which has been running Channel 31, the community TV station which broadcasts on the community UHF channel in Sydney, was almost forced to close its doors with only 24 hours notice.
I am a reasonably regular viewer of Channel 31 and have had the pleasure of appearing more than once on Chaos TV, a youth-run program broadcast on Friday nights. It now seems that the Federal Court has ordered the temporary extension of CTS's licence to allow Channel 31 to continue to broadcast, thereby preventing the channel from going off air, as was due to happen at midnight last Friday. Justice Arthur Emmett ordered the ABA to convene a special meeting over the weekend to grant a temporary licence to CTS, at the same time ordering that a permanent licence allocated to a rival group, TVS, be suspended.
I am told that TVS, which was recently granted a permanent broadcasting licence by the ABA, would not have been in a position to begin broadcasting for six to 12 months. It is this delay in broadcasting which concerns me most and which has certainly been of great concern to the constituents who have contacted me on this issue. I am also concerned to ensure that, whoever is granted the permanent licence in the end, the broad range of programs which Channel 31 is known for will continue.
I have absolutely nothing against TV Sydney holding a permanent licence. I certainly have no beef with them at all. I think that the involvement of the University of Western Sydney and the Australian Film and Television School is really good for community television.
One of the rewarding aspects about Channel 31, and one of the things that gets the most favourable comments, is the excellent educational component of their broadcasts. One of the other strong and unique features about Channel 31 has been the fact that it has broadcast programs that other stations have simply not been, and would not be, interested in broadcasting.
Chaos TV I have already mentioned, which is a program for young people run by young people. It provides an excellent opportunity for young people to get experience in broadcasting. There is another segment, Actively Radical TV, which airs programs that I do not think would get a viewing on mainstream TV. On a number of programs viewpoints seldom heard on mainstream TV have been expressed. They reflect the views of a significant section of our community.
I do not want Channel 31 to become a carbon copy, low-rent version of commercial TV. The ethnic language broadcasting component on Channel 31 is also very important, and I hope there will be no diminution of this service. It has been reported that TVS will probably not be ready to broadcast until the beginning of 2005. I really believe that that is too long for the members of the community who depend on this service to be without a community TV station.
I am also concerned about how TVS is going to fund itself. It seems that it is planning to take out a commercial loan of $2 million for set-up and operating costs. I certainly would not want to see this necessitate an increase in advertising on Channel 31. If anyone wants to watch advertisements, they can watch commercial TV or Foxtel and see as much advertising as they can handle.
I believe that CTS has been doing a good job of running Channel 31, and some of the programs are excellent. They are not all terrific but I think most of them are excellent. They do generally, however, fill gaps that are not met by commercial stations, ABC or SBS. I believe that Channel 31's unique character and the access provided to people who do not generally have their voices heard is valuable and must be maintained. I urge the ABA to again give careful consideration to these issues.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Communications: Community Broadcasting</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
