"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-04-22,"—Whilst the government's proposal to encourage Australian businesses to become Y2K compliant is sensible and should be supported, it must also be noted that there are significant gaps in its proposals. This legislation provides no scope for immediate deductibility of expenditure which has occurred after 1 January 2000. Under this system, such expenditure will, for consideration, fall under the proposed new general rules and will generally have to be written off over a far lengthier period.
This is an unusual approach for the government, as presumably the proportion of expenses relating to the development of software to overcome the millennium bug after 1 January 2000 will be devoted to urgent remediation works required for systems which are either not functioning properly or not functioning at all. Indeed, these problems may not become immediately apparent. Rather, the progressive corruption of the software will occur over time, and those problems will only come to light as they impact upon business operations.
Surely responsible government should be encouraging businesses to remedy any problems and give them an entitlement to an immediate deduction for remedial millennium 
 bug expenses, at least until 30 June 2000. For this reason, the opposition has proposed an end date of 1 July 2000. This amendment merely brings forward the expenses that would otherwise be claimed later, thus allowing savings to be made in the government's forward estimates which would no doubt have been factored into the government's estimates of the general software depreciation provisions.
The inclusion of a multiple purchase rule in the bill means that, when the total expenditure on identical software in an income year is $300 or less, an immediate write-off of expenditure is available to businesses. This is a measure which the ALP supports, as it effectively means that these minor assets will be treated in the same manner as all items of plant and equipment which are valued at under $300.
This bill also provides special rules for those who develop software. These taxpayers will be able to make a once-only election to pool their expenditure. Once this election has been made, all expenditure incurred in the developing of software in an income year is to be pooled and written off at a rate of 40 per cent in the following two years and 20 per cent in the third year. This is a reasonable position for the government to take, given its claims that this write-off strikes an appropriate balance between considerations that software is a capital expenditure which should be amortised for taxation purposes and the relatively short expected life of software arising from rapid developments in the information technology sector.
This bill highlights an area that is worthy of political attention generally, and that is the tax treatment of this particular product and of the recognition of the crucial capability of software to unlock digital knowledge and information. Software expenditure is a significant and increasing expense of business, particularly if it is viewed in the context of converging technologies. It is also an important consideration, given the rapid rate at which online services facilitated by electronic commerce are developing. Every business now is faced with the challenge of either procuring proprietary software or, indeed, 
 building their own business solutions in a computer or digital environment.
The Internet as a distribution channel for services as well as for retail sales will draw a significant proportion of commercial activity in the future. I cannot think of a business or a commercial entity that will not be confronted by the challenge of working within a digital environment in the very near future. The international nature of the Internet, where location is irrelevant and any form of control is extremely difficult to establish, has the potential to significantly affect other taxation issues, such as taxation revenue, in many countries. The Internet has progressed beyond being an efficient communications medium to become a supply medium. However, the way in which products are delivered on the Internet is determined by the degree to which physical products can be transformed into digital products.
Information is the most obvious commodity for electronic commerce conveyed through a digital environment and includes both knowledge based products and computer software, including software fixes or patches and new versions and upgrades. This information exchange has the potential to significantly impact on taxation revenue. One example of this problem would include the difficulties associated with isolating an online business which deals in Y2K remediation software to a particular country or location for taxation purposes. This is due to the high global connectivity of the business environment with the Internet facilities and the potential for businesses to locate their premises, their fixed addresses, in nations which provide the best tax benefits. The interaction of this anomaly with the changes proposed in this bill will therefore need to be closely monitored due to the possibility of businesses being able to operate in a particular country in a virtual sense.
We agree with the need for business tax changes, and we are prepared to give support to measures where it can be demonstrated, as in this case, that those changes will improve productivity and growth by adding to jobs and strengthening industries. It seems to me that this bill certainly recognises current changes 
 and challenges confronting businesses in their growing need for expenditure on software and digital products. In resisting the temptation to speak at length about the GST, I would comment that the information technology sector is finding it hard enough to deal with the issues of the year 2000 problem without having to face the complex issues of the GST which it now has to deal with.
Time is required for redevelopment and testing of the new software, and the increased cost of software under a GST is yet another barrier the coalition government has created, and one which may begin to stifle this area of Australian innovation. It is interesting to note that whilst the government, in the construction of this bill, is offering a taxation benefit for the costs incurred with Y2K, if the GST bills are passed all software purchased will incur an additional 10 per cent on those costs. So there is some irony in this bill. While providing some respite for business, the overall costs of software to businesses—whether they are for Y2K remediation purposes or for general business operation—will increase under a GST.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SOFTWARE DEPRECIATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-04-22,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999  deals with the issue of what business people or people who rely on the proper use of software can deduct from the amount of money they bring into their business before they pay tax on the residue. So it is a classical taxation bill. That is, fair taxation requires a situation where people are not taxed on all the money they get in or on all the income they have. What should be deducted from that income is the cost of earning it. Within the taxation philosophy is the concept that you take away from the amount of money that comes in the amount that you expend for the purpose of earning the profit. That is a matter that affects all business. Indeed, it affects people who have to expend money to earn money. In this case what has been talked about is deductions for certain sums that are expended on software or the development of software.
There has already been some discussion about this matter in the previous speeches that has pointed out many of the issues that are 
 involved. But there is one issue I want to begin with: who will benefit from this legislation in its present form? I want to quote two different passages: one from the Assistant Treasurer's speech and one from the explanatory memorandum. The second reading speech says:
The measures broadly provide for spending to be written off over 2½ years. In certain circumstances, they also allow an immediate deduction. An immediate deduction will be allowed for software spending of $300 or less and for undeducted spending where software development projects are abandoned. This  will be helpful for small business.
I think everybody in this chamber, as is certainly evident from the debates that have taken place on the GST, wants to help small business. And so we should, because small business faces a lot of pressures that other business and other people do not. Perhaps I will return to that a little later.
On page 2 of the explanatory memorandum—I have checked and this seems to be the correct explanatory memorandum—in the context of the summary of the regulation impact statement, the main point is:
In common with the impact of many other taxation provisions, compliance costs are likely to be most onerous for smaller businesses without dedicated accounting personnel.
I think that is a matter of some concern. The explanatory memorandum is a memorandum put out by the government that introduces the bill, and it explains what the bill is all about.
There is a real worry here. The second reading speech says, `We want this measure to be helpful for small business,' and the explanatory memorandum that explains the thrust of the bill says, `In common with the impact of many other taxation provisions, compliance costs are likely to be most onerous for smaller businesses without dedicated accounting personnel.' That probably comes about because, unless you have dedicated accounting personnel, it is getting harder and harder to work out what taxation you have to pay.
You can have visions of what businesses are all about. There is very big business: international companies that trade and work around the world that are equipped with a lot of personnel, and some of them can work out 
 very accurately what taxation they have to pay. Then there are smaller businesses who may only work within Australia but who nevertheless have the ability, because of their size, to have a particular person or particular group of people working out what income comes into the business, how much tax they should pay and so on. Then you get to the small businesses. But the businesses that I think are badly treated by the system are the ones who cannot afford to have dedicated accounting personnel—for example, plumbers who might be working on their own. They have to do a day's work. Probably on their mobile they have to get the jobs lined up and go around to each one. They have to try to fit in their ability to do a job with the ability of the people they are helping to be at home. There are all sorts of pressures on them. That has to be considered. The opposition will be moving an amendment to this bill which tries to help those sorts of people.
As the legislation now stands, it allows a tax deduction for expenditure on getting computers into a position where they can cope with the Y2K date. The Y2K issue has become a bit like the doomsday issue where we are almost in fear of it—perhaps we should be and perhaps we should not be. We will wait and see what happens. In any event, the Y2K date issue is at the point where the government and the parliament as a whole say, `Yes, some accommodation should be made.' If you are a business person or a small company with computers and other equipment that require new technology to get them into proper condition by the fateful date of the year 2K, and if this legislation goes through as it is now presented, then you will get a tax deduction if you spend money to get that equipment right by the end of the year or the start of the next year.
 The opposition's suggested amendment is that a further period of six months be given so that small business people in particular might be able to get their equipment right after the Y2K and into the first six months of the year 2000. It was Senator Andrew Murray, a person for whom I have great respect in this area, who said, `No, you shouldn't allow that extra six months because 
 people should have the foresight, the drive and the energy to get their equipment right by the end of the year.' But that does not really take into account the situation that small business gets into.
For example, take the corner store, which is now fast disappearing because of the competition from supermarkets and what have you. It is the advance—I suppose you have to say—of civilisation that leads to this situation. But there are still people who run small shops such as the corner store. They might sell papers, so they have to be up at 5 o'clock in the morning to get the papers in, cut the string, work out to whom they have to deliver papers and put the balance of the papers on the counter. They have to get their stock onto the shelves, and then people come in and start buying. A lot of worry and energy is expended just keeping the doors open. At the end of the day—it might be 8 or 9 o'clock at night—they close the doors, get their money in and do their own accounting. So they have a very busy day and they have a lot of pressure on them. The return they get from all that effort is usually quite moderate. You might think it would be a reasonable thing to give those people an extra six months so that they are not completely harassed by the burdens they have to put up with.
I will return to the previous example of plumbers who run small businesses. Since they are not employees, they are not entitled to the benefits of workers compensation, although in some states it might not be worth while being entitled to the benefits of workers compensation because the level is now so low. But leaving that aside, they are not entitled to any workers compensation. They are not entitled to lots of other things that employees are entitled to, although those things seem to be disappearing. Nevertheless, they do not have such entitlements.
As I say, plumbers are out digging trenches, laying pipes, doing their own paperwork, working out their receipts, working out their next contract, going to the next job and finding people are not home and having to come back. Then they are going home at night and doing all their paperwork. Again, they are getting what could be called fairly 
 moderate returns. We are saying to them, `You not only have to be a labourer digging the ditches, you not only have to be a skilled tradesman putting the pipes together and running the pipes in the right direction, you not only have to be a skilful purchaser of goods because you have to go out and buy the goods and make the decision as to where you are going to lay them, you not only have to be a public relations person because you have to get your custom—not only do you have to do all that but you also have to be your own accountant. Somebody is suggesting that you get an extra six months to get your computers and whatever else you have to get in order because of the Y2K problem.' But people say, `No, you shouldn't be entitled to the extra six months. You have to do all this work, take all this strain but, nevertheless, get yourself into proper shape for the coming Y2K.'
That is why I say it is a hard thing to give businesses that have the ability to hire, as it says in the explanatory memorandum, dedicated accounting personnel to have all this done the benefit of this legislation but not to give other people who are out there—energetic, decent and honest people—some sort of extension. An extension of six months is suggested in the proposed amendment to allow them to get what those in more powerful positions get. Small businesses may grow into big businesses. We should encourage them. Small businesses—for example, electricians, small shopkeepers or somebody who is trying to develop some new idea so that cars can run better—may stay at the level they are at now. If you give encouragement to those sorts of people, people who are bringing up families, that is a good thing.
The concepts behind this legislation are good but they could be made better if they were extended to small businesses. Running a small business can be a lonely exercise. Your future may depend upon your health: if you get sick, you are gone. If you make a bad contract, in the sense that you haven't quoted enough, things can go wrong. If you have all this sort of uncertainty upon you, you have to be given some help.
So the general idea behind the Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999 is supported by this side of the chamber, but this side of the chamber says that instead of having this concession, if that is what it can be called, regarding the expenditure you make on the equipment that you have, which depends upon the chips and other things that may be affected by Y2K, or this help going to 1 January, why not extend the help to 1 July 2000? That would seem reasonable. It would at least give small business a pat on the back in the sense that we are saying: `Yes, we understand your situation and we will try to accommodate it.'",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SOFTWARE DEPRECIATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-22,"—I also rise to address some of the issues related to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Software Depreciation) Bill 1999, in particular the provisions related to the Y2K compliance software projects. While the bill is primarily intended to modify the general computer software depreciation provisions, there are also a number of provisions which will significantly modify the treatment of software expenses incurred in attaining year 2000 compliance. Under these provisions expenditure will be immediately deductible if the principal purpose of that expenditure is to ensure that existing systems will be made Y2K compliant.
The Democrats, as I am sure all senators are aware, have a great deal of interest in the year 2000 problem or issue. A week ago, amid much fanfare, Senator Alston released the first of the Commonwealth government's Y2K agency reports, as required under the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act of this year. We were particularly interested in the government fanfare accompanying the release of that report. Once again we were informed that the government was taking the initiative in releasing this information and that the picture was a rosy one.	We have been told that the government is currently meeting targets and that by July this year all systems will be compliant. According to the government, the remainder of the year will be used to prepare contingency plans.
But there are still numerous concerns raised in the pages of the report. As at 5 February a 
 number of agencies still had significant compliance problems, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Australian Customs Service, Comcare, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Taxation Office. All of those problems are potentially quite serious if compliance is not attained.
As we approach Anzac Day, I also note that the Department of Veterans' Affairs was only 31 per cent compliant in early February, although there was a footnote to the report indicating that the compliance level has since risen to at least 56 per cent. It should be remembered that the release of these figures in the detailed quarterly report last week was as a result of a non-government amendment to the Year 2000 Information Disclosure Bill.
The Democrats are not alone in their concerns about compliance. One of Australia's foremost experts, Mr Phil Dodd of Unisys Australia, has stated that the government cannot reasonably expect to complete its compliance program before the end of the year. I guess all of us hope he is proved wrong. The head of the government's Y2K industry program, Mr Graeme Inchley, has separately indicated that it is unreasonable to expect that an organisation like the Australian Taxation Office will be compliant by the end of the year, given the current rate of progress. It is also indicated that the government should adopt best practice and issue monthly reports rather than quarterly reports, which I remind the Senate it was only compelled by non-government amendments to do.
My colleague Senator Stott Despoja noted other concerns with the Good Samaritan legislation at the time it was discussed in the Senate. She was rightly concerned that the legislation made a number of concessions to businesses which would need to be carefully monitored. The Democrats are keeping a careful watch on the use of the disclosure provisions. We are concerned by recent reports that some of the disclosure provisions of the disclosure legislation have been misused.
The Australian Democrats are always interested in concessions that are made to businesses. This current legislation makes 
 additional concessions relating to the costs of Y2K compliance. It allows software costs related to year 2000 compliance to be written off directly, which will result in significant costs to government and savings to business.
We can only hope that problems like this do not roll around too often. We certainly do not want the provisions of this software depreciation legislation to be a reward to slow movers in the business community. We are also concerned that this legislation could be used to write off costs of significant upgrades to non-essential systems.
Australian business has responded to the year 2000 problem—and the Democrats do acknowledge that—but not as rapidly or effectively as we had hoped. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has warned of a very poor response to a Y2K readiness survey of securities dealers, investment advisers and insurance dealers. The commission was highly concerned with both the low response rates to the survey and the low compliance levels.
The latest reports to the Australian Stock Exchange by listed companies also show major problems with compliance in a broad range of Australian companies. Costs have increased dramatically and the growing delays in reaching compliance are becoming a major concern.
Whilst in relation to many other countries in the world Australia has been doing well, the nation as a whole needs to do all it can to improve that performance further. It is not much of a consolation if we are not fully and adequately compliant by the year 2000 and run into problems to sit back and say, `At least we haven't got as many problems as people in other countries.' We need to ensure that we are fully prepared and do not encounter any problems that are in any way avoidable.
As my colleague Senator Stott Despoja has indicated, the Australian Democrats are also very interested in the year 2000 problem `problem'. I am referring here to the growing fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding the year 2000 problem. During a recent MPI debate, Senator Stott Despoja drew attention to the need for governments to take a leading 
 role in educating and preparing the community for problems that might arise during the transition to the year 2000. This is not because we believe there is going to be widespread community disaster, but because uncertainty and ignorance is not conducive to a calm and appropriate response.
We need to have decisive action to keep the community informed. Without this, avoidable problems could occur during the transition. I am particularly referring to problems such as bank runs, panic buying and the possibility of a telecommunications crisis. Earlier this month an article in the Bulletin discussed the possibility of self-fulfilling prophecies in this area. A quick calculation was undertaken of the possible effect of all Australians following the advice that has been given to staff of Westpac and the Reserve Bank. These organisations have advised staff to withdraw two weeks' worth of cash in late December to ensure they have enough money to cover the transition to the year 2000. Crude calculations suggest that the amount of cash withdrawn, if all Australians were to follow this advice, would be equivalent to almost half the total amount of coins and notes in circulation.
I know there are already moves to increase the amount of cash in actual circulation to address anticipated or possible action in the broader community along those lines. This would most likely lead to serious problems with the Australian banking system if there is a significant run on cash withdrawals in the last weeks of this year, this century and this millennium.
The Australian Democrats call on the government to begin an urgent public education campaign to increase awareness and preparedness within the community. Clearly, the sort of advice that is being given to employees in many organisations could lead to serious problems. Again, whilst we do acknowledge that the government has been active in this regard, we urge in as constructive a way as possible that more be done to ensure that problems are minimised and, if possible, completely eliminated. This is not just the problem of the so-called Y2K bug itself, but the problem of people having 
 unrealistic concerns about the nature and effect of that problem.
The government needs to do all it can to communicate with Australians about appropriate responses to the concerns of the community. Part of that relates to what this bill does, and that is obviously welcomed, but there is a lot more in a wider context that does still need to be done. The Democrats encourage the government to address those issues and we as a party are doing all we can, as part of our role as parliamentarians, to contribute to broader community debate and understanding about some of these issues.
The Democrats remain hopeful about the level of preparedness within the Australian community and hope that this legislation will be used in good faith to improve the readiness of Australian business. Once again, I emphasise that we are monitoring the use of the disclosure provisions and we will monitor carefully the costs and outcomes of this legislation. We do recognise the need to encourage appropriate responses at all levels of the Australian community, both within government and the private sector. In as much as this legislation goes down that path, we would certainly welcome its intent.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SOFTWARE DEPRECIATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-04-22,"—I thank honourable senators who have contributed to this important debate on the progress of Australia towards combating what has become known as the Y2K problem.
This is an important measure. It will indeed provide tax assistance to businesses that purchase software to remediate the Y2K problem. We have had a very important debate in relation to that particular measure. There is a debate to ensue about the desirability of extending the measure beyond 1 January 2000 based on an amendment foreshadowed by Senator Sherry.
I am pleased that the Democrats share the government's view that it would be desirable that the date stay the same as it is in the legislation. If it does not, you are sending very mixed messages to small business. Senator Lundy in her speech recognised that 
 it is very important for the major sectors of the community, including of course the Commonwealth government, to be Y2K compliant; that, particularly at the Commonwealth level, they have the systems checked, remediated, compliant and back online by July—that looks to be the case for almost every Commonwealth agency; and that we spend the next six months leading up to New Year's Eve working on contingency plans, going through all the what and what-ifs—what if something does go wrong that we have not looked at, what if this supplier of mine, for example, an electricity utility or a telecommunications company or, indeed, another small business, is not able to supply because of the Y2K fault?
It need not necessarily be a computer matter. I take the opportunity of saying this is not just something that occurs in PCs, it is not just something that occurs in computers or mainframes; this is something, as the Department of the Senate found out recently, which can occur in a voice messaging system in this very building. It can occur in airconditioning systems where you have got these little black boxes with `embedded chips', as they are called, that control virtually everything that happens on the globe these days. Little date dependent chips in these little black boxes that have got nothing to do with PCs can ensure entire airconditioning systems come crashing down as a result of dates.
I repeat a story that tends to turn people's attention to the details of this problem more than anything else. People may be tempted to do what Senator Cooney alluded to in his speech here today, that is, wait and see—`We'll see whether it's a real disaster or a doomsday.' But there are those of us who take this threat extremely seriously. If any business is tempted to `wait and see', they should listen to the story of the Epworth Private Hospital in Melbourne in Victoria, a hospital that I think I could claim is probably at the forefront of fighting the year 2000 date problem within all of its systems.
They have had a program going for nearly three years now. They have been going through all of their medical equipment, their internal systems, their accounting systems and 
 their patient systems. Last year they looked at their building systems, which are, of course, just as critical to running a hospital as they are to any other facility where human beings are wandering around, particularly hospitals where people are usually frail, vulnerable and ill. They found that an airconditioning system that was installed less than four years ago will be entirely unserviceable come 1 January 2000—an airconditioning system installed less than four years ago. I think that story highlights the problem of the year 2000. It is not just a computer problem; it is far from it. In fact, the biggest risks to life and to commerce probably come from chips—date dependent chips that are not in computers at all. So this is a very serious problem.
I want to quickly respond to some of the points that do demand a response, not only because this is an important tax measure which will help small business but also because it deals with the year 2000 problem. I share with other senators the view that this is an important opportunity to not only debate this measure but also to help inform the public.
Senator Murray suggested that there are a couple of `important events', as he called them, that will occur in the life of small businesses between now and July 2000 which will put enormous stress on businesses. He said that the date change is one of them and that the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000 is another. I might say by way of aside that that shows Senator Murray seems to have some confidence in that occurring, which I welcome. I say to Senator Murray and to everybody else that there are a range of events relating to Y2K that are very important for people to be aware of, and I take this opportunity to very briefly alert them to that.
Many expert commentators say that July 1999 will be a crucial Y2K date because, all of sudden, spreadsheets, mortgages and a whole range of financial matters that go out over the coming 12 months will start. This has been happening ever since 1 January this year but, as the new financial year clicks in, many year 2000 experts expect a serious rise in the number of Y2K problems—that is, 
 from July 1999 as the new financial year starts picking up the 2000 date. The next date that is a very important event for businesses, and another date that Y2K experts around the world expect to cause trouble, is September 1999 because, in some computer coding languages, the figures 9999 basically say to a computer: stop. That is the red signal for a computer, so many people are predicting serious problems and dislocation on 9 September 1999 as a result of that particular date that sends a different message to computers. I guess it also sends a different message to people who have their birthdays on that date.
—I think that is Natasha's birthday.
—Is it? I will not be drawn to say anything about that.
The other period, Senator Murray, that we are concerned about is the period that leads up to the date change itself, particularly the period from around mid-November through to December, and particularly for people who do what Senator Cooney said they might do—that is, wait and see. They will start saying, `Oh dear, this is serious. What a shame I didn't do something about it 300 days ago or 253 days ago,' as we are today. People may, indeed, try to make contingency plans that are either sensible or not sensible because they failed to act. That is a period, an event, that could be a problem.
The issues that Senator Murray raises are very serious issues. We in the government are very keen to ensure that we move through the Y2K events in a seamless, sound and wellmanaged way. This government has been recognised around the globe in this regard by groups such as the OECD and the Gartner Group. Indeed, our friends and colleagues in the US Senate, who have a special committee on this, have indicated that Australia is amongst the best prepared nations in the world.
It has been my privilege and honour to sit with all of the Y2K ministers from around Australia at two ministerial council meetings to discuss this, and to see the level of corporation on this issue gives one hope about the cooperation that can take place between federal and state levels of government. But 
 the issues Senator Murray raised are very important ones. It is important that the government smooths the transition as much as possible through Y2K and, equally, Senator Murray, through the introduction of the new tax system, subject of course to the parliament's agreement to that proposal. And to that end the government has allocated half a billion dollars—$500 million—to ensure, particularly, that the small to medium enterprise sector is assisted through that transition.
Senator Murray suggested that we should be considering tax concessions in that regard. We believe there is a whole range of measures that need to be brought in. The opportunities for getting a whole new massive raft of small to medium enterprise sectors into electronic and digital integration directly with the Taxation Office and directly with a range of other government agencies at all levels to make running small businesses in Australia a lot easier and a lot more efficient, giving them a lot more time to actually do the core tasks of their business, rather than complying with piles and piles of paperwork that governments at all levels pile onto them, are actually quite extraordinary and can be tagged onto the back of introducing a new tax system.
Senator Cooney—just to move to his remarks, because they flow naturally from the issues that Senator Murray raised—talked about the typical small business persons who have to comply with all of this paper, do much of the paperwork, do much of the accounting themselves, or at least prepare their documents for their accountants to do. The new tax system recognises that and, indeed, it seeks to replace a system that has an average small to medium enterprise doing something like 12 payments on tax instalments annually on behalf of employees, four income tax payments, 12 sales tax payments, potentially four fringe benefits tax payments—something like 32 separate interactions with the tax office, as the law provides at the moment. This does not include income tax and fringe benefits tax returns. And, of course, the new tax system that we are bringing in seeks to roll all of those systems into a new single pay-as-you-go system. So we will be replacing PAYE, PPS, RPS, provision 
 al tax and company instalments with one new comprehensive system.
Furthermore—and this directly responds to the points made by Senator Cooney and, I think, by Senator Murray as well—instead of having a range of different numbers that businesses and individuals need in order to interact with the tax office and another business related agencies, we will be rolling all of those into one simple new Australian business number. So each company in Australia will have one simple identifier, which will be available for use by all agencies needing to capture company data. So it is an historic reduction in the amount of interactions made by companies of all sizes, including Senator Cooney's single corner store—and God bless the corner store—and single person enterprises, such as plumbers.
I might say, by way of an aside, I have two plumbers who are close members of my family who both had plumbing practices in New Zealand during the introduction of the new tax system in New Zealand. Both of those plumbers—both of them my brothers-in-law—were extremely sceptical about the introduction of the new tax system in New Zealand by the then Labour government. They were worried because they had heard of all of the concerns that are now being scaremongered by my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle that this would increase their paperwork and that this would make life hell for small businesses. Both of those plumbers—again, my brothers-in-law—lived through the introduction of the tax system in New Zealand, which was a goods and services tax system, with some assistance I might say, Senator Murray, from the Labour government at that time. They did provide assistance to small business people to allow them to use accountants if they wanted. But both of those people found that the system was so simple and so easy to do that they did it themselves from then on in. They did not need accounting assistance to do it. It required very low compliance. And, of course, they were extremely pleased that their income tax would be lower. I think many small business people would very much welcome the tax cuts that this package would include.
But back to rebutting or at least responding to some of the arguments from honourable senators who have contributed to the debate. We heard from both Senator Lundy and Senator Bartlett that we should urgently have a public education campaign about Y2K. At that ministerial meeting I have referred to already the public education campaign that is being planned and coordinated by the Commonwealth with the states was again discussed. The unanimous, overwhelming decision of the ministers, including the federal government and the year 2000 industry program leaders—Graeme Inchley, the Chief Executive Officer, and Maurice Newman, the distinguished Chairman of that group—is that the timing is very wrong for a public education campaign right now.
That is the point I made in the last debate in the chamber on this issue. We want to ensure that we have a public education campaign that focuses on the needs of the public about the year 2000 issue. You could have a debate, I guess, with marketing and public relations consultants and pollsters and a range of other people about when is the best time to launch a campaign about the year 2000 problem. I guess whatever we do we will probably get it wrong, but there was a consensus between all state governments, the Commonwealth and the industry program that to launch a public education campaign now would be shooting the ammunition far too early, that we do need—to use a hackneyed cliche—to `keep our powder dry'.
But I can assure the Senate that it is a very, very important issue. I do not underrate it. It is just a matter of timing and of the quality of the campaign. The government—and, in fact, governments—are planning a public education campaign. We are, I think, at this very moment talking to experts on this. I think we might even be letting a tender in relation to this in terms of preparing the campaign and seeing how we deliver the information and what sort of information would be useful to put out there.
I do not think anyone can complain about a lack of information on Y2K; in fact, some might say that, if anything, there is a bit of an overload of Y2K information. I can assure 
 Senator Bartlett and Senator Lundy that preparations are well in hand. I think the way we are handling it is appropriate and, certainly, our approach has been supported by all state governments across political lines.
The conflict in approaches, as pronounced by Senator Lundy, Senator Sherry and Senator Cooney—but particularly by Senator Lundy and Senator Cooney—in relation to preparing Australia for Y2K date change events, is of concern. We are saying to government, small business and large business, `You need to spend the money now. You need to make the investment in time and management resources to ensure that your business is ready. You need to check your supply chains. You need to check with the people who supply you with crucial goods and services and ensure that their failure will not hurt you. You need to work with them to ensure that they are not going to fail. Most importantly, at the moment, you need to work with your customers.'
A fortnight ago in Adelaide, Westpac Bank made a presentation to the ministerial council about a program that it has to communicate fantastically clear, concise and easily read information to its business customers—particularly small business customers. The bank is providing counselling, tutorials and consultancy advice to all its customers to ensure that the customers solve their problems.
The banks have very quickly realised that they can make sure that there is a seamless delivery of services from their suppliers to the banks on 1 January 2000. The banks will not have very good businesses if their business customers—or, indeed, any of their customers—start to fail because of the year 2000 bug. To survive, the banks require their customers to be successful. If a lot of their customers fail because of the date change problem, then the banks themselves will fail. I congratulate Westpac. I know that the other banks also have similar sorts of programs to ensure that their customers are Y2K ready.
That is what businesses should be doing. The strong message to small businesses from government and from the industry program is, `Do all of this and get ready for the year 2000 before New Year's Eve.' That has been the 
 message from the industry program for well over a year now. We are saying to all our government departments and agencies, `Here is some money to help you do it. This is what you have to do. You have to report to your minister every month. We have to report to cabinet every quarter. We have to publicly release every agency's compliance now. But if you are a small business and you can't get it done by Christmas, don't worry. We will give you the tax incentives for another six months afterwards.' It is a confused message, and that is why the government is sticking very clearly to its guns. We are saying, `We will give you a tax incentive on software if you get it done before the change of the first two figures of the four digit year—the year 2000.' We will be sticking to that.
We deeply appreciate that the Democrats have seen the validity of that argument. That covers most of the arguments that were made. I genuinely appreciate the assistance of the honourable senators opposite in this debate. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SOFTWARE DEPRECIATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-04-22,"—I commence my contribution to this second reading debate on the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998 by noting that this legislation seeks to implement many of the recommendations of the committee of inquiry into Australia's quarantine arrangements. That committee of inquiry has become known as the Nairn committee because it was chaired by Professor Malcolm Nairn. The committee was established by the Labor minister for primary industries, Senator Bob Collins, a number of years ago, during the period of the Keating government.
The Nairn committee issued its report, entitled Australian Quarantine: A Shared Responsibility, in October 1996. It is now April 1999, 2½ years after that very important, very thorough committee inquiry handed down its report and we are now dealing with the legislation that seeks to implement many of the recommendations of the report. I certainly recognise that a report of such a nature required some time for the government to consider its response, but it should not take 2½ years, particularly when the government's response to the committee's recommendations was published by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, in August 1997. So it took from October 1996 to August 1997 for the government to consider the report and issue its response but it has taken until April 1999 for the government to bring in this legislation.
The only reason this legislation is before the Senate today is that this government has adjourned debate on the GST legislation. As I am sure every Australian knows by now, the Senate is sitting this week and next week to deal with the GST legislation. We are sitting at a time when the House of Representatives is not sitting. We are having special sittings to deal with the GST. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer claim that this is the most important piece of legislation that has to be dealt with by this parliament. Those gentlemen are out there in the community urging the Senate, telling the Labor Party, to get on with the job and pass the legislation. Well, we are here waiting for you to bring it on, and 
 what do you do? You squib it. You can't get your act together.
I am quite happy now to deal with the Quarantine Amendment Bill. Indeed, I have had my contribution to this debate prepared for some time. We are not about delaying important legislation that needs to be dealt with by the Senate. This is a most important piece of legislation. The Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998 seeks to implement many of the recommendations of the Nairn committee, which I will come to shortly. I wish to pay tribute to the former minister, Mr Bob Collins, for his initiative in establishing this committee of inquiry to broadly look at the important issues of Australian quarantine arrangements.
As people are aware from the recent reports regarding an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the poultry industry, quarantine issues are becoming more and more important. Australia can no longer rely upon the fact that it is an island continent, that it has natural boundaries, to maintain its reputation and its status as essentially disease free with respect to many of its agricultural industries. The world today, particularly with respect to international trade and travel, means that we are becoming more exposed to the problems of diseases and pests that exist in other countries. We have to be increasingly vigilant to protect our industries, our agricultural industries in particular, our food industries and our public health.
This legislation, I am pleased to say, goes a long way towards enhancing that protection by improving our quarantine arrangements. I must point out, however, that there was one recommendation of the Nairn committee that the government has not agreed to and that we likewise do not support. That was the recommendation of the committee to establish a separate authority which would be largely independent of government to look after quarantine issues. We believe that recommendation was not appropriate. We are glad to see that the government didn't pick it up because ultimately the buck stops with the government on quarantine issues. It is essential that we have a properly resourced public body such as AQIS, staffed by experts, to oversee quarantine in this country.
The bill picks up many of the recommendations of the Nairn committee. I will deal with a few of the issues covered by the bill and then move on to some issues that were specifically looked at by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. There are a number of definition changes in the legislation, particularly with respect to the use of the terms `disease' and `pest'. Without going into those in detail, we note that they are more extensive and appropriate to today's environment of greater international trade and travel.
One particular amendment to the act is the inclusion of the reference to ballast water. Whilst this may appear to be a technical issue, it is in fact a very important issue, as we know. Australia—particularly the state of Tasmania where you come from, Mr Acting Deputy President—is facing a major problem in its seafood industry as a result of ballast water from ships bringing in organisms and pests, particularly the starfish that can attack the shellfish industry. That is one matter that has become increasingly important in recent years and is covered in this legislation.
Another provision of this legislation requires greater consultation between the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage when looking at quarantine issues and in particular when exercising powers under the legislation. The bill also provides for greater flexibility in pre-border, border and post-border quarantine arrangements. By that I mean that we have moved from the traditional approach of just using border controls to handle many quarantine arrangements and extended that, for instance, by requiring pre-entry reports from vessels so that the quarantine risk is reduced even further.
There is much work that can and should be done beyond our immediate border points with respect to ensuring adequate quarantine arrangements within this country. Of course, that is particularly important with respect to the importation of food from other countries.
The bill also significantly strengthens the penalties for offences against the quarantine requirements. There are also changes which 
 will bring about greater consistency in the special quarantine zones that exist, such as in the Torres Strait. Special quarantine zones are designated particularly in that area because the traditional inhabitants move from island to island within that region. Whilst that should be facilitated, we need to ensure that exotic pests and diseases are not introduced as a result of the movement of goods or people within those areas.
The existing powers which can intrude unnecessarily on the lifestyle of indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait have been replaced in this legislation by a more flexible approach in dealing with those quarantine matters. We support the government on that proposal and think it is eminently sensible.
As I said earlier, this bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives with the support of both the government and the opposition, was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. That action was taken to enable AQIS, the department and such other groups as the National Farmers Federation who have an interest in this issue to appear before the Senate committee to provide more information regarding the legislation.
There are two areas of concern I wish to quickly refer to on which we sought information in that inquiry. One was with respect to the privatisation of quarantine stations. The opposition has a concern to ensure that we do not move down the road of the privatisation of quarantine matters, thereby reducing its effectiveness, and move too far away from the public responsibility that rests on government in respect of quarantine.
There was a recommendation in the Nairn report that supported the concept of privatising Commonwealth quarantine stations. During the inquiry evidence was given by AQIS. I will quote from their submission. They said:
In addressing this issue of privatisation, these stations—
that is, the quarantine stations—
remain government owned and operated, and thus are not commercial premises at this point. AQIS is about to publicly distribute a discussion paper on their future before taking any further steps down 
 the identified path of privatisation. AQIS would see any new arrangements being made the subject of stringent compliance agreements.
We are most concerned as an opposition to ensure that any proposals which involve the greater use of commercially operated premises—if they are to be put forward—are clearly put on the table for the parliament to consider. As I said, we are concerned to ensure that the primary responsibility for quarantine, particularly in respect of high-risk quarantine issues, is retained within a public authority such as AQIS.
We do note that this legislation encourages greater interface and cooperation between quarantine services and industry, and that is something that we strongly support. Whilst some low-level quarantine functions can be undertaken by industry successfully, that should not become the hallmark for the future of quarantine across the board in this country.
Another issue that the committee addressed in our inquiry—and I urge senators to have a look at the committee's report because, as I said, this is a most important issue for Australian industry, for our economy and for public health as well—is a proposal in the legislation to remove the privilege against self-incrimination. Essentially, this legislation removes the right of persons who have information which should be available to AQIS officers in carrying out their duties of quarantine to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination in declining to provide such information. The corresponding arrangement is, however, that any evidence obtained by using that provision is not permissible in subsequent criminal proceedings, except in certain limited circumstances. We were naturally concerned to ensure that removal of the right to answer questions on the grounds of privilege against self-incrimination was not being removed without good cause. As we note in the committee's report, AQIS were somewhat unclear regarding the implications of this proposed section of the bill, which is section 79A.
—You are being very kind.
—I am being kind to AQIS. The committee report notes that clarifi 
 cation was provided by the Attorney-General's Department and, indeed, this issue was looked at by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee noted that, on balance, they were prepared to accept the proposal as being one which strikes a reasonable balance between the requirements of law enforcement and the protection of individual rights. Having had that assurance by the eminent chair of the scrutiny committee, Senator Barney Cooney, I think all senators would at least be willing to accept the proposal on that ground.
There is a range of other issues dealt with in this legislation, such as the delegation of powers by the minister, the question of ministerial responsibility and the liability of the Commonwealth, the Crown and the minister in areas where quarantine issues arise. I am sure that my colleague Senator O'Brien will take up those issues in his remarks following my comments.
In conclusion, I indicate that the opposition supports the passage of the legislation, but we do so recognising that we have to be ever vigilant in this area. I express our particular concern that we do not wish to see further privatisation in this area. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-04-22,"—I also wish to speak to the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998 , and indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the legislation.
At the outset, I should indicate that at this stage I am not sure about the amendments to this bill foreshadowed by Senator Brown. But I presume we will have time to look at those, given that we probably will not get to the committee stage of this bill today. I am not sure yet what our response will be to those amendments to be moved by Senator Brown, but no doubt in the committee stage we will be able to indicate either agreement or otherwise. I will certainly listen carefully during the debate to Senator Brown's reasons for foreshadowing these amendments. I do not know if Senator Brown was present in the Senate committee inquiry hearings; I presume he was not. I certainly was not able to get there, but was able to read the report. I just wonder where the amendments come from—whether they come from out of the ether 
 somewhere or whether in fact they are valid amendments. They are the questions I will want to hear answered by Senator Brown.
I indicate that the Democrats still have concerns about the whole area of quarantine. We believe that this legislation is picking up a number of those concerns and is, therefore, an improvement on the current situation, but I put on the record that we still have concerns. No doubt the experience that we gain from the operation of this bill may suggest further amendments in the future—that remains to be seen—but I think we do need to allow the legislation time to bed down and see how it operates.
The bill seeks to amend the Quarantine Act 1908 and reflects the legislative response of the government to the Nairn report, which was released in October 1996. The government is reacting to the report's view of the importance to the community of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's contribution to the protection of the environment, and it is imposing an obligation on quarantine decision makers to consult with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in certain circumstances, and we certainly support that.
I do not need to go through the whole history of some of the quarantine disasters that we have experienced in this country, but certainly the one which comes to mind for me was that of the papaya fruit fly in my own state, in North Queensland. In the end, the cost of cleaning up that problem was far in excess of that of the quarantine measures that had been in place and had been removed, which allowed the papaya fruit fly to enter North Queensland and, of course, to cause a tremendous cost in terms of the clean-up of that problem.
However, it is good to be able to place on the record that, in fact, that clean-up operation did work and that, to all intents and purposes, it appears we were able to eradicate the papaya fruit fly from North Queensland. So we commend the government and the government instrumentalities on their achievement in that regard. But it underlines again the importance of quarantine, the importance of making sure we have in place proper meas 
 ures to, as far as possible, ensure that there are not breaches of our quarantine protection. I have debated previously—and in fact, I think I remember Senator Calvert also being involved in a debate on this issue some time ago—the whole issue of risk management. I concede that, unless you are going to spend an incredible amount of money, probably risk management is the only way that we can balance out the cost of quarantine measures and proper protection.
But I just place on the record again that if you asked the Australian population what they required from the quarantine service they would probably say that they would hope that `no risk' would at least be the goal of the quarantine service. We know that we have got to balance the `no risk' option against the cost of such an option. In fact, I believe that the Nairn report describes `no risk' as being a myth and impossible to achieve in a major trading country. The reality is that they are probably right. But, as an idealist, as I always am, I would still hope that risk management meant that we went as close to the `no risk' option as possible, at least in terms of the goal of the quarantine service.
One of the problems in this whole area—and this truly underlines the debate about privatisation of quarantine stations—is that we have experienced in Victoria a number of problems with the privatisation of laboratories. The privatisation of some of those laboratories turned into a bit of a farce when the privatised laboratories found that they were unable to operate economically. So I would like to underline what Senator Forshaw said and to repeat the last sentence of the quote he read, which was from AQIS to the Senate inquiry:
AQIS would see any new arrangements being made the subject of stringent compliance agreements.
I have to say that the Democrats remain very cynical about that kind of assurance, because we have seen, time and time again, that before you privatise you can give all sorts of promises about compliance agreements and the rest of it, but after privatisation often those compliance agreements are very hard to maintain in a privatised company. I can give you some examples. I have already mentioned 
 the laboratories in Victoria. There is also a problem with trying to regulate the airport in Brisbane. There is aircraft noise and a whole lot of issues to do with the parallel runway which is proposed for Brisbane. The problem, of course, is that now that the airport is privatised it is very difficult to impose any kinds of restrictions on that airport. It is an example of the problem.
—You think you've got a problem with the Brisbane airport?
—You are in Victoria, Senator McGauran. Yes, there is a problem with the Brisbane airport. It is not the present Brisbane airport; it is a projected future possibility of a parallel runway and the difficulty of enforcing on a privatised company any kind of regulation about aircraft noise. It is just an example of the problem. I could go on to talk about Telstra or the Commonwealth Bank, but it is the same problem: that it is very easy before privatisation to talk about `stringent compliance agreements' but, in our experience, after privatisation compliance agreements are very hard to impose and to maintain. So I just raise that. In terms of any proposal to privatise our quarantine stations, we know that at this stage that is not going ahead and that there is a discussion paper which AQIS is to issue, or has issued. I believe that, should we come back to further legislation along those lines, it will need to be scrutinised very carefully.
I know that I am jumping around a little bit in this speech but I think it is important to put some of these matters on the record. Let me return to the issue of the papaya fruit fly in North Queensland and the particular problem for organic growers. One of the problems that organic banana growers in North Queensland found was that once, the papaya fruit fly had entered North Queensland, all of the fruit from that area had to be dipped in chemicals. That absolutely destroyed those organic banana farms because they cannot use chemicals—that is the whole nature of organic farming. So the pest infestation was far more devastating for them than it was for other farmers who were not organic growers. This example is certainly one that raises issues about quarantine protection.
This legislation again raises issues which we have debated previously. Certainly, the Democrats will monitor this legislation very carefully. We commend the government for taking up nearly all of the issues raised by the Nairn report. The legislation is a big improvement in many areas. We will be monitoring it to see just how it works because the whole issue of the quarantine service is very important for the Australian public, for every one of the senators in this place and for Australian primary industry. I note that the committee report recommended shared responsibility between industry, government and the general public in maintaining the high standard of the service.
The current situation in our country is that Australia remains relatively free of pests and disease. But as Senator Forshaw pointed out, the recent outbreak of Newcastle disease in the Hunter area is very worrying. Apparently that was an indigenous virus rather than anything that came from imports. This, of course, raises issues for importers from overseas countries who will point the finger and say, `Why are you stopping us from importing? If it is fear of Newcastle disease, you have it here already.' So you can see that debate opening up once more.
In closing, let me commend the government and say `Well done.' I do not want to be churlish and say `It is about time,' but we certainly welcome this legislation and will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-22,"—As has been said earlier in this debate, the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998  represents the government's response to the recommendation of the Australian Quarantine Review Committee—more commonly known as the Nairn committee—that the Quarantine Review Act 1908 be revised as soon as possible. It has also been noted that the Nairn committee was set up by Labor and commenced its work in January 1996. This bill provides the legislative framework for many of the recommendations of the Nairn committee, but the government has chosen to make its changes largely within the framework of the existing structures rather than by setting up entirely new ones as envisaged by Nairn. 
 In particular, the government has chosen not to set up a new statutory authority—Quarantine Australia—which was the cornerstone of Nairn's recommendations. Labor supports that view.
This bill outlines the scope of quarantine by including reference to the environment and economic activities for the first time, as recommended by Nairn. A requirement to consult the minister for the environment in certain circumstances is included. These circumstances relate to the role of the quarantine service in protecting indigenous fauna and flora from exotic pests and diseases. Moving people and goods in and out of Australia will always involve some level of quarantine risk. The approach taken in the bill is to manage quarantine risks to Australia to an acceptably low level in a manner that provides appropriate protection based on scientific assessment and which is consistent with international rules and standards.
Some flexibility is introduced into preborder and post-border quarantine measures. Carriers will gain some flexibility, for example, in the timing of pre-arrival reporting obligations and will be allowed to make their quarantine reports by exception in certain cases, such as for scheduled international flights. The power of quarantine inspectors to use dogs to assist them is formalised. A system of rectification notices is introduced to enable importers to rectify deficiencies which might otherwise cause goods to be refused entry to Australia, particularly where breaches relate to minor deficiencies in required paperwork.
Some flexibility is also introduced in dealing with contraventions of the act due to minor technical deficiencies. The power of the Director of Quarantine to order the seizure, sale, destruction or re-export of goods is clarified. Emergency powers are also strengthened to ensure that expedient measures can be taken in respect of newly emerging pests or diseases, even before such threats are proclaimed as quarantinable diseases.
At this stage in the debate I wanted to touch on the matter of Senator Brown's amendments, which have only now been 
 tabled in the Senate. There are four amendments to schedule 1 proposed by Senator Brown. The opposition has not seen these amendments before now. The opposition has not heard of any intention to amend this bill before this morning. 
The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. In relation to that reference, a hearing of the committee inquiry into the bill was conducted on Monday, 22 March. Evidence was heard. In addition, the committee met on 29 March to consider its report. There was no indication at the hearing of the committee on 22 March that there were issues which Senator Brown sought to raise. In fact, my recollection is that he did not attend the committee at all, nor did he indicate that he was desirous of doing so but unable to do so for other reasons. In addition, the meeting to consider the report on 29 March, to my recollection, did not have drawn to its attention any intention to seek to amend the bill as proposed in the amendments which were tabled this morning.
Whilst recognising that minor parties may have some difficulties in being present at all inquiries, it certainly seems to me to be incumbent upon those minor parties to indicate if they have an interest in a matter. If they are proposing to table amendments, senators should know about that before the debate arises. Indeed, there are processes of the Senate and its committees which allow that to take place, including the process of the referral of this bill to the legislation committee for inquiry. As I have outlined, it is my belief that has not taken place in this case.
Resulting from that, the opposition are in the difficult position, if this matter proceeds today, of having to seek to address those amendments on the run, and seeking to address amendments on the run is not a desirable way of proceeding. The opposition's view is that until we have an opportunity to appreciate the intent of the amendments, we would not be keen for this matter to proceed to the committee stage. As that will not occur, I suspect, before this part of the proceedings ends—and this bill will not be due to recommence today, as I understand the legislative 
 program—we may have an opportunity to do that tomorrow. That could not be guaranteed, depending on the import of the amendments and the fact that we will no doubt need to be in contact with our colleagues from the House of Representatives, who are not here this week because the House of Representatives is not sitting. In particular, the responsible shadow ministers may not be easily contactable. I cannot say what their position will be because I do not know. I have only just seen the amendments when I came into the chamber now.
I am expressing a caution to the government to say that we may not be ready to proceed with this tomorrow either, depending on the advice we have received. That is unfortunate because we have been saying and continue to say that we support the bill. I think it would be irresponsible for us not to give proper consideration to amendments which are laid before the chamber. To simply say, `They are too late. Therefore, we will oppose them' is not an argument we would use. This circumstance is brought about by the fact that these amendments have been drawn to our attention at the eleventh hour—in fact, well past the eleventh hour. Had the amendments not been tabled today we would have been in a position to finalise consideration of this bill if not today then early tomorrow. I think that would have been the desirable course of events. I must say that it is not necessarily the case now.
In relation to a matter that Senator Forshaw referred to—that is, the question of the broadening of the powers of the minister in this matter—we did deal with that at the committee stage. Ultimately, we were satisfied with the information we had as to what the real intent of the bill was, although during our inquiries the evidence from AQIS appeared to be a little confusing and somewhat in conflict with the library's Bills Digest, which described the bill as doing certain things which AQIS were perhaps not keen to concede were the intent of the bill. We have clarified that.
I suppose, when you are rewriting legislation and a broad range of material is reconsidered, sometimes items of detail can get lost in the process and be less understood than 
 otherwise might be the case. We did have some difficulty coming to grips with the extent to which the powers of the minister were being broadened in relation to the committee's inquiry process. Ultimately, it is fair to say that the committee's report clarifies the position, if there is a need to clarify it. The position is that we are not at all unhappy with the bill in relation to the broadening of the minister's powers.
I did want to touch upon a matter which has been dealt with by the two earlier speakers, Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley. This is a matter which is of critical importance in terms of the future of the quarantine service—that is, the question of privatisation. In the evidence given to the committee by the Executive Director of AQIS, Mr Paul Hickey, into the provisions of this bill, the AQIS submission to the committee hearing advised that it was about to circulate a discussion paper on the future of the quarantine inspection stations. Mr Hickey said that the release of this discussion paper was the initiation of a process that may or may not lead to the privatisation of its quarantine stations. He said that the privatisation of high risk quarantine stations would depend upon government policy at the time. He stated:
If government policy was to authorise the use of private premises for high risk areas, that conceivably could be the case.
I also asked Mr Hickey what the value of community service obligation funding is for the high risk quarantine stations. He advised me, and I think I can tell the Senate, that the funding is in the order of $1.5 million per year.
It appears to me that this government, as it has done elsewhere, is likely to look to privatise these high risk quarantine facilities based on its philosophical commitment to small government rather than good public policy. It is, I would suggest, a fact that there is a significant public benefit in the provision of effective quarantine management. In saying that, I highlight some of the matters that have been referred to by Senator Woodley and Senator Forshaw about the risk to Australian industries of the introduction of pests and diseases not hitherto present here.
The cost to the community of the introduction of pests and diseases can be enormous and can cripple industry. The economic loss to the community can be huge not only in simple dollar terms but also in social terms if that leads to the dislocation of important industries. Short- to medium-term unemployment can also arise from the introduction of diseases. What often happens in some of these industries if things go wrong is that the people who rely on them for their industries lose their employment. They are often in rural and regional areas where there are not alternative employment opportunities. The community dislocation in those circumstances is in fact higher than it might be in other parts of Australia where there are alternatives for people to go to within the community.
In terms of the risks occasioned by breaches in the management of quarantine, certainly the high risk quarantine stations should remain as government run facilities. I do not think that there is any doubt that the community should make a financial contribution to meeting the costs of the management of quarantine, particularly for those high risk quarantine stations. As I said, the risk of a breakdown in the monitoring of our borders against the introduction of pests and diseases is too great to take our chances. Having said that, and with the qualifications I made about the amendments which lay on the table, the opposition will support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-04-22,"—I, too, support the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1998 , but the Greens are bringing in a series of amendments to tighten it up with regard to the protection of Australia's environment. We believe that this legislation in simply requiring the quarantine officers, where a matter of Australia's environment is at stake, to decide whether or not they will notify the minister for the environment and then decide whether or not they will take advice from that minister is simply not good enough. We believe that if there is a quarantine matter which threatens the Australian environment then not only should the minister always be advised but also the advice from the minister should be taken. I will come back to that a little later.
Quarantine is absolutely essential to this nation. Just up the road from my place at Liffey under the Great Western Tiers of Tasmania—and I know that you, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, know that beautiful region well; I understand it is under snow from a fall the night before last—is one of the most wonderful walking places in the world where pencil pines grow. They are a unique pine to Tasmania, but they grace the beauty of many of the posters of Tasmania, particularly those that show off places like Cradle Mountain and the Walls of Jerusalem. Yet at the start of this decade I noticed that one of these was dying by the highway—the only place where a highway goes near pencil pines in the world. Consequent investigations have found that there is a phytophthora. A rootrot germ is attacking those trees which apparently comes from alpine areas in the Northern Hemisphere, maybe America. It was not thought that phytophthora would touch alpine regions until now. The threat of this is enormous—that is, the extinction of the species.
If you go to 1,200 metres elevation on the Lake Highway above Liffey you will find barricades and fences, and beautiful little picnic spots that were a past delight to people from Launceston and elsewhere are now blocked off. The quarantine services are trying to prevent the spread of this disastrous blight on the highlands of Tasmania, which probably got in on somebody's boots or on somebody's machinery. We have to be able to put in effective prevention, because otherwise it is not just environmental disaster but economic disaster that comes out of such a blight, such an exotic pest, getting into our wonderful environment here in Australia. That is what this bill goes some way towards preventing.
Debate interrupted.
—Order! It being 12.45 p.m., we will now move to non-controversial legislation. ",SENATE,<title>QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-04-22,"—There are five bills before the Senate at this time. They are the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Bill 1999 , the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Bill 1999 , the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 , the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment Bill 1999  and the National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Amendment Bill 1999 .
These bills, taken together, form legislation that is intended to amalgamate some 40 separate acts that currently exist and provide for the imposition of levies and charges upon rural industries. This body of legislation, which I refer to as the primary industries levies amalgamation legislation, is intended to provide a framework for the imposition of future levies and charges and to streamline that process, as I said, from currently 40 separate acts to two principal acts and three related acts. The two principal bills in this legislation are the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Bill 1999 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Bill 1999.
Currently, primary industry levies and charges are imposed upon various rural industries, generally at the request of and on behalf of those industry organisations. Those levies and charges are imposed to provide funds for the promotion of research and development for those particular industries. 
 As I said, they are often imposed as a result of industry initiative, and the government acts as the collection agency on behalf of the various industry peak bodies.
The specific provisions of the bills and the purposes thereof are set out in the minister's second reading speech, and I do not need to go over that in detail. I do wish to indicate that the opposition supports passage of this legislation, as we are assured that, firstly, it has been the subject of intense consultation with industry, who support it, and, secondly, it will streamline the process into the future.
Along with those assurances, I note that, if problems arise in the future, the industry peak bodies will be on the phone to us pretty quickly, as they usually are to let us know when they have some difficulty with either government legislation or particularly government regulation. It is really the regulations powers that are used to impose the additional levies, and we will hear those concerns pretty quickly if they arise, will be able to examine them and, if necessary, will take them up with government. So with those few remarks, and noting that my colleague Senator O'Brien also wishes to add some remarks to this non-controversial but very important legislation, I will indicate that the opposition supports the legislation.",SENATE,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-22,"—These bills consolidate 40 levy and charges imposition acts into just two acts. The proceeds raised by these levies and charges will principally fund research and development, statutory marketing authorities and health and safety monitoring in a large number of key rural industries. These bills had a fairly shaky start in the Main Committee of the other place with the eleventh hour introduction of a plethora of amendments. This is yet another illustration of the failure of this government to manage its legislative program properly. We have had these bills on the books for a considerable period of time, then from nowhere the government introduced a significant parcel of amendments. The amendments were sensible, but the manner in which they were introduced was not.
The amendments, or the intent of these amendments, have an interesting history. They 
 were introduced into the parliament by the former Labor government in 1995. The purpose of the 1995 bills was to streamline the process of managing a large number of levies and, in doing so, save significant amounts of parliamentary time. They were designed to allow for a levy rate to be amended at the request of the relevant industry by way of a disallowable instrument rather than a bill. The then opposition opposed the bills and they lapsed as a result. Now we have basically the same legislation but this time sponsored by the former opposition. The purpose, according to the government, of this package of bills is to, you guessed it:
. . . enable the government to better service industry by simplifying the processes and reducing the long lead times surrounding changes to levies and charges and by being more flexible and responsive to industry requests . . . 
The government also claims the bills will enable the administration of the levies and charges to be streamlined. We support the government's adoption of our sensible package of bills for the reasons we outlined in 1995 and for the reasons the government presented last month.
I want to make only one more point. This approach of pulling down sensible programs or blocking good legislation simply for the sake of it has been a feature of the administration of the primary industry or agriculture portfolio under the Howard government, and these bills are just one more example. A large number of rural industries could have benefited from these changes in 1995—not 1999—but thanks to the former minister for primary industries, Mr Anderson, those industries have had to wait until 1999 for these changes to go through the parliament, and they will today.",SENATE,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-04-22,"—The most important thing to note about this legislation is that it will make the law more accessible to those involved in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The main achievement of this legislation is the amalgamation of 40 primary industry levy and charge acts into two main bills. This will reduce the call on the time of parliament and the public sector for the often involved process of making 
 changes to levies and charges by reducing the number of imposition acts that will have to be amended to effect changes in the future.
The other important aspect of this legislation is that it provides a framework for future levies and charges to be imposed by regulation. This will enable the government to better service industries by simplifying the processes, reducing the long lead times surrounding changes to levies and charges and being more flexible and responsive to industry requests for such changes as well as for new or additional levies. The streamlining of the administration of levies and charges legislation would also introduce new efficiencies to the public sector.
It is important to note that the government intends that, when tabled in parliament, a regulation introducing new levies will be required to be accompanied by a report setting out the extent to which the proposed levy or charge complies with the government's general principles for new primary industries levies and charges. Such a regulation will be subject to disallowance by parliament. In addition, the Office of Regulation Review examines new levies through its regulation impact process, and a regulation impact statement is required for each new levy or charge.
Industry is supportive of this primary industries levies amalgamation legislation, as it will streamline the process of amending levy rates and introducing new levies. I would point out to Senator O'Brien that many industry sectors took the opportunity to request minor amendments to the legislation while it was before parliament. The amendments moved in the Main Committee demonstrated the responsiveness of this government to industry's requests, and other minor technical amendments to correct deficiencies and improve the legislation were moved while the bill was before the House. This government is being very responsive to industry in terms of what industry wants. I am pleased to say that the House passed the amendments and that industry will benefit from this. In conclusion, this government's initiative in introducing this legislation represents a major step forward in the administration of primary 
 industries levies and charges, and I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-04-22,"—I wish to speak on behalf of the Labor opposition on the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  and indicate our support for the bill. The bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to restrict the export of medications subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The export of pharmaceuticals that have been purchased under the PBS for redistribution to other countries should be stopped, and we support any moves to address what we understand to be a growing problem. We therefore support the bill.
It is important we make the point though that the problem that has arisen and is addressed by this bill is an indication of the success of the PBS. Australia enjoys affordable subsidised pharmaceuticals that people in other countries are obviously keen to access. The PBS not only provides universal access to affordable medicines; by setting out a national schedule of prices, the scheme also minimises the overall cost of pharmaceuticals. A 1996 Industry Commission report into the pharmaceutical industry found that Australia spends less per capita on pharmaceuticals than Germany, Canada, the US, Japan, Sweden and Ireland.
We hope this bill reflects the government's continuing commitment to the PBS. My colleague the shadow parliamentary secretary for health, Alan Griffin, who is the member for Bruce, will speak when the debate moves to the House of Representatives. He has primary coverage, but I wanted to indicate on 
 this occasion the Labor Party's support for the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-04-22,"—I thank the opposition for their support on this very important piece of legislation. I intend to make a few very brief comments because the details have been set out earlier in the second reading speech. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  is a relatively straightforward piece of legislation aimed at prohibiting the inappropriate export of pharmaceutical benefit scheme subsidised medicines. This bill delivers on a 1998 budget initiative to save Australian taxpayers money. It is estimated that up to $20 million per year of PBS subsidised medication is inappropriately exported overseas. This bill will put an end to these activities and ensure that only eligible people in Australia access PBS subsidised medicine.
I want to pick up the point that Senator Evans made with regard to the ongoing support of the PBS. The government will be taking a number of initiatives throughout this year about the quality use of medicine and drawing to the Australian community's attention the important benefits that flow to all Australians from the PBS and the very important budget contribution that is made by the government in this important area. The initiatives in this bill are intended to frustrate inappropriate use of medicine—certainly by taking it out of the country without the appropriate approvals and that type of nature. On behalf of the government, I thank senators for their cooperation on this legislation.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-22,"—I rise to speak very briefly on the Customs (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998  and related bills to indicate that the opposition is supporting them. I would not want the government to think that just because we are indicating support we are in complete agreement. We believe this bill falls short of many of the needs of industry and falls short of clearing up the mess that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade got us into.
To this day we are yet to receive an explanation as to why Mr Fischer decided to grant this quite extraordinary status to China when many countries around the world in the past have been what we call command economies. This means it is possible for a government to suppress a domestic price. When your local industry is being swamped with imports from some of these countries, you traditionally make an estimate of what the local price would be. But, in a command economy like China, it is possible for the government to make sure that the inputs and the output costs are all very low. Therefore, the domestic price is artificially kept low.
For Mr Fischer to have granted what is called free market status to China a couple of years ago as part of an agreement for which we have not yet had an explanation is quite extraordinary. It created job losses in Australia within six to 12 months. Companies that were going to establish in Australia to do business here went overseas. They went to Argentina instead of setting up in Australia. Jobs were lost because of Mr Fischer's ineptitude in dealing with this matter.
This bill is a response to Mr Fischer's gaffes. It does not go as far as we would want, but it begins to address the problem that Mr Fischer caused. As I said, I did not want to speak for long. We are supporting the bill, but we do not believe it goes anywhere near meeting the needs of industry.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (ANTI-DUMPING AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-04-22,"—I wish to make some brief comments about the Customs (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998  and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 . This government has taken an incredible amount of time to progress these import 
 ant amendments. In fact, these amendments were originally introduced into the parliament in June 1997 as the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill. That bill lapsed with the proroguing of parliament on 31 August 1998.
A key feature of this legislation is to provide a special approach for determining normal values of allegedly dumped goods from countries that are in the process of transition to a market economy. This amendment was in fact announced by the government in March 1997—over two years ago.
The delay in progressing this important legislation rests entirely with the government. We on this side of the chamber, and our colleagues in the other place, have been keen to progress it. The government has been arguing for some time that its legislative program has been blocked by the opposition parties in the Senate. The manner in which the government has dealt with these important bills stands in sharp contrast to those claims. And they are only one example.
A matter of weeks ago, we debated the enabling legislation for the government's rural training program—FarmBis. The detail of that program was announced by the government in September 1997. Funding for the program was actually provided for in the May budget of that year. Yet there we were, in March 1999, still trying to get the enabling legislation through the parliament.
We on this side of the chamber see anti-dumping laws as important legal weapons against unfair international trading practices. This is not about protection; this is about fairness. Australian industries should not have to compete with imports where the costs of production do not reflect the price ultimately charged. I hope the government is of the same view. We will be supporting the bills.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (ANTI-DUMPING AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-22,"—The Customs (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998  and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  provide a special approach for determining the normal value of allegedly dumped goods from countries in transition to a market economy where the selling price of those goods is subject to government control. A 
 number of our neighbours fall into that category.
The bills also provide for a new methodology for determining the normal value of allegedly dumped goods where the goods are exported from a country in transition to a market economy and the raw material input into the goods which accounts for more than 10 per cent of the costs of producing the goods is supplied by a state owned enterprise.
As the previous speakers have already outlined, these are issues which have been very much at the forefront of consideration by the parliament as a whole and by the Senate, with inquiries into various bills and various debates focusing on the very real problems in this area. For that reason the Democrats welcome the appearance, finally, of these bills on our legislative calendar. We think they are long overdue and very valuable.
As a member of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I point out that the committee was concerned that a number of amendments commenced on 1 January 1993—six years ago. The amendments were designed, according to the explanatory memorandum, to ensure that approximately $12 million in interim duties collected since 1 January 1993 is not subject to legal challenge.
The minister replied, in response to the committee inquiry, that the relevant provisions had not been subject to judicial interpretation and that there were no cases currently pending which would be affected by the amendments. It was felt that this particular retrospective activity had been quarantined and could be accepted therefrom. For those reasons, we accept that these bills can be regarded as non-controversial and we support them accordingly.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (ANTI-DUMPING AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-04-22,"—In speaking to the Customs (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998  and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  we need to look at the course of action—
—The debacle.
—Yes, Senator Conroy, a bit of a debacle. Prior to coming to government, the coalition made much ado about 
 anti-dumping and customs controls. In 1996, the government commissioned Willett to conduct an inquiry into the anti-dumping provisions of the Customs Act 1901. The report of that inquiry was handed down in around September 1996.
It took the government until the end of 1997 to take any action. Indeed, it was only as a result of the opposition's action—the introduction of two private members' bills, by Simon Crean in the House of Representatives and by me in this chamber—that the government was forced to bring forth its own legislation to implement the Willett recommendations. Even then, they fell short of what Willett was recommending. They referred part of his report to the Industry Commission—now the Productivity Commission—for further consideration and report.
Senator Murray interjecting—
—That is exactly right. Of course, it was important for us to take certain steps to bring about some changes. In the meantime, the Deputy Prime Minister visited China and had a cup of tea with Madam Wu, who certainly wooed Mr Fischer because he came back and said, `Well now, China is an economy in transition, so that's how they ought to be treated—we've got to look after them a bit better.' There was no consideration of the impact, or potential impacts, on Australian industries—none whatsoever.
We now have a situation—as has been pointed out before—where these bills, which came forward in 1997, were subsequently amended as a result of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry and now at least somewhat reflect the position, albeit still short, that we ought to be adopting. But this is only as a result of industry pressure and opposition pressure. This is despite—as I said at the outset—this government beating its chest and saying it was going to do all of these things with regard to anti-dumping measures. We have crept along, ever so slowly, to a point where we finally have got some semblance of the anti-dumping measures that ought to apply.
—We've got there at last, in the meantime taking a bit of heat.
—Senator Murray, it is my view that these things are still a long way short of where they ought to be. Indeed, if we look at one industry—the wood and paper products industry, which is the industry with the second largest import trade deficit in this country—we still have circumstances where we ought to be taking other measures. These are not measures that would be inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation rules.
We cannot allow the import of paper and pulp, from countries such as Indonesia, which places our paper making industries in great jeopardy, under circumstances where those countries clearly do not meet any environmental guidelines in the harvesting of their forests, when we in this country require environmental guidelines to be met in the harvesting of forests and, in terms of acquiring resource to make paper, require certain forest management practices to be employed. Albeit that these practices are on a voluntary basis, there are measures that governments can take if they are not met. Clearly that is a competitive advantage that some countries have over us but it can be addressed through the customs legislation.
We can make changes that will not be in breach of the WTO rules. If we look around the world at the degree of protection that is employed by a whole host of other countries, including some of the biggest economic powers of the world, we see a totally different approach. We see examples from time to time where the US, at its will, takes certain measures that to all intents and purposes would seem to me to be in breach of the WTO rules, but are found not to be.
I have people say to me, `You suggest that we ought to take some measures, but they could end us up in a trade war, and we are not in a very strong position to enter a trade war.' I accept that, but there is nothing wrong with any country that takes measures that are consistent with the WTO and the rules that apply through the WTO. There is no reason for other countries to embark upon a trade war with us, if all we have done is to employ measures that are GATT and WTO consistent. 
 If they did, then I would suggest that they should only take measures that are also WTO and GATT consistent because otherwise we could run the same argument.
There have been many problems associated with both anti-dumping and, in the other area of customs, our own import restrictions. One example which I think was stuffed up monumentally from the start relates to our salmon farming. Clearly we ought to have a long, hard look at what we are doing in this area. Whilst we do support these bills as a small step forward we still have a long way to go. If we do not take some further steps, we will see the closure of the paper making industry in my own state of Tasmania and, I suggest, potentially the closure of the paper making industry in Victoria.
I do not know where we got to with the Productivity Commission's report on the further steps suggested by the Willett report, but we certainly have to proceed to take further steps in the area of making sure that our industries do compete on a level playing field. We should be ensuring that they are definitely not subject to dumping from other producers in other countries as they are faced with at the moment. Because of inadequacies in the legislation and some that still remain, they will continue to be subject to those pressures. I suggest the government seriously consider those matters and do something about them. I commend the bill.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (ANTI-DUMPING AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-04-22,"—I thank Senator Conroy, Senator Murray and Senator Murphy for their contributions and also thank them for their brevity and cooperation. I want to respond to Senator Murray regarding the comments in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. The bill does include a retrospective provision dealing with the collection of dumping duty. This is to correct a drafting error—and I will not be provocative, Senator Murray, and say it was a drafting error from 1993. The amendment will safeguard the duty which has been paid to date. It is not as a result of any court cases; it has not affected anybody at this stage. The duty collection arrangements have not been 
 the subject of any court challenge. The amendment does not result in the imposition of any additional burden on any party—it merely serves to clarify and safeguard existing arrangements. I thought we should put that on the public record since you had raised that issue here. I thank honourable senators for their cooperation and commend the bills to the chamber.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-22,"—I think it is important to make a number of points about the sales tax system. I have referred to the strength of the current sales tax system on a number of previous occasions in the Senate in the context of the debate on the government's tax package and its continual assertions that the sales tax system is `broke'. It is not just the Treasurer and the Prime Minister who have made this 
 claim but recently the head of Treasury, Mr Evans, in estimates also said bluntly that it was broke. I have referred again on a number of occasions to the Oxford Dictionary  definition of broke or broken. We have had this continual mantra: the tax system, particularly the wholesale sales tax system, is broke or broken. The definition of broke or broken refers to such indicators as bankrupt.
If we look at the recent revenue collection from wholesale sales tax, in fact the revenue for the six months up until December last year from wholesale sales tax collections grew by approximately nine per cent. To put that into perspective, that is well in excess of the current rate of economic growth. If a tax is broken, why is it collecting an ever-increasing amount of revenue and indeed why is it collecting more revenue than the economic growth of the country? So in terms of revenue projection it is clearly not broken.
It is interesting to note that in the last 12 years the Commonwealth budget has been in surplus on six occasions. Of those budget surpluses, four were delivered by Labor in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. As we know, the budget is back in surplus, it will certainly be in surplus when the next budget is handed down, and it is going to be in surplus for the foreseeable future with an alleged broken wholesale sales tax system and without a goods and services tax—at the present time at least and I hope for the long-term future. The notion that the sales tax base is crumbling is just unsustainable.
Recently, Access Economics released a paper analysing Australia's tax revenue base. They looked at the wholesale sales tax and pointed out a worst case scenario. They indicated that there was likely to be a loss of revenue of perhaps $100 million per year from the sales tax. Even if this were true, the loss of $100 million per year in revenue over, say, the next 20 or 30 years is absolutely minuscule in terms of the Commonwealth's revenue and the total budget.
Again recently, on the Senate tax committee of which I was a member, on the Monash model it was reported that Treasury had asserted that a major change in the tax mix was necessary because the present array of 
 indirect taxes will raise insufficient revenue in relation to Australia's future public sector requirements; however, the Treasury provided no explicit revenue forecasts. I emphasise that point. Treasury, according to Monash analysis, does not provide any explicit revenue forecasts in respect of the sales tax.
My colleagues Senators Conroy and Cook and I pursued in the recent estimates this issue with Treasury. We questioned them carefully about some files that we knew existed. We did not know their contents, but we knew that they existed about future revenue projections from sales tax. Initially at least, Treasury was denying that these files existed—until we read out the file numbers, which was a clear indication that the files existed. We wanted to know what was in those files. What are the future revenue projections? We had just had, as I referred to earlier, Mr Evans, the head of Treasury—and I know that Treasury officials do watch these debates on the TV screens down in the Treasury building—
—Wave to them, then.
—I like to do more than wave to them. I like to give the big finger down to that GST, Senator, and all the misinformation we have been getting on the GST. It does not disappoint me that the government provides misinformation—you expect that, unfortunately—but it does disappoint me that the Treasury has been part of this process, from the fact that we could not get the sales tax revenue forecasts out of Treasury and the fact that Mr Evans says `It's broke' when clearly it is not broken. Labor makes no apologies for its position that the current wholesale sales tax should continue.
It is not as though the current wholesale sales tax has not been updated and modernised, and not just in terms of the rates for collection. There have been very significant changes to our current wholesale sales tax over the past 50 or 60 years. It has been continually updated, continually modernised. Sales tax has great flexibility as a tax policy tool. You have a number of levels of sales tax and you can effectively tax progressively—unlike with a GST, where it is a common 10 per cent rate across almost all goods and 
 services. The wholesale sales tax is an input tax, just as this tax in respect of a GST on financial services and home rentals is an input tax; but the wholesale sales tax is a multiple rate structure, and that is an advantage, as I said earlier.
We do not believe that the current level of criticism of the wholesale sales tax is valid. Also, the wholesale sales tax does not tax the necessities of life. It does not tax most food, or clothing, footwear, electricity, gas or telephone—as the GST will. All that you wish to achieve in terms of revenue can be accomplished by the maintenance of the wholesale sales tax. It is not an unusual concept, even with a GST, to apply different rates of tax according to your particular ideological position about who should be taxed and at what rate.
It is interesting that there are many countries in the OECD—Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico and a considerable number of others—where their VAT applies at different levels. Labor certainly do not believe that we should have a GST. We do not believe that there is any need to shift from the current wholesale sales tax.
It is interesting that, with the goods and services tax proposed to replace the wholesale sales tax and nine other taxes—in the main, state taxes—the GST will raise some additional revenue. But that additional revenue is not critical to the maintenance of the budget surplus, and it is not critical to the delivery of the second element of the government's tax package, which is the income tax cuts.
One of the frustrating elements of the last election and the period since then is that, unfortunately, a significant number of Australians do not realise that with the government's tax package—and it is inequitable in terms of income tax cuts—those income tax cuts can be delivered without a GST. They are not dependent upon a GST. You could deliver the government's income tax cuts with the current wholesale sales tax, without it being replaced by a GST, because the proposed income tax cuts are based on a budget surplus that is likely to continue for at least the next couple of years. We do not need a GST. We simply 
 do not need it. We do not need it in order to maintain the revenue from indirect taxes and we do not need it in order to provide revenue for income tax cuts. For numerous other reasons, we do not need the wholesale sales tax replaced.
One of the major advantages of the wholesale sales tax is that there are only 70,000 tax collectors—70,000 businesses collect the wholesale sales tax. Initially in the first year the estimates are that under a GST there will be 1.4 million tax collectors, which will rise to 1.6 million tax collectors. In efficiency terms, how can a tax that increases the number of tax collectors from 70,000 to 1.6 million—there will be more than 1.5 million new tax collectors—be more efficient in terms of collection?
The vast majority of those new tax collectors will be small businesses and they will have additional compliance costs: the costs of doing business, meeting the paperwork requirements or whatever that may be. It may be $500 in one instance or $1,000 in another. In another instance it might be higher. We do know that the collection of the GST by small business particularly will involve compliance costs which will be greater than they will be for large businesses.
The wholesale sales tax is not perfect—I would be the first to say that—but it can be renewed and updated. One of the most misleading comments that is made, and one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects of the sales tax, is the continual assertion that the sales tax system is based on manufacturing and not on the growing services sector. The logic that is drawn from that is that that is why it is not a modern tax and in fact revenue will decline.
What is interesting about the sales tax is that it does tax a number of electronic goods, such as computers, to take one element, and they in turn are based on the growing services industries. So a sales tax is, in part, certainly based on manufacturing, but in turn based on the growth of services industries. It is not correct to say that the sales tax is purely based on manufacturing. That is one of the reasons why sales tax revenues are not declining. 
I want to make a couple of other points about sales tax. Sales tax is maintaining its revenue collection role. It is efficient to collect in terms of the cost of collection, both for government and businesses that are involved in that process. There does not seem to be—certainly to Labor—any good reason for a GST, other than an ideological obsession on the part of this government.
As I said earlier, we can have the income tax cuts that the government is proposing without a GST; there is no basis for such a proposal in terms of revenue. The GST can be knocked over, and Labor is certainly intent on doing that and ensuring it is not passed. The government's proposed income tax cuts are grossly inequitable and unfair, and reward the higher income earners by a factor of two or three to one over the lower middle income earners. But, if the government wants to deliver that, it can deliver it tomorrow without a GST and the budget will still be in surplus. Those are a few points I wanted to make about sales tax.
In my concluding remarks I might just say that we are debating non-controversial legislation, which is the norm on a Thursday. There are a number of bills put before the Senate that can be dealt with speedily, and Labor has facilitated that. Again I emphasise that it is a matter of deep regret to the Labor opposition that, when we go back after question time this afternoon to debating government legislation, we will not be dealing with the GST legislation.
There are more people than normal listening to the broadcast, because the House of Representatives is not sitting. There is a certain degree of public interest in the goods and services tax package. But what is important is that many of those listening—whatever the number—had a belief that we would be dealing with the goods and services tax. The Senate's  time this week and next week has been specifically set aside to deal with the goods and services tax.
In fact, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, have been out in the community and on the radio waves saying, `The Senate has got to pass this tax package.' They are telling the senators, `Get 
 in there and pass it.' Labor is here in the Senate wanting to debate the goods and services tax package.
—But you don't want to pass it, do you?
—We certainly will not pass it. I will take that interjection. But the sooner we get on with it and know what the final position is, the better. Labor will not support a goods and services tax. I am proud of that, and the Labor Party is proud of that. That is the position we took to the last election and, for some of the reasons I explained a little earlier in my comments, it is not a tax that Australia needs. The goods and services tax is not necessary.
I indicate to those people who believe that we should be discussing the goods and services tax today that we are not discussing it because the government's own leadership in the Senate yesterday afternoon decided to put off the debate on the GST, and not go into committee and discuss it in detail.
There is the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, out there saying, `Get on and pass the GST,' but the Liberal government's leadership in here is saying, `We are not going to consider it until tomorrow,' and I suspect not until next week the way things are heading. This is not because of any deliberate time delaying by the Labor Party.
Yesterday there were some examples of confusion in the Senate. Two government senators went to lunch early and the government missed the vital vote. There was some degree of confusion on the government's side. The government leader, Senator Hill, is away and has been replaced by Senator Alston, who has not been able to keep up with the game in terms of dealing with the government's GST legislation.
Surprisingly—the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and Mr Howard have been assuring Australians that the GST package does not need any amendment; that it is a good package and it does not need any change—yesterday the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, presented us with a list of about 125 or 126 amendments to the government's package.
—There were 128.
—Thank you. The government is bringing in 128 amendments to its package, which, it has been assuring everyone, does not need amendment. I always get suspicious when Senator Kemp says `minor technical matters' or `minor technical details'—he has done it on another occasion. But on this occasion 128 amendments to the government's GST package are referred to as `minor technical matters'. If you look through some of these `minor technical matters'—and I had an opportunity overnight to look at some of them at least—they relate to the sale of farms and how they will be treated with a GST. Some of the amendments relate to charities and the way in which the GST will be collected and enforced. Quite fundamental issues are addressed in those `minor technical amendments'. Normally Senator Kemp refers to them as `enhancements'—that is the jargon you get when the government is backing down on something in a big way.
I emphasise again that the sales tax we have in this country is sustainable and efficient and there is no need to replace it with a goods and services tax. There are particular problems with the sales tax, but they can be addressed and that should continue on an ongoing basis as it has for the last 60 or 70 years. For this and other reasons, which we will get into on other occasions, we do not need a goods and services tax. Labor stands ready to debate that package of legislation. We should get on with it and debate it and hopefully—certainly Labor will take this view—we will be voting the GST down.",SENATE,<title>SALES TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-22,"—The Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  seeks to exempt from sales tax four main categories. The first one is space equipment. In 1998 the government took several initiatives designed to facilitate the development of a commercial space industry in Australia. That statement on its own is worth noting. I am always pleased when I see the walls of economic rationalism and free marketeering crumble, because the government's support for a commercial space industry specifically entails selecting an industry for development which will be good 
 for Australia. I think that is entirely the right policy, and I am very glad to see the saner minds in the coalition prevail on those issues.
The financial impact of exempting from sales tax space launch vehicles, payloads and other goods intended for launch into outer space or to be brought back from outer space—true exports in the bigger sense of the word, I guess—amounts to $60 million. So we can quantify the amount of industry assistance being provided to this very desirable new industry by Australia. Thank you to those in the government who do not believe in the extremes of economic rationalism and who do believe in supporting industries and in providing subsidies and supports where appropriate.
The second area being addressed is that of goods imported by Olympians. Certain goods are to be exempted from sales tax when imported by overseas participants and delegations attending the Sydney 2000 Olympics, Paralympics and associated events. The goods are not provided in a scheduled sense—they are just described generally—so it is a fairly loose and broad approach. The exemption for goods imported by Olympians has a financial impact which is unquantifiable but is expected to be low. I am not sure what `low' means but, nevertheless, if we are in for billions with supporting the Olympics this measure is just adding to the sense of supporting an enterprise and a sporting event which has changed the face of Sydney and which will be good for Australia. The whole question of Sydney 2000 Olympics and any support, even by the sales tax bill, is to be welcomed.
The third area of attention is that of sales tax evasion in the computer industry. The government has quite rightly tightened up on the potential for such sales tax evasion to occur. But again the financial impact is recorded as an unquantifiable revenue gain.
I will need a response from the parliamentary secretary because the Scrutiny of Bills Committee again drew attention to this bill. The committee expressed concern that the starting date in respect of the provisions dealing with sales tax evasion in the computer industry is not defined, and there is no provision for automatic commencement after the 
 lapse of a certain period. The government's response to this, when the Scrutiny of Bills Committee wrote to them, was that sales tax evasion in the computer industry is not yet a significant problem—I do not quite know how they assessed that—and they will only proclaim these provisions to commence if it does become a problem. Given that the wholesale sales tax will be abolished on 1 July 2000—that is, if the GST bills go through—it may be that the commencement of these provisions could be postponed indefinitely and exporters therefore would be saved a compliance cost. This is an interesting approach—and perhaps the parliamentary secretary can explain it in her response—because it seems to me that it is almost like a threat, where the government is saying, `We've got the law, we've passed the law, and if you don't mind your p's and q's in this business, we are going to proclaim it.' That sort of provision makes me a little nervous, frankly, because there is no sunset clause and this could hang around for a long time. I might have misunderstood the intent, but I would appreciate a response on that.
The other area picked on in the sales tax bill is the temporary importation of goods. I note that the estimated gain in revenue is $2 million per annum, so it does mean that people who are involved in that area will see themselves squeezed a little tighter by the Treasurer and the Treasury for the gain of $2 million. I do not think it deserves any special attention, but there it is—another revenue raising device. With those brief remarks—I will not take the full 20 minutes that is allocated to me—I record the support of the Australian Democrats for this bill.",SENATE,<title>SALES TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-04-22,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Sales Tax Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . The bill contains four proposed changes to the sales tax law, of which two are anti-avoidance measures, one will encourage the development of the commercial space launch industry in Australia and, as Senator Murray pointed out, the other measure will ensure that sales tax does not apply to certain goods brought into 
 Australia by non-Australian family members of participants and by delegations of participants in the Olympic and Paralympic Games and associated events.
With respect to the issue that Senator Murray mentioned regarding a matter raised in the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, in order to facilitate the passage of the bill I will table the letter that was sent to Senator Cooney as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills from Senator Kemp so that it is available on the public record. But, as a short answer: it is considered that the proposed export provisions will be a powerful disincentive to evasion, even without a fixed starting date. These amendments will act as a deterrent to discourage this type of behaviour from developing, while allowing for a quick response in the event of an emerging problem with tax evasion of this nature.
Commencement of these provisions would lead to potentially significant compliance costs for some exporters. On the other hand, if the provisions do operate effectively as a deterrent to evasion, it may be possible to indefinitely defer the start date and these compliance costs. This is in line with the industry's wish to have laws which target evasion but have a limited impact on complying taxpayers and the industry generally. Industry has noted that such strong statements from government are effective in combating evasion.
The avoidance of compliance costs in this case is especially desirable, given the current intention to end sales tax on 1 July 2000. Any fixed starting date for the legislation would be shortly before 1 July 2000. It would not be cost effective for either the industry or the tax office to incur these compliance costs unless there was proof of significant emerging abuse of the export exemption.
A similar open-ended commencement date exists with respect to the retailer withholding regime, which is another anti-evasion measure aimed at the computer industry. I table the letter to Senator Cooney from Senator Rod Kemp, and I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-04-22,"—Yesterday I was asked two questions by Senator Bartlett, and I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  answers to the two questions.
Leave granted.
The answers read as follows:
IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO
Senator Bartlett asked the questions below in relation to a report in the Sydney
Morning Herald of 21 April concerning Mr Manuel Carrascalao, an East Timorese whose 18 year old son was killed in over the weekend and whose home is being used to shelter refugees from the violence. The report details Mr Carrascalao's request for Australia to provide shelter for those refugees who survived the weekend massacre.
.	 Does the minister agree with Minister Ruddock's suggestion that the best course of action for these people who are currently in Dili and East Timor hiding for their life is for them to make an initial approach to the Australian embassy over in Jakarta about their situation?
.	 What measures is Australia taking to enable prompt processing of visa applications of people in East Timor, particularly those who are in reasonable fear of their life?
Answer:	
The Australian government is deeply concerned about the recent violence in East Timor. It has been monitoring the situation very closely.
We understand the wish of East Timorese whose family members have suffered as a result of the recent violence to seek to relocate them to Australia on a temporary basis. A situation where all East Timorese can remain in safety and security would be the preferable option.
The Indonesian government and armed forces are responsible for law and order and for protecting the people of East Timor. The Australian government has been in close contact with the Indonesian government to express our concern about the situation and to convey our views on how to resolve the security situation. We have strongly urged the authorities to disarm the militias.
The Prime Minister and Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence will meet with President Habibie early next week to further discuss this issue.
The Australian embassy in Jakarta will continue to process visa applications to Australia according to the requirements of the visa class applied for.
QUESTION TAKEN ON NOTICE
IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO	
Senator Bartlett asked the Minister what measures the Australian government has taken tort ensure swift processing of applications for special humanitarian and other immigration visas for ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region and what specific 
 plans have been put in place to promptly deal with Kosovar people wanting to apply for permanent refugee status.
Answer:
Australia has made a generous offer of both 4,000 places for temporary resettlement and relief aid. This is in addition to applications being considered for permanent resettlement under the Humanitarian Program.
Offers from the US, Canada and Australia for temporary resettlement are on hold at UNHCR's request while UNHCR takes up temporary resettlement offers from European countries closer to Kosovo in the first instance. However our offer of 4,000 temporary protection places remains in place. We are in a position to—move people within a very short timeframe of UNHCR reactivating its request.
In relation to Kosovo Albanians who have applied for permanent resettlement under the Humanitarian Program, Mr Ruddock has asked that overseas posts process such applications as a matter of priority in view of the extremely difficult situation that many applicants may find themselves in.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>East Timor: Visa Applications</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-04-22,"—The 1997-98 Annual Report of the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula raises a very important issue. I suppose I should declare somewhat of an interest, having spent five or six years working as an infant welfare registered nurse and having had some experience of what happened 20 years ago. There is no doubt, with regard to the feeding of infants, that breastfeeding is the best way and that breast-milk substitutes, whilst effective, certainly do not offer the child the full benefits that breast milk does. There are, however, many women who are unable to breastfeed or who need to supplement the breastfeeds with formula. But that should be done very cautiously and with, on occasions, medical coverage and medical supervision. The report is important because it actually outlines in the foreword an increasingly used market strategy. It says:
An increasingly used market strategy that the Panel has identified in the last 12 months is the promotion of specialised infant formulas such as `lactose free' or anti-reflux'. The Panel is concerned that the promotions for such products may involve unsubstantiated therapeutic claims aimed at conditions which may not require treatment with such a product. The Panel has written to the Minister responsible for Consumer Affairs and the Minister for Health and Aged Care to outline its concerns.
I will certainly be following up in estimates with those ministers and departments what precisely they have done and if there has been any action that they have undertaken.
When I look at the outlines given in the report as to how this is taking place, they are talking about formulas being available that will stop reflux. As a former clinic sister, I would be very loath to allow self-diagnosis and self-decision about treatment of this particular condition. It is one where there is often no major treatment required, as the child will grow out of it. If treatment is required, then I am firmly of the opinion that this should be done at least under medical supervision and preferably under a paediatrician's supervision.
There is also one talking about lactose free. Again, the diagnosis of lactose intolerance is something that should be undertaken only under medical supervision, and the treatment of that with a lactose free substitute should also be undertaken only under medical supervision. It is highly remiss of these companies and outlets to be advertising these products in such a way. Whilst we can stop them from doing that here in Australia, I am concerned that when they go overseas to developing countries they might well be undertaking these sorts of marketing programs, much to the detriment—and potential hazards therefore—of the children and babies in those developing countries.
We know that they have high mortality rates and that there are problems in some areas with access to sterile or clean water, which of course is essential when making up infant formula. It is something that needs to be watched closely and cautiously. As I said, I will be following up with ministers at estimates to see what they have done about this strategy that appears to be being adopted. 
 It is certainly one of grave concern to those in the profession. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-04-22,"—One has to look behind the effect of this motion which authorises the Select Committee on Information Technologies to sit next Tuesday night, if the Senate itself is sitting. I make it clear that I will be opposing the Senate sitting next Tuesday night for a whole range of reasons but not least because we have a whole year in which to consider important pieces of legislation.
I am well aware that the government wants to get through most of its legislative slate for this year in the first half of the year in an extraordinary effort to utilise Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, the Independent senators, to get legislation through which it will not be able to get through after 1 July when the new Senate numbers are here—the Senate that was voted for by the people of Australia in October last year. This item is extraordinary because I believe it is part of the game play going on outside of this chamber to foster legislation, such as the sale of 
 Telstra and GST legislation, through the Senate courtesy of Senators Harradine and/or Colston.
The Senate has heard my view on the accelerated treatment being given to the establishment of the Committee on Information Technologies which is looking at how to prevent pornography on the Internet, pornography in cyberspace. I have no worry about that happening, but I am acutely aware of the fact that, after six months of nothing happening, the committee was suddenly established a week or two ago and that the whole process is now being truncated to give a result to the wish of Senator Alston and the government to hastily bring in regulations censoring the Internet by 11 May—budget day.
What an extraordinary situation. For six months nothing happens and then everything has to happen within a couple of weeks. We have the establishment of the committee and the hearings. We see from motions now on the Notice Paper, and foreshadowed, the dealing with the legislation itself by this committee. Here we have a motion to ensure that whatever happens, if the Senate does move to have a sitting next Tuesday night, that cannot get in the way of this either, that the committee's hearings will proceed to give a result by budget day. We are going to get, on the day of the budget, the delivery to Senator Harradine of his wish that there be censorship of the Internet.
All of us are concerned about material on the Internet. I have a particular concern about violence. I note that the Eros Foundation, and one can take or leave their figures, did a public survey which found that the majority of Australians are more concerned about violence than sexually explicit material in cyberspace. In fact, the figures, as I understand them, are that 50 per cent of Australians would first ban violent films; 32 per cent would first ban racist material; and 12 per cent would first ban sexually explicit material. I think that is probably a fair reflection of what the public thinks. But it is not a reflection, I submit, of what Senator Harradine thinks or Senator Alston thinks.
We also know, no matter what this committee comes up with, that the ability to censor 
 explicit material on the Internet deriving from Australia is not going to knock out the ability to censor material coming from overseas, and that is where 90 per cent or so of it is coming from. It is going to be an ineffective instrument. If there are legitimate reasons for such a move, then this committee should be looking at them—but not now.
This is purely political pay-off. This is about what the Independents are getting for considering the sale of more of Telstra and/or the passage of the GST. This Senate is being asked to be party to that process without being informed. If we are going to be part of the process of paying off Senator Harradine, then let the government tell us what the process at hand is. Let the government say, `Yes, this is the negotiating process as we see it.' Explicit or inherent, let the government say, `This is what is going on here. We are concerned about the GST. We feel that it would cushion the process of the GST through this chamber if we were able to offer other things to the Independents.'
 Whether one of them is this legislation and this committee's establishment, let it not be inherent, let it not be inferred—let the government be direct about it, let the Independents be direct about it. On the face of it, we are in the process of establishing a committee to rush through a wish by the Independents, who will be less powerful after 1 July, to effect what Australians can see or cannot see on the Internet. I stress again: it is valid that this chamber look at such things. What is not valid is that the agenda of this chamber be altered to give effect to a negotiating process outside this chamber which has nothing to do with this legislation but which has to do with the government's wish to get through the GST and/or the sale of Telstra.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the government has circulated a list of what it calls `high priority' bills to be dealt with by this chamber prior to 30 June—the great date when the new senators come in here and the Democrats take the balance of power, which, as far as the government is concerned, is currently held by the Independents. It is an extraordinary list. There are little  asterisks next to the list of high priority bills 
 and the list under it of bills that will be dealt with, `time permitting', by 30 June. The government lists 27 pieces of legislation it would like to see through by 30 June. At the bottom of the page, it says:
This list does not indicate the order of priority.
But I can tell you it is very close to what the government's priorities are. When you look at this list of 27 bills, the ANTS package of bills come first, the sale of Telstra comes second, and then third is the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 —so the anti-porn legislation is No. 3 on this list. What is below it? What has been shuffled out of the way to make way for this priority legislation for Senator Harradine, if that is the case? And the government can tell us whether or not it is the case. There is the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill—potentially for people coming from Albania. There are the appropriation bills, the Wool International Privatisation Bill and the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill. There is legislation to do with radically altering—in my submission, for the worst—the environment laws of this country. There is the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill. There is legislation on telecommunications and superannuation—so that people will have a choice of superannuation funds, a choice that is currently not available. There is new workplace relations legislation: that comes in way down at about No. 10.
There is other legislation on taxes, quarantine, the destruction of forests, corporate law, customs and Aboriginal issues as well as on textiles, clothing and footwear matters and higher education. They have all been moved down the list so that a hastily concocted committee can deal with pornography on the Internet, although the government did not move in the first six months of this term of office to do anything about it at all.
It is patently obvious what is going on here. I do not want to be party to it. I believe the Senate should order its priorities according to what is important and not according to what is going on in negotiations either in the Prime Minister's suite or in the suites of the Inde 
 pendents. I do not think that we should be a party to having our priorities set without the government being explicit itself about what is happening in those negotiations. It is a matter of extraordinary importance to the public. I would agree with Senator Harradine that pornography or violence or racism on the Internet are important issues we should be dealing with, but I can tell you this: there are many Australians who are more concerned about the effect of the tax package on their lives and about the sale of Telstra and what that might do to people in regional areas or to low income earners who are not in the CBD—there are a whole host of other issues, as I have just listed.
I know the government might get up and attack on this and say that it is not so, but give us an explanation, please, as to why a sudden priority has been set now—at this time when the government is engaged in massive negotiations with the Independents, who very often cannot be in here because they are so busy. I respect that—people often are not in here because they are busy. But it has been obvious to me, watching events here in the last week or two, that the Independents are distracted by their heavy burden. Senator Harradine will not cavil at this, as he sees it is on his shoulders to make sure he gets right whatever arrangement he and the government come up with on the GST and the tax package. So it is a very disturbing situation. It is a case of trying to find out what is being traded here but, above all, in my books it is a case of the Senate not having its program changed and important matters being dropped down the list to make way for a negotiating process which might suit the Indpendents but which is not giving priority to the real needs of this nation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,24,1
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-04-22,"—I was not intending to speak on this matter that Senator Brown has referred to, but I believe this morning he would not give leave for this particular committee, the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies, to sit on Tuesday night. He has already referred to the fact that there is a heavy load on senators and that there are a lot of committees in this place. This is a committee of the 
 Senate, and I take exception to some of the accusations made about the motives of it. I am a member of this committee and I certainly take exception to some of the motives that were imputed to it.
We had a meeting of the members of the committee this afternoon, as a matter of fact. It was to discuss our future program to bring to an end the particular inquiry into online services. For Senator Brown to say that what this committee is trying to do is not important—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, what we are looking at is the terrific problem, the huge problem, of pornographic material being peddled on the Internet that all our children, other people's children, young people and school-age children around this country are having foisted upon them.
We have already had evidence that 60 per cent of the material on the Internet is pornographic—paedophilia, you name it; it is all there. If we as a government or as a country cannot do something to stop the invasion of this disgraceful material, to stop it being foisted upon our young people, then what are we doing here? It is all very well for Senator Brown to get up here and say that we are wasting our time on this committee.
—I never said that, and you know it.
—I can tell you: we went down to Melbourne for two days and put up with your circus on the Regional Forest Agreement. You brought all your ferals out of the woods, and they came and made a hell of a mess around the place. They put graffiti all over Parliament House; they attacked the police and the police had to come and keep them away—all orchestrated by you. That is your agenda. But when someone else wants to do something good for the country, all you can do is sit there and complain about it.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Calvert has misrepresented me and he knows that. I seek the opportunity to put the record straight.
—There is no point of order.
—So Senator Brown is saying that he had nothing to do with the demonstrations that were held in Melbourne when we were listening to evidence on the Regional Forest Agreement and that he was not talking to people outside who came in and started blowing whistles and the like during the public hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. He says he has no knowledge of that. Fair enough; he says that, but I can tell you that it did not go unnoticed by the members of the committee who were there. I think Senator Woodley was there on that particular day.
So I am saying that everybody has their own preferences, but do not start throwing stones at other members of this Senate who are trying to do what they believe is the right thing for the young people who are being corrupted by this sort of material. This particular committee has been in existence for quite some time, and we have to finish what we have to do. Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Lundy and others are members of that committee, and Senator Quirke was a member of the committee prior to the last election. He would know very well about some of the evidence that we heard, not just about pornographic material on the Internet but also about some of the standards of material that we have to listen to on the radio and the disgraceful stuff that is being pedalled to our young children around this country. If we cannot have a look at this on behalf of the Senate and the government there is something wrong. All we are asking for is leave for the committee to get on with its work on Tuesday night while the Senate is sitting, and we hope to complete it as soon as we possibly can. I cannot believe that another senator, who obviously has other agendas, would object to that happening.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,24,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-04-22,"—The opposition supports the motion, and perhaps I should explain why. The points that Senator Brown indicates are his reasons for opposing it—
—No. On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have not opposed this motion; I have simply spoken to it. 
—Can I just indicate that this is a committee meeting which, I understand, was organised long before there was a notice of motion given by the government to extend the sitting hours for next Tuesday night. The opposition, like Senator Brown, is concerned about the extension of those sitting hours, and tomorrow we will get an opportunity to explain why we are concerned about the extension of the sitting hours. However, witnesses have been called and they do have to make travel arrangements. It is my understanding that the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which is based in Sydney, has to make the necessary travel arrangements. It is a public holiday in Sydney on Monday—unlike Melbourne of course, where there is no public holiday thanks to Mr Jeff Kennett's retrogressive attitudes and the appalling approach he has taken to the question of Anzac Day—and of course we have a public holiday here in Canberra on Monday.
I think it is reasonable to give witnesses before this inquiry an opportunity to make travel arrangements with some certainty as to their likelihood of appearing before the committee. As to the other matters that go to the arrangements with other senators in this place, I have no doubt that the government is very busy seeking the support of senators for its legislative programs, which are highly controversial, and no doubt we will get an opportunity, I trust, to examine the arrangements that may well have been made. We will do all that we can to explore that relationship, should it be demonstrated that the government has in fact entered into arrangements to secure the support of senators for the GST or for the privatisation of Telstra. As to the sitting hours question itself, we do not believe that is a reason in itself to reject the proposition that there be authorisation given for this committee to meet.
The government has an opportunity tomorrow morning to express why it believes it needs the extra sitting hours. We will take our chances on that basis. I trust that there will be a majority of senators who will not agree with the government. We have made propositions to the government with regard to a compromise on that matter, and to this point they 
 have been rejected. We think that the issue of the inquiry itself does warrant close examination. It may well be that the minister's attempt to secure the various means of introducing new forms of censorship will be demonstrated to be totally inadequate, totally inept and totally impracticable. It may in fact lead to considerable damage to this country. These are all matters that may well be demonstrated through the committee process. I trust that the committee will examine these issues in some detail.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-04-22,"—One has to look behind the effect of this motion which authorises the Select Committee on Information Technologies to sit next Tuesday night, if the Senate itself is sitting. I make it clear that I will be opposing the Senate sitting next Tuesday night for a whole range of reasons but not least because we have a whole year in which to consider important pieces of legislation.
I am well aware that the government wants to get through most of its legislative slate for this year in the first half of the year in an extraordinary effort to utilise Senator Harradine and Senator Colston, the Independent senators, to get legislation through which it will not be able to get through after 1 July when the new Senate numbers are here—the Senate that was voted for by the people of Australia in October last year. This item is extraordinary because I believe it is part of the game play going on outside of this chamber to foster legislation, such as the sale of 
 Telstra and GST legislation, through the Senate courtesy of Senators Harradine and/or Colston.
The Senate has heard my view on the accelerated treatment being given to the establishment of the Committee on Information Technologies which is looking at how to prevent pornography on the Internet, pornography in cyberspace. I have no worry about that happening, but I am acutely aware of the fact that, after six months of nothing happening, the committee was suddenly established a week or two ago and that the whole process is now being truncated to give a result to the wish of Senator Alston and the government to hastily bring in regulations censoring the Internet by 11 May—budget day.
What an extraordinary situation. For six months nothing happens and then everything has to happen within a couple of weeks. We have the establishment of the committee and the hearings. We see from motions now on the Notice Paper, and foreshadowed, the dealing with the legislation itself by this committee. Here we have a motion to ensure that whatever happens, if the Senate does move to have a sitting next Tuesday night, that cannot get in the way of this either, that the committee's hearings will proceed to give a result by budget day. We are going to get, on the day of the budget, the delivery to Senator Harradine of his wish that there be censorship of the Internet.
All of us are concerned about material on the Internet. I have a particular concern about violence. I note that the Eros Foundation, and one can take or leave their figures, did a public survey which found that the majority of Australians are more concerned about violence than sexually explicit material in cyberspace. In fact, the figures, as I understand them, are that 50 per cent of Australians would first ban violent films; 32 per cent would first ban racist material; and 12 per cent would first ban sexually explicit material. I think that is probably a fair reflection of what the public thinks. But it is not a reflection, I submit, of what Senator Harradine thinks or Senator Alston thinks.
We also know, no matter what this committee comes up with, that the ability to censor 
 explicit material on the Internet deriving from Australia is not going to knock out the ability to censor material coming from overseas, and that is where 90 per cent or so of it is coming from. It is going to be an ineffective instrument. If there are legitimate reasons for such a move, then this committee should be looking at them—but not now.
This is purely political pay-off. This is about what the Independents are getting for considering the sale of more of Telstra and/or the passage of the GST. This Senate is being asked to be party to that process without being informed. If we are going to be part of the process of paying off Senator Harradine, then let the government tell us what the process at hand is. Let the government say, `Yes, this is the negotiating process as we see it.' Explicit or inherent, let the government say, `This is what is going on here. We are concerned about the GST. We feel that it would cushion the process of the GST through this chamber if we were able to offer other things to the Independents.'
 Whether one of them is this legislation and this committee's establishment, let it not be inherent, let it not be inferred—let the government be direct about it, let the Independents be direct about it. On the face of it, we are in the process of establishing a committee to rush through a wish by the Independents, who will be less powerful after 1 July, to effect what Australians can see or cannot see on the Internet. I stress again: it is valid that this chamber look at such things. What is not valid is that the agenda of this chamber be altered to give effect to a negotiating process outside this chamber which has nothing to do with this legislation but which has to do with the government's wish to get through the GST and/or the sale of Telstra.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the government has circulated a list of what it calls `high priority' bills to be dealt with by this chamber prior to 30 June—the great date when the new senators come in here and the Democrats take the balance of power, which, as far as the government is concerned, is currently held by the Independents. It is an extraordinary list. There are little  asterisks next to the list of high priority bills 
 and the list under it of bills that will be dealt with, `time permitting', by 30 June. The government lists 27 pieces of legislation it would like to see through by 30 June. At the bottom of the page, it says:
This list does not indicate the order of priority.
But I can tell you it is very close to what the government's priorities are. When you look at this list of 27 bills, the ANTS package of bills come first, the sale of Telstra comes second, and then third is the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 —so the anti-porn legislation is No. 3 on this list. What is below it? What has been shuffled out of the way to make way for this priority legislation for Senator Harradine, if that is the case? And the government can tell us whether or not it is the case. There is the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill—potentially for people coming from Albania. There are the appropriation bills, the Wool International Privatisation Bill and the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill. There is legislation to do with radically altering—in my submission, for the worst—the environment laws of this country. There is the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill. There is legislation on telecommunications and superannuation—so that people will have a choice of superannuation funds, a choice that is currently not available. There is new workplace relations legislation: that comes in way down at about No. 10.
There is other legislation on taxes, quarantine, the destruction of forests, corporate law, customs and Aboriginal issues as well as on textiles, clothing and footwear matters and higher education. They have all been moved down the list so that a hastily concocted committee can deal with pornography on the Internet, although the government did not move in the first six months of this term of office to do anything about it at all.
It is patently obvious what is going on here. I do not want to be party to it. I believe the Senate should order its priorities according to what is important and not according to what is going on in negotiations either in the Prime Minister's suite or in the suites of the Inde 
 pendents. I do not think that we should be a party to having our priorities set without the government being explicit itself about what is happening in those negotiations. It is a matter of extraordinary importance to the public. I would agree with Senator Harradine that pornography or violence or racism on the Internet are important issues we should be dealing with, but I can tell you this: there are many Australians who are more concerned about the effect of the tax package on their lives and about the sale of Telstra and what that might do to people in regional areas or to low income earners who are not in the CBD—there are a whole host of other issues, as I have just listed.
I know the government might get up and attack on this and say that it is not so, but give us an explanation, please, as to why a sudden priority has been set now—at this time when the government is engaged in massive negotiations with the Independents, who very often cannot be in here because they are so busy. I respect that—people often are not in here because they are busy. But it has been obvious to me, watching events here in the last week or two, that the Independents are distracted by their heavy burden. Senator Harradine will not cavil at this, as he sees it is on his shoulders to make sure he gets right whatever arrangement he and the government come up with on the GST and the tax package. So it is a very disturbing situation. It is a case of trying to find out what is being traded here but, above all, in my books it is a case of the Senate not having its program changed and important matters being dropped down the list to make way for a negotiating process which might suit the Indpendents but which is not giving priority to the real needs of this nation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Meeting</title>,Committees,24,2
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-04-22,"—I was not intending to speak on this matter that Senator Brown has referred to, but I believe this morning he would not give leave for this particular committee, the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies, to sit on Tuesday night. He has already referred to the fact that there is a heavy load on senators and that there are a lot of committees in this place. This is a committee of the 
 Senate, and I take exception to some of the accusations made about the motives of it. I am a member of this committee and I certainly take exception to some of the motives that were imputed to it.
We had a meeting of the members of the committee this afternoon, as a matter of fact. It was to discuss our future program to bring to an end the particular inquiry into online services. For Senator Brown to say that what this committee is trying to do is not important—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, what we are looking at is the terrific problem, the huge problem, of pornographic material being peddled on the Internet that all our children, other people's children, young people and school-age children around this country are having foisted upon them.
We have already had evidence that 60 per cent of the material on the Internet is pornographic—paedophilia, you name it; it is all there. If we as a government or as a country cannot do something to stop the invasion of this disgraceful material, to stop it being foisted upon our young people, then what are we doing here? It is all very well for Senator Brown to get up here and say that we are wasting our time on this committee.
—I never said that, and you know it.
—I can tell you: we went down to Melbourne for two days and put up with your circus on the Regional Forest Agreement. You brought all your ferals out of the woods, and they came and made a hell of a mess around the place. They put graffiti all over Parliament House; they attacked the police and the police had to come and keep them away—all orchestrated by you. That is your agenda. But when someone else wants to do something good for the country, all you can do is sit there and complain about it.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Calvert has misrepresented me and he knows that. I seek the opportunity to put the record straight.
—There is no point of order.
—So Senator Brown is saying that he had nothing to do with the demonstrations that were held in Melbourne when we were listening to evidence on the Regional Forest Agreement and that he was not talking to people outside who came in and started blowing whistles and the like during the public hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. He says he has no knowledge of that. Fair enough; he says that, but I can tell you that it did not go unnoticed by the members of the committee who were there. I think Senator Woodley was there on that particular day.
So I am saying that everybody has their own preferences, but do not start throwing stones at other members of this Senate who are trying to do what they believe is the right thing for the young people who are being corrupted by this sort of material. This particular committee has been in existence for quite some time, and we have to finish what we have to do. Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Lundy and others are members of that committee, and Senator Quirke was a member of the committee prior to the last election. He would know very well about some of the evidence that we heard, not just about pornographic material on the Internet but also about some of the standards of material that we have to listen to on the radio and the disgraceful stuff that is being pedalled to our young children around this country. If we cannot have a look at this on behalf of the Senate and the government there is something wrong. All we are asking for is leave for the committee to get on with its work on Tuesday night while the Senate is sitting, and we hope to complete it as soon as we possibly can. I cannot believe that another senator, who obviously has other agendas, would object to that happening.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Meeting</title>,Committees,24,2
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-04-22,"—The opposition supports the motion, and perhaps I should explain why. The points that Senator Brown indicates are his reasons for opposing it—
—No. On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have not opposed this motion; I have simply spoken to it. 
—Can I just indicate that this is a committee meeting which, I understand, was organised long before there was a notice of motion given by the government to extend the sitting hours for next Tuesday night. The opposition, like Senator Brown, is concerned about the extension of those sitting hours, and tomorrow we will get an opportunity to explain why we are concerned about the extension of the sitting hours. However, witnesses have been called and they do have to make travel arrangements. It is my understanding that the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which is based in Sydney, has to make the necessary travel arrangements. It is a public holiday in Sydney on Monday—unlike Melbourne of course, where there is no public holiday thanks to Mr Jeff Kennett's retrogressive attitudes and the appalling approach he has taken to the question of Anzac Day—and of course we have a public holiday here in Canberra on Monday.
I think it is reasonable to give witnesses before this inquiry an opportunity to make travel arrangements with some certainty as to their likelihood of appearing before the committee. As to the other matters that go to the arrangements with other senators in this place, I have no doubt that the government is very busy seeking the support of senators for its legislative programs, which are highly controversial, and no doubt we will get an opportunity, I trust, to examine the arrangements that may well have been made. We will do all that we can to explore that relationship, should it be demonstrated that the government has in fact entered into arrangements to secure the support of senators for the GST or for the privatisation of Telstra. As to the sitting hours question itself, we do not believe that is a reason in itself to reject the proposition that there be authorisation given for this committee to meet.
The government has an opportunity tomorrow morning to express why it believes it needs the extra sitting hours. We will take our chances on that basis. I trust that there will be a majority of senators who will not agree with the government. We have made propositions to the government with regard to a compromise on that matter, and to this point they 
 have been rejected. We think that the issue of the inquiry itself does warrant close examination. It may well be that the minister's attempt to secure the various means of introducing new forms of censorship will be demonstrated to be totally inadequate, totally inept and totally impracticable. It may in fact lead to considerable damage to this country. These are all matters that may well be demonstrated through the committee process. I trust that the committee will examine these issues in some detail.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1999-04-22,"—Tonight I want to raise a very serious and disturbing issue. I thank my National Party colleague Senator O'Chee for allowing me to take his place in the adjournment debate. The issue concerns an insidious social contagion that has already spread across several states. It is bringing about derision, isolation, erosion and, ultimately, destruction to hundreds of families.
For the individuals concerned who are unfortunate enough to have fallen prey in their search for belonging, life becomes one of deprivation, control and total dependency. Imagine a four-year-old boy who has eaten nothing in his life but lambs brain and ox tongue and who can drink only unfiltered tap water and soy sauce. Imagine tommy rough boiled six times a day every day for eight weeks or liver steamed and eaten hourly for days on end. Imagine succumbing to the belief that not adhering to this bizarre regime results in horrid retribution and that if one's husband or wife does not engage in the same bizarre ritual divorce is advised.
It has been brought to my attention that 450 people, which means more than 400 families, including young children and babies, in South Australia alone have fallen victim to these practices. They can only be described as the workings of a cult. The Vibrational Individuation Program is a personality cult operated by Joan Phillips of Inglewood and Marie Steinke of Upper Sturt in South Australia. The program is based on the use and control of food to followers of the cult. Members consult either Joan Phillips or Marie Steinke to undergo what is known as a food test, which determines what foods the recipient should eat for a designated period.
A person undergoing the food test lies on a couch while the therapist observes the response of the wrist and surrounding muscles 
 as she reads through a checklist of food items. Depending on the response, the therapist determines which foods are to be eaten exclusively, how they are to be cooked or prepared, the quantity to be eaten, how often and for how long. Usually five to six foods and one beverage are prescribed for the whole of the designated period of some two to 11 weeks. Offal always features as one of the required foods. The person is to rigidly adhere to these instructions until the next food test. The body is asked when the next food test should be and, depending on the locking nature of the wrist, a date is set.
Despite each client being assigned their own individual program, it seems there are foods that are in vogue at the time for all the clients. For a while, everyone may be assigned brains and tonic water. Another time, it may be corn chips and another time a brand of sardines. After the food requirements are sorted out, the person is `invited to ask the body any other questions you like'. Again, depending on the muscle response, an answer is given.
As the person gets more involved in the program, every time they want to do something—anything—the body must be asked if it is okay. Every facet of the person's life is controlled by how the body's muscles respond to the question and, in turn, how that response is interpreted by Joan Phillips or Marie Stienke. Followers have been known to be issued with instructions as bizarre as wearing only pink or white underwear, or not wearing black jocks. Another was told to move to Perth from Adelaide and promptly did so.
The person ends up entirely dependent on these two women, who are the only ones who have `the knowledge' to perform the food muscle test. Followers are charged between $30 and $60 for each food test and approximately 10 to 15 of these tests or programs may be required each year. Based on this information, one could estimate an income for this group of some $20,000 to $25,000 a month.
This cult has been very cleverly concealed for 10 years in a seemingly innocent facade called a Food Program. You cannot find it in the phone book. Nor will you learn about it 
 at your local health food store. In fact, you cannot find it at all. It finds you. And then the brainwashing begins. Followers are indoctrinated into believing that by not abiding by their individual food program, disease will enter their body. When signs of physiological breakdown begin to show, followers are programmed into believing it is for their ultimate good and to ignore all symptoms. In fact, when a follower in obvious distress calls the Food Program help line, a recorded message immediately lulls them into dangerous submission.
As is usual of cult practice, pregnant women are the prime target. Programming the foetus ensures a compliant follower. The cult promotes an anti-medical philosophy, which includes refusing ultrasound testing, refusing immunisation, refusing Guthrie and Agar testing, refusing vitamin K injections at birth, refusing added iron or other mineral supplements to mothers or children and refusing baby health checks. Children born into this cult are fed the most bizarre food from birth and reports have come to my attention of undernourished, underweight babies. In addition to malnourishment, children miss out on vital socialisation which is so necessary to their overall development. In the words of a person who managed to defy the cult:
Children can't have birthday parties, can't go to a friend's house for tea or have a sleep over . . . in case the host parents feed the child something normal.
You can't go to restaurants, have a coffee, go to barbecues—the whole thing is so isolating—social life becomes totally non existent with a total reliance on others on the program for support and interaction.
You can't give blood, you can't see the dentist without asking and then sometimes the body will say you can—you must ask first before seeing a doctor and it is usually no.
But the control does not end there. The cult advocates the breaking up of families should a follower's spouse resist the Food Program. They even operate at least one known `community respite house' in the Adelaide metropolitan area. This house is used for members who have been advised by the food test to leave their partners, and as a hidden residence to house them and their children for 
 indefinite periods. Outsiders have no access to these respite houses; nor do the spouses. The cult then advises the separating parent to deny children access to the noncompliant partner for fear of the children discovering foods other than the dictates of the Food Program.
The cult does not promote or advertise in any way and only accepts people into its group by word of mouth and after initial `balancing' consultations. Publications of this cult are restricted to members or followers only. Effective from January 1999, all Vibration Individuation Program participants are now required to install fax machines to be in constant contact with the two operating therapists.
There is new evidence to suggest that the cult has spread outside of South Australia. My research indicates there are now followers in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. With an estimated 450 members and the application of pyramid marketing techniques, proliferation is certain if this group remains unchecked. It is of particularly grave concern that these cult protagonists pose as health practitioners and health therapists, offering their program as a healing modality. This has potentially fatal consequences, as evidenced by an individual who was advised by Joan Phillips that a melanoma class 4 skin cancer—which I understand is the second-highest degree of melanoma—need not be removed.
In reality, this group is obviously headed by delusional megalomaniacs whose philosophies run contrary to our social and family structure. Followers of this Food Program are indeed victims, snared in moments of mental weakness and vulnerability, trapped in a cycle of fear and dependency, totally reliant on their cult leaders and the group. Some followers have given as long as 10 years of their life to the cult. Others, not as severely indoctrinated, have sacrificed two or three years and hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars before breaking free.
It is for these reasons that I am forwarding information about the Vibrational Individuation Program, its operations and its members to the federal Attorney-General and the 
 federal ministers responsible for health and family services, to investigate whether any breaches of Commonwealth statutes have been committed by the group, and to all state and territory attorneys-general and health and family services ministers, to investigate possible breaches of provisions in the state medical practitioners acts, and/or child protection acts, based on the fact that Joan Phillips and Marie Stienke are clearly giving medical advice, for a fee.
I am sure all senators would agree with me when I say that children who are subjected to this type of parental abduction and are harboured inside this cult are at serious risk of physical, emotional and psychological abuse and that this behaviour should not be tolerated by a properly functioning family oriented society.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Vibrational Individuation Program</title>,Adjournment,26,1
