Dear Senator O’Brien
I write to seek the agreement of the Selection of Bills Committee to refer the Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007 to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry.
The Bill was introduced to the Senate in September last year.
Alcohol is a major problem - it kills three times more Australians than all illicit drugs combined. Family First wants to address our alcohol toll to help change our binge drinking culture to a healthy drinking culture.
Family First’s Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007 will:
Require health information labels on all alcohol products;
Require all alcohol ads to be pre-approved by a government body rather than a body rum by the alcohol industry;
Restrict TV and radio alcohol advertising to after 9pm and before 5am to stop alcohol being marketed to young people;
Ban alcohol ads which are aimed at children or which link drinking to personal, business, social, sporting, sexual or other success.
The inquiry could seek submissions and expert testimony from:
Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation
Australian Drug Foundation
Arbias Ltd - Acquired Brain Injury Assessment and Consulting
Dr Alex Wodak, St Vincent’s Hospital
Professor Sandra Jones, University of Wollongong
Australian Medical Association
National Health and Medical Research Council
Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia
Australian Hotels Association
Hearings could be held in the week of 3 March and the Committee could report back to the Senate by Thursday, 20 March.
I would appreciate the Committee’s support to refer the Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007 for an inquiry so that the Senate can examine how best to address the serious problem of binge drinking in Australia.
Yours sincerely
Senator Sieve Fielding

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I move the following amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee for inquiry and report by 17 March 2008”.
What we have here is a government that wants to ensure that AWAs end today by ensuring that the committee reports back to this place by 17 March; then the report will be available for debate in the March sitting period. Almost three months ago the Australian people voted for change. They did not vote for the coalition; they voted for a change. In doing so, they voted for a change in our workplace relations laws. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 delivers our key election commitment to the Australian people to change the workplace relations laws—the unfair laws that those opposite imposed on the Australian people which ripped away their conditions, took away the safety net and ensured they would suffer under the workplace relations laws.
We believe in a system which ensures that there is no place for AWAs, a system which has fairness at its heart. What the opposition believe in is a system that ensures that this unfairness and the rort under AWAs will continue. Up to the election you argued furiously for your workplace relations changes but you did not win the election. We have a clear mandate to ensure that AWAs end. This debate had an end point, and the end point was at the election. The passage of the AWA transitional amendment bill will ensure that it finishes in the March sitting. It finishes today.
We believe the opposition, particularly the opposition spokesperson on workplace relations, are now trying to pretend that none of this happened—that there was no election and that they did not lose it. Of course they did not win the election. What they are now saying is, ‘We will continue to have AWAs until such time as we think they should end.’ The Australian people have already spoken and have indicated that they should now end. What they are now saying is that they want a committee to continue on right up until 28 April and beyond so that employers can continue to enter into AWAs unfairly and hurt Australian people. They have clearly not heard the message from the Australian people in respect of this.
On the substantive matter, when you were in government you did not provide sufficient time for committees. You pushed through many bills by having short committee hearings: welfare to work, the IR legislation itself and the sale of Telstra. Again and again you put matters through committees but gave very little time to look at them. In this instance there is more than a month to deal with this substantive matter. It is not a complex matter; you will be able to deal with it in that time. I am sure you will also be able to listen to the employers and to the Australian people and hear that the matter of AWAs has now been dealt with. We will be able to get on with business in this Senate without your unduly delaying it and ensuring that AWAs continue to stay alive, because that is effectively what you are doing.
This government campaigned on the promise that we would take Australia forward with fairness without Australian workplace agreements. That was our promise to the Australian people and we will continue to ensure that that promise is realised in this place. We know your track record. It is a disgraceful track record. It is a track record that is mired and quagmired in AWAs and unfairness. It ensures that people will hurt under your AWAs. Be very clear about this: what you are now doing is ensuring that AWAs will continue; employers will be able to continue to enter into unfair AWAs past the time this bill could be debated in March and finalised. Every day after that you are going to ensure that it will continue. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-14,"—The government is clearly embarrassed by this, because two days ago we gave a notice of reference of this very important issue to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and the government was caught sleeping at the wheel, because it did not even think of that. It knows that important legislation goes to a Senate committee, and that has been the practice for years. When it saw the notice of motion brought by the opposition it suddenly thought, ‘We’d better get on this bandwagon,’ and yesterday it rushed in a late reference to the Selection of Bills Committee with, initially, a reporting date of early March until pressure was put on them and the government then said 12 March. This was one of the most important issues in the election last year. There is no doubt that workplace relations was front and centre in the election held just a few months ago. This government was only going to give a few weeks for the review of that legislation.
What we propose is that the reporting date be 28 April. That is the alternative motion that we have put up. But to try and meet the government and accommodate its desire to move legislation along, we are suggesting that we could bring that forward to mid-April and have the Senate sit for the week commencing 5 May, before the budget, to consider that legislation and report. We have heard about the Prime Minister saying, ‘We’re back at work and we’re going to have Friday sittings in the other place.’ Let us see if he is going to put his money where his mouth is. Let us see if this bloke can really work, because I can tell you that we are willing to work. We are willing to bring back the Senate. The Senate has the lightest sitting pattern in the first half of this year that I have ever seen. I can tell you right now: it is a disgrace, because the government is scared. It is scared of Senate scrutiny.
What we are proposing is that this bill go to a Senate committee. We will bring forward the reporting date to accommodate the government but, importantly, we will set aside an extra week of sitting so that the Senate can consider that report and the legislation, and we will do it before the budget so that the government can get on to the important job of the budget. We recognise that. But let us have another sitting week beforehand. The government is refusing this. It is scared of work and it is lazy. I say to the people of Australia: you have a government here which will not front up to the parliament. It is lazy, it is scared of extra sitting days and it is scared of scrutiny of one of the most important issues that Australians looked at in the election. We believe that an issue such as this should be given close attention over a period of time to enable all those interested to put forward a submission to the Senate committee. There is nothing more reasonable than that. We are willing to bring that reporting date forward and we are willing to sit an extra week to consider that.
This government is scared. It is lazy and scared. It does not want an extra week and does not want extra Senate scrutiny. We have a Prime Minister who is trying to fool people by saying: ‘Yes, we are hardworking. We are going to have extra sitting days.’ Yet in the Senate we have fewer sitting days, and we are saying, ‘Let’s bring the Senate back earlier.’ After an extensive period of some seven weeks of recess over April, we can set aside an extra week to give this due consideration. During that recess we can have the time to examine one of the most important issues this nation considered in the recent election. What do we get from this government? We get a complete refusal—a refusal which is arrogant and which absolutely flies in the face of its responsibility to give the people of this nation a chance to look at one of the most important issues that we faced in the last election.
It is simple: we are willing to put in the hours. We are willing to bring back the Senate earlier. We are willing to bring on the reporting date earlier. What we are not willing to do is to give to this government what it seeks, and that is a couple of weeks review in the normal sitting period so it gets jammed into the normal legislative agenda. We realise that this is an important issue.

Senator Ronaldson interjecting—

—As Senator Ronaldson says, what are they scared of? Why are they so scared of this scrutiny? Why are they scared of sitting an extra week? Can’t they take the hours? This is what we are all about. Obviously the Prime Minister has not got the mettle to put in those hard yards. I say to those listening and the people of Australia: this is the first sign of a government that is not up to the task and one that not only is not capable of doing the job; it is not willing to even try to do the job.

",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—There is a bit of a competition in hypocrisy going on in the chamber at the moment, I would have to say.
—You should sit down, then!
—I appreciate, Senator Macdonald, that there is no way I could win that particular competition. So you can have it hands down—there is no doubt about it. We have had the coalition here suddenly saying, ‘Yes, we need proper time to look at this legislation,’ when everybody in this chamber and in the wider community knows, because it is part of the reason you got thrown out, that you debauched the Senate committee process as comprehensively as possible by preventing proper scrutiny of legislation and by railroading through bill after bill, including the massive changes of Work Choices itself. These were huge, revolutionary reforms bulldozed through without adequate scrutiny.
The Democrats complained at the time that there was inadequate time. We always agree with the principle that there needs to be adequate time for examining legislation. It is concerning that the Labor government, in the very first piece of legislation it puts forward, wants to try and push it through very quickly. It is also ironic that, having complained all of last year about the then government using the Selection of Bills Committee process to refer their own bills to committee to try to use that to push them through as quickly as possible, the Labor government then start off straightaway by also using the Selection of Bills Committee process to refer their own bills to committee when there is already a motion on the table.
Having said that, the government has now put forward a reporting date of 17 March—I think that is what I heard Senator Ludwig say—and that does provide slightly more than a month for the committee inquiry. That is hitting about the minimum acceptable level. I draw the Senate’s attention to the answer from the Department of the Senate to a question on notice in estimates in February last year that my colleague Senator Murray put forward seeking an outline of a reasonable minimum time for a committee inquiry on a bill. It detailed a time line of about 28 days. So this does go slightly above that. This is an important issue. It is not about the whole of Work Choices; it is just one part. We know that all of the argy-bargy about Work Choices and AWAs has been a key political point-scoring exercise and a key political football over the last 12 months or longer. We here in the Senate now should not just be about continuing the political point-scoring; with this particular matter before us now we are considering what the law will be. It is one thing to look at the point-scoring opportunities for vote winning leading up to an election, and that is all part of the political process; it is another to make sure that you get the law right and look at what the actual impact will be beyond the political impact for the main parties. That is part of what we are doing and that is why we have to do this properly.
Having spoken yesterday in this place to the motion about sitting days—and, I might say, I was the only person who spoke to that motion—I am pleased to now hear the coalition joining with the Democrats in expressing concern about the inadequate number of sitting days. I wish they had shared my concerns last year and the year before that when I expressed concern about the inadequate and historically low number of sitting days that the then coalition government inflicted upon the Senate. I wish they had supported my motions to create extra sitting weeks. Of course now that they are in opposition suddenly they see that there is a problem with an inadequate number of sitting days.
I would say that you had the opportunity yesterday to amend the motion that was put forward to create that extra sitting week. I should also emphasise that it is not the government that sets the sitting days for the Senate; it is the Senate that sets the sitting days. So you can move a motion to amend the sitting days and put it through. You do not need to rely on the government to agree; you can do it—and I will support it. I spoke about that yesterday. The coalition were silent. If we were that keen on getting back into the job then we should have been sitting last week.
I put on the record yesterday how there is a historically low number of sitting days for this year, so of course we would support an extra sitting week. At least as I understand it, it does not need the government’s agreement; it is a decision of the Senate. The Senate should decide that, and we would support it. So we are left with the obvious fact that this is all about politics again. I can understand that, but let us not forget that we are actually about considering the impact of what will go into law. I would suggest that that is much more significant to the Australian people than whether or not there are some more political points to be scored on the floor of the parliament here today.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—The Greens will be supporting the motion for the reporting date of 17 March. We were very deeply concerned about the reporting date of 3 March as first proposed by the government. We thought that was an abuse of the process. We believe that the reporting date of 17 March will give us enough time to discuss the legislation that we all knew was coming and that the government did foreshadow. It is so surprising, although I guess we should not be surprised, to see that the opposition is now all of a sudden really keen on having a thorough Senate process and a thorough committee process—and there are three more proposals soon to come before us to set up committees that they want to control—when they changed the committee system in the first place so that the government could control it. Now there is a different government and all of a sudden the now opposition want to change the committee process. For 2½ years the former government systematically abused the Senate process, abused the committee process and treated this place like a sausage factory. All of sudden they are throwing their arms up in the air and saying, ‘It’s not fair. The government are abusing the process to try to push through legislation that actually does away with Work Choices.’
The government was very clear about bringing this legislation in. They went to the people with it. The opposition said, ‘Yeah, Work Choices is dead,’ but it seems like it is in name only. They’re just going to create another name for it. The same people who dreamed up Work Choices are still there and still pushing it. It is clear that Work Choices is not dead; they are just going to use another name for it. This is not about a proper Senate process; this is about the opposition not wanting to see AWAs go. They want to see them there as long as possible. If you were genuine about using the Senate process then why did you refer this in the way that you did? Why not use the selection of bills process that you were so keen on last time? This is just about frustrating the government’s AWA process and reform of IR. The Australian community will be in no doubt about what the opposition is trying to achieve—that is, to frustrate the reform process. That is what this is about. It is not about all of a sudden having a road to Damascus experience about how important committee review is.
The Northern Territory intervention was supposedly at the time the most significant government package on Aboriginal reform ever seen in Australia. There was a one-day Senate hearing. The then government did not even call the authors of the report which supposedly kicked it off in the first place. That is how serious the then government—the now opposition—was about using the committee process and having fair review of legislation. What a joke that only a couple of months down the track they are back in this place all of a sudden championing the committee process. Get real. Everybody can see through this, and the Australian public will see through it. All you are trying to do is stop the AWA reform process. All the opposition are currently trying to do is to stop the review and reform of the IR process. Everybody can see through that. The Greens will be supporting the amendment as proposed by the government to have a review and to complete the committee process by 17 March. We believe that the people of Australia have been looking forward to this legislation coming in. They will be able to read about it, able to get their submissions in on time and able to appear before the committee during that process because they have been primed to the fact that this is happening. We do not normally support a review process of just one month but in this instance we think it is particularly important because we believe that the public of Australia have voted on and are keen to get rid of AWAs. That is what this legislation is about. They will have time to get their comments in and we will get time to review this legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-02-14,"—Just for the record, Family First opposed Work Choices because it went too far. Look at what is being proposed: a four-week inquiry. If the Senate is serious, it can go through this inquiry and make sure that the relevant areas are looked at and considered and make sure that people who do not have a voice, like small business and families, can have their say on it as well. Certainly at the last election there was a lot of talk about undoing Work Choices, and this bill goes in that direction. A delay until 28 April is too far out. I think a balance has been struck. The government were looking at having an even shorter time frame for the inquiry which I think was too short, but going out to 17 March would give the Senate inquiry time to look at the aspects of the legislation that is being proposed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—The chamber knows that I have been the Democrats’ workplace relations spokesperson since 1996. For nine years we had the balance of power. Of course, we were pressured constantly by the government to pass their legislation and get committee inquiries done in a short time. During the time the Senate was not in the hands of the government, committee inquiries took their proper course, reports were produced and the legislation was dealt with properly. It is my view that neither the Democrats nor the Senate should change their standards. Governments are governments and oppositions are oppositions. Governments will always argue for mandate, for short sitting times and for having their legislation rushed through, and oppositions have a duty to look at it from a Senate perspective. So I am less interested in the hypocrisy of the past, even where that exists, than I am in the standards we should apply now. I am always very disappointed when I hear those who argued previously for higher standards arguing the reverse just because it suits their particular political case at the time.
I would note with respect to sitting days that, given this is the first year of a new government—with, I assume, a great deal of legislation and new policies to be assessed and debated—both the Senate and the House each probably need to sit at least up to 100 days, or 20 to 22 weeks. I remind the Senate that the House sits for 82 days and the Senate sits for 52 days this year. The Senate sits for 21 days in the first half and 31 days in the second half of the year. Frankly, that is an absolute disgrace. Senators who belong to the Labor Party should never have allowed themselves to be railroaded by the House of Representatives, which determined these sitting times.
I would also support my colleague Senator Bartlett, who holds the view that the Senate is entitled to set the sitting days it wishes. That should normally be done cooperatively. But, frankly, the Senate cannot deal with the sort of legislative program that is before it with the number of sitting days that we have this year. We started too late in February; we have far too few sitting days in the first half of the year; the recesses are too long. It is going to be a lazy Senate and that is not the right look for a new government. I suggest that the opposition go away, decide on when it wants extra sitting weeks, put the motion to the Senate and let the Senate decide when it wants to sit and then sit accordingly to deal with the matters. I would urge the opposition to do that and, if possible, do it today and bring it on as special business.
Turning to the matter at hand: frankly, if I were the government, given the importance of the workplace to the people of Australia, I would have introduced an exposure draft in January, referred it to a committee in January and advertised for submissions in January. We could have been reporting in March and had it all done in time. Again, we are dealing with a lazy government that has come at this far too late. The issues are not that difficult. I am unimpressed, frankly, with being presented with a bill of this importance this late. Having said that, we need a minimum of 28 days for advertising, submissions, hearings and report writing, and then we need considerable time for debate and writing amendments and reports. I would suggest, based on historical circumstances, that somewhere between 28 days and 42 days is the right period for this particular bill—28 being the minimum. I certainly think the coalition is too far out with the date of 28 April, but, given the fact that you think it is unlikely that the bill would be ready for debate and the report ready by the time the last week of March sitting comes, it probably does not matter that much. However, introducing an extra week of sitting at a time other than the last week before May makes sense, frankly—I would not be disturbed by that—and of course the Senate can always give leave to those who have already fixed other engagements. I would urge the government to accept a compromise date which allows the Senate to properly consider legislation which needs to be examined carefully and reported on, as the Senate always should with legislation that matters enormously to the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-02-14,"—The timing of the report that we have proposed—28 April—is, as Senator Murray quite rightly says, a function of the government’s extraordinary lethargy with respect to sittings of the parliament. The first six months of the parliament reflect the laziness of this government and its unwillingness to face Senate scrutiny. If you have a reporting date of 17 March—which I gather the government was originally going to set as 3 March—you will effectively have only two weeks for an inquiry into this bill, and if you report on 17 March you will have just three days to debate the bill before we have a seven-week recess. I suspect that this bill is not going to get through in three days, so inevitably this bill will carry over to the budget sittings. In good faith, the opposition has said to the government: ‘We’re prepared to have a reporting date of 14 April if you, the government, will agree that the Senate will resume in the week of 5 May—that is, the week before the budget. The report can be received and debated, and the legislation can be considered in that week. We are prepared to devote as much time as you like in the week of 5 May to consider this legislation.’
The legislation is not insignificant. The bill runs to 121 pages and the explanatory memorandum runs to 98 pages. This is not idle legislation; this is significant reform of Australia’s industrial relations arrangements. And for all the rhetoric we had from Senator Ludwig about AWAs, this bill introduces the Labor version of an AWA: an individual statutory agreement called an individual transitional employment agreement. This is significant legislation. It will have significant impact on employment, on the economy and on industries all over Australia.
The Senate should properly scrutinise this legislation by conducting, right across this land, inquiries that consider this bill in detail and give everybody an opportunity to comment on significant changes to our industrial relations arrangements which, as I said, allow the Labor Party to introduce its own form of individual statutory agreement. The Senate should properly examine that—examine its impact on the inflation which the government is so concerned about. The Senate should examine its impact on employment and on our great mining industries in Senator Murray’s state of Western Australia, which are genuinely concerned about what Labor proposes to do with individual statutory agreements. It is worthy of proper examination.
Of course, governments will always try to have short inquiries. I am not going to pretend that we did not, but we are now the opposition and other non-government parties in the Senate ought to hold this government to account for the proper scrutiny of its legislation. Therefore the coalition, in good faith, have said that we are prepared to compromise. We are prepared to bring it forward. If there were more sitting weeks we could have a more relevant and probably earlier reporting date, but if the government stick to 17 March the Greens say that we have effectively two weeks only, because there is a week of estimates next week, two clear weeks and then the Senate resumes. The Greens are saying that they are prepared to join with Labor in having a two-week inquiry into, as I just said, a bill of over 100 pages and an explanatory memorandum of about 100 pages. This bill demands greater scrutiny than that, and the opposition, in good faith, offer 14 April. If that is rejected then we believe the appropriate reporting date is the 28th, allowing this bill to be considered in the budget week. As I said, our offer still stands. We are here ready, willing and able to return to this parliament on 5 May if the government wishes.

Dear Senator O’Brien
I write to seek the agreement of the Selection of Bills Committee to refer the Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007 to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry.
The Bill was introduced to the Senate in September last year.
Alcohol is a major problem - it kills three times more Australians than all illicit drugs combined. Family First wants to address our alcohol toll to help change our binge drinking culture to a healthy drinking culture.
Family First’s Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007 will:
Require health information labels on all alcohol products;
Require all alcohol ads to be pre-approved by a government body rather than a body rum by the alcohol industry;
Restrict TV and radio alcohol advertising to after 9pm and before 5am to stop alcohol being marketed to young people;
Ban alcohol ads which are aimed at children or which link drinking to personal, business, social, sporting, sexual or other success.
The inquiry could seek submissions and expert testimony from:
Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation
Australian Drug Foundation
Arbias Ltd - Acquired Brain Injury Assessment and Consulting
Dr Alex Wodak, St Vincent’s Hospital
Professor Sandra Jones, University of Wollongong
Australian Medical Association
National Health and Medical Research Council
Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia
Australian Hotels Association
Hearings could be held in the week of 3 March and the Committee could report back to the Senate by Thursday, 20 March.
I would appreciate the Committee’s support to refer the Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007 for an inquiry so that the Senate can examine how best to address the serious problem of binge drinking in Australia.
Yours sincerely

That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I move the following amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee for inquiry and report by 17 March 2008”.
What we have here is a government that wants to ensure that AWAs end today by ensuring that the committee reports back to this place by 17 March; then the report will be available for debate in the March sitting period. Almost three months ago the Australian people voted for change. They did not vote for the coalition; they voted for a change. In doing so, they voted for a change in our workplace relations laws. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 delivers our key election commitment to the Australian people to change the workplace relations laws—the unfair laws that those opposite imposed on the Australian people which ripped away their conditions, took away the safety net and ensured they would suffer under the workplace relations laws.
We believe in a system which ensures that there is no place for AWAs, a system which has fairness at its heart. What the opposition believe in is a system that ensures that this unfairness and the rort under AWAs will continue. Up to the election you argued furiously for your workplace relations changes but you did not win the election. We have a clear mandate to ensure that AWAs end. This debate had an end point, and the end point was at the election. The passage of the AWA transitional amendment bill will ensure that it finishes in the March sitting. It finishes today.
We believe the opposition, particularly the opposition spokesperson on workplace relations, are now trying to pretend that none of this happened—that there was no election and that they did not lose it. Of course they did not win the election. What they are now saying is, ‘We will continue to have AWAs until such time as we think they should end.’ The Australian people have already spoken and have indicated that they should now end. What they are now saying is that they want a committee to continue on right up until 28 April and beyond so that employers can continue to enter into AWAs unfairly and hurt Australian people. They have clearly not heard the message from the Australian people in respect of this.
On the substantive matter, when you were in government you did not provide sufficient time for committees. You pushed through many bills by having short committee hearings: welfare to work, the IR legislation itself and the sale of Telstra. Again and again you put matters through committees but gave very little time to look at them. In this instance there is more than a month to deal with this substantive matter. It is not a complex matter; you will be able to deal with it in that time. I am sure you will also be able to listen to the employers and to the Australian people and hear that the matter of AWAs has now been dealt with. We will be able to get on with business in this Senate without your unduly delaying it and ensuring that AWAs continue to stay alive, because that is effectively what you are doing.
This government campaigned on the promise that we would take Australia forward with fairness without Australian workplace agreements. That was our promise to the Australian people and we will continue to ensure that that promise is realised in this place. We know your track record. It is a disgraceful track record. It is a track record that is mired and quagmired in AWAs and unfairness. It ensures that people will hurt under your AWAs. Be very clear about this: what you are now doing is ensuring that AWAs will continue; employers will be able to continue to enter into unfair AWAs past the time this bill could be debated in March and finalised. Every day after that you are going to ensure that it will continue. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-14,"—The government is clearly embarrassed by this, because two days ago we gave a notice of reference of this very important issue to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and the government was caught sleeping at the wheel, because it did not even think of that. It knows that important legislation goes to a Senate committee, and that has been the practice for years. When it saw the notice of motion brought by the opposition it suddenly thought, ‘We’d better get on this bandwagon,’ and yesterday it rushed in a late reference to the Selection of Bills Committee with, initially, a reporting date of early March until pressure was put on them and the government then said 12 March. This was one of the most important issues in the election last year. There is no doubt that workplace relations was front and centre in the election held just a few months ago. This government was only going to give a few weeks for the review of that legislation.
What we propose is that the reporting date be 28 April. That is the alternative motion that we have put up. But to try and meet the government and accommodate its desire to move legislation along, we are suggesting that we could bring that forward to mid-April and have the Senate sit for the week commencing 5 May, before the budget, to consider that legislation and report. We have heard about the Prime Minister saying, ‘We’re back at work and we’re going to have Friday sittings in the other place.’ Let us see if he is going to put his money where his mouth is. Let us see if this bloke can really work, because I can tell you that we are willing to work. We are willing to bring back the Senate. The Senate has the lightest sitting pattern in the first half of this year that I have ever seen. I can tell you right now: it is a disgrace, because the government is scared. It is scared of Senate scrutiny.
What we are proposing is that this bill go to a Senate committee. We will bring forward the reporting date to accommodate the government but, importantly, we will set aside an extra week of sitting so that the Senate can consider that report and the legislation, and we will do it before the budget so that the government can get on to the important job of the budget. We recognise that. But let us have another sitting week beforehand. The government is refusing this. It is scared of work and it is lazy. I say to the people of Australia: you have a government here which will not front up to the parliament. It is lazy, it is scared of extra sitting days and it is scared of scrutiny of one of the most important issues that Australians looked at in the election. We believe that an issue such as this should be given close attention over a period of time to enable all those interested to put forward a submission to the Senate committee. There is nothing more reasonable than that. We are willing to bring that reporting date forward and we are willing to sit an extra week to consider that.
This government is scared. It is lazy and scared. It does not want an extra week and does not want extra Senate scrutiny. We have a Prime Minister who is trying to fool people by saying: ‘Yes, we are hardworking. We are going to have extra sitting days.’ Yet in the Senate we have fewer sitting days, and we are saying, ‘Let’s bring the Senate back earlier.’ After an extensive period of some seven weeks of recess over April, we can set aside an extra week to give this due consideration. During that recess we can have the time to examine one of the most important issues this nation considered in the recent election. What do we get from this government? We get a complete refusal—a refusal which is arrogant and which absolutely flies in the face of its responsibility to give the people of this nation a chance to look at one of the most important issues that we faced in the last election.
It is simple: we are willing to put in the hours. We are willing to bring back the Senate earlier. We are willing to bring on the reporting date earlier. What we are not willing to do is to give to this government what it seeks, and that is a couple of weeks review in the normal sitting period so it gets jammed into the normal legislative agenda. We realise that this is an important issue.

Senator Ronaldson interjecting—

—As Senator Ronaldson says, what are they scared of? Why are they so scared of this scrutiny? Why are they scared of sitting an extra week? Can’t they take the hours? This is what we are all about. Obviously the Prime Minister has not got the mettle to put in those hard yards. I say to those listening and the people of Australia: this is the first sign of a government that is not up to the task and one that not only is not capable of doing the job; it is not willing to even try to do the job.

",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—There is a bit of a competition in hypocrisy going on in the chamber at the moment, I would have to say.
—You should sit down, then!
—I appreciate, Senator Macdonald, that there is no way I could win that particular competition. So you can have it hands down—there is no doubt about it. We have had the coalition here suddenly saying, ‘Yes, we need proper time to look at this legislation,’ when everybody in this chamber and in the wider community knows, because it is part of the reason you got thrown out, that you debauched the Senate committee process as comprehensively as possible by preventing proper scrutiny of legislation and by railroading through bill after bill, including the massive changes of Work Choices itself. These were huge, revolutionary reforms bulldozed through without adequate scrutiny.
The Democrats complained at the time that there was inadequate time. We always agree with the principle that there needs to be adequate time for examining legislation. It is concerning that the Labor government, in the very first piece of legislation it puts forward, wants to try and push it through very quickly. It is also ironic that, having complained all of last year about the then government using the Selection of Bills Committee process to refer their own bills to committee to try to use that to push them through as quickly as possible, the Labor government then start off straightaway by also using the Selection of Bills Committee process to refer their own bills to committee when there is already a motion on the table.
Having said that, the government has now put forward a reporting date of 17 March—I think that is what I heard Senator Ludwig say—and that does provide slightly more than a month for the committee inquiry. That is hitting about the minimum acceptable level. I draw the Senate’s attention to the answer from the Department of the Senate to a question on notice in estimates in February last year that my colleague Senator Murray put forward seeking an outline of a reasonable minimum time for a committee inquiry on a bill. It detailed a time line of about 28 days. So this does go slightly above that. This is an important issue. It is not about the whole of Work Choices; it is just one part. We know that all of the argy-bargy about Work Choices and AWAs has been a key political point-scoring exercise and a key political football over the last 12 months or longer. We here in the Senate now should not just be about continuing the political point-scoring; with this particular matter before us now we are considering what the law will be. It is one thing to look at the point-scoring opportunities for vote winning leading up to an election, and that is all part of the political process; it is another to make sure that you get the law right and look at what the actual impact will be beyond the political impact for the main parties. That is part of what we are doing and that is why we have to do this properly.
Having spoken yesterday in this place to the motion about sitting days—and, I might say, I was the only person who spoke to that motion—I am pleased to now hear the coalition joining with the Democrats in expressing concern about the inadequate number of sitting days. I wish they had shared my concerns last year and the year before that when I expressed concern about the inadequate and historically low number of sitting days that the then coalition government inflicted upon the Senate. I wish they had supported my motions to create extra sitting weeks. Of course now that they are in opposition suddenly they see that there is a problem with an inadequate number of sitting days.
I would say that you had the opportunity yesterday to amend the motion that was put forward to create that extra sitting week. I should also emphasise that it is not the government that sets the sitting days for the Senate; it is the Senate that sets the sitting days. So you can move a motion to amend the sitting days and put it through. You do not need to rely on the government to agree; you can do it—and I will support it. I spoke about that yesterday. The coalition were silent. If we were that keen on getting back into the job then we should have been sitting last week.
I put on the record yesterday how there is a historically low number of sitting days for this year, so of course we would support an extra sitting week. At least as I understand it, it does not need the government’s agreement; it is a decision of the Senate. The Senate should decide that, and we would support it. So we are left with the obvious fact that this is all about politics again. I can understand that, but let us not forget that we are actually about considering the impact of what will go into law. I would suggest that that is much more significant to the Australian people than whether or not there are some more political points to be scored on the floor of the parliament here today.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—The Greens will be supporting the motion for the reporting date of 17 March. We were very deeply concerned about the reporting date of 3 March as first proposed by the government. We thought that was an abuse of the process. We believe that the reporting date of 17 March will give us enough time to discuss the legislation that we all knew was coming and that the government did foreshadow. It is so surprising, although I guess we should not be surprised, to see that the opposition is now all of a sudden really keen on having a thorough Senate process and a thorough committee process—and there are three more proposals soon to come before us to set up committees that they want to control—when they changed the committee system in the first place so that the government could control it. Now there is a different government and all of a sudden the now opposition want to change the committee process. For 2½ years the former government systematically abused the Senate process, abused the committee process and treated this place like a sausage factory. All of sudden they are throwing their arms up in the air and saying, ‘It’s not fair. The government are abusing the process to try to push through legislation that actually does away with Work Choices.’
The government was very clear about bringing this legislation in. They went to the people with it. The opposition said, ‘Yeah, Work Choices is dead,’ but it seems like it is in name only. They’re just going to create another name for it. The same people who dreamed up Work Choices are still there and still pushing it. It is clear that Work Choices is not dead; they are just going to use another name for it. This is not about a proper Senate process; this is about the opposition not wanting to see AWAs go. They want to see them there as long as possible. If you were genuine about using the Senate process then why did you refer this in the way that you did? Why not use the selection of bills process that you were so keen on last time? This is just about frustrating the government’s AWA process and reform of IR. The Australian community will be in no doubt about what the opposition is trying to achieve—that is, to frustrate the reform process. That is what this is about. It is not about all of a sudden having a road to Damascus experience about how important committee review is.
The Northern Territory intervention was supposedly at the time the most significant government package on Aboriginal reform ever seen in Australia. There was a one-day Senate hearing. The then government did not even call the authors of the report which supposedly kicked it off in the first place. That is how serious the then government—the now opposition—was about using the committee process and having fair review of legislation. What a joke that only a couple of months down the track they are back in this place all of a sudden championing the committee process. Get real. Everybody can see through this, and the Australian public will see through it. All you are trying to do is stop the AWA reform process. All the opposition are currently trying to do is to stop the review and reform of the IR process. Everybody can see through that. The Greens will be supporting the amendment as proposed by the government to have a review and to complete the committee process by 17 March. We believe that the people of Australia have been looking forward to this legislation coming in. They will be able to read about it, able to get their submissions in on time and able to appear before the committee during that process because they have been primed to the fact that this is happening. We do not normally support a review process of just one month but in this instance we think it is particularly important because we believe that the public of Australia have voted on and are keen to get rid of AWAs. That is what this legislation is about. They will have time to get their comments in and we will get time to review this legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-02-14,"—Just for the record, Family First opposed Work Choices because it went too far. Look at what is being proposed: a four-week inquiry. If the Senate is serious, it can go through this inquiry and make sure that the relevant areas are looked at and considered and make sure that people who do not have a voice, like small business and families, can have their say on it as well. Certainly at the last election there was a lot of talk about undoing Work Choices, and this bill goes in that direction. A delay until 28 April is too far out. I think a balance has been struck. The government were looking at having an even shorter time frame for the inquiry which I think was too short, but going out to 17 March would give the Senate inquiry time to look at the aspects of the legislation that is being proposed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—The chamber knows that I have been the Democrats’ workplace relations spokesperson since 1996. For nine years we had the balance of power. Of course, we were pressured constantly by the government to pass their legislation and get committee inquiries done in a short time. During the time the Senate was not in the hands of the government, committee inquiries took their proper course, reports were produced and the legislation was dealt with properly. It is my view that neither the Democrats nor the Senate should change their standards. Governments are governments and oppositions are oppositions. Governments will always argue for mandate, for short sitting times and for having their legislation rushed through, and oppositions have a duty to look at it from a Senate perspective. So I am less interested in the hypocrisy of the past, even where that exists, than I am in the standards we should apply now. I am always very disappointed when I hear those who argued previously for higher standards arguing the reverse just because it suits their particular political case at the time.
I would note with respect to sitting days that, given this is the first year of a new government—with, I assume, a great deal of legislation and new policies to be assessed and debated—both the Senate and the House each probably need to sit at least up to 100 days, or 20 to 22 weeks. I remind the Senate that the House sits for 82 days and the Senate sits for 52 days this year. The Senate sits for 21 days in the first half and 31 days in the second half of the year. Frankly, that is an absolute disgrace. Senators who belong to the Labor Party should never have allowed themselves to be railroaded by the House of Representatives, which determined these sitting times.
I would also support my colleague Senator Bartlett, who holds the view that the Senate is entitled to set the sitting days it wishes. That should normally be done cooperatively. But, frankly, the Senate cannot deal with the sort of legislative program that is before it with the number of sitting days that we have this year. We started too late in February; we have far too few sitting days in the first half of the year; the recesses are too long. It is going to be a lazy Senate and that is not the right look for a new government. I suggest that the opposition go away, decide on when it wants extra sitting weeks, put the motion to the Senate and let the Senate decide when it wants to sit and then sit accordingly to deal with the matters. I would urge the opposition to do that and, if possible, do it today and bring it on as special business.
Turning to the matter at hand: frankly, if I were the government, given the importance of the workplace to the people of Australia, I would have introduced an exposure draft in January, referred it to a committee in January and advertised for submissions in January. We could have been reporting in March and had it all done in time. Again, we are dealing with a lazy government that has come at this far too late. The issues are not that difficult. I am unimpressed, frankly, with being presented with a bill of this importance this late. Having said that, we need a minimum of 28 days for advertising, submissions, hearings and report writing, and then we need considerable time for debate and writing amendments and reports. I would suggest, based on historical circumstances, that somewhere between 28 days and 42 days is the right period for this particular bill—28 being the minimum. I certainly think the coalition is too far out with the date of 28 April, but, given the fact that you think it is unlikely that the bill would be ready for debate and the report ready by the time the last week of March sitting comes, it probably does not matter that much. However, introducing an extra week of sitting at a time other than the last week before May makes sense, frankly—I would not be disturbed by that—and of course the Senate can always give leave to those who have already fixed other engagements. I would urge the government to accept a compromise date which allows the Senate to properly consider legislation which needs to be examined carefully and reported on, as the Senate always should with legislation that matters enormously to the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-02-14,"—The timing of the report that we have proposed—28 April—is, as Senator Murray quite rightly says, a function of the government’s extraordinary lethargy with respect to sittings of the parliament. The first six months of the parliament reflect the laziness of this government and its unwillingness to face Senate scrutiny. If you have a reporting date of 17 March—which I gather the government was originally going to set as 3 March—you will effectively have only two weeks for an inquiry into this bill, and if you report on 17 March you will have just three days to debate the bill before we have a seven-week recess. I suspect that this bill is not going to get through in three days, so inevitably this bill will carry over to the budget sittings. In good faith, the opposition has said to the government: ‘We’re prepared to have a reporting date of 14 April if you, the government, will agree that the Senate will resume in the week of 5 May—that is, the week before the budget. The report can be received and debated, and the legislation can be considered in that week. We are prepared to devote as much time as you like in the week of 5 May to consider this legislation.’
The legislation is not insignificant. The bill runs to 121 pages and the explanatory memorandum runs to 98 pages. This is not idle legislation; this is significant reform of Australia’s industrial relations arrangements. And for all the rhetoric we had from Senator Ludwig about AWAs, this bill introduces the Labor version of an AWA: an individual statutory agreement called an individual transitional employment agreement. This is significant legislation. It will have significant impact on employment, on the economy and on industries all over Australia.
The Senate should properly scrutinise this legislation by conducting, right across this land, inquiries that consider this bill in detail and give everybody an opportunity to comment on significant changes to our industrial relations arrangements which, as I said, allow the Labor Party to introduce its own form of individual statutory agreement. The Senate should properly examine that—examine its impact on the inflation which the government is so concerned about. The Senate should examine its impact on employment and on our great mining industries in Senator Murray’s state of Western Australia, which are genuinely concerned about what Labor proposes to do with individual statutory agreements. It is worthy of proper examination.
Of course, governments will always try to have short inquiries. I am not going to pretend that we did not, but we are now the opposition and other non-government parties in the Senate ought to hold this government to account for the proper scrutiny of its legislation. Therefore the coalition, in good faith, have said that we are prepared to compromise. We are prepared to bring it forward. If there were more sitting weeks we could have a more relevant and probably earlier reporting date, but if the government stick to 17 March the Greens say that we have effectively two weeks only, because there is a week of estimates next week, two clear weeks and then the Senate resumes. The Greens are saying that they are prepared to join with Labor in having a two-week inquiry into, as I just said, a bill of over 100 pages and an explanatory memorandum of about 100 pages. This bill demands greater scrutiny than that, and the opposition, in good faith, offer 14 April. If that is rejected then we believe the appropriate reporting date is the 28th, allowing this bill to be considered in the budget week. As I said, our offer still stands. We are here ready, willing and able to return to this parliament on 5 May if the government wishes.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-14,"—After discussions with government, and on behalf of Senator Heffernan, I seek leave for motion No. 9 and motions Nos 21 and 22, standing in my name, to be dealt with together. As I understand it, formality will be denied. This is rather an unusual step but it will save the Senate’s time if we embark on this path. I seek leave to have those three dealt with together so that the matter may then proceed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-02-14,"—by leave—The government thinks that it is in the interests of time. The three motions are in fact on the same issue and can be dealt with together. We would normally deny formality and then go into a suspension to have the debate. We oppose the establishment of the select committees. In the interests of time it is far more convenient for the Senate to deal with the substantive debate now with those matters being dealt with together. It is not an unusual practice. I think the practice has been done before, although I am sure that the Clerk will correct me if I am wrong about that. But in this instance the most sensible way is to proceed into the substantive debate so we can put our view about the select committees.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2008-02-14,"—How amusing is it to hear Senator Ellison talk about the need for scrutiny by the Senate when he comes off a track record of three years—when the opposition had the numbers in this place—of always avoiding scrutiny. A classic example was seen yesterday during question time when the opposition got six questions and the government got three. That is not a privilege they extended to us the moment they got the numbers in this chamber; it is the one they took back for themselves.
I happen to agree, by the way, with the breakdown of questions in this place, not on the basis of proportionality or on where the power lies in this place but on the basis of the necessity for scrutiny. Of course the opposition should get the first question and every alternate one, but that is not something they ceded to the Labor Party when it was in opposition. They always mistreated the Labor Party in opposition and the minor parties when it came to scrutiny. If Senator Ellison is so keen on scrutiny, why did we not have any returns to order acceded to when they were in government and had the numbers in this chamber? It did not matter which document Labor Party or minority senators requested, it was refused without proper reason. They come in here and talk about scrutiny. Yes, they want to scrutinise when it was they who avoided it at every possible opportunity in the past. What double standards and hypocrisy. It will not be the road back to government for those in opposition now to simply change all their views and principles because they have just walked to the other side of the chamber. It does not gel.
I want to go through a little of the history of select committees. Senator Ellison today outlined a case for three inquiries. I am not going to challenge him on the substantive nature of those inquiries. What I am going to challenge him on is who does the inquiries. When they were last in opposition, in 1995, they had seven select committees going in this chamber, in spite of all the other committees. Every time some narrow pressure group came along, they would not answer them or give them a policy alternative. They said, ‘We’ll set up a select committee to look at that,’ so that they did not actually have to respond.
To have seven committees was putting an enormous financial burden on Senate finances. We must have been mugs after the election—and we lost—because we sat down with the government and discussed a rational outcome for select committees. We agreed on having a maximum of four select committees at any one time. Indeed, that is the deal the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing and President Reid struck with Finance, and that is what the current Senate is funded for for select committees. Yet, from 1996 through to 2005, before the Liberal Party and the National Party got a majority in this place, we averaged two right throughout that period. We were not just setting up select committees out of political cowardice; we set up rational ones. As a result, Senate finances have prospered ever since.
But let us have a look at the last parliament. How many select committees did we have? In the last parliament we had one. Every time we put up a proposal for a select committee it got smashed by the government majority of the time. That is what happened. And here we are two days into the sitting and, all on the one day, the coalition are demanding that three committees be set up. Every one of those inquiries could be done by one of the legislative committees. Remember: this is a mob that collapsed all the committees into eight, saying, ‘We don’t need 16 committees; we need eight.’ ‘This is an economic rationalistic proposal,’ they told us. This was not about them jumping and grabbing every chair and every payment for every chair, we were told, this was a matter of principle. Yet, two days into this sitting, all those principles have gone out the window, and here they are setting up three more committees. As I said, we had only one select committee in the last parliament for over three years; we are now getting three after two days here. The duplication is obvious. I have no dispute with the subject matter that Senator Heffernan and his colleagues want to look into in terms of agriculture. Of course an existing committee can do it, and of course an existing committee can look into housing affordability or into state finances and the way they operate there. This is just a way of creating jobs for people.
Just look at the way the committees are so balanced. The coalition get three members on it and the chair and the casting vote. You might as well not have anyone else—they basically grab the lot—and all three are exactly the same. At least back in the 1990s when we set up a select committee the chairs and membership rotated around, but not in this case—everyone is exactly the same. Each one has a special clause in it, and that is clause (11), which talks about staffing et cetera and that it will be empowered to appoint persons with specialist knowledge for the purpose of the committee, with the approval of the President. That is not an unusual clause, but essentially we will be keeping a very close eye on this particular one. You are not going to use this as another way of supplementing opposition staff. If you do appoint experts, let them do their job and not just supplement Liberal senators and shadow ministers in this chamber. I am sure the President will make sure that that is not the case.
Partly this is about snouts in the trough. Partly this is about giving some opposition members committee chairmanships, just as it was three years ago when you reorganised all the committees and grabbed control for yourselves. I know the full history of this; I was involved in the 1994 negotiations, when after years of frustration in opposition you said that the committees should be shared amongst the whole of the Senate—and so it was done. But the moment you got the numbers, your attitude was, ‘No more shares here; we’ll take the lot back,’ and a whole range of arguments were invented at the time that this was economically more rational and that it concentrated the efforts on these committees. But possibly the mistake you made here was to entrench these matters in standing orders. So then you lost the election, you front up here and—oops—you do not have any more chairs of committees. We even read in the newspapers that the Leader of the Liberal Party, Dr Nelson, has bottled up the great prizes of deputy chairs of committees and is doling them out as some sort of patronage, which borders on the pathetic. It is absolutely pathetic for someone like Dr Nelson, who was once in government with all the patronage they then had, to be reduced down to doling out deputy chairs of committees as a way of shoring up his shaky leadership. Why not let the Liberal Party party room determine who its deputy chairs will be. By the way, who will determine these three chairs? Will it be the Senate party room or will it be Dr Nelson? Will it be another three positions of patronage for Dr Nelson to hand out? What the opposition are doing here today is quintessential hypocrisy at its worst.
There is a case over time for select committees—we would not have left them in standing orders if there were not—but they do pre-date this current committee system and so the necessity for select committees is far less today than it once was. But it is absolute greed to shove them up on the first day. It is duplication and a waste of resources, and I think this is just the thin end of the wedge. You are going to see more select committees set up over the next year. You shake your head, but are you going to guarantee there are not going to be more set up in the next few weeks or few months? By the way, Senator Heffernan, if you are to chair one of these, why don’t you actually apply yourself and chair it. Don’t get up and wander around the room, intimidating people; actually apply yourself for once in your life. I know that life is less relevant now—and your mentor, the former member for Bennelong, has gone—but see if you can retrieve your career through this and actually do something positive for once in your life, instead of going around the building and smearing everyone you can find. Surprise me and prove me wrong. Make this select committee, when you get control of it, a decent, honourable committee. That is your challenge; we will see if you are up to the mark. I am not going to bet my life savings on it, though, I have to tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
In summary, the move to set up three select committees in one day reflects the opposition’s desire to capture three chairs—to put their snouts in the trough. It is nothing more than that; that is what it is about. Any one of these inquiries could have been done by a current standing committee. I remind you that, when you controlled the government benches and the numbers, there was only one select committee in three years, and there were no returns to order and no scrutiny. Every matter that we wanted referred to a committee was knocked off. There were unrealistic timetables for reporting. So by all means come out and say you have got the numbers and you will do what you like. I will accept that, but as for the hypocrisy of Senator Ellison and everyone else saying, ‘This is a matter of Senate scrutiny’: nonsense it is! Nonsense it is a matter of Senate scrutiny. It is a ruthless exercise in the numbers to line your own pockets.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—As I have said once already this morning, it is a competition for hypocrisy. We have certainly got a lot of it here with regard to this motion before us, as Senator Ray, as always backed by his knowledge of history, has pointed out. I am not going to join in that: having railed against the lack of scrutiny of the previous government and their using their numbers to prevent it, I am not then going to vote against an opportunity to put scrutiny on the new government. Nonetheless, it is impossible not to make the point, as Senator Ray did, that over the last 2½ years, since the coalition had control of the Senate, not a single select committee was established. The last one was the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health—which, I might say, did an extremely good, non-partisan job—set up in March 2005 before the coalition got full control of the Senate. As I said, it did a good job, which makes it all the more inexcusable that there was no support provided for any attempts to set up select committees after that.
Of course, there were not a lot of motions put forward to establish select committees, so in that sense I suppose the coalition might try the furphy that there was only a few actually proposed: ‘You didn’t try.’ But the reason why people did not try is that they knew it would not succeed. We could not even get references up to the existing standing committees half the time, let alone set up select committees. It is worth looking at the history of this.
I would genuinely urge all senators here to look at the history of this. One of the issues that I think is very real, and that will become more real after July, is that in July we will have about 14 new senators coming in. We had 16 new senators coming in after the last election, so there are 16 people here already who know nothing other than the coalition having control of the Senate. We will have another 14 coming in. That is nearly half the Senate who will have no recollection and no corporate memory of the long history and tradition behind the Senate committee processes and why it often works so well.
I would recommend people look at the history. Senator Ray has touched on it a bit. It is outlined in Odgers in great detail. If you look at appendix 9 of Odgers, it lists all of the Senate select committees that have been set up since 1984—including, for example, one into agricultural and veterinary chemicals, which has some overlap with the one Senator Heffernan is trying to put forward now. Perhaps more relevantly to the point before us, appendix 8 of Odgers lists the number of select committees that were in place in the Senate each year since, I think, 1977. Perhaps it is not surprising but it is nonetheless interesting to read that the last time there were zero select committees in existence was back in the 1970s, which just happened to be when the coalition had control of the Senate and prevented any select committees being set up then. It was not until 1980, with the arrival of the Democrats and balance of power role, that select committees started to be established again.
Since that time we have had the standing committees put in place. They were permanent standing committees that looked at policy issues and often carried and examined the sort of references that are before us today and that are proposed for these select committees. Even at that time, as Senator Ray pointed out, select committees continued to operate. If you look through that list, in 1984, for example, which was the first full year of the new Labor government, six select committees were in place, although not all of them at the one time. The next year there were six. The next year there were four. The next year there were four. The next year there were five, then five, then four, then four, then five, then six, then five, and then six until in the final year of the Labor government in 1995, as Senator Ray pointed out, there were nine separate select committees put in place. As Senator Ray also pointed out, that then reduced in most years to no more than four—again, not all at the one time. As he said, there were an average of two. It went up to six in 2004 and dropping down again in 2005, until we hit the end of 2005 when the coalition got control of the Senate and it went to zero.
It simply cannot pass without us emphasising the extraordinary gall here. I know you need a fair bit of gall in this place, and perhaps I have never had enough and that is part of my problem. It shows an overpowering level of gall to be able to come in on the first day, after not allowing any select committees for three years, and then try and make an argument based on principle that we need to have three, particularly at a time when most of the standing committees have nothing before them. So you would be giving them something to do. I am not saying they are not all about to work on putting in place references, and I am sure they will get busy fairly soon. But you cannot even use the normal argument that the existing standing committees are all too busy, because they are not.
Having said that, I am not opposing the arguments that have been put forward for the specific inquiries here. As a person who, probably more than anyone else in this chamber, has argued repeatedly over many years for the need for a much greater focus to be put on the crisis in housing affordability, I would be hypocritical myself to then argue against setting up a committee precisely to focus on that. So I actually welcome that one in particular, because of my own personal longstanding interest in it. I have had less interest in fertiliser, I must say, but I am sure there is an argument there—I am not trying to belittle that. As I have repeatedly said in this place, in past years, it has been a real problem that there has not been adequate opportunity for the Senate to really put the heat on the government of the day.
So I welcome the fact that the new government will have scrutiny put on it from day one. It is still an open question of how the Senate committees will perform now that they have Labor government chairs and a Labor government majority, and that is not casting any aspersions on chairs. As an example of their dedication to the cause, I see that we have two new Senate committee chairs in the chamber here. I congratulate them both on their appointments. I think the fact that you are here listening to this debate shows how committed you are to an effective committee process, so I am sure you will both do well in that role. But the jury is still out on how the new government will use its numbers on the Senate standing committees. Will they use them fairly and reasonably or will they use them for partisan political purposes? I am still reasonably hopeful in that regard. To some extent I am sure it will come down to the individual chairs.
But there is no reason for the Senate not to immediately put the pressure on the new government and apply scrutiny, including by setting up select committees not controlled by the government of the day to examine matters more forensically. Even if the standing committees do not have a lot of other work before them, there can still be a benefit in having a committee set up that does nothing else but that one job—because there is the issue of the loss of continuity on standing committees when you have three or four different inquiries before you and different people shifting onto or off the committee depending on the issue. So having a committee where the people on it all know they are there for one task—that is, to focus on this one issue—can be valuable regardless of whether the relevant standing committee is busy or not. So I am not arguing against the substantive value of putting in place select committees on these issues, but it is impossible not to join with Senator Ray, at least in the main, in expressing astonishment at the level of hypocrisy from the coalition in suddenly turning around and making the argument for putting the scrutiny on the government of the day when every single person now sitting on the opposition benches voted time and time again to prevent that happening. Every one of you individually could have voted on many occasions to apply even just a tiny bit of extra scrutiny on the government of the day. If that had occurred in a few cases—not least in the Work Choices arena—then perhaps things might have been different in terms of the general election result.
I do not join with Senator Ray in his assertions about this being about lining people’s pockets. I think that is a little bit harsh, frankly. I have no knowledge of Dr Nelson’s leadership shakiness or otherwise, and I am not particularly interested. I do not believe this is particularly about lining pockets. But the hypocrisy is nonetheless undeniable and cannot pass without remark. Part of the reason it needs to be remarked on is that we do need to shift back to what the Senate is about. I guess, at least with regard to that, in setting up these committees there is the opportunity for the Senate to get back to doing its job: that is, not only scrutinising that government of the day—it is not just about using their numbers in the Senate to put the blowtorch on the government of the day, although that must be part of it—but also using the Senate’s role as a chamber independent of the government of the day to examine issues in a non-partisan way. That means not looking solely for opportunities to put the heat on the government but rather looking for opportunities to get better ideas out into the public arena, to get a more informed public debate and a more informed parliamentary debate, and ideally to get better policy proposals across the board and better legislation to improve things for the Australian people.
I would make the point again that the more we can depoliticise and ‘departisanise’—if that is a word—the Senate the better it will be for the Australian community. We can spend all our time in here scoring points left, right and centre—we have spent most of the morning doing it. I would remind the Senate of the complete lack of interest from the press gallery in anything that happens in this chamber, either today or yesterday. There was so little interest in the Senate’s role in the stolen generations apology that they were having morning tea while we were still having the debate here. That shows how little interest not only the House of Representatives but also the press gallery has in the Senate. If it has happened in the Reps, then it has happened. Whatever happens here, the interest is minimal. So, frankly, 99 per cent of the points we think we are scoring fall on stony ground, waste everybody’s time, make everybody more and more irritable, and do nothing for what we are supposed to be doing here—which is to achieve better results for the Australian community. So, having said that the jury is out on how well or otherwise Labor will use its numbers on the standing committee, the jury will also be out on how these select committees will perform. Obviously they will get through—the coalition has the numbers even without the Democrats’ support, which we will provide. I say that not so much from the point of view of what it means for the Democrats—which is obviously not very much given what is happening on 1 July from the Democrats’ point of view—but from the point of view of the public’s respect for the political process, and particularly for the Senate.
The Senate has a real opportunity, particularly come July, to re-establish some credibility not just for itself but also for the parliamentary process and the political process. I would suggest that it would be to the benefit of all of us, particularly those of you who will be continuing on here, if I might give some gratuitous advice, if the Senate could really rise above more frequently. I do not expect the press gallery to care because they rarely have—but I think people in the wider committee do notice, particularly those who do engage with the political process and the policy process. There is a real anticipation amongst those people, minority though they may be, who actually engage with the public debate and policy debate on its merits rather than on its point-scoring and talking points aspects, looking forward to the Senate starting to operate effectively again—not just in putting pressure on the government of the day but also in providing an opportunity to get ideas out there and considered more fully. That opportunity now presents itself once again. I hope these select committees will operate in a way that will enable that to happen.
I must admit that I particularly have my doubts about the committee on state government financial management. I hope I am proven wrong but I find it hard to see that one being used for anything other than an exercise in state government bashing. I will be pleased if you prove me wrong. They may well deserve it, but they are not the only people who deserve it. Ending the blame game might be a bit of political rhetoric from the new Prime Minister, although I am sure there is some genuineness in there. Whether it is genuine or not from the Prime Minister, I have no doubt there is a real desire, a huge desire, amongst the Australian community to end the blame game, and that includes the blame game and finger-pointing occurring across the parliamentary chambers here. So if that committee can actually do its job effectively rather than just turning into a ‘beat up state governments’ exercise then that would be good. I will suspend my disbelief on that one. Nonetheless I think the broader points have been made. I will not oppose putting forward any of the select committees. I do hope that this is an actual new dawn in proper and genuine scrutiny, but it is hard to look past some of the extraordinary gall shown here today—even for politicians I think there should be some limit on the level of two-facedness in the positions we put forward.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-02-14,"—I can only assume from Senator Bartlett’s comments about the gallery that he does not intend pursuing a post-parliamentary career in journalism, but his points are nevertheless well made in relation to the observation of what occurred yesterday. It is a fascinating debate today because what was wrong is apparently now right. Senator Ray trotted out today to raise these matters. I actually thought it was probably the worst speech I have ever heard Senator Ray make. I have a lot of respect for Senator Ray, but that was the worst speech he has made in this chamber, because he was trying to justify the unjustifiable. He said that the substance of these matters was significant. So, if it is significant, there can surely be only two reasons for him to not support the select committees: one is political and the other is utter churlishness. I will go to the latter first. This is not about select committees; this is about the government this morning being knocked off in relation to an inquiry by the Senate on industrial relations legislation. This was a very childish and churlish act this morning in relation to that legislation and you stand condemned for it. You failed the very first test of transparency and you failed abysmally. It was the very first test of your complaints about the workings of the Senate being taken over by the executive and you failed. On the second day of sitting in this place you failed your own test, imposed over the last three years.
Senator Ray cannot have it both ways. He said that there is now no need for those select committees because of the change of structure to the committees, but those changes occurred three years ago. He then complained about select committees being knocked off in the last term. He cannot actually have it both ways. Either the select committees are important or they are not. You cannot rewrite history and say, ‘Well, now they are not quite as important as they were, because of the changes to the standing orders.’ Those standing orders were changed three years ago. He was complaining about select committees being, in his words, knocked off in the last term. So he is trying to have it both ways and he cannot do so, despite his endeavours.
Let us look at the substance of those committees. My colleagues will remember that, in the 12 months leading up to the last election, housing affordability was a matter that was apparently absolutely fundamental to the Australian Labor Party. I will not talk about the agriculture select committee proposal because Senator Heffernan will do that; I will confine my comments to the other two. For 12 months, all we heard about was the issue of housing affordability. At the very first test of this by the Australian Labor Party, they are refusing to have a bipartisan committee—not an opposition committee but a bipartisan committee—look at the issue of housing affordability.

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—Anyone listening to this today will say, ‘Why, when presented with the opportunity to actually get the men and women of the Senate to look into this, are you trying to knock it off?’ What gross hypocrisy. How dare you come into this place and talk about housing affordability!
—It’s a bit late to care now—it really is.
—Quite frankly, the very silly interjections from Senator Marshall will not change the dynamics of this. You have failed your first test in relation to your complaints. We saw crocodile tears over the last 12 months in relation to housing affordability. Your hypocrisy is breathtaking.
—You did nothing about housing affordability—nothing.
—We did nothing—is that right? So is this committee going to do something or not?
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Ronaldson, address your remarks through the chair.
—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, you cannot have it both ways: it is either an issue or it is not. I cannot believe that the Greens would not support this select committee, because they have also been talking about housing affordability. If they sit in here and vote against this, as they did in the test before in relation to industrial relations, then it only proves again that—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—you are one and the same: the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party are one and the same. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President to Senator Siewert, until you have the guts to cut yourselves away from the Australian Labor Party and start putting in place the sorts of processes you have been complaining about in this place, then you are also completely and utterly hypocritical. You are hypocrites.
I want to turn to the state governments. I think Senator Bartlett was absolutely right when he said that there may well be matters that need to be looked at in relation to the state governments. Well, they are—absolutely.
—Order! You cannot address a senator as a hypocrite. It is unparliamentary.
—I was referring to the senator’s party, but I will withdraw it if she believes I was addressing it to her. I actually hold her in high regard. It was her party that I was referring to, and they are gross hypocrites. The Australian Greens are grossly hypocritical in relation to these matters.
I now return to the issue of state government financial matters. The Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate has quite rightly, in my view, asked for the establishment of a select committee to look into state government financial management. If Prime Minister Rudd—who I think called himself a fiscal conservative during the campaign and beforehand—is serious about this and if he is a fiscal conservative, how can Mr Rudd stand back and watch what has happened with the state governments around his country, who are spending like drunken sailors? The last reports I saw showed that in the out years there will be some $80 billion of state government debt—in the next three or four years. Is Mr Rudd going to impose on the states the same fiscal restraints that he is apparently going to impose on himself—we will see if that occurs—or will he let the states go off as they will?
The only reason that he is not prepared to let this Senate—a bipartisan committee—look at the state governments’ financial management is that they are all Labor. I can tell you now, if there were coalition governments around the country the government would be jumping over the chairs to support this. You would have to beat them back with a stick. But as soon as the pressure is turned back onto the government in relation to their state Labor mates, what do they do? When this Senate and a bipartisan committee had the opportunity to look at the sort of fiscal rectitude that they have been talking about, they roll over. They stand condemned for that.
This is just a churlish and childish payback for our decision this morning to insist on the Senate looking appropriately at the industrial relations laws. You said, before the federal election, that it was the most significant issue. As the Manager of Opposition Business said today, it is a significant issue. But what do you do when asked by the Senate to have a proper and full inquiry in relation to this matter that you believe is so important? You try to cut it off for your own cheap political purposes. This openness and transparency which we heard about for 12 months before the last election is a complete and utter farce. The farcical response of Senator Carr yesterday to a question put to him is an indication that you will do and say everything that is required to maintain the position you have found yourselves in at the moment.
Why haven’t you got a level of support and trust for this Senate to allow it to look at housing affordability? You cannot talk about the people around Australia who have very significant housing affordability issues—renters, those with mortgages and those who desire to build the accommodation that is required to make up for a deficit of some, I think, 40,000 houses a year to address this situation—when you are not prepared to let the Senate look at that.
The Australian Greens stand up here and say they are not prepared to let the Senate look at that. You cannot have it both ways: you cannot cry crocodile tears when you go on television and then, when asked to form part of an inquiry, not do so.

Senator Siewert interjecting—

—So you are going to vote with us! Are you going to vote with us or not?
 (Senator Murray)—Order, Senator Ronaldson! Please address your remarks through the chair.
—Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am fascinated as to whether the Australian Greens are going to support us in relation to these issues. I suspect, from the lack of response from Senator Siewert, that they are not going to do so. I thought Senator Bartlett was absolutely right: the particularly cheap shot of Senator Ray’s in relation to remuneration for committee chairs was an appalling reflection on his Senate colleagues.
I know that my colleagues Senator Heffernan, Senator Joyce and others are passionate about this select committee, and I will confine my remarks. But I will say that we are not going to tolerate the sort of hypocrisy that we have seen today. We are not going to tolerate the childish churlishness that we have seen. When the government did not get its way it started attacking the integrity of this Senate to hold the executive to account. We will not tolerate it. If this is the start of the battle then I can assure the Australian Labor Party that it is game on.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—I feel as if I am in the twilight zone—truly! It is as if the last 2½ years did not happen. This morning I went into my concerns about the coalition having amnesia. They have forgotten how they opposed virtually every committee that we tried to get up last year. Maybe Senator Ronaldson was not here in the chamber when we had numerous discussions about housing affordability, when we were trying to push the then government into having an inquiry into housing affordability. All of a sudden they have a road to Damascus experience, over the last couple of months, in relation to housing affordability. Well, the public of Australia know exactly what is going on. It is only because they are in opposition that the coalition have suddenly discovered housing affordability as an issue and have suddenly decided that the Senate has a role in scrutiny.
As I have said just recently, I am gobsmacked. They talk about other parties having hypocrisy! The hypocrisy of them coming in here and, all of a sudden, deciding that the Senate does have a role is simply astounding. I think most Australians are probably feeling as if they are in the twilight zone at the moment if they are listening to the arguments we have had this morning about the role of the Senate. However, I am not going to take too much time in expounding on my astonishment because it is boundless.
The issues that are being raised here to be inquired into by select committees are very important issues. The fertiliser issue is very important. I am passionate about agriculture and passionate about this issue, but I would have preferred to see it referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. That is the committee it belongs with. That is the most appropriate committee, so I am a little frustrated that the opposition wants to set up a select committee.
I would also like to add that we need to consider the issue of peak oil when we are considering the issues around fertiliser because the two are intimately linked. The impact of restricted oil supplies is necessarily linked to the issues around fertiliser.
I have touched lightly on the issue of housing affordability. The Greens, the Democrats and the previous opposition, the ALP, tried numerous times in this place to raise the issue of housing affordability. So we do think it is important that we inquire into these issues. We are just astounded that all of a sudden the opposition have decided that they need select committees to inquire into these issues. So the Greens will not be opposing this motion, because we will not oppose motions that in fact lead to better scrutiny by the Senate. We are deeply concerned about the way the opposition have gone about doing this, trying to put these committees in place. We believe that they should be using the existing standing committees rather than setting up select committees. But, as I said, we will not be opposing it.
We will, however, seek to divide the opposition’s amendment, because we do not support opposition amendment (3A)(c):
A participating member shall be taken to be a member of the committee for the purpose of forming a quorum of the committee if a majority of members of the committee is not present.
Under the existing quorum rules, my understanding is that we need a member who has been nominated by both the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the government. We are very concerned that participating members might be used to form a quorum and we do not believe that is an appropriate process. We will be seeking to divide the amendment so that amendments (3A)(a) and (3A)(b) are put and then (3A)(c) is put separately. So I am giving notice that that is our intended approach to that amendment.
 (Senator Murray)—Just to advise you, Senator Siewert, that item (c) is now part of the standing orders of the Senate. You are entitled, of course, to divide the question, and I will put that question when we come to the conclusion of the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I am gobsmacked by what I have heard today, absolutely gobsmacked. Let us put it into context: if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, it is a duck. This is about money, money, money. It is about Senator Heffernan.
—Don’t insult me with that!
—It is about money. It is about 11 per cent. It is about ensuring that they can line their pockets, because if they were serious about this—

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Senator Ludwig, as you are aware, you are entitled to make general remarks, but I think it would be wrong to imply a particular senator has a particular motive.
—It was not about implying anything; it was about the facts of the matter. If you are the chair of a select committee, you receive 11 per cent. Those are the facts of the matter. And we have the establishment of three select committees being proposed today—three.
Since July 2005, no select committees have been established. Why that date? Because from that date the Liberals had control of the Senate. They did not want scrutiny. They did not allow select committees to go forward. In the past the usual process was that, if you wanted inquiries into matters, individual senators would take them to the standing committees and say, ‘We want an inquiry into x, y or z,’ and it would go to one of the standing committees. That is what standing committees are there for: they are deliberately set up to inquire widely into matters. We had reference committees and legislation committees, but the Liberals combined them into one. So those committees are there. But the Liberals did not go through that process. There was no attempt to put these matters to one of the standing committees to be inquired into—no attempt. What we see is a straight-out, sit-down attempt to establish three select committees in one day. So I stand by what I said: if it looks like a duck then it can only be a duck.
Now we have Senator Ellison from the Liberals getting up and putting his hand on his heart and saying this is about scrutiny. If it was about scrutiny, why not use the standing committees? No argument. But have they suddenly turned over a new leaf? That is what I thought they had accepted, that they had in fact turned over a new leaf, that they had understood that they were arrogant and out of touch—that prior to the election they were in fact completely arrogant and completely out of touch. But what do we have now? The Liberals again being arrogant and out of touch by trying to set up three select committees in one day in this place, to ensure that they can continue to have their will imposed on this Senate rather than taking these matters to the standing committees that are designed to inquire into such matters; that is what they are for. Next I will hear Senator Ellison talk about throwing light into dark corners. I am sure I will hear that from him eventually in respect of these committees.
These matters—housing affordability, and agricultural and related industries—for which the opposition is trying today to establish select committees to inquire into, may be important matters. I am not here to judge how important they are. But those matters should be referred to standing committees, for those standing committees to do their work. There should at least be an attempt by the Liberals to do that. But we do not have that. We have them walking into the Senate today to try to establish select committees—three extra committees, with the resources that go with them.
As for the Liberals’ record, I can recall standing on the other side of the chamber proposing a reference to a standing committee and getting knocked back, and proposing references to select committees of matters that were considered to be important and getting knocked back. There have been no select committees since July 2005. That is their record that they want to stand on—arrogant and out of touch. And they are continuing it. They certainly have not learnt their lesson between when they were in government and now. I took Mr Brendan Nelson at his word when he said they had changed their approach. They had heard from the electorate and understood what the change in government was about. But, clearly, they did not hear one jot of what the electorate said to them.
If you look at the select committees that were established, they were mental health, in 2005; superannuation, in 2002; the Scrafton evidence, in 2004; ministerial discretion, in 2003; Medicare, in 2003; the Lindeberg grievance, in 2004; free trade, in 2004; and the administration of Indigenous affairs, in 2004. Eight select committees have been set up since 2002, but today we get three proposed in one day. That gives you an indication of their pursuit of these issues. Is it about the issues or is it about the resourcing? Is it about the money? I leave it to this chamber to determine that on the evidence that is being put here today.
When you look at the way that the Liberals ran this chamber where they had control of the Senate, they ensured that, even if we were able to inquire into legislation, it was confined to one day, a weekend in one instance and less than a week in others. They ensured that proper scrutiny was not undertaken in this place. We now have statements from the Liberals to say: ‘We are about scrutiny; we want to ensure that we can inquire into things. We are about ensuring that we can “throw light into dark corners”.’ But is that the truth? Is that the real argument that they are progressing today when only a very short while ago they demonstrated clearly by their actions that they did not subscribe to that view one bit? Their view was entirely different from that. Have they changed? I do not think so. That leaves me with the only conclusion I can draw from their actions today: that they are going to pursue setting up three select committees—with the resources and the chairs that go with that—for only one reason. And I leave that for the chamber to decide.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-02-14,"—This is an insult to rural Australia. I want to speak just about the rural matters. To say that this is about money is an insult. You do not come here if you are about money. I would like to put this to bed. I will not refer to the generous speech that Senator Ray made, because it is too insulting. You would only come here for the money if you were a bloody crook, in my view. You do not come here for the money. You come here to do good for your country.
I want to put paid to the idea that this could have gone off to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport and to tell why. Three weeks ago, I did an interview with the ABC up here because Australian farmers are being ripped off by a world cartel in fertilisers and chemicals. It is a bloody insult to Australia’s farmers, who have to cop it.
 (Senator Murray)—Senator Heffernan!
—I withdraw that; I will tone it down. In the interview for the ABC’s Country Hour, I said that we should have a reference to the rural, regional and transport committee. After a week, when the ABC did not run the interview, I rang up the girl in the ABC and asked: ‘How come you didn’t run it?’ I was told that they had had editorial direction from Melbourne that they are not allowed run stories about opposition propositions until they get a response from the government. I rang the editorial directors in Melbourne, and they used all these weasel words about why they could not run the story. I asked, publicly, for this to be referred to the rural and regional affairs committee. So what happened? The ABC rang up Chris Bowen. I have spoken to Chris, and he said: ‘No, we won’t let it go to the rural, regional and transport committee. We’ll send it off to the ACCC and tack it on to the end of the food inquiry.’ The government is entitled to do that—just as we are entitled to say that it should go to the rural, regional and transport committee. That is your doing, not our doing. You put the argument that this could have gone off there—but you knocked that back. You cannot eat your own weasel words—you knocked it back.
This is not about damaging the government. This committee is about protecting our farmers. This is about assisting the government. Let me tell you another fact that you probably do not know. There is only one person in the government who has lived in the bush and has had to make a living in the bush, and that is the new member for Leichhardt.
Yesterday was a great day for Australia. Democracy is a great thing. The election changed the government. You face the reality for rural Australia that the government has changed. So what do you do? You think, ‘We’ve got to make sure that the government does not mess up rural Australia.’ That is my attitude. I was pleased to see that Penny Wong, given that the government had changed—
—She is Senator Wong, please.
—Sorry, I mean Senator Wong. I was pleased that she was given the portfolio, because she is a high intellectual driver. We are pleased in the bush. We want a high intellectual driver running it. I was pleased that Tony Burke was given the job—even though I was disappointed for Senator O’Brien—because he is a high intellectual driver, has a clean sheet of paper and is a good listener. So I have not been going around blowing raspberries; I have been giving cheerio calls. I actually think this is about assisting the government in good decision making. This is about protecting rural Australia. It is very disappointing for a farmer to rock up to a fertiliser agent—who is intimidated by the monopoly supplier—when there is a shed full of superphosphate there, which back in November was worth a worth about $780 a tonne, and be told by the agent, ‘Mate, I can’t quote you a price or give you a delivery.’ And that super is sitting in the shed. We have been had! The price has now gone up $400 a tonne in the meantime, and now you can have some! The argument being put to the agents by the fertiliser monopoly supplier is: ‘Tell them the price of wheat has gone up, and that justifies the price of super going up.’ That is what this is about. It is about these sorts of issues. There are serious issues in the meat market at the present time.
We are not here to pull the government to pieces on the issues of rural Australia; we are to here to protect rural Australia. I implore the government to understand that this is not about money. This is not about resources. This is about a voice for rural Australia in this place. That is our job. I came here to represent the concerns of the bush. You can ring me at three o’clock in the morning if you have a problem. I do not mind—I will do something about it. With those few words, I want to put to bed the idea that somehow the government did not take the view. It is on the transcript of the ABC. They said they would take it to the ACCC. I do not mind if it goes to the ACCC, but I want to give farmers the opportunity to come in here and tell their story, because they have been had.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-02-14,"—With this new government, it is very important that we get back to a respect of the Senate and that the Senate move to where it should be, which is a position based more on the American system than that of the House of Lords. The first thing that we should do—because people should know this—is understand what a Senate select committee is about. Odgers states:
Select committees are an extremely versatile inquiry vehicle. Because they examine single issues, select committees permit a concentration of focus and effort on those issues.
What could be more concentrated than an inquiry into the pricing and supply of diammonium phosphate? That would have to be a very focused and ad hoc issue. And so such a committee would be appropriate in dealing with this issue, which Senator Heffernan has rightly brought up. This is a disease through a number of sectors in the economy. There is evidence of cartels being manipulative and extracting unreasonable premiums from the Australian consumer and, at this point, unreasonable premiums from the farmer. When diammonium phosphate was $120 a tonne, I remember thinking that that was dear. Last year, we were purchasing it for about $750 a tonne. This year, it is $1,350 a tonne and heading north. There is one reason for that: there is a monopoly. This monopoly is extracting an unreasonable premium from the Australian citizen and the Australian farmer. This issue definitely warrants a Senate select committee to look into it. I believe the information that will come from such an inquiry can overlay into so many other areas of trade practices issues and trade practices laws and how this nation is run.
The belief that the government have put today that such an inquiry is not appropriate and that they are not happy with it seems to be in stark contrast to their rhetoric about the extremism of the government when they were in opposition. If that were the case then and if they truly believe it, then we should revert this place to what it should be—that is, an independent chamber that does its business on behalf of the Australian people, that does not work solely on the direction of the executive that exists in the other place. We should be doing that.
Further, I propose that the chairs of the standing committees be elected by the will of the Senate. If the will of the Senate is that a certain chair should be a member of the opposition then it should be a member of the opposition, or if it is a member of the government then it should be a member of the government. It should be based on talent and not so much by appointment. That is something I think we should move towards. I have heard some people say, ‘That’s not what happens in the House of Lords in England.’ It may not be what happens in the House of Lords in England but it is certainly more a reflection of what should be happening in the Senate in Australia, which is based primarily on the Senate in the United States.
The reintroduction of the primacy of the Senate brings about what we really need in our Commonwealth, which is the capacity to protect states rights, and this house has the ability to do that. This Senate should have the ability to appoint select committees to deal with those so-called ad hoc issues that arise from time to time. If the Senate requires three committees, then it is three; if it is four, then it is four. If it is five or more, then that should be the will of the majority of the Senate. If it is the will of the majority of the Senate that innumerable select committees are wanted, then that is its right. Once you say, ‘We don’t want that because of tradition and because of what is coming as an instruction from the other place,’ then you straightaway step away from the belief in the independence and primacy of the Senate. That is a dangerous proposition because it means that we then become a house that works under instruction. A house that works under instruction is pointless.
Unfortunately, I live with the situation of a unicameral parliament in Queensland, where we do not have the protection of an upper house. We do not have the protection that comes from someone having the capacity to raise an issue and pursue it. I heard that one of the select committees was established to hear the Lindeberg grievances. There should be the capacity for a committee to pursue certain ad hoc issues and to bring some sense of solace, some sense of inquiry and some sense that you do not have to go to the other place and get the majority of the numbers in the executive down there to pursue a case here in the Senate.
This is not brought about by the opposition. If these select committees get up, they will be brought about by the will of the majority of the Senate. That is the key issue here. So if it is the will of the majority of the Senate today that the vote should go forward, there will be select committees that will have the capacity to deal with ad hoc issues, including housing affordability, state government financial matters and rural issues, especially the cartel arrangement in diammonium phosphate which is financially stripping down those who are coming off the back of one of the worst droughts in the history of our nation. I believe that is a just and proper position for us to pursue.
 (Senator Murray)—There being no further speakers, I shall divide the question on Senator Ellison’s amendment to general business notices of motion Nos 21 and 22 as follows. The first question is that paragraphs (a) and (b) amending motions Nos 21 and 22 be agreed to.
Question agreed to.
—The next question is that paragraph (c) be agreed to.
Question agreed to.
—The question is that general business notice of motion No. 9 and general business notices of motions Nos 21 and 22, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Agricultural and Related Industries Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-14,"—After discussions with government, and on behalf of Senator Heffernan, I seek leave for motion No. 9 and motions Nos 21 and 22, standing in my name, to be dealt with together. As I understand it, formality will be denied. This is rather an unusual step but it will save the Senate’s time if we embark on this path. I seek leave to have those three dealt with together so that the matter may then proceed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-02-14,"—by leave—The government thinks that it is in the interests of time. The three motions are in fact on the same issue and can be dealt with together. We would normally deny formality and then go into a suspension to have the debate. We oppose the establishment of the select committees. In the interests of time it is far more convenient for the Senate to deal with the substantive debate now with those matters being dealt with together. It is not an unusual practice. I think the practice has been done before, although I am sure that the Clerk will correct me if I am wrong about that. But in this instance the most sensible way is to proceed into the substantive debate so we can put our view about the select committees.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2008-02-14,"—How amusing is it to hear Senator Ellison talk about the need for scrutiny by the Senate when he comes off a track record of three years—when the opposition had the numbers in this place—of always avoiding scrutiny. A classic example was seen yesterday during question time when the opposition got six questions and the government got three. That is not a privilege they extended to us the moment they got the numbers in this chamber; it is the one they took back for themselves.
I happen to agree, by the way, with the breakdown of questions in this place, not on the basis of proportionality or on where the power lies in this place but on the basis of the necessity for scrutiny. Of course the opposition should get the first question and every alternate one, but that is not something they ceded to the Labor Party when it was in opposition. They always mistreated the Labor Party in opposition and the minor parties when it came to scrutiny. If Senator Ellison is so keen on scrutiny, why did we not have any returns to order acceded to when they were in government and had the numbers in this chamber? It did not matter which document Labor Party or minority senators requested, it was refused without proper reason. They come in here and talk about scrutiny. Yes, they want to scrutinise when it was they who avoided it at every possible opportunity in the past. What double standards and hypocrisy. It will not be the road back to government for those in opposition now to simply change all their views and principles because they have just walked to the other side of the chamber. It does not gel.
I want to go through a little of the history of select committees. Senator Ellison today outlined a case for three inquiries. I am not going to challenge him on the substantive nature of those inquiries. What I am going to challenge him on is who does the inquiries. When they were last in opposition, in 1995, they had seven select committees going in this chamber, in spite of all the other committees. Every time some narrow pressure group came along, they would not answer them or give them a policy alternative. They said, ‘We’ll set up a select committee to look at that,’ so that they did not actually have to respond.
To have seven committees was putting an enormous financial burden on Senate finances. We must have been mugs after the election—and we lost—because we sat down with the government and discussed a rational outcome for select committees. We agreed on having a maximum of four select committees at any one time. Indeed, that is the deal the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing and President Reid struck with Finance, and that is what the current Senate is funded for for select committees. Yet, from 1996 through to 2005, before the Liberal Party and the National Party got a majority in this place, we averaged two right throughout that period. We were not just setting up select committees out of political cowardice; we set up rational ones. As a result, Senate finances have prospered ever since.
But let us have a look at the last parliament. How many select committees did we have? In the last parliament we had one. Every time we put up a proposal for a select committee it got smashed by the government majority of the time. That is what happened. And here we are two days into the sitting and, all on the one day, the coalition are demanding that three committees be set up. Every one of those inquiries could be done by one of the legislative committees. Remember: this is a mob that collapsed all the committees into eight, saying, ‘We don’t need 16 committees; we need eight.’ ‘This is an economic rationalistic proposal,’ they told us. This was not about them jumping and grabbing every chair and every payment for every chair, we were told, this was a matter of principle. Yet, two days into this sitting, all those principles have gone out the window, and here they are setting up three more committees. As I said, we had only one select committee in the last parliament for over three years; we are now getting three after two days here. The duplication is obvious. I have no dispute with the subject matter that Senator Heffernan and his colleagues want to look into in terms of agriculture. Of course an existing committee can do it, and of course an existing committee can look into housing affordability or into state finances and the way they operate there. This is just a way of creating jobs for people.
Just look at the way the committees are so balanced. The coalition get three members on it and the chair and the casting vote. You might as well not have anyone else—they basically grab the lot—and all three are exactly the same. At least back in the 1990s when we set up a select committee the chairs and membership rotated around, but not in this case—everyone is exactly the same. Each one has a special clause in it, and that is clause (11), which talks about staffing et cetera and that it will be empowered to appoint persons with specialist knowledge for the purpose of the committee, with the approval of the President. That is not an unusual clause, but essentially we will be keeping a very close eye on this particular one. You are not going to use this as another way of supplementing opposition staff. If you do appoint experts, let them do their job and not just supplement Liberal senators and shadow ministers in this chamber. I am sure the President will make sure that that is not the case.
Partly this is about snouts in the trough. Partly this is about giving some opposition members committee chairmanships, just as it was three years ago when you reorganised all the committees and grabbed control for yourselves. I know the full history of this; I was involved in the 1994 negotiations, when after years of frustration in opposition you said that the committees should be shared amongst the whole of the Senate—and so it was done. But the moment you got the numbers, your attitude was, ‘No more shares here; we’ll take the lot back,’ and a whole range of arguments were invented at the time that this was economically more rational and that it concentrated the efforts on these committees. But possibly the mistake you made here was to entrench these matters in standing orders. So then you lost the election, you front up here and—oops—you do not have any more chairs of committees. We even read in the newspapers that the Leader of the Liberal Party, Dr Nelson, has bottled up the great prizes of deputy chairs of committees and is doling them out as some sort of patronage, which borders on the pathetic. It is absolutely pathetic for someone like Dr Nelson, who was once in government with all the patronage they then had, to be reduced down to doling out deputy chairs of committees as a way of shoring up his shaky leadership. Why not let the Liberal Party party room determine who its deputy chairs will be. By the way, who will determine these three chairs? Will it be the Senate party room or will it be Dr Nelson? Will it be another three positions of patronage for Dr Nelson to hand out? What the opposition are doing here today is quintessential hypocrisy at its worst.
There is a case over time for select committees—we would not have left them in standing orders if there were not—but they do pre-date this current committee system and so the necessity for select committees is far less today than it once was. But it is absolute greed to shove them up on the first day. It is duplication and a waste of resources, and I think this is just the thin end of the wedge. You are going to see more select committees set up over the next year. You shake your head, but are you going to guarantee there are not going to be more set up in the next few weeks or few months? By the way, Senator Heffernan, if you are to chair one of these, why don’t you actually apply yourself and chair it. Don’t get up and wander around the room, intimidating people; actually apply yourself for once in your life. I know that life is less relevant now—and your mentor, the former member for Bennelong, has gone—but see if you can retrieve your career through this and actually do something positive for once in your life, instead of going around the building and smearing everyone you can find. Surprise me and prove me wrong. Make this select committee, when you get control of it, a decent, honourable committee. That is your challenge; we will see if you are up to the mark. I am not going to bet my life savings on it, though, I have to tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
In summary, the move to set up three select committees in one day reflects the opposition’s desire to capture three chairs—to put their snouts in the trough. It is nothing more than that; that is what it is about. Any one of these inquiries could have been done by a current standing committee. I remind you that, when you controlled the government benches and the numbers, there was only one select committee in three years, and there were no returns to order and no scrutiny. Every matter that we wanted referred to a committee was knocked off. There were unrealistic timetables for reporting. So by all means come out and say you have got the numbers and you will do what you like. I will accept that, but as for the hypocrisy of Senator Ellison and everyone else saying, ‘This is a matter of Senate scrutiny’: nonsense it is! Nonsense it is a matter of Senate scrutiny. It is a ruthless exercise in the numbers to line your own pockets.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—As I have said once already this morning, it is a competition for hypocrisy. We have certainly got a lot of it here with regard to this motion before us, as Senator Ray, as always backed by his knowledge of history, has pointed out. I am not going to join in that: having railed against the lack of scrutiny of the previous government and their using their numbers to prevent it, I am not then going to vote against an opportunity to put scrutiny on the new government. Nonetheless, it is impossible not to make the point, as Senator Ray did, that over the last 2½ years, since the coalition had control of the Senate, not a single select committee was established. The last one was the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health—which, I might say, did an extremely good, non-partisan job—set up in March 2005 before the coalition got full control of the Senate. As I said, it did a good job, which makes it all the more inexcusable that there was no support provided for any attempts to set up select committees after that.
Of course, there were not a lot of motions put forward to establish select committees, so in that sense I suppose the coalition might try the furphy that there was only a few actually proposed: ‘You didn’t try.’ But the reason why people did not try is that they knew it would not succeed. We could not even get references up to the existing standing committees half the time, let alone set up select committees. It is worth looking at the history of this.
I would genuinely urge all senators here to look at the history of this. One of the issues that I think is very real, and that will become more real after July, is that in July we will have about 14 new senators coming in. We had 16 new senators coming in after the last election, so there are 16 people here already who know nothing other than the coalition having control of the Senate. We will have another 14 coming in. That is nearly half the Senate who will have no recollection and no corporate memory of the long history and tradition behind the Senate committee processes and why it often works so well.
I would recommend people look at the history. Senator Ray has touched on it a bit. It is outlined in Odgers in great detail. If you look at appendix 9 of Odgers, it lists all of the Senate select committees that have been set up since 1984—including, for example, one into agricultural and veterinary chemicals, which has some overlap with the one Senator Heffernan is trying to put forward now. Perhaps more relevantly to the point before us, appendix 8 of Odgers lists the number of select committees that were in place in the Senate each year since, I think, 1977. Perhaps it is not surprising but it is nonetheless interesting to read that the last time there were zero select committees in existence was back in the 1970s, which just happened to be when the coalition had control of the Senate and prevented any select committees being set up then. It was not until 1980, with the arrival of the Democrats and balance of power role, that select committees started to be established again.
Since that time we have had the standing committees put in place. They were permanent standing committees that looked at policy issues and often carried and examined the sort of references that are before us today and that are proposed for these select committees. Even at that time, as Senator Ray pointed out, select committees continued to operate. If you look through that list, in 1984, for example, which was the first full year of the new Labor government, six select committees were in place, although not all of them at the one time. The next year there were six. The next year there were four. The next year there were four. The next year there were five, then five, then four, then four, then five, then six, then five, and then six until in the final year of the Labor government in 1995, as Senator Ray pointed out, there were nine separate select committees put in place. As Senator Ray also pointed out, that then reduced in most years to no more than four—again, not all at the one time. As he said, there were an average of two. It went up to six in 2004 and dropping down again in 2005, until we hit the end of 2005 when the coalition got control of the Senate and it went to zero.
It simply cannot pass without us emphasising the extraordinary gall here. I know you need a fair bit of gall in this place, and perhaps I have never had enough and that is part of my problem. It shows an overpowering level of gall to be able to come in on the first day, after not allowing any select committees for three years, and then try and make an argument based on principle that we need to have three, particularly at a time when most of the standing committees have nothing before them. So you would be giving them something to do. I am not saying they are not all about to work on putting in place references, and I am sure they will get busy fairly soon. But you cannot even use the normal argument that the existing standing committees are all too busy, because they are not.
Having said that, I am not opposing the arguments that have been put forward for the specific inquiries here. As a person who, probably more than anyone else in this chamber, has argued repeatedly over many years for the need for a much greater focus to be put on the crisis in housing affordability, I would be hypocritical myself to then argue against setting up a committee precisely to focus on that. So I actually welcome that one in particular, because of my own personal longstanding interest in it. I have had less interest in fertiliser, I must say, but I am sure there is an argument there—I am not trying to belittle that. As I have repeatedly said in this place, in past years, it has been a real problem that there has not been adequate opportunity for the Senate to really put the heat on the government of the day.
So I welcome the fact that the new government will have scrutiny put on it from day one. It is still an open question of how the Senate committees will perform now that they have Labor government chairs and a Labor government majority, and that is not casting any aspersions on chairs. As an example of their dedication to the cause, I see that we have two new Senate committee chairs in the chamber here. I congratulate them both on their appointments. I think the fact that you are here listening to this debate shows how committed you are to an effective committee process, so I am sure you will both do well in that role. But the jury is still out on how the new government will use its numbers on the Senate standing committees. Will they use them fairly and reasonably or will they use them for partisan political purposes? I am still reasonably hopeful in that regard. To some extent I am sure it will come down to the individual chairs.
But there is no reason for the Senate not to immediately put the pressure on the new government and apply scrutiny, including by setting up select committees not controlled by the government of the day to examine matters more forensically. Even if the standing committees do not have a lot of other work before them, there can still be a benefit in having a committee set up that does nothing else but that one job—because there is the issue of the loss of continuity on standing committees when you have three or four different inquiries before you and different people shifting onto or off the committee depending on the issue. So having a committee where the people on it all know they are there for one task—that is, to focus on this one issue—can be valuable regardless of whether the relevant standing committee is busy or not. So I am not arguing against the substantive value of putting in place select committees on these issues, but it is impossible not to join with Senator Ray, at least in the main, in expressing astonishment at the level of hypocrisy from the coalition in suddenly turning around and making the argument for putting the scrutiny on the government of the day when every single person now sitting on the opposition benches voted time and time again to prevent that happening. Every one of you individually could have voted on many occasions to apply even just a tiny bit of extra scrutiny on the government of the day. If that had occurred in a few cases—not least in the Work Choices arena—then perhaps things might have been different in terms of the general election result.
I do not join with Senator Ray in his assertions about this being about lining people’s pockets. I think that is a little bit harsh, frankly. I have no knowledge of Dr Nelson’s leadership shakiness or otherwise, and I am not particularly interested. I do not believe this is particularly about lining pockets. But the hypocrisy is nonetheless undeniable and cannot pass without remark. Part of the reason it needs to be remarked on is that we do need to shift back to what the Senate is about. I guess, at least with regard to that, in setting up these committees there is the opportunity for the Senate to get back to doing its job: that is, not only scrutinising that government of the day—it is not just about using their numbers in the Senate to put the blowtorch on the government of the day, although that must be part of it—but also using the Senate’s role as a chamber independent of the government of the day to examine issues in a non-partisan way. That means not looking solely for opportunities to put the heat on the government but rather looking for opportunities to get better ideas out into the public arena, to get a more informed public debate and a more informed parliamentary debate, and ideally to get better policy proposals across the board and better legislation to improve things for the Australian people.
I would make the point again that the more we can depoliticise and ‘departisanise’—if that is a word—the Senate the better it will be for the Australian community. We can spend all our time in here scoring points left, right and centre—we have spent most of the morning doing it. I would remind the Senate of the complete lack of interest from the press gallery in anything that happens in this chamber, either today or yesterday. There was so little interest in the Senate’s role in the stolen generations apology that they were having morning tea while we were still having the debate here. That shows how little interest not only the House of Representatives but also the press gallery has in the Senate. If it has happened in the Reps, then it has happened. Whatever happens here, the interest is minimal. So, frankly, 99 per cent of the points we think we are scoring fall on stony ground, waste everybody’s time, make everybody more and more irritable, and do nothing for what we are supposed to be doing here—which is to achieve better results for the Australian community. So, having said that the jury is out on how well or otherwise Labor will use its numbers on the standing committee, the jury will also be out on how these select committees will perform. Obviously they will get through—the coalition has the numbers even without the Democrats’ support, which we will provide. I say that not so much from the point of view of what it means for the Democrats—which is obviously not very much given what is happening on 1 July from the Democrats’ point of view—but from the point of view of the public’s respect for the political process, and particularly for the Senate.
The Senate has a real opportunity, particularly come July, to re-establish some credibility not just for itself but also for the parliamentary process and the political process. I would suggest that it would be to the benefit of all of us, particularly those of you who will be continuing on here, if I might give some gratuitous advice, if the Senate could really rise above more frequently. I do not expect the press gallery to care because they rarely have—but I think people in the wider committee do notice, particularly those who do engage with the political process and the policy process. There is a real anticipation amongst those people, minority though they may be, who actually engage with the public debate and policy debate on its merits rather than on its point-scoring and talking points aspects, looking forward to the Senate starting to operate effectively again—not just in putting pressure on the government of the day but also in providing an opportunity to get ideas out there and considered more fully. That opportunity now presents itself once again. I hope these select committees will operate in a way that will enable that to happen.
I must admit that I particularly have my doubts about the committee on state government financial management. I hope I am proven wrong but I find it hard to see that one being used for anything other than an exercise in state government bashing. I will be pleased if you prove me wrong. They may well deserve it, but they are not the only people who deserve it. Ending the blame game might be a bit of political rhetoric from the new Prime Minister, although I am sure there is some genuineness in there. Whether it is genuine or not from the Prime Minister, I have no doubt there is a real desire, a huge desire, amongst the Australian community to end the blame game, and that includes the blame game and finger-pointing occurring across the parliamentary chambers here. So if that committee can actually do its job effectively rather than just turning into a ‘beat up state governments’ exercise then that would be good. I will suspend my disbelief on that one. Nonetheless I think the broader points have been made. I will not oppose putting forward any of the select committees. I do hope that this is an actual new dawn in proper and genuine scrutiny, but it is hard to look past some of the extraordinary gall shown here today—even for politicians I think there should be some limit on the level of two-facedness in the positions we put forward.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-02-14,"—I can only assume from Senator Bartlett’s comments about the gallery that he does not intend pursuing a post-parliamentary career in journalism, but his points are nevertheless well made in relation to the observation of what occurred yesterday. It is a fascinating debate today because what was wrong is apparently now right. Senator Ray trotted out today to raise these matters. I actually thought it was probably the worst speech I have ever heard Senator Ray make. I have a lot of respect for Senator Ray, but that was the worst speech he has made in this chamber, because he was trying to justify the unjustifiable. He said that the substance of these matters was significant. So, if it is significant, there can surely be only two reasons for him to not support the select committees: one is political and the other is utter churlishness. I will go to the latter first. This is not about select committees; this is about the government this morning being knocked off in relation to an inquiry by the Senate on industrial relations legislation. This was a very childish and churlish act this morning in relation to that legislation and you stand condemned for it. You failed the very first test of transparency and you failed abysmally. It was the very first test of your complaints about the workings of the Senate being taken over by the executive and you failed. On the second day of sitting in this place you failed your own test, imposed over the last three years.
Senator Ray cannot have it both ways. He said that there is now no need for those select committees because of the change of structure to the committees, but those changes occurred three years ago. He then complained about select committees being knocked off in the last term. He cannot actually have it both ways. Either the select committees are important or they are not. You cannot rewrite history and say, ‘Well, now they are not quite as important as they were, because of the changes to the standing orders.’ Those standing orders were changed three years ago. He was complaining about select committees being, in his words, knocked off in the last term. So he is trying to have it both ways and he cannot do so, despite his endeavours.
Let us look at the substance of those committees. My colleagues will remember that, in the 12 months leading up to the last election, housing affordability was a matter that was apparently absolutely fundamental to the Australian Labor Party. I will not talk about the agriculture select committee proposal because Senator Heffernan will do that; I will confine my comments to the other two. For 12 months, all we heard about was the issue of housing affordability. At the very first test of this by the Australian Labor Party, they are refusing to have a bipartisan committee—not an opposition committee but a bipartisan committee—look at the issue of housing affordability.

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—Anyone listening to this today will say, ‘Why, when presented with the opportunity to actually get the men and women of the Senate to look into this, are you trying to knock it off?’ What gross hypocrisy. How dare you come into this place and talk about housing affordability!
—It’s a bit late to care now—it really is.
—Quite frankly, the very silly interjections from Senator Marshall will not change the dynamics of this. You have failed your first test in relation to your complaints. We saw crocodile tears over the last 12 months in relation to housing affordability. Your hypocrisy is breathtaking.
—You did nothing about housing affordability—nothing.
—We did nothing—is that right? So is this committee going to do something or not?
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Ronaldson, address your remarks through the chair.
—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, you cannot have it both ways: it is either an issue or it is not. I cannot believe that the Greens would not support this select committee, because they have also been talking about housing affordability. If they sit in here and vote against this, as they did in the test before in relation to industrial relations, then it only proves again that—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—you are one and the same: the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party are one and the same. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President to Senator Siewert, until you have the guts to cut yourselves away from the Australian Labor Party and start putting in place the sorts of processes you have been complaining about in this place, then you are also completely and utterly hypocritical. You are hypocrites.
I want to turn to the state governments. I think Senator Bartlett was absolutely right when he said that there may well be matters that need to be looked at in relation to the state governments. Well, they are—absolutely.
—Order! You cannot address a senator as a hypocrite. It is unparliamentary.
—I was referring to the senator’s party, but I will withdraw it if she believes I was addressing it to her. I actually hold her in high regard. It was her party that I was referring to, and they are gross hypocrites. The Australian Greens are grossly hypocritical in relation to these matters.
I now return to the issue of state government financial matters. The Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate has quite rightly, in my view, asked for the establishment of a select committee to look into state government financial management. If Prime Minister Rudd—who I think called himself a fiscal conservative during the campaign and beforehand—is serious about this and if he is a fiscal conservative, how can Mr Rudd stand back and watch what has happened with the state governments around his country, who are spending like drunken sailors? The last reports I saw showed that in the out years there will be some $80 billion of state government debt—in the next three or four years. Is Mr Rudd going to impose on the states the same fiscal restraints that he is apparently going to impose on himself—we will see if that occurs—or will he let the states go off as they will?
The only reason that he is not prepared to let this Senate—a bipartisan committee—look at the state governments’ financial management is that they are all Labor. I can tell you now, if there were coalition governments around the country the government would be jumping over the chairs to support this. You would have to beat them back with a stick. But as soon as the pressure is turned back onto the government in relation to their state Labor mates, what do they do? When this Senate and a bipartisan committee had the opportunity to look at the sort of fiscal rectitude that they have been talking about, they roll over. They stand condemned for that.
This is just a churlish and childish payback for our decision this morning to insist on the Senate looking appropriately at the industrial relations laws. You said, before the federal election, that it was the most significant issue. As the Manager of Opposition Business said today, it is a significant issue. But what do you do when asked by the Senate to have a proper and full inquiry in relation to this matter that you believe is so important? You try to cut it off for your own cheap political purposes. This openness and transparency which we heard about for 12 months before the last election is a complete and utter farce. The farcical response of Senator Carr yesterday to a question put to him is an indication that you will do and say everything that is required to maintain the position you have found yourselves in at the moment.
Why haven’t you got a level of support and trust for this Senate to allow it to look at housing affordability? You cannot talk about the people around Australia who have very significant housing affordability issues—renters, those with mortgages and those who desire to build the accommodation that is required to make up for a deficit of some, I think, 40,000 houses a year to address this situation—when you are not prepared to let the Senate look at that.
The Australian Greens stand up here and say they are not prepared to let the Senate look at that. You cannot have it both ways: you cannot cry crocodile tears when you go on television and then, when asked to form part of an inquiry, not do so.

Senator Siewert interjecting—

—So you are going to vote with us! Are you going to vote with us or not?
 (Senator Murray)—Order, Senator Ronaldson! Please address your remarks through the chair.
—Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am fascinated as to whether the Australian Greens are going to support us in relation to these issues. I suspect, from the lack of response from Senator Siewert, that they are not going to do so. I thought Senator Bartlett was absolutely right: the particularly cheap shot of Senator Ray’s in relation to remuneration for committee chairs was an appalling reflection on his Senate colleagues.
I know that my colleagues Senator Heffernan, Senator Joyce and others are passionate about this select committee, and I will confine my remarks. But I will say that we are not going to tolerate the sort of hypocrisy that we have seen today. We are not going to tolerate the childish churlishness that we have seen. When the government did not get its way it started attacking the integrity of this Senate to hold the executive to account. We will not tolerate it. If this is the start of the battle then I can assure the Australian Labor Party that it is game on.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—I feel as if I am in the twilight zone—truly! It is as if the last 2½ years did not happen. This morning I went into my concerns about the coalition having amnesia. They have forgotten how they opposed virtually every committee that we tried to get up last year. Maybe Senator Ronaldson was not here in the chamber when we had numerous discussions about housing affordability, when we were trying to push the then government into having an inquiry into housing affordability. All of a sudden they have a road to Damascus experience, over the last couple of months, in relation to housing affordability. Well, the public of Australia know exactly what is going on. It is only because they are in opposition that the coalition have suddenly discovered housing affordability as an issue and have suddenly decided that the Senate has a role in scrutiny.
As I have said just recently, I am gobsmacked. They talk about other parties having hypocrisy! The hypocrisy of them coming in here and, all of a sudden, deciding that the Senate does have a role is simply astounding. I think most Australians are probably feeling as if they are in the twilight zone at the moment if they are listening to the arguments we have had this morning about the role of the Senate. However, I am not going to take too much time in expounding on my astonishment because it is boundless.
The issues that are being raised here to be inquired into by select committees are very important issues. The fertiliser issue is very important. I am passionate about agriculture and passionate about this issue, but I would have preferred to see it referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. That is the committee it belongs with. That is the most appropriate committee, so I am a little frustrated that the opposition wants to set up a select committee.
I would also like to add that we need to consider the issue of peak oil when we are considering the issues around fertiliser because the two are intimately linked. The impact of restricted oil supplies is necessarily linked to the issues around fertiliser.
I have touched lightly on the issue of housing affordability. The Greens, the Democrats and the previous opposition, the ALP, tried numerous times in this place to raise the issue of housing affordability. So we do think it is important that we inquire into these issues. We are just astounded that all of a sudden the opposition have decided that they need select committees to inquire into these issues. So the Greens will not be opposing this motion, because we will not oppose motions that in fact lead to better scrutiny by the Senate. We are deeply concerned about the way the opposition have gone about doing this, trying to put these committees in place. We believe that they should be using the existing standing committees rather than setting up select committees. But, as I said, we will not be opposing it.
We will, however, seek to divide the opposition’s amendment, because we do not support opposition amendment (3A)(c):
A participating member shall be taken to be a member of the committee for the purpose of forming a quorum of the committee if a majority of members of the committee is not present.
Under the existing quorum rules, my understanding is that we need a member who has been nominated by both the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the government. We are very concerned that participating members might be used to form a quorum and we do not believe that is an appropriate process. We will be seeking to divide the amendment so that amendments (3A)(a) and (3A)(b) are put and then (3A)(c) is put separately. So I am giving notice that that is our intended approach to that amendment.
 (Senator Murray)—Just to advise you, Senator Siewert, that item (c) is now part of the standing orders of the Senate. You are entitled, of course, to divide the question, and I will put that question when we come to the conclusion of the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I am gobsmacked by what I have heard today, absolutely gobsmacked. Let us put it into context: if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, it is a duck. This is about money, money, money. It is about Senator Heffernan.
—Don’t insult me with that!
—It is about money. It is about 11 per cent. It is about ensuring that they can line their pockets, because if they were serious about this—

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Senator Ludwig, as you are aware, you are entitled to make general remarks, but I think it would be wrong to imply a particular senator has a particular motive.
—It was not about implying anything; it was about the facts of the matter. If you are the chair of a select committee, you receive 11 per cent. Those are the facts of the matter. And we have the establishment of three select committees being proposed today—three.
Since July 2005, no select committees have been established. Why that date? Because from that date the Liberals had control of the Senate. They did not want scrutiny. They did not allow select committees to go forward. In the past the usual process was that, if you wanted inquiries into matters, individual senators would take them to the standing committees and say, ‘We want an inquiry into x, y or z,’ and it would go to one of the standing committees. That is what standing committees are there for: they are deliberately set up to inquire widely into matters. We had reference committees and legislation committees, but the Liberals combined them into one. So those committees are there. But the Liberals did not go through that process. There was no attempt to put these matters to one of the standing committees to be inquired into—no attempt. What we see is a straight-out, sit-down attempt to establish three select committees in one day. So I stand by what I said: if it looks like a duck then it can only be a duck.
Now we have Senator Ellison from the Liberals getting up and putting his hand on his heart and saying this is about scrutiny. If it was about scrutiny, why not use the standing committees? No argument. But have they suddenly turned over a new leaf? That is what I thought they had accepted, that they had in fact turned over a new leaf, that they had understood that they were arrogant and out of touch—that prior to the election they were in fact completely arrogant and completely out of touch. But what do we have now? The Liberals again being arrogant and out of touch by trying to set up three select committees in one day in this place, to ensure that they can continue to have their will imposed on this Senate rather than taking these matters to the standing committees that are designed to inquire into such matters; that is what they are for. Next I will hear Senator Ellison talk about throwing light into dark corners. I am sure I will hear that from him eventually in respect of these committees.
These matters—housing affordability, and agricultural and related industries—for which the opposition is trying today to establish select committees to inquire into, may be important matters. I am not here to judge how important they are. But those matters should be referred to standing committees, for those standing committees to do their work. There should at least be an attempt by the Liberals to do that. But we do not have that. We have them walking into the Senate today to try to establish select committees—three extra committees, with the resources that go with them.
As for the Liberals’ record, I can recall standing on the other side of the chamber proposing a reference to a standing committee and getting knocked back, and proposing references to select committees of matters that were considered to be important and getting knocked back. There have been no select committees since July 2005. That is their record that they want to stand on—arrogant and out of touch. And they are continuing it. They certainly have not learnt their lesson between when they were in government and now. I took Mr Brendan Nelson at his word when he said they had changed their approach. They had heard from the electorate and understood what the change in government was about. But, clearly, they did not hear one jot of what the electorate said to them.
If you look at the select committees that were established, they were mental health, in 2005; superannuation, in 2002; the Scrafton evidence, in 2004; ministerial discretion, in 2003; Medicare, in 2003; the Lindeberg grievance, in 2004; free trade, in 2004; and the administration of Indigenous affairs, in 2004. Eight select committees have been set up since 2002, but today we get three proposed in one day. That gives you an indication of their pursuit of these issues. Is it about the issues or is it about the resourcing? Is it about the money? I leave it to this chamber to determine that on the evidence that is being put here today.
When you look at the way that the Liberals ran this chamber where they had control of the Senate, they ensured that, even if we were able to inquire into legislation, it was confined to one day, a weekend in one instance and less than a week in others. They ensured that proper scrutiny was not undertaken in this place. We now have statements from the Liberals to say: ‘We are about scrutiny; we want to ensure that we can inquire into things. We are about ensuring that we can “throw light into dark corners”.’ But is that the truth? Is that the real argument that they are progressing today when only a very short while ago they demonstrated clearly by their actions that they did not subscribe to that view one bit? Their view was entirely different from that. Have they changed? I do not think so. That leaves me with the only conclusion I can draw from their actions today: that they are going to pursue setting up three select committees—with the resources and the chairs that go with that—for only one reason. And I leave that for the chamber to decide.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-02-14,"—This is an insult to rural Australia. I want to speak just about the rural matters. To say that this is about money is an insult. You do not come here if you are about money. I would like to put this to bed. I will not refer to the generous speech that Senator Ray made, because it is too insulting. You would only come here for the money if you were a bloody crook, in my view. You do not come here for the money. You come here to do good for your country.
I want to put paid to the idea that this could have gone off to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport and to tell why. Three weeks ago, I did an interview with the ABC up here because Australian farmers are being ripped off by a world cartel in fertilisers and chemicals. It is a bloody insult to Australia’s farmers, who have to cop it.
 (Senator Murray)—Senator Heffernan!
—I withdraw that; I will tone it down. In the interview for the ABC’s Country Hour, I said that we should have a reference to the rural, regional and transport committee. After a week, when the ABC did not run the interview, I rang up the girl in the ABC and asked: ‘How come you didn’t run it?’ I was told that they had had editorial direction from Melbourne that they are not allowed run stories about opposition propositions until they get a response from the government. I rang the editorial directors in Melbourne, and they used all these weasel words about why they could not run the story. I asked, publicly, for this to be referred to the rural and regional affairs committee. So what happened? The ABC rang up Chris Bowen. I have spoken to Chris, and he said: ‘No, we won’t let it go to the rural, regional and transport committee. We’ll send it off to the ACCC and tack it on to the end of the food inquiry.’ The government is entitled to do that—just as we are entitled to say that it should go to the rural, regional and transport committee. That is your doing, not our doing. You put the argument that this could have gone off there—but you knocked that back. You cannot eat your own weasel words—you knocked it back.
This is not about damaging the government. This committee is about protecting our farmers. This is about assisting the government. Let me tell you another fact that you probably do not know. There is only one person in the government who has lived in the bush and has had to make a living in the bush, and that is the new member for Leichhardt.
Yesterday was a great day for Australia. Democracy is a great thing. The election changed the government. You face the reality for rural Australia that the government has changed. So what do you do? You think, ‘We’ve got to make sure that the government does not mess up rural Australia.’ That is my attitude. I was pleased to see that Penny Wong, given that the government had changed—
—She is Senator Wong, please.
—Sorry, I mean Senator Wong. I was pleased that she was given the portfolio, because she is a high intellectual driver. We are pleased in the bush. We want a high intellectual driver running it. I was pleased that Tony Burke was given the job—even though I was disappointed for Senator O’Brien—because he is a high intellectual driver, has a clean sheet of paper and is a good listener. So I have not been going around blowing raspberries; I have been giving cheerio calls. I actually think this is about assisting the government in good decision making. This is about protecting rural Australia. It is very disappointing for a farmer to rock up to a fertiliser agent—who is intimidated by the monopoly supplier—when there is a shed full of superphosphate there, which back in November was worth a worth about $780 a tonne, and be told by the agent, ‘Mate, I can’t quote you a price or give you a delivery.’ And that super is sitting in the shed. We have been had! The price has now gone up $400 a tonne in the meantime, and now you can have some! The argument being put to the agents by the fertiliser monopoly supplier is: ‘Tell them the price of wheat has gone up, and that justifies the price of super going up.’ That is what this is about. It is about these sorts of issues. There are serious issues in the meat market at the present time.
We are not here to pull the government to pieces on the issues of rural Australia; we are to here to protect rural Australia. I implore the government to understand that this is not about money. This is not about resources. This is about a voice for rural Australia in this place. That is our job. I came here to represent the concerns of the bush. You can ring me at three o’clock in the morning if you have a problem. I do not mind—I will do something about it. With those few words, I want to put to bed the idea that somehow the government did not take the view. It is on the transcript of the ABC. They said they would take it to the ACCC. I do not mind if it goes to the ACCC, but I want to give farmers the opportunity to come in here and tell their story, because they have been had.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Establishment</title>,Committees,18,2
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-02-14,"—With this new government, it is very important that we get back to a respect of the Senate and that the Senate move to where it should be, which is a position based more on the American system than that of the House of Lords. The first thing that we should do—because people should know this—is understand what a Senate select committee is about. Odgers states:
Select committees are an extremely versatile inquiry vehicle. Because they examine single issues, select committees permit a concentration of focus and effort on those issues.
What could be more concentrated than an inquiry into the pricing and supply of diammonium phosphate? That would have to be a very focused and ad hoc issue. And so such a committee would be appropriate in dealing with this issue, which Senator Heffernan has rightly brought up. This is a disease through a number of sectors in the economy. There is evidence of cartels being manipulative and extracting unreasonable premiums from the Australian consumer and, at this point, unreasonable premiums from the farmer. When diammonium phosphate was $120 a tonne, I remember thinking that that was dear. Last year, we were purchasing it for about $750 a tonne. This year, it is $1,350 a tonne and heading north. There is one reason for that: there is a monopoly. This monopoly is extracting an unreasonable premium from the Australian citizen and the Australian farmer. This issue definitely warrants a Senate select committee to look into it. I believe the information that will come from such an inquiry can overlay into so many other areas of trade practices issues and trade practices laws and how this nation is run.
The belief that the government have put today that such an inquiry is not appropriate and that they are not happy with it seems to be in stark contrast to their rhetoric about the extremism of the government when they were in opposition. If that were the case then and if they truly believe it, then we should revert this place to what it should be—that is, an independent chamber that does its business on behalf of the Australian people, that does not work solely on the direction of the executive that exists in the other place. We should be doing that.
Further, I propose that the chairs of the standing committees be elected by the will of the Senate. If the will of the Senate is that a certain chair should be a member of the opposition then it should be a member of the opposition, or if it is a member of the government then it should be a member of the government. It should be based on talent and not so much by appointment. That is something I think we should move towards. I have heard some people say, ‘That’s not what happens in the House of Lords in England.’ It may not be what happens in the House of Lords in England but it is certainly more a reflection of what should be happening in the Senate in Australia, which is based primarily on the Senate in the United States.
The reintroduction of the primacy of the Senate brings about what we really need in our Commonwealth, which is the capacity to protect states rights, and this house has the ability to do that. This Senate should have the ability to appoint select committees to deal with those so-called ad hoc issues that arise from time to time. If the Senate requires three committees, then it is three; if it is four, then it is four. If it is five or more, then that should be the will of the majority of the Senate. If it is the will of the majority of the Senate that innumerable select committees are wanted, then that is its right. Once you say, ‘We don’t want that because of tradition and because of what is coming as an instruction from the other place,’ then you straightaway step away from the belief in the independence and primacy of the Senate. That is a dangerous proposition because it means that we then become a house that works under instruction. A house that works under instruction is pointless.
Unfortunately, I live with the situation of a unicameral parliament in Queensland, where we do not have the protection of an upper house. We do not have the protection that comes from someone having the capacity to raise an issue and pursue it. I heard that one of the select committees was established to hear the Lindeberg grievances. There should be the capacity for a committee to pursue certain ad hoc issues and to bring some sense of solace, some sense of inquiry and some sense that you do not have to go to the other place and get the majority of the numbers in the executive down there to pursue a case here in the Senate.
This is not brought about by the opposition. If these select committees get up, they will be brought about by the will of the majority of the Senate. That is the key issue here. So if it is the will of the majority of the Senate today that the vote should go forward, there will be select committees that will have the capacity to deal with ad hoc issues, including housing affordability, state government financial matters and rural issues, especially the cartel arrangement in diammonium phosphate which is financially stripping down those who are coming off the back of one of the worst droughts in the history of our nation. I believe that is a just and proper position for us to pursue.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-14,"—At the request of Senator Abetz, I move:
That, upon its introduction into the House of Representatives, the provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 be referred to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee for inquiry and report by 28 April 2008, with particular reference to:
economic and social impacts from the abolition of individual statutory agreements;
impact on employment;
potential for a wages breakout and increased inflationary pressures;
potential for increased industrial disputation;
impact on sectors heavily reliant on individual statutory agreements; and
impact on productivity.
This is a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. It is an extremely important bill and one which needs adequate time for scrutiny. We have had a good deal of debate today about the necessity of scrutiny by the Senate and the use of legislative standing committees, and this is what this motion does. We have had those ad hoc issues referred to select committees. This is a bill going to a Senate legislation standing committee—and quite rightly so. But the issue at hand is the length of time of scrutiny for this committee. The reporting date in the motion is 28 April. That gives the Senate committee adequate time over the break to travel Australia and to engage those people who have an interest in this area, which is vital to all Australians and, indeed, was one of the major issues in the last election.
The government proposed an earlier reporting date around mid-March. Of course, in between, we have estimates committees sitting and other sitting weeks. It is the view of the coalition that more time is needed for such an important bill. This is something which needs to be considered carefully and, as indicated in the terms of reference—which, whilst general, also refer to some specific areas—is vital to this country and, of course, the scrutiny that goes with it is essential. Many Australians have concerns, one way or another, about this legislation. As I said, it was a major issue in the last election. It is therefore imperative that we have that time within which to report. And might I say that the government’s proposal would have seen this come back in the second sitting week in March, as I recall, and it would have left just three days—just three days—to pass what is a very important bill before that lengthy break in April. So the government was giving us a short period for scrutiny by the committee and an even shorter time for debate in the Senate. Previously we made an offer to the government to bring the date forward and also have an extra sitting week, but the government has rejected that. So we have reverted to the original notice of motion which has a reporting date of 28 April and which will provide adequate time for debate in the May and June sitting weeks in the Senate. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I rise to speak to this motion and indicate I have an amendment. I will move that now and then speak to both the amendment and the motion at the same time. I move:
Omit all words from and including “28 April 2008”, substitute “17 March 2008”.
I think it is very important that we are very clear in this chamber and also externally about precisely what is occurring here. We have an opposition who are ideologically committed to Work Choices, an issue that played extremely large in last year’s election, and who are desperately trying to push out the date on which AWAs are abolished in this country. That is simply what it is: the opposition are refusing to accept the decision of the Australian people at the last election and are desperately clinging on to this Work Choices totemic issue to which they are so bound. They cannot think any other way.
This is an opposition whose position is that they want to continue the unfair Australian workplace agreements which we know have continued over the period of the Howard government, since they were introduced, to strip away wages and conditions from workers, particularly disadvantaged workers. So I place the opposition on notice: the Australian people will know that, for every day that you delay the passage of this bill through putting in place an unduly lengthy Senate inquiry, every AWA that is put in place where a young worker or any worker is asked to strip away conditions they would otherwise have received under Labor’s fairer industrial relations policy will be on your heads. This is after an election where no-one could say that anyone in Australia did not understand the difference between the parties on industrial relations. Leave aside all the colour and movement and smokescreens that Senators Minchin and Abetz and Ellison are trying to put into this debate.
At its core, this debate is about an opposition who are ideologically shackled to Australian workplace agreement, an opposition who cannot bear to let go the hard Right agenda about stripping wages and conditions from workers, an opposition who cannot bear the fact that this was an issue on which they clearly did not win the support of the Australian people at the last election. It is extraordinary, isn’t it, really, when you consider the high profile, the centrality of the issue of industrial relations at the election on 24 November? There is a lot of discussion in this chamber at various times about mandates. From memory, I have had the lecture—and I am sure the crossbenchers have at various times—from the previous government about their mandates. That is an issue that gets debated.
But let us be very clear about this. I do not think there was anybody in this country who paid any attention to the last election campaign who would not have considered industrial relations to have been the key issue, the issue that was most front and centre for the longest period, the issue that was most clearly debated, the issue where there were detailed and clear differences between the parties. This was an issue where Labor clearly have a very detailed mandate. The Australian people knew exactly what we were going to do on industrial relations. And they know exactly what you were doing, and they will know in coming weeks if your motion succeeds—because, as you know, you still have the numbers in this chamber—what you are doing by pushing out this reporting date. They will also know that any Australian workplace agreement that is put in place between when this bill should have been dealt with by the Senate and when you are proposing to deal with it is on your heads.
There are a number of particular issues that Senator Minchin mentioned in his earlier contribution to discussion on the Selection of Bills Committee about scrutiny. Firstly, on the issue of scrutiny, people may recall, as I said, that industrial relations was a central issue in the last election campaign. People may recall that Labor put out not only one but two policies in relation to industrial relations. We put out our Forward with Fairness policy and then we put out a very detailed implementation plan. It was far more detailed than anything we ever got from the former Howard government at the election prior to them introducing these extreme workplace laws that Labor are trying to remove through this legislation. I do not remember the former member for Bennelong ever coming out in the 2004 election and saying, ‘By the way, I am going to put in place contracts which allow you to have conditions stripped away without any no disadvantage test or without any reference to awards, which allow young workers to be exploited.’ I do not remember that being an issue that you campaigned on.
In contrast, we put out our policy in, I believe, April of last year, but I could be corrected on that date. Then we put out a very detailed implementation plan. The bill that is the subject of the referral that we are discussing is true to the implementation plan and the policies that we put out for scrutiny and upon which we were elected. This opposition in this chamber is trying to stop the abolition of Australian workplace agreements. You want the bill pushed out. You want more time for more AWAs. You do not want to abolish them because you still believe, despite the fact that you lost the election, that these are good things.
In terms of the time frame—and we have had some discussion about that and I think Senator Siewert has also made this point—we can look at some of the time frames around the legislation introduced by the previous government when it announced it was going to change the law to introduce a fairness test, and the scrutiny that this chamber was allowed to give that legislation. The former government’s Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Bill 2007 was introduced in the House on 28 May and passed on 30 May and the Senate committee commenced its inquiries as soon as the bill was introduced in the House. The bill was introduced in the Senate on 13 June. The Senate committee report was tabled on 14 June and the bill passed on 20 June. So, when you were in government, for your safety net bill there were fewer than four weeks between its introduction into the House and its passage by the Senate, including the Senate committee inquiry.
The Australian people gave us a very clear mandate to implement this legislation. They understood very clearly what Labor’s policy was on these issues. We put out publicly our policy and our implementation plan. What those opposite are arguing for is a time frame far longer for consideration of this bill than they demanded of themselves in government. It is interesting, isn’t it? The shoe is on the other foot now. They are on the other side of the chamber now, but when the opposition were in government and retained control of this chamber they were very happy to rush things through and to have short inquires to suit their political purposes. They are now arguing for longer debate and longer consideration of this bill, which very clearly implements the policies that we articulated in detail prior to the election. If you want to talk in terms of a mandate, we have far more of a mandate for this legislation—given the detail, the discussion and the political focus on this issue prior to the election—than you ever had, when you were the government, for the safety net bill, as I have outlined.
Isn’t it amazing how things change when you cross over? There is only one explanation, and it is the one I started with: this is an opposition that cannot bear the fact that this legislation will remove Australian workplace agreements. I should not say that this is an opposition that cannot bear that fact. I think that is the position of most of the opposition, but we have had a fair bit of toing and froing on their side, with some people suggesting they should fold on this issue and others suggesting they should not—not because those who want to allow passage of this legislation or have a different view on the legislation have had a change of heart or have a different philosophical view; they just recognise the politics of this. Anybody who campaigned during this election—and I assume other senators also campaigned—knows that this was front and centre. For Senator Webber, who I know worked very hard in WA, it was a front and centre issue—as it was across the country. No-one could say that they did not understand that Kevin Rudd and Labor were standing for the abolition of AWAs.
So let us understand what is happening. The opposition is saying: ‘We don’t want to abolish AWAs. We don’t care that this was an issue in the election campaign. We don’t care that we lost the election. We don’t care that the government has got a mandate. We don’t care that the Australian people elected a government that was committed to doing this. We want to delay this as long as possible.’ Let us understand that that is what the motion will do. It will push this out to 28 April and we all know, given the sitting schedule, what that will mean.
The government is absolutely determined to press on with our amendments to these unfair laws. We absolutely will keep faith with the commitment we gave to the Australian people to remove Australian workplace agreements. We absolutely will keep faith with the policies and plans that we put forward and, in this area, the transitional arrangements that we articulated. We will push forward on that and Australians will know, if those on the other side continue to stonewall, who is responsible for the continuation of Australian workplace agreements in this country.
There was some discussion in the earlier debate about sitting hours. I want to make it very clear what the government’s position is. I have moved an amendment that requires a reporting date of 17 March. If that is passed, we will ensure that the bill is passed as expeditiously as possible. I flag to the chamber and to the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate that, if additional sitting hours or days are required in order to pass this bill, the government will put those in place. We are committed to the passage of this legislation. So the challenge to the opposition is this: are you going to accept the fact that Australian workplace agreements are clearly something that the Australian people have rejected, or are you going to try to use the Senate processes to delay as long as possible the dismantling of these laws, which were soundly rejected at the most recent election?
I want to make it clear also that not only is this a bill in which this government is meeting its clear election commitments to the Australian people; it is a bill which is a product of genuine consultation. This may not be something those opposite understand. Not only was this bill put to the Australian people, who overwhelmingly endorsed it in effect at the last election, but the policy and detail of this bill went to the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and its subcommittee on industrial relations. So this is a bill that has been worked on by experts from employer and employee organisations sitting around a table and, as a result of that consultation process, I understand the bill has been improved. We have also held consultations with state workplace relations ministers.
Because there has been a lot of discussion about scrutiny from the other side, I again want to make it clear that the government is not opposed to proper scrutiny of the bill. However, the government wants to ensure that this opposition does not unduly delay or frustrate the will of the Australian people being implemented into law. I again remind the chamber that the last time this parliament dealt with a piece of industrial relations legislation we dealt with the so-called fairness test. Again, I remind the chamber that that legislation, with all its complexity and uncertainty—and we saw some of that after its implementation—was processed within four sitting weeks, including a Senate inquiry. The then government, the current opposition, then believed that four sitting weeks was an appropriate length of time, inclusive of a Senate inquiry, for parliamentary scrutiny of a piece of industrial relations legislation which had not been put to the Australian people and which was announced—let us remember this—before it had even been drafted.
To those who might recall, send your minds back to May last year, I think it was. The government actually announced what it was going to do before it had the legislation ready. So we had this very strange situation where employers and employees were told something publicly that was in effect not enacted, nor was the legislation or the clarity around it introduced into the parliament.
I again remind those opposite that we announced our policy intentions in our Forward with Fairness policy in April last year—that is 10 months ago—and we provided the implementation details of our policy, to which I have already referred, in August last year. That was some three months before the election. It is our very strong view on this side of the chamber that, if four weeks was good enough for the consideration of the previous government’s so-called fairness test legislation, inclusive of a Senate inquiry, it is certainly good enough for the processing of this Labor government’s clear and simple transitional legislation.
This is a challenge for the opposition. Are they actually going to accept the will of the Australian people? Are they going to fairly and properly deal with this legislation or are they going to frustrate its passage? Those watching can only draw one conclusion from the delay that the opposition are proposing, and that is this: that you have not changed. The opposition have not changed. This is the same Liberal Party and National Party that were dedicated to deregulating the industrial relations system such that workers become substantially disadvantaged. This is the same coalition that supported the extreme Work Choices laws, the laws which we know are the most extreme this country has ever seen. This is the same coalition that supported and championed the Australian workplace agreements that we know stripped away the wages and conditions of Australian workers.
So what is happening in this chamber today is that the opposition are refusing to allow the abolition of Australian workplace agreements. That is what the opposition are doing. They are refusing to allow the expeditious passage of a piece of legislation which the Australian people voted for, because the Australian people voted for the dismantling of Work Choices. They knew exactly what the Labor Party’s position was on this, and they knew exactly what yours was as well. One thing we can take out of this debate is this: the opposition have not changed. We will remove Work Choices. We will abolish Australian workplace agreements. The other thing that is clear from this debate is that you have not changed. The opposition have not changed. You are still supporting the extreme Work Choices laws, which have meant a stripping away of wages and conditions amongst Australian workers.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—Much of what Senator Wong has said I and the Democrats agree with. As I have pointed out a couple of times already in the chamber today, there can be no questioning the breath-taking hypocrisy of the arguments being put forward by the coalition. Across the board, people expect some degree of malleability, shall we say, in the cogency of the arguments that politicians put forward, but I think they do like to see at least some degree of consistency and intellectual honesty. It is impossible not to draw attention to the extraordinary hypocrisy in the assertions being made by the coalition today, in contrast to the arguments they made just about workplace relations laws, let alone everything else, over the last three years.
Frankly, I would be much more comfortable with what the coalition is putting forward on this—and I would suggest they might consider adopting this approach in regard to other legislation and inquiries, because I am sure we will keep seeing the same thing—if they could stand up and say, ‘Look, we accept that we overdid it; we accept that we were wrong.’ I am not here to give political advice, particularly given my own lack of political success at the last election, but I think it would send a message to stand up and say, ‘We accept that we got it wrong in the way we handled the Senate in the last few years and we are turning over a new leaf.’ Then you could much more credibly argue the positions you are now making about the need for greater scrutiny, rather than just asserting carte blanche that this is right in principle with no reference to your own record and statements over the last few years.
Indeed, I know at the declaration of the Senate poll after the last election, for example, Senator Ian Macdonald from the Queensland Liberals—he was the first elected in Queensland—made the point that he thought the previous coalition government did have some arrogance creeping into it. I think you could make that comment publicly a few more times and it might actually benefit the credibility of your arguments, whether you are putting them here or in the community. But the arguments you put forward are your business, I guess.
The other point that needs to be made is that it is one thing to draw attention to the double standards of the position the coalition is now arguing, but the Senate still has to make its decisions on the basis of what is best, of the issue on its merits. We have to examine the legislation and the proposal before us and decide what is best for the Australian community. Senator Wong again rightly referred to the apparent shift in views of a number of members of the coalition in regard to Work Choices being based upon their recognising the politics of this, and that seems to be quite clear.
Up to a point, there is nothing wrong with that because you are recognising that you might have got it wrong in the past. That would be good, if that statement were to accompany things. I would suggest, particularly in regard to the decisions the Senate makes, that making decisions, particularly about what becomes law and what does not, just on the basis of what is the best politics rather than what is the best policy and the best law is not good. It might be good for people’s election chances, but it is not good for the Australian people. We need to do better at making decisions predominantly based on the best policy rather than the best politics.
I am not being too starry eyed here. We have all taken into account the politics of the decision, but the day that that becomes the primary driver of our decisions is the day that the Australian public loses out. That is something we are all guilty of. I could certainly point to, but I shall not, examples in regard to past decisions of some in the Democrats being motivated more by politics than policy and that not leading to the best outcomes.
We are not debating, per se, the merits of the legislation that the government has put forward, but the proposal, in effect, for when the committee examining it will report. That is basically what we are arguing about. There is no disagreement about the committee it will go to; there is no general disagreement about the terms of reference. It is about the reporting date. We have already had that debate to some extent and both Senator Murray and I put on record that we thought that the time frame of 17 March was, while short, at the edges of what is acceptable in regard to a minimum time frame and something that we could wear. That is the reason that we voted the way we did in the earlier debate on this, but we certainly do not believe that it is problematic to have a somewhat longer time frame. I think the suggestion that was made earlier that, if it is not passed in March, it will not be passed till June ignores the fact that we actually have a sitting week in May.
I will now foreshadow, as part of my comments, the amendment that I have circulated to amend the substantive motion here to express the view that it would better enable full consideration of the committee’s report if the Senate were to sit an extra four days prior to the week beginning 12 May, prior to budget week. That is consistent with the comments I made earlier today and, I might say, yesterday about the Democrats’ view that there needs to be more sitting days across the board, to consider not just this one issue but issues across the board.
The point needs to be made repeatedly that this year we have a record low in the number of sitting days that have been scheduled in a non-election year. Indeed, it is extremely low even for an election year. I made that point yesterday. The Senate could have decided yesterday, when it adopted its sitting days for the year, to add some extra days on. It did not choose to do so and indeed nobody else even spoke to issue other than me. I am pleased to see, perhaps a day late, that today at least the coalition is now joining the Democrats in expressing dissatisfaction at the low number of sitting days.
I believe quite strongly that, if the majority of the Senate believes that there are too few sitting days, the Senate should schedule some extra days. That is within the power of the Senate. I understand—I will be corrected if I am wrong; I do not want to put words in the mouths of the coalition senators—that the coalition does not want to set a precedent of the Senate actually doing that. It is a convention that the government of the day, even if it does not have the numbers in the Senate, determines what the Senate sitting days are. Ideally, it does so with consultation, but at the end of the day the government of the day should decide. There is no doubt that it would set a precedent if the Senate said: ‘Well, that’s nice but the majority of us disagree. We will set and schedule more sitting days.’ That would set a precedent. I think it would be a good precedent to set because it would send the very strong signal to whoever is in government that the Senate is independent of the government and will choose for itself the order of its business, how many days it sits and what it is going to do. This is not in any way to capriciously frustrate the government but to ensure that the Senate is less driven by the political imperatives of the government of the day and more driven by a comprehensive examination of what is best overall. I think it would be a good precedent to set for the Senate to move its own motions to add extra sitting days should it so wish.
I understand the coalition does not want to do that. Certainly, I never got support in previous years when I have moved such motions, so the amendment that I foreshadow simply expresses a view that we would benefit from extra sitting days. I hope at least that would be accepted and recognised as a signal to the new government that we could do with some extra sitting days.
Whilst the substantive motion before us is about the reporting date, in effect, of the committee inquiry into this legislation, I do want to make a few points about the issue of mandate regarding the legislation and the broader issue of Work Choices and AWAs. The issue of mandate is one that is repeatedly put forward by all sides selectively to suit whatever they want to do and it is an extremely hollow theory, frankly. It has some very loose value. Certainly, it is worth noting the decisions of the Australian electorate in regard to how they voted. We note that because that is what ends up being reflected in the number of people in this place and the other place and who is in government. But to claim an automatic imprimatur for rubber-stamping any piece of legislation on the basis of an election result, even on an issue that was pivotal to the election, as I agree Work Choices was, is really stretching the idea of a mandate to the boundaries of intellectual honesty.
If you want a solid mandate, an incontrovertible mandate, on a specific issue then you put it to a referendum or a plebiscite and ask people. There is no other way you can credibly say that the Australian people support this specific issue. You can quote every opinion poll you like. I think the interchangeableness of the terms ‘AWA’ and ‘Work Choices’ that is being employed by the Labor government demonstrates that. I understand why they are doing that. It is good politics to do that. There is some accuracy in it, but there is some inaccuracy in it because AWAs and Work Choices are not synonymous. The particular type of AWAs that were adopted in the Work Choices legislation were unacceptable and extreme. I believe they were strongly opposed by the Australian government, they were certainly categorically opposed by the Democrats and we remain categorically opposed to Work Choices AWAs.
But AWAs in a different form, with a very strong safety net via the no disadvantage test, have been in place since 1996—heavily amended by the Senate and the Democrats in particular. Of course, the government that put them in place was re-elected in 1998, 2001 and 2004, with those AWAs as part of our workplace laws. It was only when it removed that no disadvantage test, bastardising, in my view, the intent behind AWAs, and removed a lot of the protections that were there—they were not perfect protections, but they certainly were reasonably good protections that could have been strengthened further—that it ran into political problems and, I might say, a lot of Australians ran into personal problems, having been subjected to them. But it is not synonymous: getting rid of Work Choices does not necessarily mean scrapping AWAs.
That does not mean we cannot do so, and Labor is in effect replacing one type of individual statutory agreement with another, interim, individual statutory agreement—that is all very good, and you have different labels and everybody can use them to sell their own messages. That is fine, and I am not expressing a view one way or another about the policy intent; I am simply saying that the mandate argument only goes so far. Getting rid of Work Choices, I think, is widely supported. Whether or not you can use that to say that therefore the Senate should rubber-stamp everything the government puts forward as long as the government says, ‘This is getting rid of Work Choices,’ is another matter.
A lot of people wanted to get rid of Work Choices; I do not think there is much doubt about that. Whether there is widespread agreement about what they want to replace it with is very much more in doubt, I think. The vast majority of Australians have an opinion about whether they are for or against Work Choices; there is far less certainty and clarity about what they see as desirable to take its place. In one sense you could say that, if you were ripping up Work Choices, all you would be doing, if you simply repealed the Work Choices law that was passed, would be going back to the pre-Work Choices laws. That is not what Labor is doing—and I am not saying they should do that; I do not believe they should. I am simply saying it is not as simple as just saying you can claim an automatic mandate. It is intellectually dishonest to say so, even though it may be intelligent politics.
Returning to the issue before us—the committee enquiry—the Democrats have already stated that we think 31 days or so to inquire and report is a short amount of time but not inappropriately short for a bill such as this, which is not massively complex. Having said that, we do not think it would be harmful for the time frame to be somewhat longer, as the coalition is proposing, particularly if the Senate put in place extra sitting days, as we believe should occur. As yet I have not read the bill in question, but my understanding is that it has a start-up date past the end of May anyway. So whether it is passed in May or passed in March—if it does get passed, which is a big ‘if’, I might say—my understanding is it still will not come into effect till later down the track. So it will not affect in any way the number of people who are put on AWAs or not put on AWAs.
There are very valid points to be made by the Labor government in pointing to the hypocrisy of the coalition, but I think their argument with regard to the mandate and the suggestion of expeditious rubber-stamping is somewhat thinner. As we move through the process of actually debating the legislation, I do think that point needs to be made more continually. The Labor Party have won the argument on Work Choices, and they were right. On the issue of Work Choices they were joined by the Democrats, the Greens and pretty much everybody except some within the Liberals. They won the argument and they won the election. They have got government, and I would think there is little doubt that that was probably the key factor in the election—not the only factor but the pivotal one. So you won your political argument and you won your election.
We are now dealing with what becomes the law. I am not naive enough to suggest that people should now put aside all political arguments and political point-scoring opportunities, but let us not allow that to dominate the decision the Senate finally makes. Let the Senate make its final decision on the basis of the merits of the legislation that is put forward and the evidence that is put forward in the Senate committee process. Score your points based on that; do not predetermine your position based on continuing the argument from the last election.
Frankly, I do not actually expect that to happen. I think that is a plea that will be widely ignored by all sides. But nonetheless I make it because I do think that would benefit the Australian public and our economy. We are all feverishly scrambling to emphasise economic responsibility and the importance of making sure our economy does not go south and more Australians do not get hurt by some difficult economic times ahead. So let us keep that in mind and match that rhetoric with reality when it comes to considering this and all other legislation.
In case it was not picked up the first time around, I foreshadow the amendment I have circulated to the motion. In effect, we already voted on that. As I said, the Democrats believe 17 March is an adequate minimum time frame, but we do not believe that the sky will come crashing down if that time frame is longer.
 (Senator Watson)—As a matter of procedure, Senator Bartlett, I suggest you move your foreshadowed amendment to the motion after we vote on Senator Wong’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—I am going to show considerable restraint and not get stuck in once again about the former abuse of the committee process as I have already done that twice today and I do not want to bore everybody to tears. At this time I would like to discuss some of the proposed committee terms of reference. The Greens, of course, do believe it is important that this legislation be referred to committee. We believe it should have been done through the selection of bills process and supported the government’s referral to the Selection of Bills Committee, with the reporting date of 17 March. It is interesting to note too that, because the government was not proposing to put any restraints on what the committee could review, any issue would then have been open for a review through that process.
We believe the terms of reference that the opposition are proposing reflect their particular ideology around AWAs and individual statutory agreements in many of the particular points—particularly, terms of reference (c) and (d), which refer to the ‘potential for a wages breakout and increased inflationary pressures’ and the ‘potential for increased industrial disputation’. We believe these terms of reference are pre-empting a particular point of view of the impact of the changes to the legislation and, basically, running the opposition’s political point of view. They are not listening to the fact that the Australian people have said very definitely: ‘We don’t want AWAs. We don’t want them.’ The coalition continue with their particular point of view. They also seem to be a bit confused about AWAs. On the one hand, when it suits them, they reckon AWAs are increasing wages. On the other hand, when it suits them, they reckon getting rid of AWAs is going to lead to a wages breakout. So it is a bit fascinating. If you look at the terms of reference, they have changed the way they refer to AWAs. They are now adopting the term ‘individual statutory agreements’ rather than naming them what they are—AWAs. This is fascinating but it is an acknowledgement of the fact that they realise that AWAs are poisonous and that they know the community hates them. As Senator Wong rightly pointed out, you had to have been fast asleep during the election if you did not work out that a key part of the election was about AWAs and Work Choices.
I also take on board Senator Bartlett’s comments about a mandate. I agree with his comments in that I think the government does have a mandate to change the legislation, to get rid of AWAs and to get rid of Work Choices. But it does not give them the mandate to then just put any legislation in without letting this Senate carry out its proper work of review and scrutiny. With regard to the issue of mandates, the Howard government never went to the electorate with Work Choices; it only brought it in when it realised it had gained control of the Senate at the 2004 election. So, while the Howard government had no mandate for that legislation, the Rudd government was very strongly elected on the basis of industrial relations legislation. However, the Greens do not believe that the Rudd government’s proposed changes, as put forward during the election, went far enough. We will be using the Senate process to review this legislation and to make sure it is delivering much better industrial relations and the much promised industrial relations reform.
It is clear that AWAs fall into two categories: those used to lower wages and those used de-unionise a workplace. It is important that the committee understand the impact of AWAs on workers and what the transitional bill will mean for those workers. We believe there is a critical role to be played to look at this legislation to make sure it is doing what it is purporting to be doing. It is also interesting to note that the opposition do not seem to care about the impact AWAs have had on workers in terms of lowering wages. It is concerned about a wages breakout but it does not seem to be concerned about the impact AWAs have had on lost wages or about the reduction of conditions through these instruments.
The Greens strongly support this legislation being referred to the committee. We have made that abundantly clear ad infinitum in this place over the years. We will be supporting Senator Wong’s proposed amendment for 17 March. If it is unsuccessful, I am persuaded by Senator Bartlett’s arguments about the extra days of sitting. We Greens want to see, in particular, the awful blot of this legislation gone and the awful blot of AWAs in Australia removed. That is why we are putting the effort in to make sure we get across this legislation very quickly so that we are able to look at its impacts and ensure that it is delivering what it is promising to deliver. Let us get on with it. Let us refer this to the committee. As I said, we are not happy with these terms of reference. We would prefer to use the wider Selection of Bills Committee process. But let’s refer it to the committee on 17 March.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee</title>",Committees,20,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I rise to speak in this debate, which is very similar to the debate that took place this morning on another motion about the same matter. Unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to speak then, as the time allowed for that debate was expiring. I want to talk about some of the furphies that have been introduced into this debate over this motion and in relation to the same issues that were raised earlier this morning and try to deal with them, because, quite frankly, I took exception to many of the comments and allegations made about the motives of the government in this matter. This morning Senator Murray referred to this government as a lazy government with respect to trying to have a shorter—than what he would like—inquiry into this legislation. I take exception to those comments and reject them.
Let us just go through the facts about what the government has actually been doing. An enormous amount of work and consultation has been undertaken by this government to get this legislation right, right back from when it was developed as a policy position. We announced our policy intentions about this matter in April 2007 and we provided detailed implementation strategies of the policy in August 2007. These policies have been in the public realm for almost a year.
Since taking government, we have also been involved in a comprehensive consultative process with unions, employers and other experts about the development of our policy position into the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. That has taken place at many levels. There was certainly significant consultation with the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and its subcommittee, the Committee of Industrial Legislation. That involved experts from employer and employee organisations sitting around the table and developing the policy into a bill through consultation. The bill was then subject to discussion at the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council, and the council debated the bill and the effects of the bill and ultimately endorsed the Rudd Labor government’s policy directions and our intention to go forward with the bill. There was enormous consultation. With the greatest of respect—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—Senator Murray knows how difficult that consultation can be. So an enormous amount of hard work has been done by this government to get this bill balanced, fair and right.
I do not suggest for one second that that sort of consultation should replace Senate scrutiny. I am not suggesting that at all. But whenever we talk about referring bills to committees, we need to also look at what is required, the work of the committee, and whether the committee can actually do its job in a particular time frame. Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, you are the new deputy chair of the committee that is going to look at this reference. The Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations was established yesterday, and we have absolutely no work before us. So it is really a question of whether the committee can do the work required by this chamber—or what the government thinks the committee can actually do in terms of scrutinising this bill—in the appropriate time. There should not be any arbitrary minimum time for scrutiny. It really depends upon the size of the bill, its impact and the amount of time it has been in the public domain.
Contrast that consultation process with that of the Work Choices legislation itself. Had anyone seen it? No. It was developed in secret with some employer-friendly lawyers over a long period of time. There was very little consultation. We did not have any idea what was in it. There was never any policy position put out from the government. They certainly did not go to an election with any detailed policy or implementation plans. They put it in this place and effectively gave us a single day of hearings when we had to jam through all the people who wanted to make substantial submissions. It was really an obstructed Senate process as far as I was concerned, and we had a very short time to do it.
Senator Ellison made some reference this morning to the size of the bill. He said that it was some 100 pages in length. Let me remind the Senate that the Work Choices legislation was some 800 pages in length. And, after the truncated Senate scrutiny process, when we got to the day when the bill was going to be debated in the chamber, we had another 100 pages of amendments put on the table, none of which would have substantially changed the legislation.
We do not say that we do not want to have Senate scrutiny. In fact we say we do want to have Senate scrutiny. But what we also want to do is to make sure that the bill is passed in a reasonable time frame to put an end to AWAs. That was clearly what we went to the election with. We said we would end AWAs and that is what we will do. We have worked with unions, employers and academics to develop a bill resulting from our public policy position that was front and centre going into the election. I acknowledge that Senator Ellison acknowledged that this morning. He said that industrial relations were front and centre in the election—absolutely. There were no secrets about what our policy was, and we have gone through a comprehensive, consultative process right up until now.
Now that we are at the point where we have done that, we have a bill that in today’s press was described by Heather Ridout, Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, as being ‘balanced and fair’. I make the point that people from employer organisations can say that because of the work that was done by this government in developing this consultative process. Again, I make the point: that does not mean we do not need a proper Senate scrutiny process; we do. That is what we support. But the committee can clearly do this work in the time that has been allocated by the government. We have no other work before us. We have been in the position many times when we have had to work very hard, and I object to some of the statements that were made this morning by Senator Ellison, when he said: ‘Let’s do the hard work. What this government is scared of is doing the hard work.’ We want to do the hard work on our committee. We can do that hard work and carry out a proper scrutiny process—hear from everyone who wants to be heard and go wherever we need to go to hear from those people. But a lot of that work has already been done, as I outlined earlier in my contribution.
I reject the argument that this is the result of a government wanting to ram this legislation through. We want to do no such thing. But, because we have engaged in such a comprehensive consultative process and clearly made our policy position public over the last 12 months, clearly put it before the Australian people at the federal election and clearly got endorsement from them to do what we want to do, we want to get on and do it. The committee can do it in that time frame and the Senate should allow us to do that.
We had many furphies introduced into the debate about the sitting calendar. Quite frankly, the motion before us is not about the sitting calendar of the Senate. That is an important issue, but that is a different debate. It has been introduced into this debate simply as a red herring. The question before us is whether the committee can perform a proper scrutiny of this legislation in the time that the government would like, and the answer to that is yes. The opposition’s argument is not for the Senate to play a new-found, active scrutiny role. I have rarely seen that in the time I have been here, which is nearly six years. They are simply using that argument to frustrate this government’s legislative agenda, something that we have an absolute, clear and unambiguous mandate from the Australian people to introduce. Let me put some of those arguments to bed. As I said, if you want to have a debate about the Senate sitting calendar, let us have that debate at some point in time. But let us not confuse that argument with the process of referring a bill to a committee, because the committee is going to do its work outside of parliamentary sitting times anyway.
We have had to suffer some of the most ridiculous arguments about hypocrisy, as if our wanting to pursue our legislative agenda and give an appropriate level of time for Senate scrutiny, allowing the Senate committee to do its work, was somehow taking the reverse position of what we argued when we were in opposition. We are not saying that we want to simply ram the bill through. We are not doing what the previous government did on the Telstra bill. We are not doing what they did on numerous other bills, such as the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Vocational Rehabilitation Services) Bill 2006. To put the record straight on that, the previous government opened up and awarded tenders for that process before they even introduced the bill, completely bypassing any Senate scrutiny process. They had a token inquiry at the end, but it was after it was all done and dusted because of their abuse of their numbers in the Senate.
Their arguments are just not true. We want to have, and will have, a proper scrutiny process. But the difference is we can do it in the time we say because of the enormous consultation with stakeholders that has already taken place, because of the public nature of our policy implementation position and the development of that into the bill.
The opposition do not seem to have understood the result of the election. The only choice Work Choices ever gave any worker was ‘take it or leave it’. The instrument which delivered that choice was the AWA. We were absolutely clear about wanting to remove that instrument. That is what the Australian people voted for in the previous election. We want to do that. The previous government want to frustrate us in doing that. They know that thousands and thousands of AWAs are still being made unfairly and that people are still losing conditions and pay, but they are still ideologically attached to AWAs.
We have heard all sorts of comments. I actually heard the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Brendan Nelson, say that he is going to ensure that we deliver on our election promises. He is going to ensure that! Let us make no mistake: one of our election promises was the introduction of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 and the abolition of AWAs. That was one of our election promises, but what do we see from coalition senators? We simply see an attempt to frustrate that promise and to push the introduction of the bill out past the parliamentary sittings so that it cannot be passed for many months. So AWAs will continue in operation and the previous government will delay our election promises and implementing the mandate that we received.
I reject the arguments that have been put forward by the opposition. As I said, I also take exception to and reject the arguments put by Senator Murray in respect of how we got to this point. We support proper Senate scrutiny. We have always done so. The previous government cannot make that claim. Like Senator Siewert, I do not need to go into all the numerous examples. We have talked about them over the last couple of years. There are many examples of where the previous government used the Senate numbers to avoid any form of Senate scrutiny. They are trying to run the line that that is what we are doing when clearly we are not. You could not have a more transparent process than the one the new government have undertaken. This is simply a way to frustrate this government implementing its legislative agenda.
Let me say again very clearly that, as chair of the committee that this bill will be referred to, in my view, the committee is able to conduct a proper, thorough Senate scrutiny process of this legislation within the time frame outlined in Senator Wong’s amendment. It has no other work to do at this point in time. We are able to do it. In fact, we proved that we were able to do it many times in the past, even when the previous government set us much more unrealistic expectations than the time frame that we are suggesting at the moment. We have the ability to do this. The Senate has the ability to do this. The integrity of the Senate will be protected through this process. This argument can be for no reason other than that the former government is seeking to frustrate the introduction of this bill for debate in the Senate chamber.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-14,"—At the request of Senator Abetz, I move:
That, upon its introduction into the House of Representatives, the provisions of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 be referred to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee for inquiry and report by 28 April 2008, with particular reference to:
economic and social impacts from the abolition of individual statutory agreements;
impact on employment;
potential for a wages breakout and increased inflationary pressures;
potential for increased industrial disputation;
impact on sectors heavily reliant on individual statutory agreements; and
impact on productivity.
This is a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. It is an extremely important bill and one which needs adequate time for scrutiny. We have had a good deal of debate today about the necessity of scrutiny by the Senate and the use of legislative standing committees, and this is what this motion does. We have had those ad hoc issues referred to select committees. This is a bill going to a Senate legislation standing committee—and quite rightly so. But the issue at hand is the length of time of scrutiny for this committee. The reporting date in the motion is 28 April. That gives the Senate committee adequate time over the break to travel Australia and to engage those people who have an interest in this area, which is vital to all Australians and, indeed, was one of the major issues in the last election.
The government proposed an earlier reporting date around mid-March. Of course, in between, we have estimates committees sitting and other sitting weeks. It is the view of the coalition that more time is needed for such an important bill. This is something which needs to be considered carefully and, as indicated in the terms of reference—which, whilst general, also refer to some specific areas—is vital to this country and, of course, the scrutiny that goes with it is essential. Many Australians have concerns, one way or another, about this legislation. As I said, it was a major issue in the last election. It is therefore imperative that we have that time within which to report. And might I say that the government’s proposal would have seen this come back in the second sitting week in March, as I recall, and it would have left just three days—just three days—to pass what is a very important bill before that lengthy break in April. So the government was giving us a short period for scrutiny by the committee and an even shorter time for debate in the Senate. Previously we made an offer to the government to bring the date forward and also have an extra sitting week, but the government has rejected that. So we have reverted to the original notice of motion which has a reporting date of 28 April and which will provide adequate time for debate in the May and June sitting weeks in the Senate. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,20,2

Omit all words from and including “28 April 2008”, substitute “17 March 2008”.
I think it is very important that we are very clear in this chamber and also externally about precisely what is occurring here. We have an opposition who are ideologically committed to Work Choices, an issue that played extremely large in last year’s election, and who are desperately trying to push out the date on which AWAs are abolished in this country. That is simply what it is: the opposition are refusing to accept the decision of the Australian people at the last election and are desperately clinging on to this Work Choices totemic issue to which they are so bound. They cannot think any other way.
This is an opposition whose position is that they want to continue the unfair Australian workplace agreements which we know have continued over the period of the Howard government, since they were introduced, to strip away wages and conditions from workers, particularly disadvantaged workers. So I place the opposition on notice: the Australian people will know that, for every day that you delay the passage of this bill through putting in place an unduly lengthy Senate inquiry, every AWA that is put in place where a young worker or any worker is asked to strip away conditions they would otherwise have received under Labor’s fairer industrial relations policy will be on your heads. This is after an election where no-one could say that anyone in Australia did not understand the difference between the parties on industrial relations. Leave aside all the colour and movement and smokescreens that Senators Minchin and Abetz and Ellison are trying to put into this debate.
At its core, this debate is about an opposition who are ideologically shackled to Australian workplace agreement, an opposition who cannot bear to let go the hard Right agenda about stripping wages and conditions from workers, an opposition who cannot bear the fact that this was an issue on which they clearly did not win the support of the Australian people at the last election. It is extraordinary, isn’t it, really, when you consider the high profile, the centrality of the issue of industrial relations at the election on 24 November? There is a lot of discussion in this chamber at various times about mandates. From memory, I have had the lecture—and I am sure the crossbenchers have at various times—from the previous government about their mandates. That is an issue that gets debated.
But let us be very clear about this. I do not think there was anybody in this country who paid any attention to the last election campaign who would not have considered industrial relations to have been the key issue, the issue that was most front and centre for the longest period, the issue that was most clearly debated, the issue where there were detailed and clear differences between the parties. This was an issue where Labor clearly have a very detailed mandate. The Australian people knew exactly what we were going to do on industrial relations. And they know exactly what you were doing, and they will know in coming weeks if your motion succeeds—because, as you know, you still have the numbers in this chamber—what you are doing by pushing out this reporting date. They will also know that any Australian workplace agreement that is put in place between when this bill should have been dealt with by the Senate and when you are proposing to deal with it is on your heads.
There are a number of particular issues that Senator Minchin mentioned in his earlier contribution to discussion on the Selection of Bills Committee about scrutiny. Firstly, on the issue of scrutiny, people may recall, as I said, that industrial relations was a central issue in the last election campaign. People may recall that Labor put out not only one but two policies in relation to industrial relations. We put out our Forward with Fairness policy and then we put out a very detailed implementation plan. It was far more detailed than anything we ever got from the former Howard government at the election prior to them introducing these extreme workplace laws that Labor are trying to remove through this legislation. I do not remember the former member for Bennelong ever coming out in the 2004 election and saying, ‘By the way, I am going to put in place contracts which allow you to have conditions stripped away without any no disadvantage test or without any reference to awards, which allow young workers to be exploited.’ I do not remember that being an issue that you campaigned on.
In contrast, we put out our policy in, I believe, April of last year, but I could be corrected on that date. Then we put out a very detailed implementation plan. The bill that is the subject of the referral that we are discussing is true to the implementation plan and the policies that we put out for scrutiny and upon which we were elected. This opposition in this chamber is trying to stop the abolition of Australian workplace agreements. You want the bill pushed out. You want more time for more AWAs. You do not want to abolish them because you still believe, despite the fact that you lost the election, that these are good things.
In terms of the time frame—and we have had some discussion about that and I think Senator Siewert has also made this point—we can look at some of the time frames around the legislation introduced by the previous government when it announced it was going to change the law to introduce a fairness test, and the scrutiny that this chamber was allowed to give that legislation. The former government’s Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Bill 2007 was introduced in the House on 28 May and passed on 30 May and the Senate committee commenced its inquiries as soon as the bill was introduced in the House. The bill was introduced in the Senate on 13 June. The Senate committee report was tabled on 14 June and the bill passed on 20 June. So, when you were in government, for your safety net bill there were fewer than four weeks between its introduction into the House and its passage by the Senate, including the Senate committee inquiry.
The Australian people gave us a very clear mandate to implement this legislation. They understood very clearly what Labor’s policy was on these issues. We put out publicly our policy and our implementation plan. What those opposite are arguing for is a time frame far longer for consideration of this bill than they demanded of themselves in government. It is interesting, isn’t it? The shoe is on the other foot now. They are on the other side of the chamber now, but when the opposition were in government and retained control of this chamber they were very happy to rush things through and to have short inquires to suit their political purposes. They are now arguing for longer debate and longer consideration of this bill, which very clearly implements the policies that we articulated in detail prior to the election. If you want to talk in terms of a mandate, we have far more of a mandate for this legislation—given the detail, the discussion and the political focus on this issue prior to the election—than you ever had, when you were the government, for the safety net bill, as I have outlined.
Isn’t it amazing how things change when you cross over? There is only one explanation, and it is the one I started with: this is an opposition that cannot bear the fact that this legislation will remove Australian workplace agreements. I should not say that this is an opposition that cannot bear that fact. I think that is the position of most of the opposition, but we have had a fair bit of toing and froing on their side, with some people suggesting they should fold on this issue and others suggesting they should not—not because those who want to allow passage of this legislation or have a different view on the legislation have had a change of heart or have a different philosophical view; they just recognise the politics of this. Anybody who campaigned during this election—and I assume other senators also campaigned—knows that this was front and centre. For Senator Webber, who I know worked very hard in WA, it was a front and centre issue—as it was across the country. No-one could say that they did not understand that Kevin Rudd and Labor were standing for the abolition of AWAs.
So let us understand what is happening. The opposition is saying: ‘We don’t want to abolish AWAs. We don’t care that this was an issue in the election campaign. We don’t care that we lost the election. We don’t care that the government has got a mandate. We don’t care that the Australian people elected a government that was committed to doing this. We want to delay this as long as possible.’ Let us understand that that is what the motion will do. It will push this out to 28 April and we all know, given the sitting schedule, what that will mean.
The government is absolutely determined to press on with our amendments to these unfair laws. We absolutely will keep faith with the commitment we gave to the Australian people to remove Australian workplace agreements. We absolutely will keep faith with the policies and plans that we put forward and, in this area, the transitional arrangements that we articulated. We will push forward on that and Australians will know, if those on the other side continue to stonewall, who is responsible for the continuation of Australian workplace agreements in this country.
There was some discussion in the earlier debate about sitting hours. I want to make it very clear what the government’s position is. I have moved an amendment that requires a reporting date of 17 March. If that is passed, we will ensure that the bill is passed as expeditiously as possible. I flag to the chamber and to the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate that, if additional sitting hours or days are required in order to pass this bill, the government will put those in place. We are committed to the passage of this legislation. So the challenge to the opposition is this: are you going to accept the fact that Australian workplace agreements are clearly something that the Australian people have rejected, or are you going to try to use the Senate processes to delay as long as possible the dismantling of these laws, which were soundly rejected at the most recent election?
I want to make it clear also that not only is this a bill in which this government is meeting its clear election commitments to the Australian people; it is a bill which is a product of genuine consultation. This may not be something those opposite understand. Not only was this bill put to the Australian people, who overwhelmingly endorsed it in effect at the last election, but the policy and detail of this bill went to the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and its subcommittee on industrial relations. So this is a bill that has been worked on by experts from employer and employee organisations sitting around a table and, as a result of that consultation process, I understand the bill has been improved. We have also held consultations with state workplace relations ministers.
Because there has been a lot of discussion about scrutiny from the other side, I again want to make it clear that the government is not opposed to proper scrutiny of the bill. However, the government wants to ensure that this opposition does not unduly delay or frustrate the will of the Australian people being implemented into law. I again remind the chamber that the last time this parliament dealt with a piece of industrial relations legislation we dealt with the so-called fairness test. Again, I remind the chamber that that legislation, with all its complexity and uncertainty—and we saw some of that after its implementation—was processed within four sitting weeks, including a Senate inquiry. The then government, the current opposition, then believed that four sitting weeks was an appropriate length of time, inclusive of a Senate inquiry, for parliamentary scrutiny of a piece of industrial relations legislation which had not been put to the Australian people and which was announced—let us remember this—before it had even been drafted.
To those who might recall, send your minds back to May last year, I think it was. The government actually announced what it was going to do before it had the legislation ready. So we had this very strange situation where employers and employees were told something publicly that was in effect not enacted, nor was the legislation or the clarity around it introduced into the parliament.
I again remind those opposite that we announced our policy intentions in our Forward with Fairness policy in April last year—that is 10 months ago—and we provided the implementation details of our policy, to which I have already referred, in August last year. That was some three months before the election. It is our very strong view on this side of the chamber that, if four weeks was good enough for the consideration of the previous government’s so-called fairness test legislation, inclusive of a Senate inquiry, it is certainly good enough for the processing of this Labor government’s clear and simple transitional legislation.
This is a challenge for the opposition. Are they actually going to accept the will of the Australian people? Are they going to fairly and properly deal with this legislation or are they going to frustrate its passage? Those watching can only draw one conclusion from the delay that the opposition are proposing, and that is this: that you have not changed. The opposition have not changed. This is the same Liberal Party and National Party that were dedicated to deregulating the industrial relations system such that workers become substantially disadvantaged. This is the same coalition that supported the extreme Work Choices laws, the laws which we know are the most extreme this country has ever seen. This is the same coalition that supported and championed the Australian workplace agreements that we know stripped away the wages and conditions of Australian workers.
So what is happening in this chamber today is that the opposition are refusing to allow the abolition of Australian workplace agreements. That is what the opposition are doing. They are refusing to allow the expeditious passage of a piece of legislation which the Australian people voted for, because the Australian people voted for the dismantling of Work Choices. They knew exactly what the Labor Party’s position was on this, and they knew exactly what yours was as well. One thing we can take out of this debate is this: the opposition have not changed. We will remove Work Choices. We will abolish Australian workplace agreements. The other thing that is clear from this debate is that you have not changed. The opposition have not changed. You are still supporting the extreme Work Choices laws, which have meant a stripping away of wages and conditions amongst Australian workers.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,20,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—Much of what Senator Wong has said I and the Democrats agree with. As I have pointed out a couple of times already in the chamber today, there can be no questioning the breath-taking hypocrisy of the arguments being put forward by the coalition. Across the board, people expect some degree of malleability, shall we say, in the cogency of the arguments that politicians put forward, but I think they do like to see at least some degree of consistency and intellectual honesty. It is impossible not to draw attention to the extraordinary hypocrisy in the assertions being made by the coalition today, in contrast to the arguments they made just about workplace relations laws, let alone everything else, over the last three years.
Frankly, I would be much more comfortable with what the coalition is putting forward on this—and I would suggest they might consider adopting this approach in regard to other legislation and inquiries, because I am sure we will keep seeing the same thing—if they could stand up and say, ‘Look, we accept that we overdid it; we accept that we were wrong.’ I am not here to give political advice, particularly given my own lack of political success at the last election, but I think it would send a message to stand up and say, ‘We accept that we got it wrong in the way we handled the Senate in the last few years and we are turning over a new leaf.’ Then you could much more credibly argue the positions you are now making about the need for greater scrutiny, rather than just asserting carte blanche that this is right in principle with no reference to your own record and statements over the last few years.
Indeed, I know at the declaration of the Senate poll after the last election, for example, Senator Ian Macdonald from the Queensland Liberals—he was the first elected in Queensland—made the point that he thought the previous coalition government did have some arrogance creeping into it. I think you could make that comment publicly a few more times and it might actually benefit the credibility of your arguments, whether you are putting them here or in the community. But the arguments you put forward are your business, I guess.
The other point that needs to be made is that it is one thing to draw attention to the double standards of the position the coalition is now arguing, but the Senate still has to make its decisions on the basis of what is best, of the issue on its merits. We have to examine the legislation and the proposal before us and decide what is best for the Australian community. Senator Wong again rightly referred to the apparent shift in views of a number of members of the coalition in regard to Work Choices being based upon their recognising the politics of this, and that seems to be quite clear.
Up to a point, there is nothing wrong with that because you are recognising that you might have got it wrong in the past. That would be good, if that statement were to accompany things. I would suggest, particularly in regard to the decisions the Senate makes, that making decisions, particularly about what becomes law and what does not, just on the basis of what is the best politics rather than what is the best policy and the best law is not good. It might be good for people’s election chances, but it is not good for the Australian people. We need to do better at making decisions predominantly based on the best policy rather than the best politics.
I am not being too starry eyed here. We have all taken into account the politics of the decision, but the day that that becomes the primary driver of our decisions is the day that the Australian public loses out. That is something we are all guilty of. I could certainly point to, but I shall not, examples in regard to past decisions of some in the Democrats being motivated more by politics than policy and that not leading to the best outcomes.
We are not debating, per se, the merits of the legislation that the government has put forward, but the proposal, in effect, for when the committee examining it will report. That is basically what we are arguing about. There is no disagreement about the committee it will go to; there is no general disagreement about the terms of reference. It is about the reporting date. We have already had that debate to some extent and both Senator Murray and I put on record that we thought that the time frame of 17 March was, while short, at the edges of what is acceptable in regard to a minimum time frame and something that we could wear. That is the reason that we voted the way we did in the earlier debate on this, but we certainly do not believe that it is problematic to have a somewhat longer time frame. I think the suggestion that was made earlier that, if it is not passed in March, it will not be passed till June ignores the fact that we actually have a sitting week in May.
I will now foreshadow, as part of my comments, the amendment that I have circulated to amend the substantive motion here to express the view that it would better enable full consideration of the committee’s report if the Senate were to sit an extra four days prior to the week beginning 12 May, prior to budget week. That is consistent with the comments I made earlier today and, I might say, yesterday about the Democrats’ view that there needs to be more sitting days across the board, to consider not just this one issue but issues across the board.
The point needs to be made repeatedly that this year we have a record low in the number of sitting days that have been scheduled in a non-election year. Indeed, it is extremely low even for an election year. I made that point yesterday. The Senate could have decided yesterday, when it adopted its sitting days for the year, to add some extra days on. It did not choose to do so and indeed nobody else even spoke to issue other than me. I am pleased to see, perhaps a day late, that today at least the coalition is now joining the Democrats in expressing dissatisfaction at the low number of sitting days.
I believe quite strongly that, if the majority of the Senate believes that there are too few sitting days, the Senate should schedule some extra days. That is within the power of the Senate. I understand—I will be corrected if I am wrong; I do not want to put words in the mouths of the coalition senators—that the coalition does not want to set a precedent of the Senate actually doing that. It is a convention that the government of the day, even if it does not have the numbers in the Senate, determines what the Senate sitting days are. Ideally, it does so with consultation, but at the end of the day the government of the day should decide. There is no doubt that it would set a precedent if the Senate said: ‘Well, that’s nice but the majority of us disagree. We will set and schedule more sitting days.’ That would set a precedent. I think it would be a good precedent to set because it would send the very strong signal to whoever is in government that the Senate is independent of the government and will choose for itself the order of its business, how many days it sits and what it is going to do. This is not in any way to capriciously frustrate the government but to ensure that the Senate is less driven by the political imperatives of the government of the day and more driven by a comprehensive examination of what is best overall. I think it would be a good precedent to set for the Senate to move its own motions to add extra sitting days should it so wish.
I understand the coalition does not want to do that. Certainly, I never got support in previous years when I have moved such motions, so the amendment that I foreshadow simply expresses a view that we would benefit from extra sitting days. I hope at least that would be accepted and recognised as a signal to the new government that we could do with some extra sitting days.
Whilst the substantive motion before us is about the reporting date, in effect, of the committee inquiry into this legislation, I do want to make a few points about the issue of mandate regarding the legislation and the broader issue of Work Choices and AWAs. The issue of mandate is one that is repeatedly put forward by all sides selectively to suit whatever they want to do and it is an extremely hollow theory, frankly. It has some very loose value. Certainly, it is worth noting the decisions of the Australian electorate in regard to how they voted. We note that because that is what ends up being reflected in the number of people in this place and the other place and who is in government. But to claim an automatic imprimatur for rubber-stamping any piece of legislation on the basis of an election result, even on an issue that was pivotal to the election, as I agree Work Choices was, is really stretching the idea of a mandate to the boundaries of intellectual honesty.
If you want a solid mandate, an incontrovertible mandate, on a specific issue then you put it to a referendum or a plebiscite and ask people. There is no other way you can credibly say that the Australian people support this specific issue. You can quote every opinion poll you like. I think the interchangeableness of the terms ‘AWA’ and ‘Work Choices’ that is being employed by the Labor government demonstrates that. I understand why they are doing that. It is good politics to do that. There is some accuracy in it, but there is some inaccuracy in it because AWAs and Work Choices are not synonymous. The particular type of AWAs that were adopted in the Work Choices legislation were unacceptable and extreme. I believe they were strongly opposed by the Australian government, they were certainly categorically opposed by the Democrats and we remain categorically opposed to Work Choices AWAs.
But AWAs in a different form, with a very strong safety net via the no disadvantage test, have been in place since 1996—heavily amended by the Senate and the Democrats in particular. Of course, the government that put them in place was re-elected in 1998, 2001 and 2004, with those AWAs as part of our workplace laws. It was only when it removed that no disadvantage test, bastardising, in my view, the intent behind AWAs, and removed a lot of the protections that were there—they were not perfect protections, but they certainly were reasonably good protections that could have been strengthened further—that it ran into political problems and, I might say, a lot of Australians ran into personal problems, having been subjected to them. But it is not synonymous: getting rid of Work Choices does not necessarily mean scrapping AWAs.
That does not mean we cannot do so, and Labor is in effect replacing one type of individual statutory agreement with another, interim, individual statutory agreement—that is all very good, and you have different labels and everybody can use them to sell their own messages. That is fine, and I am not expressing a view one way or another about the policy intent; I am simply saying that the mandate argument only goes so far. Getting rid of Work Choices, I think, is widely supported. Whether or not you can use that to say that therefore the Senate should rubber-stamp everything the government puts forward as long as the government says, ‘This is getting rid of Work Choices,’ is another matter.
A lot of people wanted to get rid of Work Choices; I do not think there is much doubt about that. Whether there is widespread agreement about what they want to replace it with is very much more in doubt, I think. The vast majority of Australians have an opinion about whether they are for or against Work Choices; there is far less certainty and clarity about what they see as desirable to take its place. In one sense you could say that, if you were ripping up Work Choices, all you would be doing, if you simply repealed the Work Choices law that was passed, would be going back to the pre-Work Choices laws. That is not what Labor is doing—and I am not saying they should do that; I do not believe they should. I am simply saying it is not as simple as just saying you can claim an automatic mandate. It is intellectually dishonest to say so, even though it may be intelligent politics.
Returning to the issue before us—the committee enquiry—the Democrats have already stated that we think 31 days or so to inquire and report is a short amount of time but not inappropriately short for a bill such as this, which is not massively complex. Having said that, we do not think it would be harmful for the time frame to be somewhat longer, as the coalition is proposing, particularly if the Senate put in place extra sitting days, as we believe should occur. As yet I have not read the bill in question, but my understanding is that it has a start-up date past the end of May anyway. So whether it is passed in May or passed in March—if it does get passed, which is a big ‘if’, I might say—my understanding is it still will not come into effect till later down the track. So it will not affect in any way the number of people who are put on AWAs or not put on AWAs.
There are very valid points to be made by the Labor government in pointing to the hypocrisy of the coalition, but I think their argument with regard to the mandate and the suggestion of expeditious rubber-stamping is somewhat thinner. As we move through the process of actually debating the legislation, I do think that point needs to be made more continually. The Labor Party have won the argument on Work Choices, and they were right. On the issue of Work Choices they were joined by the Democrats, the Greens and pretty much everybody except some within the Liberals. They won the argument and they won the election. They have got government, and I would think there is little doubt that that was probably the key factor in the election—not the only factor but the pivotal one. So you won your political argument and you won your election.
We are now dealing with what becomes the law. I am not naive enough to suggest that people should now put aside all political arguments and political point-scoring opportunities, but let us not allow that to dominate the decision the Senate finally makes. Let the Senate make its final decision on the basis of the merits of the legislation that is put forward and the evidence that is put forward in the Senate committee process. Score your points based on that; do not predetermine your position based on continuing the argument from the last election.
Frankly, I do not actually expect that to happen. I think that is a plea that will be widely ignored by all sides. But nonetheless I make it because I do think that would benefit the Australian public and our economy. We are all feverishly scrambling to emphasise economic responsibility and the importance of making sure our economy does not go south and more Australians do not get hurt by some difficult economic times ahead. So let us keep that in mind and match that rhetoric with reality when it comes to considering this and all other legislation.
In case it was not picked up the first time around, I foreshadow the amendment I have circulated to the motion. In effect, we already voted on that. As I said, the Democrats believe 17 March is an adequate minimum time frame, but we do not believe that the sky will come crashing down if that time frame is longer.
 (Senator Watson)—As a matter of procedure, Senator Bartlett, I suggest you move your foreshadowed amendment to the motion after we vote on Senator Wong’s amendment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,20,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—I am going to show considerable restraint and not get stuck in once again about the former abuse of the committee process as I have already done that twice today and I do not want to bore everybody to tears. At this time I would like to discuss some of the proposed committee terms of reference. The Greens, of course, do believe it is important that this legislation be referred to committee. We believe it should have been done through the selection of bills process and supported the government’s referral to the Selection of Bills Committee, with the reporting date of 17 March. It is interesting to note too that, because the government was not proposing to put any restraints on what the committee could review, any issue would then have been open for a review through that process.
We believe the terms of reference that the opposition are proposing reflect their particular ideology around AWAs and individual statutory agreements in many of the particular points—particularly, terms of reference (c) and (d), which refer to the ‘potential for a wages breakout and increased inflationary pressures’ and the ‘potential for increased industrial disputation’. We believe these terms of reference are pre-empting a particular point of view of the impact of the changes to the legislation and, basically, running the opposition’s political point of view. They are not listening to the fact that the Australian people have said very definitely: ‘We don’t want AWAs. We don’t want them.’ The coalition continue with their particular point of view. They also seem to be a bit confused about AWAs. On the one hand, when it suits them, they reckon AWAs are increasing wages. On the other hand, when it suits them, they reckon getting rid of AWAs is going to lead to a wages breakout. So it is a bit fascinating. If you look at the terms of reference, they have changed the way they refer to AWAs. They are now adopting the term ‘individual statutory agreements’ rather than naming them what they are—AWAs. This is fascinating but it is an acknowledgement of the fact that they realise that AWAs are poisonous and that they know the community hates them. As Senator Wong rightly pointed out, you had to have been fast asleep during the election if you did not work out that a key part of the election was about AWAs and Work Choices.
I also take on board Senator Bartlett’s comments about a mandate. I agree with his comments in that I think the government does have a mandate to change the legislation, to get rid of AWAs and to get rid of Work Choices. But it does not give them the mandate to then just put any legislation in without letting this Senate carry out its proper work of review and scrutiny. With regard to the issue of mandates, the Howard government never went to the electorate with Work Choices; it only brought it in when it realised it had gained control of the Senate at the 2004 election. So, while the Howard government had no mandate for that legislation, the Rudd government was very strongly elected on the basis of industrial relations legislation. However, the Greens do not believe that the Rudd government’s proposed changes, as put forward during the election, went far enough. We will be using the Senate process to review this legislation and to make sure it is delivering much better industrial relations and the much promised industrial relations reform.
It is clear that AWAs fall into two categories: those used to lower wages and those used de-unionise a workplace. It is important that the committee understand the impact of AWAs on workers and what the transitional bill will mean for those workers. We believe there is a critical role to be played to look at this legislation to make sure it is doing what it is purporting to be doing. It is also interesting to note that the opposition do not seem to care about the impact AWAs have had on workers in terms of lowering wages. It is concerned about a wages breakout but it does not seem to be concerned about the impact AWAs have had on lost wages or about the reduction of conditions through these instruments.
The Greens strongly support this legislation being referred to the committee. We have made that abundantly clear ad infinitum in this place over the years. We will be supporting Senator Wong’s proposed amendment for 17 March. If it is unsuccessful, I am persuaded by Senator Bartlett’s arguments about the extra days of sitting. We Greens want to see, in particular, the awful blot of this legislation gone and the awful blot of AWAs in Australia removed. That is why we are putting the effort in to make sure we get across this legislation very quickly so that we are able to look at its impacts and ensure that it is delivering what it is promising to deliver. Let us get on with it. Let us refer this to the committee. As I said, we are not happy with these terms of reference. We would prefer to use the wider Selection of Bills Committee process. But let’s refer it to the committee on 17 March.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,20,2
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I rise to speak in this debate, which is very similar to the debate that took place this morning on another motion about the same matter. Unfortunately, I did not get an opportunity to speak then, as the time allowed for that debate was expiring. I want to talk about some of the furphies that have been introduced into this debate over this motion and in relation to the same issues that were raised earlier this morning and try to deal with them, because, quite frankly, I took exception to many of the comments and allegations made about the motives of the government in this matter. This morning Senator Murray referred to this government as a lazy government with respect to trying to have a shorter—than what he would like—inquiry into this legislation. I take exception to those comments and reject them.
Let us just go through the facts about what the government has actually been doing. An enormous amount of work and consultation has been undertaken by this government to get this legislation right, right back from when it was developed as a policy position. We announced our policy intentions about this matter in April 2007 and we provided detailed implementation strategies of the policy in August 2007. These policies have been in the public realm for almost a year.
Since taking government, we have also been involved in a comprehensive consultative process with unions, employers and other experts about the development of our policy position into the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. That has taken place at many levels. There was certainly significant consultation with the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and its subcommittee, the Committee of Industrial Legislation. That involved experts from employer and employee organisations sitting around the table and developing the policy into a bill through consultation. The bill was then subject to discussion at the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council, and the council debated the bill and the effects of the bill and ultimately endorsed the Rudd Labor government’s policy directions and our intention to go forward with the bill. There was enormous consultation. With the greatest of respect—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—Senator Murray knows how difficult that consultation can be. So an enormous amount of hard work has been done by this government to get this bill balanced, fair and right.
I do not suggest for one second that that sort of consultation should replace Senate scrutiny. I am not suggesting that at all. But whenever we talk about referring bills to committees, we need to also look at what is required, the work of the committee, and whether the committee can actually do its job in a particular time frame. Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, you are the new deputy chair of the committee that is going to look at this reference. The Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations was established yesterday, and we have absolutely no work before us. So it is really a question of whether the committee can do the work required by this chamber—or what the government thinks the committee can actually do in terms of scrutinising this bill—in the appropriate time. There should not be any arbitrary minimum time for scrutiny. It really depends upon the size of the bill, its impact and the amount of time it has been in the public domain.
Contrast that consultation process with that of the Work Choices legislation itself. Had anyone seen it? No. It was developed in secret with some employer-friendly lawyers over a long period of time. There was very little consultation. We did not have any idea what was in it. There was never any policy position put out from the government. They certainly did not go to an election with any detailed policy or implementation plans. They put it in this place and effectively gave us a single day of hearings when we had to jam through all the people who wanted to make substantial submissions. It was really an obstructed Senate process as far as I was concerned, and we had a very short time to do it.
Senator Ellison made some reference this morning to the size of the bill. He said that it was some 100 pages in length. Let me remind the Senate that the Work Choices legislation was some 800 pages in length. And, after the truncated Senate scrutiny process, when we got to the day when the bill was going to be debated in the chamber, we had another 100 pages of amendments put on the table, none of which would have substantially changed the legislation.
We do not say that we do not want to have Senate scrutiny. In fact we say we do want to have Senate scrutiny. But what we also want to do is to make sure that the bill is passed in a reasonable time frame to put an end to AWAs. That was clearly what we went to the election with. We said we would end AWAs and that is what we will do. We have worked with unions, employers and academics to develop a bill resulting from our public policy position that was front and centre going into the election. I acknowledge that Senator Ellison acknowledged that this morning. He said that industrial relations were front and centre in the election—absolutely. There were no secrets about what our policy was, and we have gone through a comprehensive, consultative process right up until now.
Now that we are at the point where we have done that, we have a bill that in today’s press was described by Heather Ridout, Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, as being ‘balanced and fair’. I make the point that people from employer organisations can say that because of the work that was done by this government in developing this consultative process. Again, I make the point: that does not mean we do not need a proper Senate scrutiny process; we do. That is what we support. But the committee can clearly do this work in the time that has been allocated by the government. We have no other work before us. We have been in the position many times when we have had to work very hard, and I object to some of the statements that were made this morning by Senator Ellison, when he said: ‘Let’s do the hard work. What this government is scared of is doing the hard work.’ We want to do the hard work on our committee. We can do that hard work and carry out a proper scrutiny process—hear from everyone who wants to be heard and go wherever we need to go to hear from those people. But a lot of that work has already been done, as I outlined earlier in my contribution.
I reject the argument that this is the result of a government wanting to ram this legislation through. We want to do no such thing. But, because we have engaged in such a comprehensive consultative process and clearly made our policy position public over the last 12 months, clearly put it before the Australian people at the federal election and clearly got endorsement from them to do what we want to do, we want to get on and do it. The committee can do it in that time frame and the Senate should allow us to do that.
We had many furphies introduced into the debate about the sitting calendar. Quite frankly, the motion before us is not about the sitting calendar of the Senate. That is an important issue, but that is a different debate. It has been introduced into this debate simply as a red herring. The question before us is whether the committee can perform a proper scrutiny of this legislation in the time that the government would like, and the answer to that is yes. The opposition’s argument is not for the Senate to play a new-found, active scrutiny role. I have rarely seen that in the time I have been here, which is nearly six years. They are simply using that argument to frustrate this government’s legislative agenda, something that we have an absolute, clear and unambiguous mandate from the Australian people to introduce. Let me put some of those arguments to bed. As I said, if you want to have a debate about the Senate sitting calendar, let us have that debate at some point in time. But let us not confuse that argument with the process of referring a bill to a committee, because the committee is going to do its work outside of parliamentary sitting times anyway.
We have had to suffer some of the most ridiculous arguments about hypocrisy, as if our wanting to pursue our legislative agenda and give an appropriate level of time for Senate scrutiny, allowing the Senate committee to do its work, was somehow taking the reverse position of what we argued when we were in opposition. We are not saying that we want to simply ram the bill through. We are not doing what the previous government did on the Telstra bill. We are not doing what they did on numerous other bills, such as the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Vocational Rehabilitation Services) Bill 2006. To put the record straight on that, the previous government opened up and awarded tenders for that process before they even introduced the bill, completely bypassing any Senate scrutiny process. They had a token inquiry at the end, but it was after it was all done and dusted because of their abuse of their numbers in the Senate.
Their arguments are just not true. We want to have, and will have, a proper scrutiny process. But the difference is we can do it in the time we say because of the enormous consultation with stakeholders that has already taken place, because of the public nature of our policy implementation position and the development of that into the bill.
The opposition do not seem to have understood the result of the election. The only choice Work Choices ever gave any worker was ‘take it or leave it’. The instrument which delivered that choice was the AWA. We were absolutely clear about wanting to remove that instrument. That is what the Australian people voted for in the previous election. We want to do that. The previous government want to frustrate us in doing that. They know that thousands and thousands of AWAs are still being made unfairly and that people are still losing conditions and pay, but they are still ideologically attached to AWAs.
We have heard all sorts of comments. I actually heard the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Brendan Nelson, say that he is going to ensure that we deliver on our election promises. He is going to ensure that! Let us make no mistake: one of our election promises was the introduction of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 and the abolition of AWAs. That was one of our election promises, but what do we see from coalition senators? We simply see an attempt to frustrate that promise and to push the introduction of the bill out past the parliamentary sittings so that it cannot be passed for many months. So AWAs will continue in operation and the previous government will delay our election promises and implementing the mandate that we received.
I reject the arguments that have been put forward by the opposition. As I said, I also take exception to and reject the arguments put by Senator Murray in respect of how we got to this point. We support proper Senate scrutiny. We have always done so. The previous government cannot make that claim. Like Senator Siewert, I do not need to go into all the numerous examples. We have talked about them over the last couple of years. There are many examples of where the previous government used the Senate numbers to avoid any form of Senate scrutiny. They are trying to run the line that that is what we are doing when clearly we are not. You could not have a more transparent process than the one the new government have undertaken. This is simply a way to frustrate this government implementing its legislative agenda.
Let me say again very clearly that, as chair of the committee that this bill will be referred to, in my view, the committee is able to conduct a proper, thorough Senate scrutiny process of this legislation within the time frame outlined in Senator Wong’s amendment. It has no other work to do at this point in time. We are able to do it. In fact, we proved that we were able to do it many times in the past, even when the previous government set us much more unrealistic expectations than the time frame that we are suggesting at the moment. We have the ability to do this. The Senate has the ability to do this. The integrity of the Senate will be protected through this process. This argument can be for no reason other than that the former government is seeking to frustrate the introduction of this bill for debate in the Senate chamber.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I am very pleased today to address the Aged Care Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. This bill implements the changes to the Aged Care Act 1997 accommodation subsidies and resident accommodation fees that were announced in the 2007 federal budget. The bill amends the Aged Care Act to simplify the fees and charges paid by residents, as well as the accommodation supplements paid by the government for residents who cannot fully meet their own accommodation costs. A higher level of accommodation payments will be phased in to support the provision of quality accommodation. All care recipients, regardless of whether they are pensioners or self-funded retirees, will potentially be eligible for the new government accommodation supplement. The eligibility of the care recipient for the accommodation supplement will depend on the person’s assets. Unlike under the current arrangements, new self-funded retiree residents with few assets will also be eligible for government assistance.
The bill also amends provisions governing income tested fees. Currently, self-funded retirees pay higher income tested fees because nearly all of their income is counted under the income test. However, pension income is currently not counted under the income test. This results in self-funded retirees paying more than part-pensioners of similar means. The bill creates a new income test that treats all people in the same way and treats all income the same.
There are three important safeguards that will ensure that residents are protected and that the changes do not adversely affect existing residents: first, a residence accommodation charge will continue to be determined based on assessable assets at the time of entry to care and remain fixed until they are discharged; second, the government will continue to place a cap on accommodation charges; third, residents with unrealisable assets will continue to be able to apply for hardship assistance if they cannot afford to pay their charges.
The changes also broaden eligibility for community care grants for providers of community aged-care packages and extend eligibility to extended aged-care at-home providers, extend the operation of aged-care legislation to the territory of Christmas Island and the territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and makes technical amendments to improve consistency and clarity in the Aged Care Act. Subject to the passage of the bill through parliament, it is proposed that the new arrangements will take effect from 20 March 2008.
In addition to the amendments required to the act, further detail will be outlined in amendments to the aged-care principles as well as in other delegated legislation. These changes align with the implementation of the Aged Care Funding Instrument, which determines the level of funding for care based on the assessed needs of care recipients. As we have previously indicated, the government is committed to review the implementation of the Aged Care Funding Instrument, including the extent to which it achieves its stated purpose, 18 months after implementation. We have also committed to review the current aged-care planning ratios to take better account of demographic changes and changing patterns of use of aged-care services. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-02-14,"—The Appropriation (Drought and Equine Influenza Assistance) Bill (No. 1) 2007-2008 and the Appropriation (Drought and Equine Influenza Assistance) Bill (No. 2) 2007-2008 will deliver urgent funding to cover new and expanded assistance measures for the drought and the outbreak of equine influenza that were announced last year. The measures include additional exceptional circumstances funding for farmers and farm-dependent small businesses and the emergency assistance package and eradication program for the horse flu outbreak. These bills require immediate passage as the administered appropriations provided to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have actually been exhausted. At the current rate of expenditure, the department will run out of appropriations by the end of February 2008.
The Appropriation (Drought and Equine Influenza Assistance) Bill (No. 1) requests additional funding for the department to meet increased expenses during the 2007-08 financial year. This money will cover the new and expanded drought relief assistance and provide financial aid to the horse industry as a result of the equine flu outbreak. The Appropriation (Drought and Equine Influenza Assistance) Bill (No. 2) seeks additional funding for the department to make payments to the states, territories and local government authorities for drought relief. It will also allow the department to reimburse the states and territories for costs associated with the national response to eradicating equine influenza. The majority of the costs of this response, while being reimbursed to states and territories at this stage, will be recovered from the horse industry through the national emergency animal disease response agreement, so cost recovery will be addressed in separate legislation.
The drought and equine influenza measures were announced by the previous government in September and October 2007. The equine influenza measures were extended by the government earlier this month. The measures are a response to the increasing severity of the drought and also provide immediate financial relief for the equine influenza outbreak that occurred in August last year.
The previous government’s measures were published in the media and in previous government documents and they now need to be substantially supported by additional appropriation. So these appropriation bills and the urgency with which we are treating them demonstrate the government’s commitment to assisting those communities affected by drought and to eradicating equine influenza. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-02-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I want to take note today particularly of the answers given by Senator Carr in response to my questions to him, which were following up of course from the questions asked by Senator Abetz yesterday. One of the most serious allegations that can be made against any member in the other place or senator in this chamber is that they have misled their colleagues. Any reasonable assessment of the answers given by Senator Carr yesterday and the answers given again by Senator Carr today shows that he is not prepared to accept that the answers he gave this chamber yesterday to a very simple question were indeed an attempt to mislead the parliament. The sin here is that Senator Carr could have quite easily addressed this matter by acknowledging that he was caught out by a bit of good work by the opposition—that we found out what he had not yet announced. He might have sort of fluffed around the edges, but he should have just acknowledged defeat.
—He should have fessed up.
—As Senator Coonan says, he should have just fessed up. He should have said, ‘I got caught out. You all found out about it. Yes, that is what we are going to do. What a terrific bloke Steve Bracks is and what a marvellous job he will do.’ But he did not take that course of action. He did not take the course of action of decency, which would have been to say, ‘Okay, you’ve got me. This is what we’re going to do.’ Then he would have obviously defended Mr Bracks, and he is entitled to do so as he has appointed him. But what he failed to do yesterday was to accept the responsibility that we all have as senators—and indeed a higher level of responsibility lies with members of the executive—to ensure that what we tell the Senate is indeed correct and truthful.
Senator Carr knew very well that Mr Bracks had been approached in relation to this job. He knew very well that the other members of this committee, which were announced mysteriously very early this morning, had also been approached, but he chose to take the course of action that would enable him to put out a press release as opposed to making the announcement yesterday. By doing so, there was a gross derogation of his responsibilities to this place to ensure that what he was telling us was indeed the truth.
Senator Carr is a new minister but he has been around this place for a very, very long time. He knows what the responsibilities are for a senator. He knows what the added responsibilities are for a member of the executive. One can only assume that he decided to not take this course of action (a) to give himself some wriggle room the next morning and (b) because he was not going to acknowledge the fact that one of the people he was putting on to this committee was indeed a former union representative who had made it quite clear that the Productivity Commission was not an appropriate group to address this. The Productivity Commission, as those opposite know full well, is the organisation that should be conducting this review.
What has happened is that a former member of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, who has been vehemently opposed to the Productivity Commission since its last report, has actually leant on this government, and again it is payback for election funding. For this government to take the course of action they have, where they have appointed former union officials who are vehemently opposed to the Productivity Commission for a rational and reasonable debate in relation to tariffs, is, quite frankly, a shame on the new government. You had the choice of going to the Productivity Commission, but you know and we know that you are indebted to the trade union movement; you are indebted to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. I have the figures here: 634,000 reasons for you to put a former union official, now an ACTU official, on this inquiry. This is not an independent inquiry. It would have been an independent inquiry with the Productivity Commission. The Australian Labor Party has sold its soul to the union movement because of election funding. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I know it must be a very difficult transition from government to opposition, but the former government were arrogant and out of touch and now they are over there on the opposition benches flailing around and trying to find an issue. They start off with the first question to Minister Carr, accusing him of misleading the parliament, and they selectively quote one part of the Hansard and misrepresent it here. It was Senator Abetz who asked the question, and I am not surprised that he is not here today. Did he know you were going to ask this question? Did he know you were actually going to run this line of questioning? He knows that was not what Minister Carr said. He actually said so yesterday and it is in the Hansard.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That is an unfortunate reflection on Senator Abetz. The Hansard will show that comment. Senator Abetz is actually at a funeral. I hope that is now on the public record.
—You have that on the record, but there is no point of order.
—That is a pretty common theme today: there is no point of order. Here we have a disgraceful attack on a minister who said no such thing. One knows full well that, if this opposition were serious and thought a minister misled this parliament, every single question would have been to that minister today. But, no, it was the first question and then it completely fizzled out. There was not one follow-up question because everyone knows it was an absolute try-on. So what did they actually accuse Minister Carr of doing?

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—Order! It is unruly to interject when you are not in your place.
—Let us go to the allegation that was outrageously made by Senator Ronaldson, who cannot wait to get out of the chamber. Come back, Senator Ronaldson, sit in your spot and listen to this, because maybe you ought to have read the Hansard. When Senator Abetz yesterday asked his supplementary question, this is what he said, and I quote directly from the Hansard:
Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In that case, how much will Mr Bracks be paid per day, seeing that it was not denied that he was going to be appointed?
That is out of Senator Abetz’s mouth. It was not denied by the senator that Mr Bracks was going to be appointed. Can’t you read the Hansard? That is why Senator Abetz would have been embarrassed. I made no allegation about why he is not here today, but if he were here today he probably would have pulled you up and said, ‘Don’t be stupid. Senator Carr did not mislead the chamber.’ Those were his own words. You only have to pick up the Hansard and read it to see that Senator Abetz admits in his supplementary question that Senator Carr did not deny that Mr Bracks was going to be appointed to head this review. Enough of that.
We all know—we have been around long enough to know—that, if you seriously thought that, every question would have been asked about that. It was a pathetic effort. It really goes to the integrity of this place. To accuse a minister of misleading the Senate in a question really goes pretty damn low. But, then again, it is only your first week in opposition. I know it must be difficult—
—Senator Marshall, your comments should be addressed to the chair and not across the chamber.
—I should, and I apologise, Mr Deputy President. Through you, I advise the whole opposition that I understand and sympathise with them. They do not have the hordes of departmental officials and advisers that they used to have to give them all the answers and they are really struggling at the moment. If it was too hard to even read the Hansard from yesterday, why did they not read the press? I know that the opposition got this story up, but what does it say? The last paragraph of the article in the Advertiser from this morning says:
Industry Minister Kim Carr did not deny the long-serving Victorian Labor leader would be given the plum role …
It was clear in Hansard that Minister Carr did not mislead the parliament. The press knew it because they were not so lazy. They were not so incompetent. They actually read the Hansard.
You have to do better than that. I will not be too hasty to make judgement because I know you were arrogant and out of touch when you were in government. You have not yet worked out why you are over on that side of the chamber, and you are going to try a few things on, but you want to get a bit of integrity; you want to get a bit of honesty; and if you are going to ask questions and attack ministers, you want to get your facts right. You want to have a case, instead of running around mouthing off and making yourselves look completely ridiculous.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,29,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-02-14,"—I wanted to take note of the answers given by Senators Conroy and Wong as part of the general motion to take note of answers but I think it feeds very nicely into the response by Senator Marshall. Today in question time, particularly from the two ministers I have identified, we saw pathetically inept attempts to deal with a straightforward question as to when working families could expect to see reduced prices at the bowser and the checkout. We will continue to hold the Labor Party to account for having encouraged this expectation that they will do something about reducing prices at the bowser and the checkout. These prices are still going up, and if ever anyone is going to be out of touch it is going to be the Labor Party for making such a hollow promise to the Australian people.
I can understand how new ministers struggle a bit. They are obviously a bit nervous. They fumble around. They have trouble with their indexes as they try to find some kinds of generic answers on their computers but I think it is not ungenerous to say that the new ministers are struggling. Senator Wong was totally unable to answer the question about whether the government had sought economic advice as to the inflationary pressures of stripping back Australian Workplace Agreements and the attendant pressures that this will have on containing labour costs. The Labor Party, now the government, claim that they are serious that their first priority—they’ve said they have about 12 priorities, as best I can tell—is dealing with inflation, but they do not even appear to be able to tell this place what economic advice they have received as to how they are going to go about it.
They are, I am afraid, giving every indication that government ministers simply have no idea how to handle a burgeoning economy. They resort to the kind of defeatist inflation rhetoric that is being run by Mr Swan and Mr Rudd at every opportunity. Like parrots, they read it out verbatim in this chamber. It is worth saying, and it is worth recording in the few remarks I have time to make, that they are without doubt peddling myths. They have inherited a booming economy—with inflationary pressures but a bulging budget—and they have no idea what to do. They are like the proverbial dog that caught a car. Mr Rudd and Mr Swan have inherited a strong, growing economy, with unemployment at close to 45-year lows, and a low and stable inflation consistent with the Reserve Bank’s inflation target.
No other government in Australia’s history has taken office under such favourable economic conditions. Already we are seeing the fault lines—the fracture lines—in Labor’s capacity to handle these economic conditions. Our economy is growing faster than the United States, Japan, Europe and Canada. Our unemployment rate is lower than the United States, Europe and Canada, and our annual inflation rate is lower than in the United States and Europe. It is no wonder that the Economist magazine has described the Australian economy as ‘the wonder down under’.
The most disappointing aspect of what Labor are doing, because it is so vital to be able to manage the economy, is that they are simply not accurate in what they say. Right now Mr Swan and Mr Rudd are misrepresenting our economic history, talking down our economy and talking up inflation. You have to ask yourself: what sort of government is it which, upon inheriting a strong, fast-growing economy with unemployment at record lows and inflation running at manageable levels—over average within the target band—immediately starts to misrepresent our economic history, to talk down our economic prospects and talk up inflationary expectations? It is very disappointing, and the performance we have seen from the new ministers in the new government has been very disappointing. I would have thought that most of them would be across their briefs by now. They have had months to get on top of it. What we have seen is a dog that has caught a car and has no idea what to do next.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,29,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-02-14,"—Whilst I have only been in this place a few years, listening from the opposition side in those days, I know that we sought, question time after question time, to get straight, concise answers from those very experienced ministers who sat over on this side of the chamber and lectured us continually. Many years into their ministries, they went off on long and rambling answers and completely avoided answering any direct questions. It is a bit rough for them to be coming in here in the first week of question time and casting aspersions on new ministers.
It would seem to me that we now have an opportunity as a government to listen to the community, listen to the people of this country, and address what comes forward. It was all very well, over the last 11 years, for those opposite to deny the inflation pressures. We heard, and we continue to hear, that there have been significant inflation pressures put on the Australian economy. The previous government was in inflation denial: if you did not talk about it—if you kept ignoring the issues or kept talking around the issues—suddenly the problem would disappear and people would not really understand the real troubles that could be seen in the economy.
In Senator Conroy’s answer to one of the questions today, he put forward those table marks of when warnings were given to the previous government about what was happening with underlying inflation in this country. The then government just ignored that advice. They kept picking out the good bits and concentrating on those, thinking that that would make them appear extremely sound economic managers. Then, with the change in government, suddenly the now opposition are demanding exact dates and times. The questions we heard were: could this government determine the exact date that petrol prices would begin to come down; when would grocery prices begin to come down? That is pretty rough from an opposition that, when in government, did not even acknowledge that there were problems with petrol prices or that grocery prices were biting into the weekly incomes of ordinary Australians.
In our process towards achieving government, we listened to the community to hear from them what the daily pressures in their budgets were, and they identified that there were problems. Despite the rhetoric from the then government, despite the promises, there were problems daily. So we have committed to work through a process to determine how we can meet those issues and prepare some practical solutions. Some of those were mentioned in answers today. Certainly, Senator Conroy mentioned the increased powers of the ACCC over the petrol issue. We are talking about the fact that, when you hear that there are issues, you then seek to address them and come up with solutions—not avoid them, not run away from them and not pretend that they do not exist. That is what a government should do. It should be in a consultative process with the community, it should be in a consultative process with industry and it should be in a consultative process with all spheres of government because these issues do not belong to one minister, they do not belong to one department; they belong across government. They belong to a cooperative government working together to address issues and come up with solutions
We heard questions today that were across the board—about inflation, about the CDMA process, about broadband—and yet somehow the opposition is concentrating on attacks on the individual performances of ministers early in their ministry. The real issue must be how we actually put in place plans, how we put in place solutions and how we can effectively come up with results. That was actually done by a number of our ministers today. We heard from Senator Wong, talking about the processes within her portfolio, how she is working with different agencies, how she is working effectively with IR to bring forward a future. We heard from Senator Conroy, talking about the important issue of CDMA turnover. And we heard from a number of other ministers—Senator Sherry, Senator Carr—what is happening in different portfolios to address the real issues in our economy and in our society.
This is not going to be a straightforward, one-off answer. We will not be able to say that, on some mythical date—say, tomorrow—everything will be fine. Seeking a certain date indicates that once again the real import of the issues has not been understood by the opposition. They want short, sharp, delusional answers which do not get to the heart of the problem. If you want a time, perhaps it would be more useful to work effectively in consultation—(Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-02-14,"—I rise to take note of answers by Senators Sherry and Wong on the subject of inflation. In relation to their answers today, I have to say: here we go again. We might be on a different side of the chamber, as those opposite have kindly pointed out, but some things never change. Here Labor go again, peddling untruths about the coalition’s economic record while at the same time acting in a way that is very damaging to the Australian economy. Labor are out there telling complete untruths. Let me give one example, from Kevin Rudd on 21 January this year:
And for the last couple of years, slowly but steadily inflation has once again let loose in the Australian economy – resulting in inflation numbers for Australia that are significantly above most OECD economies.
False. Australia’s inflation is below most OECD nations and, significantly, it is below that of the United States and the euro area. Our respective inflation rates are a matter of historical record. Inflation during the last Labor government averaged 5.6 per cent. Under the coalition, it averaged 2.5 per cent—bang in the middle of the RBA’s two to three per cent target band.
But Labor are out there commenting recklessly, in a way that is likely to put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Wayne Swan was completely and utterly reckless when he uttered the words ‘the inflation genie is out of the bottle’. Any economist—or, indeed, any first-year economics student—will tell you that inflation is driven by expectations, because inflation expectations are self-fulfilling. If consumers think that inflation will rise, they will more readily pay higher prices for goods and services. If businesses think inflation is rising, they will react by lifting their prices to cover those anticipated costs. Thus inflation expectations become an inflation reality. The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said recently:
Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation ...
That is why, as Australian Treasurer, Wayne Swan’s comment that the inflation genie was out of the bottle is so reckless and so irresponsible. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s latest quarterly statement on monetary policy, released on Monday, confirms this very danger. It said:
A further risk is the possibility that inflation expectations could rise, which would make the reduction in inflation more difficult to achieve.
Labor are fuelling those inflation expectations.
But Labor are acting as though inflation is some new discovery. Newsflash for Labor: the battle against inflation is nothing new. We were fighting it for 11½ years. It is always a challenge with a growing economy. You have inflation when you have a strong and growing economy. That is the situation we find ourselves in. You always have to cast policy settings to take inflation into account. It is a policy setting that we got right in government; we handled the inflation issue well.
We have heard an awful lot about Labor’s five-point plan, but let us take a quick look at it—their five-point plan to fight inflation. I have to laugh at the first point: a targeted budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP. Give me a break, please! When we came into office we had a debt of $96 billion, and Labor opposed us every step of the way in paying that down. They opposed every single measure we put into the parliament to rebalance the budget. Their target is 1.5 per cent of GDP; we had a target of one per cent of GDP. You would really have to be looking at something in the order of three per cent of GDP to make a difference to inflation. What Labor are proposing will have no impact at all.
Labor are also proposing to boost national savings. We did a lot on that. We introduced the super co-contribution scheme. We abolished taxes on end benefits drawn down from taxed super funds. Their third point is that they want to act decisively and effectively on the skills crisis. Well, here is some advice: do not get rid of the 457 visas and do not abolish the tech colleges if you want to do something about the skills crisis and deal with infrastructure bottlenecks. For infrastructure bottlenecks, again a committee has been proposed. Infrastructure Australia—that will not do much. Point 5 is boosting workforce participation. As for Labor’s new IR legislation, we want to hear two things from Labor: will unemployment go up—(Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-02-14,"—I would like to take note of the answer given by Senator Evans to my question on the Northern Territory intervention. I again thank the minister for sort of offering us a briefing, and we will certainly be taking that up. I also note he implied that, in cases of extreme hardship, Minister Macklin may be able to look at those issues. I will certainly be raising with the minister a number of the issues of extreme hardship that we are aware of. Yesterday senators and members of the House of Representatives were invited to attend a briefing in the Main Committee room by representatives of Aboriginal communities from the Northern Territory. Unfortunately, only about eight out of all of the senators and members of the House of Representatives turned up. If more had turned up, they would have heard the stories of extreme distress and hardship that the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory are suffering under the new so-called Northern Territory intervention, which, apparently, is supposed to be about radical measures that will break the cycle of drug abuse and show a new way forward.
People are being provided with a ration card. By the way, this is a copy of the card people are given by Coles. This is how big it is—it is small. It says ‘Coles gift card’. What an insult to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. Mothers at the meeting yesterday were outlining the extreme shame that they feel when they are standing in a queue at Coles or Woolies—they are the two main places you can get a card for. Standing there with no cash in their hands they are told that they have to take some of the things back because they cannot buy them on the card. They are standing there with people who have cash, and they do not. They described the deep shame they feel. It takes them back to the ration days, when they can remember that their parents, in some cases, were given rations in old sugar bags. That is how these people in the Northern Territory feel. It is outrageous.
They are given these cards and apparently the people working on the checkouts at Coles are supposed to put little stickers on the back to tell them how much they have left on the cards. Unfortunately, that does not help when the stickers come off. People are throwing the cards away thinking that they are empty and they are not. So they are actually throwing away money because they do not understand the process. As I outlined in my question, in addition to all these other issues, people are not being given financial training or counselling on how to handle their money. So I do not see how this is turning out to be a learning process.
We heard stories yesterday—and I have heard other stories, because I have been talking to as many people as I can about this—of community stores closing down because they are not being supported by the quarantining process. We heard stories of people queuing all day to get their food ‘gift cards’ and not getting them, having not eaten all day and having no money and no way of getting home. We also heard stories of people queuing all day to get their cards and then going back to their remote community only to find out that they cannot use their card at that community and therefore do not have any money. We also heard stories of people who are living in, for example, Rapid Creek up there, where they do not have any storage facilities. They are being encouraged to spend the whole of their card at once, so they go and get a trolley load of shopping which they cannot keep anywhere. Other people are spending their card on a trolley load of shopping and then having no money left to get home. They have no money left for a taxi to get home, so they are left on the footpath with a trolley load of shopping. We heard another story of a lady who is unable to send food money to her son who is studying at a college in Townsville. She does not have any available cash to send him.
As I touched on briefly in my question, I heard another story about a lady who worked for 48 years. She has been retired for 10 years and she has raised 10 kids. She went into Centrelink and had a young lady explain budgeting matters to her. I would have thought, if you had worked that long, you have been retired that long and you have raised 10 kids, that you would have an idea about how to budget your money. Imagine how she feels. I can only barely imagine the shame that she is feeling because, after all this time, she has been told she cannot manage her money. She also told of relatives who have been affected by the same shame and subjected to the same quarantine rules with absolutely no justification. This process needs to be revised now. If the government were committed to evidence based policy, it would be listening to these examples of the failure of the system. (Time expired)

I do so to draw the attention of the Senate and the community, and particularly the new government, to the serious and significant challenges faced by the Wet Tropics Management Authority. As I trust all senators are aware, the Wet Tropics World Heritage area is in the far north of Queensland. It goes from north of the Daintree and Cape Tribulation. That is probably the part of it that is most well known, but it is actually quite a large area, reaching almost as far south as Townsville, past places like Mission Beach.
The Wet Tropics Management Authority has an interesting set of governance arrangements linking to both the Commonwealth and the state government. The key issue that I want to emphasise out of this report is the need, in my view, for more significant and stable funding for the authority. Without trying to sound too pejorative, in my view it has pretty much limped along for a number of years with inadequate and unpredictable levels of funding. Significant components of its ongoing funding actually have not been ongoing in one sense; they have been reappearing on an annual basis via annual grants through sources such as the Natural Heritage Trust. It is simply inadequate for such an important body that oversees such an absolutely crucial area—not just environmentally but culturally—as the Wet Tropics World Heritage area to operate on unknown funding, not knowing what it is going to be getting from one year to another. The authority has had serious problems with unfilled staff vacancies and an inability to plan long term with regard to those vacancies because of uncertainty over the totality of its funding, as well as some issues with regard to board level.
I presume this area comes under the responsibility of the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett. I know he is very familiar with the wet tropics—certainly the Daintree but I think the wet tropics more broadly—and I urge him to look at the possibility of providing more reliable and more significant funding for this authority and perhaps negotiating with the Queensland government about some shared arrangements with regard to that funding. I also make the point that, whilst most of the focus about the Wet Tropics World Heritage area is on its extraordinary environmental values, it is one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet, and I think the most biodiverse area in all of Australia. It is home to a huge number of endemic species, both plant and animal, that exist nowhere else on the globe other than in this region. Some of the genesis of those species goes right back to the earliest stages. Some very primitive, literally prehistoric, species exist there and nowhere else. They are under immense threat, particularly from development, in all of those areas—I have mentioned a number of times in this place the continual impact on the World Heritage area from residential and tourism development, not in the World Heritage area but on its boundaries, with continuing car traffic and increases in people visiting. But it is just one area amongst many that are impacted and being fragmented.
Just as significantly and given far less attention is the immense continuing cultural heritage of traditional Aboriginal peoples in that area. There are a large number of Aboriginal tribal groupings that continue to have ongoing connection to country in that area. A number of native title claims have been recognised over parts of the Wet Tropics World Heritage area, most notably with regard to the Kuku Yalanji claim in the far north of the Wet Tropics World Heritage area around Wujal Wujal and elsewhere. The Democrats have long made and supported calls for the World Heritage listing of the wet tropics area to also include its ongoing Indigenous cultural values as well as its environmental values. We urge the new government to continue that process.
But there is no point acknowledging all of the fabulous environmental and cultural values of that area if you do not adequately resource and manage it. I believe the Wet Tropics Management Authority has been hamstrung in its ability to do that in recent years. It does need extra support in that regard, and I call on the new minister and the new government to provide that.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is the Auditor-General’s report into the whole-of-government Indigenous service delivery arrangements. These whole-of-government arrangements were put in place by the previous government a number of years ago and it is those arrangements that the Auditor-General audited and has reported on via this document. In the current context and the current political debate about Indigenous issues in Australia, one could focus on the negatives with regard to all governments, all political parties, as I myself have done a lot of times or one could seek to use the current political context and the current public debate around things to seek to point to the positive and the opportunities that it presents to us. I would like to do more of the latter. It does need to be said though, as this report indicates, there were a lot of failings with the so-called whole-of-government service delivery arrangements to Indigenous communities.
These were introduced with large fanfare—by Minister Vanstone, I think. There were a lot of very strong statements about people putting their reputations on the line and about making all these things work better. As it panned out, not only did it not make things work better but, at great expense, it actually increased the amount of red tape involved. And that is really saying something given the amount of red tape that is already in place for many Indigenous communities in remote areas such as the Northern Territory.
I do not want to use that simply to point-score against the previous government. I highlight it simply to emphasise a point that many people have been making of late: strong statements, words and commitments are all very good—and they are important—but we need to follow through by assessing what actually works on the ground. Strong statements have been made in the area of Indigenous affairs in the last year or two, and even yesterday and today in this chamber statements were made with regard to the stolen generations. People have used that issue to go on to a slightly related but very different issue of child protection in the Northern Territory today. All of the rhetoric surrounding that is one thing, but let’s look at the reality on the ground—at what is working and what is not. That is something we all need to do.
I also emphasise my view—it is a view I am willing to modify according to the evidence but I think the evidence, including in this report, backs it up—that one of the things that is most obvious about the parliamentary debate today and yesterday on the stolen generations issue is that the people participating on the floor of this chamber were a bunch of non-Indigenous people, most of whom have very little day-to-day contact with Indigenous people and Indigenous communities, blathering on about what we think the solutions are. I am not saying that our views are not important. I think they are reasonably important—I like to think mine are!—but they are not as informed and as important, in many respects in this area, as the views of Indigenous people, particularly those at community level.
Most often, the big failing with regard to the specific area of whole-of-government service delivery arrangements that this report was looking at, and also with regard to governments of all persuasions—and even with regard to parliamentary reports involving politicians of all parties, including the smaller parties—is that we do not listen enough to the people on the ground and follow through to work with them. Even when there has been a little bit of listening we say, ‘Thank you for that, and now here’s the solution which we are going to impose on you,’ rather than having the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples actively and meaningfully involved in an ongoing capacity in the delivery of services to make sure that they suit the particular communities, people, and circumstances of the various regions—not just culturally but, more broadly, economically, environmentally and socially. There needs to be an ongoing focus and an ongoing capacity for those views to be heard and to make a difference. They should not just be heard with someone saying, ‘Thank you for telling us your views,’ but with, ‘Your views will be acted on, or at least taken into account in a meaningful way.’
That is a key missing element. I think there have been some positive comments made by a number of people in this chamber and the other chamber over the last couple of days. People across the political spectrum, at least to some extent recognised that. Now there is a real platform—from a lot of the words people said today and yesterday—from which to build some positives for the future. Some strong commitments have been made and they need to be followed through. They need to be audited, as the Auditor-General has done in this case. The key thing is to maintain the focus, because what happened in this case, as happens in so many cases, is that the new whole-of-government arrangements were announced and there was a big fanfare and a lot of media coverage. There were a lot of strong statements, a lot of strong commitments and a lot of determination—I am sure it was very genuine—and then the focus shifted elsewhere. A couple of years later people said, ‘I wonder what happened to that?’ They have a look into it and find a report that says: ‘Well actually it was a disaster, not to put too fine a point on it.’
We have to have that continual focus day after day. It does not have to be on the front pages day after day—sometimes it is helpful not to have things on the front pages—but we do need to maintain our focus. The key call I would like to make to political parties and to the parliament—to the Senate in particular—is to keep the day-to-day focus on this issue as much as possible, to keep the point-scoring opportunities out of it and, as much as possible, to listen more to Indigenous peoples at the community level. As we all know, there is as much diversity of views amongst Indigenous peoples as there is in the wider non-Indigenous community about what will work and what will not. So we need to do a lot more listening.
There is such a big gap in the daily experiences and the reality on the ground for so many Indigenous Australians compared to all of us that it is unrealistic to expect people like us—those that advise us and people in government—to determine all the correct solutions without far more effective connection with, and involvement of, people on the ground. I think that is a key failing. It needs a shift in attitude and it needs a shift in where the resources are directed.
This audit report is valuable, not just because it points to the specific failings in the whole-of-government Indigenous service delivery arrangement but because it points more broadly to the lessons that can be learnt from mistakes. The mistakes that were made in this case were the same mistakes that have been made time and time again. These are not new mistakes; they are old mistakes being repeated because we do not go about things in the right way. In this area the processes are in some ways more important than the policies behind them, because if the process is good enough the policy will adjust in recognition of the reality on the ground. As the process identifies the flaws in the policy and adapts to the evidence of what is working and what is not, it will modify itself to work effectively.
I think there is a lot of commonality about the goals we want to achieve—eliminating the gap in life expectancy; significantly improving access to education; significantly improving employment opportunities; significantly improving housing arrangements; and maintaining and improving recognition of, respect for and acknowledgement of Indigenous cultures. The goals are widely shared. We need a better process in place to take account of what works on the ground so that we start moving towards those goals rather than spinning around and around in circles, which seems to be what we have been continuing to do. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-02-14,"—I rise tonight to speak briefly regarding the commendable work currently being undertaken by Dragons Abreast Australia and to highlight its premier event, the 2008 hospital boat challenge, due to take place this coming Sunday, 17 February. I am aware of the fantastic work this group has been doing nationally and in my home state of Tasmania with breast cancer survivors to help them regain their health and spirits. For those of you who may not be aware, Dragons Abreast Australia is a not-for-profit national organisation which encourages breast cancer survivors from all around Australia to take part in physical activity—namely, the sport of dragon boat racing.
Dragon boat racing is an aquatic sport which involves a 12-metre long canoe-like boat, large enough to sit 20 people, two abreast, along with a sweep to steer the boat and a drummer. It is paddled over a course of approximately 500 metres in length. During races, a dragon boat normally features the head and tail of a dragon, a creature regarded by the Chinese as having dominion over the waters and exercising control over rainfall.
The concept of using this sport as a means of therapy for breast cancer survivors originated in Vancouver, Canada back in 1996, and quickly spread to Australia, with the first Australian dragon boat team taking to the water in the Northern Territory in December 1998. Participation in the sport provides breast cancer survivors with not only a suitable form of physical activity to aid them in their recovery but also a forum in which to regain confidence and to share the ups and downs that come with recovery. In this sense, the organisation aims to provide survivors with an inclusive team environment in which they can focus on regaining their health, confidence and self-esteem after battling breast cancer.
Following the first boat taking to the waters in Australia in 1998, the innovative idea quickly gained momentum. The program’s popularity has resulted in around 34 teams operating around Australia in each state and territory. I am proud to report this figure includes three teams that are based in Tasmania—one each in Hobart, Launceston and Devonport.
In light of the fantastic work this organisation is doing for breast cancer survivors all around Australia, I was surprised to learn that the organisation is completely self-funded and relies on sponsorship and the tireless work of volunteers. Participants pay a small membership fee to cover the costs associated with liability; the remainder of the organisation’s funding is collected through donations. This has not limited Dragons Abreast Australia’s capacity to help breast cancer survivors from all around the world. Just last September the organisation hosted an international regatta in Queensland, which saw around 2,000 breast cancer survivors from seven countries come together to share their experiences and to raise awareness about breast cancer. By all accounts the event was a huge success. I am sure that it would have been quite spectacular.
As I mentioned earlier, Dragons Abreast Australia’s premier event this year will be the 2008 hospital boat challenge. It will take place this coming Sunday, 17 February, on Darling Harbour. The challenge will see teams of fit, well-trained and enthusiastic breast cancer survivors from all around the country converge on Darling Harbour to compete in the challenge, all with the aim of raising awareness of breast cancer and creating an atmosphere of hope for breast cancer survivors.
The president of the Hobart Dragons Abreast team, Rosemary Kerrison, along with 22 other breast cancer survivors, will be heading up to the event. Rosemary has said that, for the members of her team, the benefits associated with training for and participating in the event reaches beyond the obvious physical benefits, with the group allowing survivors to share a common journey on the long and often difficult road to recovery.
Indeed, countless studies have pointed to the numerous physical and mental benefits stemming from regular physical activity for cancer survivors of all persuasions. However, the nature of the various treatments used to treat breast cancer, including surgery, radiation and hormone therapy, are known to frequently result in decreased strength and range of movement in the shoulders and arms. Other side effects from such treatments include fatigue, weight gain, nausea, depression and lowered self-esteem. Further, the Dragons Abreast website estimates that around 25 to 30 per cent of women treated for breast cancer develop lymph oedema, which results in the accumulation of excess lymphatic fluid, in this case causing arm swelling.
Regular exercise for breast cancer survivors has emerged as a positive complementary treatment, assisting in reducing a number of the side effects associated with treatment. The benefits of regular physical activity for breast cancer survivors include enhanced mobility and strength, particularly in the arms and shoulders; decreased fatigue associated with chemotherapy; improved sleep patterns; and, of course, enhanced quality of life.
However, Rosemary Kerrison from Dragons Abreast in Hobart is quick to point out that Dragons Abreast not only provides survivors with the chance to regain their physical fitness; it also—importantly—provides survivors with a chance to improve their emotional wellbeing. Participation allows female breast cancer survivors the opportunity to boost their morale and self-esteem, which can sometimes be eroded after what can be a long and sometimes confronting battle with breast cancer.
As the numerous national breast cancer awareness campaigns over the years have highlighted, for many women who are diagnosed with breast cancer the challenge of fighting the illness lies not only with fighting the actual disease but also in dealing with the deeply personal and emotional battle that often arises when faced with the prospect of losing one or both breasts.
Whether by default or design, women diagnosed with breast cancer are often forced to confront society’s concept of femininity and the prospect of a change in their physical appearance. In an era in which so much attention is placed on physical appearance, the mental and emotional strain that may arise from such an experience must be, in many cases, immense and mentally challenging.
This initiative by Dragons Abreast provides women—not only in my home town but right around the country and, indeed, throughout the world—with an opportunity to share their common struggle and to work together toward forming the building blocks for a happy, productive and supported life after surviving breast cancer.
Rosemary relayed one touching story of how Dragons Abreast plays a varied role in supporting women, although I am sure there are numerous examples of how Dragons Abreast has assisted members to rebuild their lives. This Hobart team member, I am told, could not swim and was terrified of water. After ongoing support from her other team members, she eventually gained the courage to, first, sit in the boat, and then to participate. Following on from this, I am told, she has now taken up swimming lessons and swims on a regular basis. As I said, this is probably only one of a number of stories that could be told world wide of how Dragons Abreast has assisted breast cancer survivors on their journey towards recovery.
Roughly one in 11 women in Australia is diagnosed with breast cancer before they reach the age of 75. And despite a significant increase in awareness and intense campaigns promoting early detection through breast screening, it remains the most common form of invasive cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Despite this, there is still hope and organisations like Dragons Abreast are providing that to sufferers and survivors alike. For these reasons, I commend the work that Dragons Abreast Australia is doing to raise awareness about this disease, and—most importantly—to provide much-needed support for breast cancer survivors around the country.
I think it is a fantastic thing to encourage women who have been through the often difficult and confronting experience of battling breast cancer to participate in a physical activity which will help them reconnect with the positive aspects of their physical and mental wellbeing. It is also great to see an organisation that is able to provide women with a comforting team environment in which to regain their confidence and, in many cases, to work through the grief associated with the changes that have occurred to their physical appearance as a result of the illness.
Because the organisation relies solely on donations and sponsorship, I urge my colleagues to consider getting behind their local Dragons Abreast team. I know I will definitely be doing all I can to support the organisation’s work in the future. Although, unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the event on Sunday, I certainly wish all participants the very best of luck and hope that it proves to be an enjoyable and enriching experience for all.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Dragons Abreast Australia</title>,Adjournment,40,1
