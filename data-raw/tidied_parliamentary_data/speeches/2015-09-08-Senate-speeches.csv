The speech read as follows—



BANKING LAWS AMENDMENT (UNCLAIMED MONEY) BILL 2015


Today I introduce a Bill to reverse the previous government's changes to Australia's unclaimed moneys provisions.


From 31 December 2015, this Bill will ensure that funds from Australians bank accounts and life insurance policies can only be transferred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission after they have been inactive for at least seven years. 


Australia has had provisions to affect the transfer of unclaimed funds to the government since at least 1911. They exist to protect Australians forgotten funds from being eroded by fees and charges, but no matter what, these funds continue to belong to their rightful owner and can be reclaimed at any time. 


Between 1911 and 2012, accounts must have been inactive for at least seven years before funds could be transferred to the Commonwealth. Under these rules, only $70 million in unclaimed funds were transferred to ASIC in 2011-12. 


However in late 2012, the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity to three years. This resulted in $550 million from thousands of accounts being transferred to ASIC in 2012-13—an almost eight fold increase in a single year. Many of these accounts were certainly not unclaimed or forgotten, but were transferred to the government regardless in order to improve the budget bottom line. 


For many Australians this meant cancelled holidays and delays in purchasing new goods—washing machines, dishwashers, and cars—that were crucial to their families. For some Australians the consequences of not being able to access their hard earned savings when they needed to were even more severe. Many Australians, particularly in regional areas, were placed in positions of financial difficulty. In the worst cases, some individuals have had to sell their homes. This is unacceptable. 


We did not support this change in Opposition and, as promised, in Government we will make it right. That is why, in the 2015-16 Budget, we committed to reforming the unclaimed moneys provisions. 


Returning the required period of inactivity before savings and life insurance policies can be transferred to ASIC to seven years will drastically reduce the number of effectively active accounts that are transferred to ASIC each year. 


This change will cost the Government $285 million over four years, however will save the community $36 million each year in reduced red tape costs as fewer accounts must be transferred from, and returned, to account holders. 


To further ensure that only funds that are truly forgotten are transferred to ASIC, this Bill also expands the ways in which account holders can keep their accounts active. This Bill will ensure that if an account holder alerts their financial institution to the fact that they are aware of their account in any way prior to their funds being transferred to ASIC—including simply checking a balance online—that transfer will no longer occur. 


This Bill will also exempt children's accounts and foreign currency accounts from the unclaimed moneys provisions entirely. 


Many Australians set money aside for their children's future and trust that this money will continue to grow in value and be available for their children when they are ready. 


In recognition of this fact and to reward, not punish, those Australians working hard to contribute to their family's future, children's accounts will never be transferred to the government.


Foreign currency accounts, meanwhile, are primarily used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex business transactions. 


Not only does transferring these accounts to the government potentially disrupt these processes, it also exposes the account holder to the risk of a loss as their funds must be converted to Australian Dollars at the prevailing exchange rate before they can be transferred to ASIC. In line with the Government's commitment to protect Australian businesses from excessive red tape, these types of products will also be exempted entirely from the unclaimed moneys provisions.


Not only did the changes made by the previous government leave many Australians financially distressed, the unprecedented growth in the value of money transferred to ASIC also highlighted glaring deficiencies in the way that account holders' personal information is protected. 


ASIC is currently required to publish an Unclaimed Moneys Gazette online with detailed personal information, which includes a person's name, last known address and the amount of money they have unclaimed. The Information Commissioner has raised concerns about the potential for identity theft using currently published information.


Some unscrupulous businesses are also using this information to charge fees as high as 25 per cent to reunite people with their own money. The Government and financial institutions do not charge account holders for this service. 


To protect those Australians with unclaimed moneys from exploitation, this Bill will remove the requirement for ASIC to publish the Unclaimed Money Gazette and will introduce secrecy provisions to ensure that only individuals with unclaimed accounts or those acting on their behalf will be able to access their data through Freedom Of Information requests. 


As stated before, this Bill delivers on the Government's promise to reform the unclaimed moneys provisions and contributes to the Government's promise to support Australian business by reducing red tape by at least $1 billion each and every year. This Bill will leave more Australians in control of their own finances, better protect their personal information, and leave a safety net in place to protect those with truly forgotten amounts from having their value eroded by fees and charges.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (12:33):  I rise to inform the Senate that Labor will be supporting the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015. This bill extends the time that bank accounts and life insurance policies can be inactive before they are transferred to the government from three years to seven years. The principle behind unclaimed money legislation is that customers do not benefit if their savings are eaten away by fees and charges when they are left sitting in a bank for years. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, in 2014 Australian banks collected over $1 billion in fees from household deposit accounts. We do not want to see bank profits rising simply because Australian savings are shrinking.


When Labor made this change to a three-year time period in 2012 we also determined the Australian government should pay interest on unclaimed money for the first time. Paying interest on the money held for safekeeping protects the value of those savings by ensuring they are not diminished by inflation. Right now a standard transaction account with one of the big four banks is paying 0.1 per cent interest. Thanks to Labor's decision, accounts held by ASIC are earning interest at a rate linked to the consumer price index. That means that those bank accounts are better off, even before fees and charges, as a result of being held by ASIC. We are also aware that fees and charges can significantly erode accounts. Stories of fees and charges amounting to up to $100 a year have been heard of in the past, and that is why unclaimed money legislation exists. 


It is important to get the balance right, of course, between protecting the value of people's savings and ensuring that accounts are not claimed incorrectly. Treasury consulted on this issue in 2014, and a majority of the submissions supported a lengthening of the time frame for declaring accounts inactive. Some suggested it should be extended from three years to five years and some from three years to seven years. Labor is always willing to be guided by expertise and feedback from those who work most closely with Australian banking customers. It is vital that we recognise that for all the schoolyard talk of 'trousering' what we are debating here is the correct duration after which unclaimed money should be moved into ASIC. It is not about an argument that the unclaimed money legislation should be repealed entirely. The question is whether the time frame ought to be three years or seven years, and today Labor will support the decision to change that time frame from three years to seven years. 


More broadly, though, Labor wants to see Australians get a fair deal with their banking. That is what motivated the changes to the unclaimed money rules in 2012. It is what has prompted the Leader of the Opposition to recently call for an inquiry into disproportionately high credit card fees. We were pleased that the Senate supported this call with a reference to the Economics Committee, which is due to report on 24 November 2015.


The gap between the two per cent official interest rate set by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the credit card interest rates of around 20 per cent is near its highest level ever. This 18 per cent point spread has doubled over the past 25 years and continues to widen. The government's top economic advisers, including Treasury secretary John Fraser, RBA deputy governor Malcolm Edey, APRA chairman Wayne Byres and ASIC deputy chair Peter Kell all have stated that this growing gap is an issue that needs to be investigated. 


Research from Swinburne university shows that over the past 23 years an average of 112 per cent of cash rate rises were passed onto credit card customers but only 53 per cent of rate cuts were. As author Abbas Valadkhani puts it, credit card rates 'go up like a rocket and fall like a feather'. We not only want to make sure that Australians avoid unreasonable fees and charges at the bank, but also Labor is fighting to protect Australian people from unfair costs imposed by the Abbott government. We have opposed an unfair chippie co-payment, $100,000 degrees and a 15 per cent GST as an unfair tax on the cost of living.


Increasing the GST to 15 per cent would see the poorest Australians paying 11 per cent of their income while the richest would pay less than eight per cent. That would be at odds with what the Prime Minister said before the election: 'The GST does not change. Full stop. End of story.' Similar comments were made by the now Prime Minister on 33 separate occasions before the election. Now, when asked to rule out increasing the GST, the Prime Minister replies, 'Well, what I'm not going to do is rule out a sensible conversation about a better tax system.'


Australians are increasingly feeling that Mr Abbott's list of promises of things that he would not do is, instead, turning into a to-do list for things that he will do: cuts to hospitals, cuts to schools, cuts to the pensions, cuts to the ABC and SBS, and increasing the GST. There is only one thing on that list that has not been done, and that is the increase to the GST. We have had an $80 billion cut in funding to schools and hospitals, a cut that was aimed at forcing states and territories to make an argument for an increase in the GST.


The Abbott government is already taxing Australians at higher levels than at any time since the big-spending Howard government, with tax receipts rising each and every year over the budget forward estimates. Labor has been deeply concerned that since the Abbott government came to office we have seen a steady trend downwards in annual growth, almost trending downwards in train with the Prime Minister's popularity ratings. Every quarter since the Abbott government's first budget was brought down we have seen a downgrade in growth. There was nearly three per cent annual growth in the March 2014 quarter. There was below two per cent annual growth in the most recent figures. Unemployment has increased from 5.7 to 6.3 per cent and is now at its highest level in 13 years. We have consumer sentiment 11 percentage points below where it was at the election and the budget deficit has doubled in the last 12 months.


We know that we need to get growth above three per cent if we are to see unemployment trending downwards rather than upwards. But while we have anaemic growth sitting at two per cent or potentially worse—given that the last quarter's figure was only positive as a result of a one-off blip in Defence procurement—we know that it is not enough growth to secure a lower unemployment rate rather than a higher unemployment rate. Before the election the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said:


Now, I believe that the Coalition I lead understands all of this in the marrow of its bones and that’s why I am confident that should there be a change of government later in the year, there will be an instantaneous adrenaline charge in our economy. 


But that adrenaline charge has far from been delivered. Instead, we have unemployment going up, confidence going down, debt going up and the standing of the Australian government in boardrooms around the nation going down. The figures that should be rising are falling, and the figures that should be falling are rising. We had the Treasurer saying that returning the budget to surplus had 'an inescapable moral dimension'.


Before the election, we were told that the budget would be back in surplus in the first year and in every subsequent year. Earlier this year, though, Steve Austin, on ABC Brisbane, asked the Treasurer: 'What's the higher priority, delivering personal income tax cuts or returning the budget to surplus?' The member for North Sydney said: 'Well, it's both, Steve.' Steve Austin then asked: 'But which is the priority, though?' And the member for North Sydney replied: 'We've got to try and do both. They're not mutually exclusive.


What was to be a moral imperative of returning the budget to surplus has now seen net debt increasing from its levels in the low teens, when the government took office, to being projected to peak at 18 per cent of GDP. So the deficit is up and debt is up. If they were driving debt trucks around the country when they were in opposition, they should have debt ocean liners now.


This suggestion that we can return to surplus now finds itself following the almost comical suggestions from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister that there ought to be personal income tax cuts of some $5 billion or $6 billion a year—but with no plan to fund those personal income tax cuts. Bluff and bluster does not balance the budget. We have a Treasurer who has claimed that his own electorate is the home of bulk-billing in Australia when we know that it rates 126th out of 150 electorates; a Treasurer who, while the rest of the world is moving and embracing the growth and jobs benefits of renewable energy, describes the wind turbines around Lake George as 'utterly offensive' and a 'blight on the landscape'; a Treasurer who says that the GP co-payment of $7 is just a couple of middies of beer; and a Treasurer who, before his first budget, confessed to his authorised biographer, Madonna King, that he wanted to cut harder and cut earlier.


While it is absolutely vital for treasurers to get their numbers right, we have a Treasurer who instead exaggerates the tax paid by higher income households, saying that they pay half their income in tax, whereas, in fact, the highest marginal tax rate is 49c—but only for incomes over $180,000. The suggestion that pensioners will be made better off by halving the pension by mid-century is not one that has received universal acclaim from groups like the Council on the Ageing and the Australian Council of Social Service. The idea that poor people do not drive cars suggests a Treasurer who is a fantastically out of touch with the Australian people, as does the proposal that, if housing were unaffordable in Sydney, no-one would be buying it—a logic which can equally be applied to diamond-encrusted iPhone covers and any other unaffordable item that you would like to mention.


We have a government with a lack of long-term vision and perspective that has moved into the very dangerous territory of playing partisan politics when overseas. The confidence with which this government approaches the unclaimed money bill is not matched with the confidence that we see when the Treasurer is overseas in discussions with his Chinese counterparts. We know, from his comments on the ABC's AM program just yesterday morning, that he was going into those conversations trash-talking the Australian union movement and the Australian opposition. The government likes to talk about 'Team Australia', but it is hardly Team Australia to take your partisan games into an international conversation with our largest trading partner. That is dangerous politics and bad economics, and it signifies so much why the Australian people have lost confidence in this Treasurer and this government.


We need a government with a clear economic plan, with a vision for jobs and growth and with an understanding that the science, technology, engineering and maths jobs of the future need to be underpinned by investment in education—not by cuts, cuts and more cuts. Labor will be supporting this bill, but we continue, as do the Australian people, to have deep reservations about the economic agenda of this government.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-09-08,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:46):  I went away for the two-week break hoping, like a lot of Australians, that we might actually have some reform on the table during this next couple of parliamentary weeks. The Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 is disappointing on a number of levels—and I will get to the detail around why the Greens are likely to oppose this bill.


A week ago, the Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey, walked away from what would have been a significant but passable reform through this Senate: a bank deposit levy. A bank deposit levy was originally proposed by Labor and the Greens four years ago, following a comprehensive piece by the Reserve Bank of Australia and an international study looking at the requirement to have funds put aside for contingencies should we see a situation like we saw with the global financial crisis, when our government had to step in and guarantee both wholesale and retail deposits so that we did not have the contagion and the mass panic that we saw in other markets around the world. A bank deposit levy that made a lot of sense was broadly supported, including by some very positive statements by the Treasurer himself, and it would have had the support of the Greens. I cannot speak for Labor—who knows what Labor does on the economy from day to day—but it would have had the support of the Greens.




Senator Polley:
  That's not nice.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I had to say that, Senator Polley.


It fascinates me. We had a business forum in this country organised by the Fin Review and The Australian. I must say I was very disappointed that the Greens were not invited to that business forum because it was discussing a vision for this country in tax reform and we have a lot of very good ideas that we have always been on the front foot with around tax reform in this country. One of the things that came out of that forum—it was widely reported and, a couple of days later, backed up by a statement from Roger Corbett, a well-known corporate figure in this country who went into retirement—was that the Senate is making this country ungovernable from a big business perspective. Then, of course, as he likes to do, Rupert Murdoch made some very similar comments on his Twitter account on Thursday night last week. It was the same thing: the Senate is making this country ungovernable; let's have a double dissolution election.


That bank deposit levy would have been a significant reform and it would have got through this Senate. The Greens would have supported it if it had been good legislation that targeted the big four banks to put aside, on the estimates that we had costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion over the forward estimates into a reserve account for contingencies around potential liabilities should we see more financial crisis.


Another reform that would have got through this Senate and arguably—certainly from my personal perspective—would have been a lot more important was implementing the findings of the government's own Harper review and amending section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act to bring in an effects test. This is what small businesses around this country want; this is what farmers around this country want. Give the government and the ACCC, which acts on behalf of the government, the powers to have create a level playing field in this country and, for example, at least test the proposition that the supermarkets duopoly has too much market power and often uses that market power to the detriment of small businesses and farmers in this country. This is significant reform and a very important piece of legislation that people, including my party, the Greens, have campaigned on for decades.


Guess what? The government walked away from it. They turned their back on small business, the sector of this economy they so often take for granted. So, while they are whispering sweet nothings in the ear of small business on one hand over a Chinese trade deal, the government walked away from the reform that small businesses and farmers in this country really want: competition powers to take on abuses of market power—another example, Mr Murdoch, of reform that could have got through this Senate, if it had been good legislation. I wrote to the Prime Minister myself—of course, I was hoping for an answer, but I have not got one—asking him to bring us the legislation. Let's do this in this parliament. Let us—the Liberal Party and the Greens; and I know how much this means to the National Party and their constituents in the bush—work on getting a section 46 effects test through parliament. But the government walked away from it. They think they have done 'enough' for small business in this country.


Well, guess what? According to the lead lobby group for small business in this country the tax cuts and the instant asset write-offs are just a shadow of what they want. This was the Holy Grail for them, and there was a significant expectation that the government would deliver on this—especially following all the work and all the feedback that went into the Harper competition review. And I have to say that the final recommendation of the Harper review was a bit weaker than I wanted. Because of the consultation with the big end of town, section 46, the final version of it, was weaker than what I would like to have seen. But it was significantly better than the existing competition laws that we have got in place, where you have to improve content in anticompetitive behaviours rather than look at the effect of anticompetitive behaviour. This is a significant disappointment.


To the big end of town, big business in this country, who are claiming that the Senate is making this country ungovernable because it cannot get economic reform through the Senate, I say that there are two examples. A bank levy would have raised billions of dollars on, arguably, the most profitable financial sector in this country. They make tens of billions of dollars of profits for their shareholders each year, who have been propped up by the Australian taxpayer to the extent that this levy would erase the revenue. The taxpayer and the government stepped in to give a deposits guarantee. The government guarantee—and this was all modelled by the Reserve Bank—has allowed banks to access wholesale funding at a better rate. As Senator Canavan well knows, their price of money was lower because the risk is lower. The premium would have been higher if that guarantee had not been there. And that has been good for the banks. They borrow money in wholesale markets and then they lend it out. They do other things—they invest their money in securities and all sorts of different investments—but, essentially, that is how banks work. So the Australian taxpayer has helped the big banks make money.


Of course it has had some good effects on the financial stability of our system, as it was designed to do. This bank levy was saying, 'Give the money back to the taxpayer.' At least have a contingency fund put aside for future financial crises, which will always happen. I do not want to digress too much, but it is remarkable how often financial crises do happen; just outside the boundaries of our memory, these things continue to happen. So there are some reforms that we could be dealing with and I could be talking about here today. I am proud to say that my party has campaigned for years on a bank deposit levy. We have campaigned for years on helping farmers and small business get a section 46 amendment to the competition policy.


But what I am standing here today talking about is a policy proposal that has been put up by the Australian Bankers Association, the same people who have lobbied against the FoFA laws, which we fought tooth and nail in the Senate—credit to Labor where credit is due—to retain in their existing format to strengthen laws around financial advice. The Australian Bankers Association no doubt fought tooth and nail in the corridors of power, behind the scenes, and they made public statements to oppose a bank levy. They probably even gave the Prime Minister the line 'This is a tax on your bank deposits'—which is a total myth; it was a levy on bank deposits. The Greens proposed a levy of 0.5 per cent on deposits up to $250,000. We were not sure what the final proposal from the government would be, but it would be a levy and it would have been sensible policy that would have been passed by the Senate. But when you criticise this House and say we are making this country ungovernable it is because we do not pass legislation that the big end of town wants. But this would have been legislation that certainly small businesses and some of our governance organisations would like to have seen.


What we have in front of us today, the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill is a flaccid attempt at reform for the banking sector. In my opinion, it is wholly designed to give the banks the upper hand. I want to read a statement by the former Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Bernie Ripoll. In a media release on 29 November 2012 they stated that 'reducing from seven years to three years the time before money was referred to the government was a good thing because Australians who have lost track of superannuation or old bank accounts will now have their money returned faster and interest paid to preserve its real value'. This was a bill that was brought in by Labor—and good on them. It was supported by groups such as CHOICE. Let me read you CHOICE's comment in its submission to the Senate inquiry:


The proposed amendment contains several important amendments for consumers.


this is going back to 2012 when it was reduced from seven years to three years—


With unclaimed money being transferred four years earlier to the Commonwealth, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or the Commissioner of Taxation, the erosion of balances through fees, commission and adverse market movements is substantially reduced.


Now hands up who does not understand that especially for small amounts of money, which the majority of unclaimed deposits tend to be, bank fees are not a substantial part of your return on those unclaimed moneys. I made the mistake of leaving $500 in a Westpac account and forgetting about it. Six years later, when I realised that I had an actual physical passbook—this is about 10 years ago—I went in to withdraw the money in cash and I found that I had $126 left. I had $126 left—out of a $500 deposit!


That was the erosion. It was only a small amount of money, I will warrant, but at the time it was important to me. The erosion of that amount was through fees. There was interest on top of that, but it was actually fees and charges that ate that amount.


Why do you think the Australian Bankers' Association want to keep these deposits for an extra four years? Well, go figure! It is because they can earn fee income on these deposits. They claim that—and I am not sure where they got the evidence from—if the government increases this to seven years before the government takes responsibility for it it will reduce the claims by half on these unclaimed money deposits. And, by the way, when it goes to the government you get a CPI return, not a return that has been heavily eroded by fees and service charges. It seems to me that this is about giving the Australian Bankers' Association what they want and it is about them making more fees and income.


Whatever your arguments for or against, it is a pretty poor attempt by this government to bring legislation like this before the Senate and have us even stand here and debate it when there are so many more important things we could be talking about, like multinational tax avoidance, reform around negative gearing and superannuation tax concessions, capital gains concessions and a whole range of things that we could do for affordable housing in this country, removing perverse incentives for fossil fuels for the big mining companies or providing research and development tax breaks for high-risk mining exploration companies—giving taxpayer deductions to mining exploration companies that you go punt on down at the local share market. There are so many things that we could actually be dealing with in the Senate that you would classify as real reform.


Take superannuation tax concessions, for example. It has been ruled out, depending on who you believe. Because this government is so chaotic, it is hard to know from day to day who speaks on what. If we had some decent reform proposals on superannuation tax concessions, I have no doubt the Greens would support that. We have very clear policies in this area. It is another example of why it is a load of rubbish that this Senate is making this country ungovernable. It is just that the right policies and the reform that is necessary is not coming from a gutless government that is more interested in the politicisation of things like national security than it is in actual reform in this country. They are totally rudderless.


While we are in this period before we go to an election—whenever that is going to be, and I do not think any of us know whether or not we are going to have an early election—I say here again today to the Prime Minister and to those across the chamber that if you want to get sensible economic reform through this place we have voted with our feet. You cannot dispute our track record on things like pension changes and small business reform. We have supported good legislation that is in line with our policies, values and beliefs. We are prepared to do that on things like superannuation tax concessions, on a bank levy and on section 46 competition policy—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Excuse me, Senator Whish-Wilson. I just want to point out to you that when you are tapping the table it does echo through the microphone and out onto the radio. Continue, please.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I got that from House of Cards. I only have three minutes left to go, so, rather than you having to go and have some kind of shock treatment, I would like to leave on this very important note: I throw down the challenge to Rupert Murdoch, to Roger Corbett and to the big end of town in this country that if you want the right economic reform in Australia, while this government is still around—and hopefully it will not be for much longer—bring some good economic reform that the Greens can vote on and we will get this through.


Do not waste the opportunity on section 46 competition policy. It is not a sign of weakness to admit you were wrong and to change your mind. Bring some good reform back to this Senate that helps small business and helps farmers and that helps to at least provide a level playing field. It is not a silver bullet—who knows whether it would work, and we will not know until it is tested—but at least bring back the recommendations of the Harper review so that we can actually give farmers and small business what they want in this country, not this kind of reform that is designed to put a few extra dollars into the pockets of the Australian Bankers' Association and the big banks. This is a really poor attempt at legislative reform.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2015-09-08,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (13:06):  I rise to contribute to this debate on the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015. I would like to put a bit of history in here. I congratulate the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg, for bringing forward this legislation to right the wrong put on the Australian people by the previous government. It is important to note that since around 1911 this country has had provisions to allow the transfer of unclaimed funds to the government. That is how long it has been around. These provisions stop accounts being eroded by fees and charges. Even after they are transferred, the funds still remain the property of the rightful owner. For 100 years the rule existed that the accounts must have been inactive for at least seven years before funds could be transferred to the Commonwealth.


Let me expand on the matter of the account being inactive. If, for example, you had $500 in a bank account, when interest was paid in each month or fees and charges were taken out each month and there was no other transaction, then the account would still be inactive. You must actually put some money into the account or withdraw some money out of the account every seven years.


In 2011-12, when inactive accounts were transferred only after seven years, only $70 million in unclaimed funds were transferred to ASIC. In 2012-13, after the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity from seven years down to three years, 156,000 accounts, worth around $550 million, were transferred to ASIC—up from $70 million. In 2013-14 almost 40,000 accounts, worth around $145 million, were transferred to ASIC. In 2014-15 a further estimated $162 million was transferred to ASIC. Without change to the required period of inactivity, Treasury had assumed that an approximately equal number and value of accounts would be transferred to the government each year.


The rapid growth in the number of unclaimed accounts highlighted problems with the treatment of children's' accounts and foreign currency accounts. Accounts that had been set aside for a child to access when they turned 18 were being transferred to the government and therefore the account was not accruing interest—except that when the government did get the money you received the bond rate when you claimed it back, a very low rate of interest. Take a young couple, both of them working away. They have two young children. Let's say they get a tax return of $5,000, and they say, 'We'll put this $5,000 away in a fixed deposit account for the children's education, when they get older.' After seven years, under the previous rules, they would have had to either add some more money to it or take some money out of it. As I said, the interest accrued or the fees taken out do not mean that the account is active; it is still inactive. Wouldn't it be great! After about eight years they go to their accountant—that is how the law used to be—and their money would have gone to ASIC, and they would have to get it back.


But the previous government reduced that to three years. I know for a fact; I was handling my late mother's money then, with power of attorney. A thankyou to Westpac: my mother had a fixed account of some $8,000 or $9,000 and Westpac wrote to me and said, 'You must put some money in this account by such-and-such a date, or remove some money from the account, or the money will disappear.' Thank you, Westpac, for that notification. I went and deposited a small bit of money in my mother's account, and that kept me going for another three years without having to worry about it. However, I should not have had to do that. It should be a seven-year period.


It is amazing. This was brought in by the previous government, and for what reason? The reason was simple: to get money into the coffers of Treasury. And of course the then Treasurer was Mr Swan, alongside his finance minister, Senator Wong, and the then assistant finance minister, one Mr Bill Shorten MP. What a crazy situation, that you have to steal the money off the Australian people after three years if the account has laid idle, to help fix the bottom line of your budget. As I said, it was about $70 million in active accounts, taken out after seven years so that the fees did not erode the account down to zero. That climbed to around $550 million. This was wrong in all principle. I remember Senator Bushby asked the question of Senator Cormann, the finance minister, a few months ago: why are we doing this? Are we doing this to take it back to the status quo, as it has been for over 100 years, since 1911, since the formation of the Commonwealth Bank? That had not been a situation whereby if you leave your account idle for three years and then if you go to it there is nothing there.


I had pensioners come to me. They had some money in a fixed deposit. They phoned my office and said: 'The money's gone. What do I do? Where did it go?' We had to tell them to go through the process. When I raised this in the joint party room some time back I said that this is wrong, that it goes against all the principles of what we in the coalition believe in, that you must rely on stealing the money—and I underline 'stealing'; that is what it is—off people in Australia to help the bottom line of your budget. Mr Russell Matheson MP made another good point while we discussed this in the party room. He said that there is an industry that has started up, an industry that will go out there and say: 'Oh, you lost your money; it's been taken. Pay me $2,000 and I'll get your money back.' People were preying on pensioners' and kids' accounts to make money out of it. That is wrong. It is against everything we believe in.


So I was very pleased to hear the announcement that this would be changed back so that when people put money in their accounts they at least have seven years. I encourage all the banks—and I am sure most of them or perhaps all of them do this—when the accounts have been idle for some time to write to their customers to inform them of the situation. Once again, I thank Westpac for doing exactly that: writing to me about the management of my mother's accounts.


The Information Commissioner raised concerns about the potential for identity theft by using currently published information. For example, some businesses are also using this information to charge fees as high as 25 per cent to reunite people with their own money. That was the industry, as I was saying, that kicked off. By removing the requirement for ASIC to publish the unclaimed money gazette and introducing secrecy provisions in this bill to restrict freedom of information requests generally to an individual's own details, this bill will better protect the privacy of those with unclaimed accounts.


The bill will generate regulatory savings of approximately $36 million a year. I will repeat that: the money this bill will save in regulatory savings will be about $36 million a year. This legislation will ensure that only funds that are truly forgotten are transferred to ASIC, not those that might be set aside for three years. And it will ensure that if an account holder alerts their financial institution to the fact that they are aware of their account in any way prior to their funds being transferred to ASIC then that transfer will no longer occur.


An article in June last year indicated that several Labor shadow ministers were privately embarrassed about the policy Mr Shorten introduced. In fact, one Labor frontbencher reportedly compared the bank-siphoning policy with the Gillard government's wrong decision to cut welfare payments for thousands of single mothers.


In 2013 National Seniors received numerous emails from members regarding the changes to the time frame after which accounts are deemed to be inactive. Grave concerns for the vulnerable elderly residents in aged-care facilities and for those with neurological degenerative diseases were expressed.


In a submission to a consultation paper—and you will be very interested in this, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson—the Australian Bankers' Association said:


… the current period of inactivity, being three years, is inappropriate and has caused substantial disruption for banks and their customers.


I repeat: 'banks and their customers'. They go on to say:


In our experience, the ABA believes that a period of inactivity of seven years is appropriate and better meets customer expectations and reduces costs and inefficiencies for the banking industry and ASIC. Many accounts tend to no longer be inactive after seven years, and therefore, this is better aligned with the way customers tend to operate their accounts.


The ABA said that:


According to industry estimates, when the regime reduced the period of inactivity from seven to three years, complaints increased by 300%.


Complaints each year increased by 300 per cent. They said:


The impact of the change was felt across the customer base, including individual, business and institutional banking customers.


The ABA told the Financial System Inquiry that reverting to seven years would halve the number of claims. The inquiry recommended that the government should act to ensure bank accounts and life insurance policies are deemed unclaimed after seven years of inactivity and that these moneys be held in a separate trust account.


In summary, I totally support this bill and I am glad those opposite do as well. I am disappointed that the previous speaker from the Greens seemed to be saying that the Greens will not support it. I do not support governments stealing money off Australian people, and that is exactly what was happening after three years under the previous government. If you left your account idle, three years later it had disappeared. It was gone. So what do you do? What do elderly pensioners do, especially the ones who are in aged-care facilities who perhaps are relying on family members to monitor their accounts like my mother was with me? Do you go in search of it? Where do they start to search? What are they going to get back? It is a very low bond rate.


As Senator Cormann, in response to a question from Senator Bushby, asked: who was at the scene of the crime when this stealing started? The finance minister, Senator Wong, the Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, and the current opposition leader, Mr Bill Shorten. They were the trio seen running from the scene of the crime. This is wrong on all levels. Each and every Australian should believe that a government has no right to steal their money after three years. We should put it back to what the status quo was since 1911—that is, seven years—and give people more time.


As I said, I commend those institutions that notify, ring, write or email those customers to warn them by saying, 'Hey, your term is now getting close to the expiry date on an inactive account, which will mean that your money will be taken away.' Then the hunt starts to get it back. As I said, the businesses kicked off, saying, 'She'll be right, mate! Give me $2,000. I will get your money back.' It is an easy $2,000 for a bit of paperwork. But instead of giving the $5,000 back to the customer they only give $3,000. The smart businessman or businesswoman has taken $2,000 out of it. An industry kicked off to go out and siphon money off those people who had their money stolen in that period.


I commend this legislation. I again thank those opposite for supporting it. At the end of this year it is going to be back to how it was for more than 100 years prior to the ridiculous changes that the previous government made in an effort to try and bring their budget bottom line somewhere towards a surplus, which is something we have never ever seen. That has been the case all my life whenever the Labor Party is in government. We have seen the history of their financial management. 


I welcome this bill. I welcome this legislation. I commend my colleagues, especially Assistant Treasurer Frydenberg, with the support of Senator Cormann and Treasurer Joe Hockey, for the work that they have done on this. I look forward to the passing of this bill and to getting things back to how they were for more than 100 years.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-09-08,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (13:19):  It is great to follow my friend and colleague Senator Williams in speaking to this very important piece of legislation. Let us be crystal clear: this legislation is about a fundamental difference between the coalition and those opposite—the Labor Party and the Greens—based on what was expressed earlier today in the debate. The fundamental difference is that we believe that people's hard-earned money is their money. We believe that you should not be raiding people's bank accounts. You should not be raiding their super accounts. You should be leaving people with as much control of their own money as is possible, keeping the tax burden as low as possible and certainly not looking for new and inventive ways to raid people's savings. 


That is what the Labor Party did when they were in office. That is what they plan to do should they come back into office. It is great that they are supporting this repeal. It is unfortunate that we need it, isn't it? We would not need it if the Labor Party had not raided people's cash. They have already signalled that should they come back into office they will be raiding people's superannuation accounts. We take a very different approach. We want to leave people with as much of their own money as possible. That is how we approach all legislation and all policy—we start with the principle that it is taxpayers' money and that, when we take it in taxes, we need to use it wisely. We should keep that tax burden as low as possible and we certainly should not be raiding people's accounts. In that vein, it is great to be supporting the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015.


This is another bill from this government that is about the fact that we believe people should be able to enjoy the fruits of their labour and keep their savings. We have already done much in this space. We scrapped the carbon tax. That allows people to have more of their own money in their pockets. We scrapped the mining tax, which allows more jobs in the mining industry so that workers can have more of their own money in their pockets and can choose how to look after their own families. We have delivered the biggest tax cut ever to small business, which means that the hardworking men and women who run small businesses in this country can have more of their own money, can choose how they will spend it and can look to employ more people so that those employees can have money in their pockets, contribute to their families and contribute to our economy.


In total, we have reduced the overall tax burden on Australians by nearly $7 billion since coming to office. That is $7 billion staying in the pockets of hardworking Australians. That is something we are very proud of. We are continuing to look at how we can lower the tax burden on ordinary Australians. We note there are all sorts of issues with the tax system and, of course, through various processes we are looking at how we can further reform our taxation system to make it fairer and more reasonable, and particularly for low- and middle-income families who are doing it tough we want to make sure that they can keep as much of their money as possible.


Also, I was glad to see in this vein, just last week, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announcing that we are getting rid of Labor's bank deposit tax. That is just another raid on people's savings. This decision is not only fulfilment of our election promise to protect the savings of Australians but, also, it comes after the recommendation of the financial systems inquiry and extensive consultations with stakeholders and the community. Labor's bank deposit tax would have imposed costs of $1 billion on Australians with bank savings. It would have damaged competition in the banking sector by putting regional and community banks at a disadvantage relative to the big four banks, further disadvantaging hardworking Australians.


Dumping Labor's tax also addresses another legacy of Labor's shoddy economic management. Labor announced this tax just before the last election and then put it in the books so their bottom line looked better, but they never legislated the change. This is typical of the hypocrisy of Labor in government. All through the last chaotic days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government they made announcements about spending, put them in the books so that things would look better and never legislated the changes, because they knew they would never have to deliver. We saw it in their promises on health and education, which they knew they never had the money for. Mark my words on this: if they ever do come back into government, they will not be putting back the money that they claimed was there. I can assure you, they will not be putting that money back, because it was never there. As I said, we are about protecting people. We are about putting money back in people's pockets, not raiding their savings.


This bill amends the unclaimed moneys provisions which exist to protect Australia's forgotten savings and life insurance policies from being eroded by fees and charges over time. This bill will ensure that, after an account has been inactive for seven years, the funds in that account will be transferred to the government where they will grow at the consumer price index, tax-free. No matter what, these funds continue to belong to their rightful owner and can be reclaimed at any time through contact with either ASIC or their financial institution. There is no fee charged for this service. As you mentioned in your contribution, Acting Deputy President Williams, we have had provisions like this since 1911. That is, of course, until the former Labor government came to office and decided that the provision which had been there for a century was no longer good enough. They did not want to transfer inactive accounts after seven years; they wanted to raid bank accounts after three years. They did that in late 2012, but they did not legislate it. This resulted in some half a billion dollars from thousands of accounts—many of which belonged to people who knew they existed and were simply long-term savings—being transferred to the Commonwealth. Many Australians were left in financial distress. By returning to the original benchmark of seven years of inactivity, we expect to see a reduction in the number of accounts transferred by about 50 per cent and it will reduce the red tape burden on the community by around $36 million per year. That is another example of how we are respecting Australians' money and, of course, cutting red tape. We want to do that in all sorts of ways. We are doing it for small business. This is another way that we cut red tape and cut some of the cost burdens in the economy. The change to the time of inactivity will take effect from 31 December this year, which means that no funds should be assessed as unclaimed until at least 2019 and no unclaimed funds should transfer to the government until 2020.


As I said, we on this side are about protecting the savings of Australians. We know that one important type of saving comes from parents to set aside accounts for their children. Many parents do it this way with a view to making those savings grow and being made available for their children when, for example, they turn 18 or perhaps at some other important milestone. When parents do this for their children and contribute to their family's future we should be protecting them, not raiding their savings. Funds from children's accounts are exempt from this bill. They will never be transferred to the government. Similarly, accounts in a foreign currency are also exempt from this provision. This is because these accounts are often used in relation to complex business transactions. Not only does transferring these accounts to the government potentially disrupt these legitimate business processes; it also exposes the account holder to costs, as the moneys must be converted back to Australian dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. The government is committed to reducing this sort of unnecessary red tape, so these accounts are also exempt.


At present, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission publishes an online Unclaimed monies gazette which details personal information relating to unclaimed accounts. This information includes a person's name, last known address and the amount of money unclaimed. There were serious concerns raised by the Information Commissioner about the potential for identity theft from the publishing of this information. Some unscrupulous businesses, as has been touched on, have also been using this information to prey on these people with unclaimed money by charging high fees—as much as 25 per cent—to reunite people with their own money. With this in mind, the bill will also remove the requirement for this gazette to be published. We will also restrict FOI requests generally to an individual's own details. The ASIC MoneySmart website will continue to operate and people who may have unclaimed money can go there to find out their own situation. So there will still be plenty of opportunity for people to find their unclaimed money, even without this gazette. Cancelling the Unclaimed monies gazette in conjunction with stricter controls on accessing account holders' personal information through FOI requests, will help to protect Australians with unclaimed accounts from exploitation.


As I have already mentioned, this bill is about protecting the savings of Australians, so we are also making it easier for people to make sure that their accounts stay active and away from the government. If you signal to your bank in some way that you are aware of your account before it is transferred to the government, the pending transfer will be cancelled and your savings will remain in your account. That notification can be as simple as checking your balance online or making a phone call to your bank. We are setting that bar very low because we understand that this is other people's money and we need to respect it as such. This will be the case even if your account had been declared unclaimed, because we believe your savings are, first and foremost, yours, and the burden should be on the government to transfer money, not on the individual. This is part of our commitment to reducing red tape and keeping your money in your pocket. As I have said, this reform will save $36 million a year.


Thousands of Australians will no longer need to locate their missing funds and apply to their bank or life insurance provider for their return—all thanks to this bill. Similarly, banks and life insurers will no longer need to unnecessarily transfer millions of dollars of Australians' savings to the government and then process thousands of requests for this money to be returned—often in the same year that those funds were transferred in the first place.


As is normal practice on this side of the chamber, we have looked through this issue carefully and methodically and have consulted widely. This is what good government does. Unlike those opposite, we do not just decide it is more important for our bottom line to look good than it is for Australians to keep their savings. We know the most important thing is to do the right thing by Australians and their own money—that is good government and good economic management—so we have consulted with the community on this issue.


On 26 May 2014 the government released a discussion paper, 'Options for improving the unclaimed bank account and life insurance money provisions'. Consultation on this paper closed on 11 July 2014 and the government received 17 submissions. These informed the government's changes to the unclaimed money arrangements. A year later, on 28 May 2015, the government released an exposure draft of the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 and the Banking Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Regulation 2015 and explanatory materials. Consultation closed on 26 June 2015 and the government received five submissions. These submissions have informed the final bill that has been presented to the parliament. So this has been a long, thorough process, and it is now important the Senate does the right thing and passes this bill so that thousands of Australians can have the security of knowing their savings are protected.


This of course builds on our record of lowering taxes and growing the economy. We are lowering taxes, boosting productivity, encouraging investment and creating jobs. All of these small steps, as they may be, contribute to saying to Australians: 'We respect your money. We believe your money should not be raided, be it your money in your bank account or your money in your superannuation account.' We respect those who have done the right thing, who have worked hard, who have saved their pennies and who believe that that money should belong to them. We agree with those Australians who believe that they should have access to their own money. Of course, it is part of our broader plan about people keeping their own money not just in their bank accounts and in their superannuation accounts but through lower taxes. 


I have already outlined some of the taxes that we have gotten rid of or reduced. We have gotten rid of the bank deposits tax, the carbon tax and the mining tax, and we are lowering taxes for small business and putting in place tax write-offs for small business. This all means more money in the pockets of Australians. There is a fundamental difference between us and those opposite. Even though the Labor Party has indicated their support for this bill today, which is welcome, we would not be here if Labor did not have the view that, when they get into trouble, when they overspend, when they blow out the deficit and create a debt and deficit legacy for Australians, they always look to raid Australians' money in various ways. They jack up taxes and they look to raid superannuation accounts and bank accounts. Here is a clear difference in approach. I commend what I think is an important bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-09-08,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:33):  Explained simply, the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 is all about stopping the Labor Party and their Greens allies from stealing people's money. That is a simple explanation of what this bill is all about. The previous Labor government, supported by the Greens political party, always in need of a bit of money, thought, 'Here's an easy way to get it—we'll steal the money from depositors who have not dealt with their accounts for a period of three years.' The previous law, the law that had been in place since 1911, was that after a seven-year period the money went to a government agency, for very good reasons. But the Labor Party, supported by the Greens political party, thought, 'Here's a way we can get a bit more money.' Of course, they always needed money. 


Mr Acting Deputy President, you and those who are listening to this broadcast might remember that, when Labor took government under Mr Rudd in 2007, the Howard government had put some $60 billion in credit—put it away in the piggy bank, so to speak—to save for a rainy day and to fund important assets or actions of governments in the years ahead. So the Labor government took over in 2007 with $60 billion in credit. What happened? Within a few short years under Labor Party administration, supported I might say—more than supported, egged on—by the Greens political party, that $60 billion in credit went into a debt that, if it had not been addressed, would have approached something like $700 billion. I will repeat that: from $60 billion in credit to $700 billion in debt. That is the legacy of the Labor government. 


Where did they get this money from? They borrowed it, very often, from overseas. When you borrow money, as all of us who run a household budget know, you have to pay it back sometime, and in the meantime you have to pay interest. We were in the crazy situation where, thanks to the Labor-Greens debt approaching $700 billion, we were paying something like $1 million a day in interest. Imagine how many roads, how many hospitals and how many schools could have been built with the money the Labor Party and the Greens political party wasted on interest through their intemperance in financial management.


So that bill was another of the Labor Party's schemes to take money from Australians, after a three-year period of inactivity on their accounts. It was opposed at the time by the then opposition, the current government, but of course it was supported by the Labor Party and their Greens political party mates. I am pleased to see that the Labor Party have at last realised the error of their ways and are, from speeches that have been made so far in this chamber, supporting this bill.


This bill simply puts the time limit that accounts remain un-dealt-with and unclaimed by the government back to the seven-year limit that it has been since 1911. In making this major change, the government has also introduced some other amendments that will make it easier and better for Australians to look after their money. For example, children's accounts will be exempted from these provisions of being claimed after seven years of inactivity, and the reason for that is obvious.


Cleverly, the government has also provided, in this bill, that if a depositor signals to the bank in some way that they are aware of the account before it is transferred after the seven-year period then the account will remain in the control of the depositor. So the signal you can give to the bank is if you ring up or if you check the balance of the account online every now and again; that will show to the bank that the account has not been forgotten about, that it is available and that the account will therefore remain in the control of the depositor.


Under the scheme that has applied since 1911—and even under the Labor Party's three-year scheme—someone whose account was taken from the bank and put in a government agency could get it back, eventually, if they had the wherewithal and knew how to do it, and if they remembered it. They could apply to get it back. But that involved red tape, and many people, particularly older people in the community, perhaps would find the effort of trying to reclaim their money from a government agency too difficult. That is why we opposed, at the time, the three-year proposal by the Labor-Greens coalition, and that is why this bill corrects this anomaly and effectively gives Australians' money back to them. It prevents future Labor-Greens governments—should there, heaven forbid, ever be any—from again trying to steal the funds of Australian depositors.


We do have a good banking system in this country. Indeed, it is a system which, at times, has been supported by the government—and that means, of course, supported by the taxpayers, because, as I always say, governments do not have any money; they just use taxpayers' money. Over the years, at various times, the taxpayers have supported the banks, and that is why I always think that the banks owe a duty to Australian taxpayers to run their operations properly and fairly. Occasionally you hear of situations where banks do not.


I hope I am not verballing the National Australia Bank, but I thought I heard a report recently that the National Australia Bank had indicated that it was going to stop funding any fossil fuel investments within Australia. For 'fossil fuel investments' read 'coalmines', and where I come from, in North Queensland, coalmines are very important. They are big contributors to the economy, and they create lots and lots of jobs—jobs for mine workers; jobs for all the mine support staff and jobs for those working in the small businesses that support mines. These are the sorts of jobs that you would think the Australian Labor Party, which claims to be the party of workers, would support. But do they? Of course they do not!


I could understand why the Labor Party is not terribly concerned about workers' rights, because, as I often point out, the Labor Party consists of union hacks and people who have worked in the unions; the majority of their members in this chamber come here from the unions and with not much other experience, I might say. So the unions control the people who come in here, and the people who come in here look after the unions. You might say: 'If the unions looked after the workers and if the Labor Party looked after the workers, that might be okay.' But let us have a look at the figures. Of all workers in the private sector, how many joined a union? Who do the unions speak for? I can tell you, because the Australian Bureau of Statistics told me, that only 12 per cent of workers in the private sector choose to join a union. That means that 88 per cent of workers in the private sector make a deliberate decision not to join the unions. And when you see what is coming out from the royal commission into unions, you can understand why workers do not want to join a union. For that reason, the unions will eventually fade into insignificance. So it is a matter of life and death for the unions, and for all of those opposite me who the unions support, to try and maintain their relevance to Australian society by getting the Australian Labor Party into government. But I emphasise that, in doing this, the unions, which control the Labor Party, and the Labor Party, which answers to the unions, do not answer to the workers; they answer to 12 per cent of the workforce in the private sector. And across Australia they represent only 17 per cent of all workers in all sectors—17 per cent—which means that 83 per cent of all workers in Australia choose not to join a union. Seventeen per cent of Australian workers choose to join the unions, yet it is the union movement that controls the ones who would hope to be the alternative government of this nation. It is an important point to continue making.


But I have diverted. I was talking about the National Australia Bank. As I say, if I am verballing them, I will apologise later. I read or heard somewhere that they were going to stop investment in coalmines. That concerns me because I understand how important coalmining is to Australia, to my state of Queensland and to the area where I live and that I represent in this chamber. I am particularly disturbed if that is true, because years ago my father used to work for the National Australia Bank and I have always had a soft spot for the National Australia Bank. In all of my own personal banking since I first had a bank account—and that is many more years ago than I want to confess to here—I have always dealt with the National Australia Bank. Indeed, when I was a solicitor and had rather a big trust account, it was with the National Australia Bank too, and the National Australia Bank were very grateful for that.


I would be distressed if a major Australian bank had made a policy decision not to fund fossil fuels. That, to me, would be a bank simply trying to get a warm, fuzzy feeling and succumbing to the propaganda of the Greens political party—the party that says Australia, which emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is the reason for all the climate change in the world. That is what the Greens political party would have you believe. I say to anyone who might be listening to this to think about this: Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of all the world's emissions.




Senator McKim:
  Don't believe a word. That's a load of rubbish!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Is that not correct, Senator? Is that not correct? You get up and show me what the true figures are.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. The senator needs to direct his comments through the chair, not across the chamber. It is disorderly.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  That is a very good point, Senator Whish-Wilson. He could also perhaps present his speech without interjections as well. That might be a good idea, don't you think? Senator Macdonald, you have the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I appreciate your protection from that vicious attack from the Greens political party by way of interjection. They are trying to put me off my thoughts because they do not like me telling the people of Australia who are hearing this on broadcast that Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. Do not worry about five per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent or even 50 per cent of Australia's emissions being reduced—forget that. Let's surmise that we shut down 100 per cent of Australia's emissions. That means that you would stop Australia. You would not have any lights on now. Even if you did that, what impact would that have on the changing climate of the world?


I have often said that I am one of those who believe that the climate is changing because I have read about the time when Australia was covered in ice and when the centre of Australia was a rainforest, so clearly the climate has been changing over many, many years. Are man's emissions of carbon contributing to it? I have heard eminent scientists say yes and similarly qualified scientists say no. I am not in a position to judge that. But what I can judge—and you do not have to very bright to do this, and many would say that is appropriate for the Greens—that 20 per cent of 1.2 per cent is an infinitesimal number and will make absolutely no difference to the changing climate or to the environment of the world whatsoever.


Yet the Greens political party, with their Labor mates, would somehow have you believe that because Australia is only reducing its emissions by five per cent that we are the bad guys. I would like to make the analogy—not a very sensitive one, I might say—that it is much the same with the Syrian refugee situation. If everybody else in the world plays their part then so should Australia. If we are going to reduce emissions we should do so commensurately with every other country in the world. When the countries of the world that are the big emitters get down to the emissions size of Australia, then Australia should be in step with them. But this idea of the Greens political party and the Labor Party that somehow Australia, by cutting its emissions by 20 or 30 per cent, will save the world is just so ludicrous and ridiculous that I find it impossible to believe that supposedly intelligent people can fall for that lie.


I repeat again and again: Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. I will say it again: Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. That is the sort of thing that most Australians understand, and that is why they got rid of the Labor Party and their Greens allies at the last election. They realised that the Labor-Greens carbon tax was destroying Australian industry, particularly the manufacturing industry. It was destroying Australian jobs and, in fact, exporting Australian jobs overseas. What did the so-called workers' party do about it? They exacerbated the export of those jobs overseas. That is why I always want to continue reminding Australians that the Labor Party do not stand for workers—they stand for the unions, and the unions only represent 12 per cent of Australian workers in the private sector. They are not my figures; they are the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.


I hope I am wrong about the National Bank and, if I am, I will come in here and apologise to them. If the National Bank wants to invest in Queensland, it should be investing in coal mines. There is another biofuels fibre-to-plastics proposal up in Ingham, near where I live in North Queensland, that the National Bank could well invest in. I would hope that if it is the bank that it used to be—and that I hope it still is—it will be investing in those sorts of new technologies but at the same time it will be investing in the tried and proven technologies that provide us the light and the comforts we all enjoy and that provide for poorer people around the world to enjoy some of the advantages of life which Australians take for granted. Let's continue to operate our mines but I hope the banks are not part of this fraud by the Australian Greens political party that cause them to change their investment policies because of the false propaganda of the Greens political party.


That has taken me just a little bit away from the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill. Suffice it to say, I support this bill wholeheartedly and I repeat that it is simply explained as the bill that will stop the Labor-Green governments of the future—heaven forbid that should ever be any—from stealing people's money again, as they did during the time of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (13:53):  I was trying to figure out what had happened. I had to go and get my hair cut and so I missed some of the intervening debate. When I left, we were talking about banking laws and, when I came back, Senator Macdonald was making a fine contribution on other matters. But I am glad that we are still on the same topic. I do not share the rhetorical gymnastic skills of Senator Macdonald to tie those issues into this bill, but, since he has already done so, I will use it as an opportunity to back the points that Senator Macdonald was making. Put very simply, we cannot change the temperature of the globe from a room in Canberra—we cannot do that. We might love to be able to do that and we may want to be able to do that, but we cannot. I am very proud to be part of a party with a strong history and record of practical and pragmatic action for people in this country, and we cannot practically change the temperature of the globe from Canberra. It has to be something we do globally, and I would be very opposed to any move that puts at risk one job or one Australian family's ability to provide for themselves—a move based on some ideological, passionate debate that seeks to do something that we cannot do. I am on a unity ticket with Paul Howes on that: if it is to cost one job, we should not do it. On our own we cannot do anything to change the temperature of the globe.


That somehow brings me back to the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill. I am happy to share Senator Macdonald's support for this particular piece of legislation. We should at all times try to provide consistent laws for the Australian people so that they can plan their futures and understand the laws of the land and comply with them. We should avoid haphazardly changing what has been in place for decades and, in this case, for more than a century—for almost the entirety of our federation. For almost the entirety of this parliament, people could be assured that, if their money was in the bank and they had not touched it, it would not be taken off them for at least seven years. There was a seven-year period in place to ensure that people who were using an account in that period did not have that money taken from them. For reasons I will go into later, in 2012 the then Labor government decided that they needed more cash and so they raided people's bank accounts. It was the wrong thing to do; they made a futile attempt to hit an unachievable budget surplus target and so they raided the bank accounts of Australian people. There is hardly a lower act of that former government, even though they did lots of low acts—




Senator Kim Carr:
  It was in your budget twice!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order! Order on my left.




Senator CANAVAN:
  to try to meet a futile promise to the Australian people to balance the budget by raiding their bank accounts. That is exactly what they did.




Senator Kim Carr:
  It was in your budget twice!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Carr!




Senator CANAVAN:
  The only reason they did it was to bring some more money into the forward estimates so that somehow their budget looked better. They wanted to do that on the backs of hardworking Australians who save their money. I am very happy that this government rejects that approach. We will be returning to the historic precedent of 101 years of not touching people's bank accounts for seven years. If people have used that account within that seven-year period in some shape or form, they can be assured, after this bill goes through, that it will remain their money.


My colleague, Senator Williams, made a good point earlier: when that raid occurred on people's money some years ago, a few people were caught red-handed in the act. Senator Wong was there as finance minister; Senator Conroy was part of cabinet; I am not sure whether Senator Carr was in cabinet—he was in and out a few times—




Senator Kim Carr:
  Come on! 




Senator CANAVAN:
  Were you there, Senator Carr? Perhaps you can enlighten me.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Come on! I was only in Siberia for a while.




Senator CANAVAN:
  There were various criminals over there who were caught red-handed raiding people's bank accounts. I will give them this: when they were caught in the act of raiding people's money, they owned up to it. Congratulations to the Labor Party—they have done that now. I am thankful that they have owned up to the fact that they conducted this raid and they will now be making efforts to compensate people by returning the law to where it was. Thankfully, they have finally seen the light in that regard, and we can count of their support and the support of other sensible political parties in this chamber to make sure we return the savings of hardworking Australians to their control.


We need to pass this bill very quickly because we want it to take effect before the end of this year so that any uncertainty can be removed. It is a great credit to the government that it has brought this bill forward. This bill also provides a number of protections to improve its implementation and application. We will be exempting children's accounts; if someone has put money into their child's account and that money is not touched for seven years, it will not disappear—




Senator Kim Carr:
  It's because you have no other legislation!



The PRESIDENT:  On my left.




Senator CANAVAN:
  There has been some benefit from the Labor Party's act of theft some years ago. We have made this legislation better and I am glad—

  Senator Carr interjects and says, 'Truth'—and it is correct that they are running an ongoing campaign to discredit a royal commission which has exposed corruption day after day within certain elements of the trade union movement. I would have thought any trade unionists worthy of their calling as a trade union official representing the workers of Australia would want to see a clean trade union movement. 


What puts the lie to Senator Conroy's assertion is Ms Jackson's response after her day in the witness box. You know what? She felt 'ambushed' by the royal commission. Here is a classic example of the Australian Labor Party not being able to get their story right. Ms Jackson says that she was 'ambushed' and that that is why she was not as good a witness as she otherwise might have been—I do not know what her rationale was. Yet here we have the Australian Labor Party asserting that she was coached every single step of the way. Get your story straight.

ChAFTA does not change the skills and experience requirements that need to be met by any skilled worker applying for a temporary skilled 457 visa to Australia. It is to the shame of those opposite that they follow blindly their leader, Mr Shorten, who, once again, on ABC radio this morning, and in the parliament today, has continued to report falsehoods and to generate a scare campaign in relation to skilled tradespeople working in Australia, which is just not based in truth. Any applicant for a skilled 457 visa will still be required to demonstrate to the department of immigration, the border protection service and the Department of Education and Training that they possess the requisite skills and experience to work in this country.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Conroy and Cameron today relating to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.


As senators would be aware, today's article in The Australian by Pamela Williams contains explosive revelations about the Abbott government's politically motivated trade union royal commission. We already knew that the Prime Minister's hand-picked royal commissioner, Dyson Heydon, had inexplicably agreed to speak at a Liberal Party function. In recent weeks, we have also come to learn that Dyson Heydon and Counsel Assisting Jeremy Stoljar failed to disclose that they were tipped off about the forthcoming media storm. And, most recently, we have seen the unedifying spectacle of Dyson Heydon finding himself, surprisingly, clear of potential bias.


If all of that were not enough to prove what Labor has been saying all along—that this royal commission is nothing more than a politically motivated witch-hunt set up by the Prime Minister to smear his political opponents—today's explosive revelations can leave nobody in doubt about the political motivations behind this royal commission and the biased behaviour of the royal commissioner and his staff. Thanks to the investigative journalism of Pamela Williams, we have learned today from the royal commission's own file notes—the royal commission's own documents—that the royal commission staff helped—coached, no less—Ms Kathy Jackson. This is a smoking gun. It fatally compromises this outrageous politically-motivated royal commission.


Instead of investigating trade union corruption, the supposed basis for this royal commission, today we have learned that the royal commission was protecting a corrupt witness, Kathy Jackson, to cover up her thefts—was protecting a corrupt witness to protect her from disclosure of her own corrupt stealing, rather than fulfilling its supposed mandate—




Senator Bushby:
  Oh, you've established it?




Senator CONROY:
  I do not have to establish anything, Senator, because a court of law in this land has found Kathy Jackson guilty of stealing $1.4 million. And this is what the royal commission did, instead of its job; it said: 'We're not going to investigate allegations against Kathy Jackson; we are going to give you, Ms Jackson, the opportunity to attack the people who made the allegations against you, which you have subsequently been proved guilty of.'


So let me be very clear about this: it is not simply Labor's contention that this outrageous witness-coaching took place; it is not even The Australian's contention. It is in black and white in the royal commission's own documentation.


Let me read directly from a file note of a telephone call between Kathy Jackson, Fiona Roughley and Matthew Ashworth. I am sure everyone in this chamber—especially Senator Abetz, who is a regular telephone correspondent with her—knows who she is. But the royal commission staff's own notes reveal that Ms Roughley told Kathy Jackson that the royal commission had obtained material relating to her slush fund. For those who are not aware, this innocuously named 'national health development account' is none other than her slush fund, that she raided for $284,000—plus the rest. And this is what was said, from the file note: 'The commission intends—

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-08,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (15:11):  Once again, Senator Conroy is true to form; he is long on balderdash and short on basic facts. He was short on very basic facts, because the facts are that the information that was provided to Kathy Jackson, as revealed in The Australian, is exactly the kind of information that was provided to other witnesses that have appeared at the royal commission as well.




Senator Conroy:
  Rubbish! Liar!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, you need to withdraw those comments.




Senator Conroy:
  I withdraw.




Senator CANAVAN:
  Senator Conroy, I did not actually hear them myself, but I thank you for withdrawing. What Labor senators opposite have to prove in this debate is: why is it okay for some union witnesses to receive very detailed information on the topics and issues that they will be questioned about but apparently not okay for Ms Kathy Jackson to receive the same briefing before her appearance?


I actually have some basic facts to provide the Senate, unlike Senator Conroy. It looks like I will have time to actually do them, unlike Senator Conroy. There is a letter here from the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, dated 7 April 2015, to Mr Steve Heathcote, who was a solicitor for the Transport Workers' Union of Australia. In that letter, it discusses the TWU's appearance before the commission on 11 May. I quote directly from it:


The Commission would be grateful if a statement from Mr Burton would be provided on the following topics: …


This letter in itself is more than a page long. I do not have time to read out all of the topics, but they go to the purchase of two Ford F350s in 2012-13. Senator Conroy was just saying there was some grand conspiracy over the identification of an account. This goes to the actual details of two cars purchased, as well as a redundancy payment to an individual. That is not the only basic fact that I would like to present during this debate.


There was another letter on 30 July 2014, again from the royal commission, to Mr Michael Doherty of Maurice Blackburn, a lawyer for TWU Australia. It goes to their appearance between 19 and 22 August 2014. Again, this letter is more than three pages long and details different issues that the royal commission would like to ask questions on, including the election of positions for the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia, and the receipt and expenditure of moneys by the McLean Forum Ltd and the election of positions of office to the TWU in 2010. This is standard procedure for the royal commission, and there is nothing special about this. What is special about this is the continuing attempt from the Labor Party to distract attention from the contemptible behaviour that some union officials have engaged in.


Another basic fact is that four officials connected to the CFMEU have been arrested. Twenty-six union and ex-union officials are currently under investigation by police around the country. They are basic facts. The Labor Party would have you believe that there is some grand conspiracy between the Prime Minister, the royal commission and the police forces in this country. Apparently the police forces in this country are engaged in a conspiracy among each other to distract attention from the otherwise good work of trade unions. I do think some trade unions do good work, but unfortunately there is a number—admittedly, it is a small number—of very bad apples that should be rooted out. Their behaviour should be exposed, and any decent political party in this country would join with this government, the police and the royal commission to make sure that those bad apples are gotten rid of so that the hardworking and genuine trade union members of this country can receive proper and non-corrupt representation from their officials.


But, apparently, the Labor Party with their continuing campaign of rolling out red herrings on this issue are not interested in that. They are not interested in protecting the hardworking union members that these organisations are meant to represent. They are only interested in protecting the officials and the perks that those officials can often provide. I wish the Labor Party had a different attitude, but clearly they do not. 


In the limited time left available, I would like to say that a couple of weeks ago the police made a visit to some CFMEU offices. In response, CFMEU officials accused the police of being in hock to the royal commission and accused them of running a distraction campaign on behalf of the Prime Minister. What credible organisation in this country does not cooperate with police? What credible political party in this country defends people who do not cooperate with police?

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  I always find it quite amusing when the coalition talk about workers and looking after workers and trade unionists. It always make me smile when I see these people, with a pedigree going back to Bjelke-Petersen in the National Party, spawned from the loins of the Bjelke-Petersen regime, stand up here and tell us they are going to look after working people and trade unionists in this country. 


The reality is quite clear. The reality is that this royal commission is fundamentally flawed. It is fundamentally flawed because it was a political product of the coalition. It was a political product that was to be a clear attack on not only the trade union movement in this country but the Labor Party in this country. It is about attacking the opponents of the coalition. It is about using every aspect of the power of government against political opponents. That is what this government has done. Bjelke-Petersen did the same thing, but Bjelke-Petersen did it in a much more raw way. He did it in a much more blatant way. This coalition is trying to do it in a way that is a little bit more subtle. 


So what do they do? They get Dyson Heydon, a former High Court judge who is one of the most conservative judges this country has ever seen, to head up a royal commission to attack the trade union movement and to attack the Labor Party. Dyson Heydon, only a few years back, was talking about it still being okay to rape your wife in marriage. That is the type of conservatism that this guy brought to the royal commission. He set about establishing procedures in the royal commission that looked after the biggest fraud and the biggest crook in the Australian trade union movement—Kathy Jackson. He looked after her, gave her special treatment and gave her inside running that was given to no other witness before this commission. Dyson Heydon is presiding over a crook royal commission. Dyson Heydon should go. The lawyers who are supporting Dyson Heydon should go. We should be establishing a proper inquiry. If there is evidence of any wrongdoing in the trade union movement, the people involved should be locked up and the key should be thrown away. That is what should be happening.


But it should not be done through a kangaroo court process which is a political attack by this government on the trade union movement and on the Labor Party. That is what this is all about. The bias is clearly there. Dyson Heydon—this guy who is supposedly a great legal mind—stood up and argued that a fundraiser for the Liberal Party was not a fundraiser. He sat in the royal commission and he protected the biggest crook ever in the trade union movement. He protected her, gave her cover and gave her the inside running. Dyson Heydon is an absolute disgrace and he should go. He should go, his team should go and this royal commission should go. It is a tool of the coalition government to attack its political opponents, and Dyson Heydon is allowing himself to be the main attack weapon set up by this government.


If you are Kathy Jackson, you get a fair go, you get the inside running and you get coached. If you are a former Labor Party Prime Minister, you get attacked and you get a biased commentary made against you. If you are the current leader of the Labor Party, you get attacked. After hundreds of questions that they could not damage the leader of the opposition with, what happened? Dyson Heydon moved in to give the press the grab for the day. This guy is biased. He should go. The royal commission is nothing more than a political tool to attack the trade union movement and the Labor Party. It is biased, it is unacceptable and Dyson Heydon should go.

You would think that those opposite would have confidence in the processes that this royal commission is going through and as part of that it will not only be trade unions or trade union officials and members, but there will be third parties so that at the completion of this royal commission we can have confidence that the trade union movement in this country, and indeed those dealing with the trade union movement, are free of corruption. That is something that, I am sure, many members of the trade union movement want to see happen.


Those opposite are braying about the political bias inherent and are trying so hard to undermine the royal commission. They have moved motions in the Senate, but have been unable to get the necessary support. They have tried to ruin the reputation of the eminent Dyson Heydon, the Royal Commissioner. They have attempted to critique quite severely the female witnesses appearing before the commission, and they tried to do that today. But what they cannot run away from is the fact that they are incredibly full of double standards. The Labor Party fails time and time again to notice the beam in its own eye. 


I think of Mr Tim Harcourt, who is a commissioner on the Fair Work Commission and who is very public in the partisan way that he goes about his daily business. He tweets; he attends Labor Party fundraisers; he goes about it with disregard—it is almost a joy in the way he participates; he goes on The Drum et cetera. He is publicly proud of his association with the Labor Party. He ignores the advice of Justice Ross, who says, 'Pull you head in'—obviously in more legal language than that—and 'You're not in line with the code of conduct of the commission.' He ignores that and continues on his merry partisan way. I have not heard anybody on the other side decry the partisan behaviour and how it undermines the credibility and the trust that the Australian people can have in the Fair Work Commission, because of that particular member's refusal to do the right thing and resign.


When we talk about kangaroo courts, the Labor Party's attack over the last week on Dyson Heydon was nothing short of appalling. They took it to the court of public opinion. I do not think there is a high percentage of the Australian public with a legal background. I do not, and so I would not be an appropriate person to assess the legal arguments as to the facts of the case around Dyson Heydon. I would say the same of the majority of the Australian public. I think Waleed Aly—hardly an apologist for the right—had it right when he said that he thinks that decision should be left in the hands not of the public or of a kangaroo court or subject to the pub test, but it should be left to those with the legal expertise to bring down an opinion in which we can have confidence.


I really wish that those opposite would get on board. Martin Ferguson is; he wants to see the royal commission do its work in uncovering corruption on both sides of the argument so that once again Australians on both sides of the political or ideological divide can have confidence that the workers in Australia are being appropriately represented, that their funds are not being squirrelled away in slush funds, that their union officials are not beating up on female investigators with the Fair Work Commission and that their representatives are not bullying workers in their own workplace. When we look at what the royal commission has already uncovered in its work—and we look forward to seeing the third party decisions—we should all get on board and support it.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:27):  I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis to questions asked by Senator Conroy and Senator Cameron. The Abbott government's royal commission into trade unions has never been about weeding out corruption and it has never been about improving unions. What it was and what it continues to be—




Senator McKenzie:
  Have you seen the list?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator URQUHART:
  is a direct attempt to attack political rivals and increase Mr Abbott's electoral prospects in the next election. Since the day it gained the keys to the ministerial wing, the Abbott government has waged a concerted and vicious campaign against Australian workers and the organisations that support them, including the Australian Labor Party—




Senator McKenzie:
  Why are you sticking up for them?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator URQUHART:
  The Abbott government has tried to smear its way into another term of government by using $80 million of taxpayers' money on a thoroughly compromised royal commission. Failing on fundamental tests of competence and economic management, Tony Abbott launched a politically motivated witch hunt to impugn the reputation of the unions and of the Labor Party. Knowing that he would not be able to win the argument on substantive issues of policy and the future direction of this country, Mr Abbott decided to play dirty instead. 


Last month we saw evidence of just how conflicted this royal commission is—when we heard that the Royal Commissioner himself, Dyson Heydon, agreed to be the star speaker at a Liberal party function. The invitation clearly showed that funds from the event would be funnelled into the Liberals' election campaigning. Clearly, any reasonable person would have difficulty believing that a man who has agreed to be a star speaker at a party political event does not have an affinity with that party. Then we had the absurd situation of Mr Heydon ruling on whether Mr Heydon could be perceived by a reasonable person to be biased. Sadly, in his ruling, Mr Heydon ignored the advice—




Senator Brandis:
  Have you read it? 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator URQUHART:
  that Mr Heydon himself had provided not too long ago in a similar situation. In the case of British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited v Laurie, Mr Heydon wrote:


It is fundamental to the administration of justice that the judge be neutral. It is for this reason that the appearance of departure from neutrality is a ground of disqualification, because the rule is concerned with the appearance of bias and not the actuality. It is the perception of the hypothetical observer that provides the yardstick. 


This was great advice from Mr Heydon, but it is a shame that he did not take heed of that advice.




Senator Brandis:
  Have you read his decision?




Senator URQUHART:
  But it gets worse. Not only is there a pall over the motivations and political affinities of the royal commissioner himself, but today we have heard a very concerning report about the special treatment given to Prime Minister Abbott's star witness, Kathy Jackson. Let's not forget some of the comments of senior Liberal members about Ms Jackson—Prime Minister Tony Abbott himself said: 


Kathy Jackson is speaking up for the right and she deserves a bit of support from the leader of our country.


Christopher Pyne said that Ms Jackson 'will be remembered as a transforming union leader'. Senator Abetz said: 'She did have the courage to blow the whistle and in those circumstances she is to be applauded'. Let's not forget that this is the same Kathy Jackson that the Federal Court has found to have defrauded HSU members of $1.4 billion. 




Senator Abetz:
  Billion?




Senator URQUHART:
  Million dollars. Last week we knew that Ms Jackson was treated with kid gloves by the commission—a very different experience from that which other unionists received. But today we have heard the appalling extent of her special treatment. Not only did the commission give Ms Jackson an easy ride; she was actually given an extensive briefing on the issues that were to be raised in the hearings. The royal commission's lawyers gave advance warning of its strategies and the issues that would be canvassed. She knew what she would be asked; she knew what she would not be asked; she even received advice that she should use her time on the stand to respond to her critics. These are absolutely damning revelations that go to the very heart of the integrity of the commission. 


Labor has been very clear from the outset that we want to see an end to corruption and we want to see strong action on illegal activity. But a politically motivated, morally compromised and mortally tainted royal commission is not the way to do it. Clearly there could be no doubt in the eyes of any reasonable person that Mr Heydon's position is now untenable and the royal commission is nothing but an expensive, taxpayer-funded witch-hunt to the tune of $80 million of taxpayer money.

(1) That the following Address to His Excellency, the Governor General be agreed to:


To His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd)


Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia and Commander in Chief of the Defence Force


   MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY—


   We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, respectfully submit that the Honourable John Dyson Heydon AC QC, whom Your Excellency requested to make inquiry into and report upon the governance arrangements of separate entities established by employee associations or their officers (Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption), by his conduct in accepting an invitation to speak at a function raising campaign funds for the Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division) has failed to uphold the standards of impartiality expected of a holder of the office of Royal Commissioner.


   Accordingly we respectfully request Your Excellency to revoke the Letters Patent issued to the Honourable John Dyson Heydon AC QC.


(2) That so much of standing order 172 be suspended as would prevent the President transmitting the Address to His Excellency in writing only.


I seek leave to make a short statement of no more than five minutes.


Leave granted.




Senator WONG:
  I thank the Senate. Labor is moving this motion because the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, has failed to act, Commissioner Dyson Heydon has failed to act and it is now up to this Senate to act on legitimate public concerns about the conduct of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, and the royal commissioner. Put very simply, it is untenable for a royal commissioner who is conducting a politically charged inquiry to be politically compromised. 


Mr Heydon is in this position in the public mind and in the view of this Senate because two branches of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party asked him to headline a Liberal Party fundraiser. Not only did he accept that invitation; he did so on 10 April 2014, the day after he made his opening remarks at the royal commission and two days after a profile in The Australian Financial Reviewdescribed him as someone Mr Abbott 'thinks is as politically conservative as he is judiciously'. 


No-one can have any doubt about the nature of the function Mr Heydon was to headline on 26 August 2015. 


The invitation to the event bore the Liberal Party's logo, the names of two Liberal Party branches, advice that all proceeds from this event will be applied to state election campaigning, guidance on electoral disclosure laws, a space for credit card details and Mr Heydon's photograph. Mr Heydon, as the Attorney keeps telling us, is a renowned black letter lawyer. Yet, in ruling on his own fate, Mr Heydon has construed a Liberal Party fundraiser organised by not just one but two branches of the Liberal Party as something other than a Liberal Party fundraiser. In fact, he has decided it was not a Liberal Party event at all. Mr Heydon said: 'The Liberal Party events submission must be rejected.' Forget the logo, forget the host and forget the eulogising of one of the lines of the Liberal Party—Liberal Attorney-General and the Liberal Party's political appointment to the High Court. I suspect that any lawyer putting the argument Commissioner Heydon both proposed to himself and accepted unreservedly would not have got very far in a court presided over by Justice Heydon. 


Of course, that is speculation, but do you know what is not speculation? What is not speculation is the way in which most Australians find the facts in this matter. I do not think many Australians find the facts in the way that Mr Heydon finds them. I think most Australians find the facts in this matter compelling and not in a way that flatters Mr Heydon. Australians are fair-minded. They might be prepared to overlook the explanation that he cannot use a computer, he overlooked it, he cannot send or receive an email, he pays no attention to the subject line of emails. But, really, his suggestion that the Barwick lecture was not a Liberal Party event cannot be made out on the facts and his actions contradict his words, because he withdrew from the event belatedly, telling organisers he would be unable to deliver the address if there were any possibility the event could be described as a Liberal Party event. You have to ask yourself: if it was not a Liberal Party event, why did he withdraw? 


This inquiry is manifestly political in nature. It is a royal commission hand-picked by the government, which is undertaking a politically charged, a politically biased, inquiry. We saw that today in question time with the revelations about the coaching of a witness by the commission—a witness whom the Prime Minister has previously described as 'heroic'. The Attorney says there was no coaching. Well, have a look at the file note dated 25 July. The commissioner's staff tell Ms Jackson: 'She should think about those transactions before the hearing on Wednesday. She should try and remember some examples of who the cash withdrawals were given to.' If that is not coaching, what is? Do you need any more evidence that this is a politically biased inquiry? It is unsurprising the Prime Minister's office has been working so hard with the crossbench to try and prevent this motion from getting up. You know this stinks. You know this royal commission is a politically biased witch-hunt and you know that Commissioner Heydon has been compromised by his behaviour and his actions in accepting an invitation to a Liberal Party event, completely unjustifiably.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:48):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement of no more than five minutes. 


Leave granted. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr President, as you know, the purpose of dealing with matters formally is so that they are not debated in the chamber, and the practice of making short statements is to explain the government's or the opposition's position. I am not going to descend into the debate other than to say that the attack on a very illustrious Australian jurist we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is utterly contemptible. 



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Conroy, Senator Wong was heard in relative silence from the right of the chamber.




Senator BRANDIS:
  For the Senate to pass this resolution it would be a serious violation of basic constitutional principles. It is a fundamental principle of constitutional government that the Governor-General only acts upon the advice of his ministers. The only exception is the extremely rare case where the Governor-General exercises the reserve powers of the Crown. Nobody suggests that this case falls within that exception. By requesting that the Governor-General act contrary to the advice of ministers, the resolution asks the Governor-General to act unconstitutionally. Further, the resolution asks the Governor-General to act on the advice of the Senate, although the House of Representatives has a different view. The Governor-General cannot be asked to favour the view of one house of the parliament in preference to the other. 


Finally, the appropriate place for any challenge to the royal commissioner's decision not to disqualify himself is the courts. If the Senate were to pass this resolution, it would be interference with the judicial process and a violation of the separation of powers. On two previous occasions, governors-general have considered this situation: Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson in 1914; and Sir Isaac Isaacs—like Mr Heydon, by the way, a former member of the High Court of Australia—in 1931, when a Senate resolution asked the Governor-General to act at variance from the advice of ministers. This is the way Sir Isaac Isaacs disposed of the matter in 1931: 


My plain duty in such circumstances, as it appears to me, acting, not as the representative of His Majesty the King as a constituent part of the Commonwealth Parliament, but as the designated executant of a statutory power created and conferred by the whole Parliament, is simply to adhere to the normal principle of responsible government by following the advice of the Ministers who are constitutionally assigned to me for the time being as my advisers, and who must take the responsibility of that advice. If, as you request me to do, I should reject their advice, supported as it is by the considered opinion of the House of Representatives, and should act upon the equally considered contrary opinion of the Senate, my conduct would, I fear, even on ordinary constitutional grounds, amount to an open personal preference of one House against the other—in other words, an act of partisanship. 


That is the position into which this motion seeks to place his Excellency the Governor-General. Regardless of what one might say about the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, this is plainly an attempt to use the Senate to achieve an unconstitutional end; an end at variance with constitutional precedent and practice which seeks to embarrass His Excellency the Governor-General by asking him to act at variance with the advice of his ministers.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (16:04):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. The title says it all, quite frankly: 'The Abbott government's second anniversary of broken promises, slogans, dysfunction and division'. Mr Abbott told SBS News on the eve of the election that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no change to the ABC or SBS. We have come a long way since he made that bold statement. What have we seen? $80 billion cut from health and education, which in turn is supposed to put pressure on the states to raise GST. So that is doing two cuts in one, which in itself would be another broken promise. 


There are cuts to pensions and cuts to the ABC and SBS. Mr Abbott also said to the people before the election, 'no new taxes'. After all of that, he then chose to bring in the fuel tax. Not only has Mr Abbott broken all of these promises; he also has so little respect for the people of this country that he continues to deny cuts and broken promises. Mr Abbott shows breathtaking contempt in his ability to stand there and continue to say, 'I didn't say that—or if I did, I didn't mean it'. He does not do the proper thing and say, 'I apologise; I made a mistake; let's move on'. He does not seem to be able to do that.


The best, I think, was the 'stable, mature, adult government' line that we got. Mr Abbott said in his address to the National Press Club shortly before the election:


My aim is to lead a no surprises, no excuses government that says what it means and does what it says.


You have to make a choice here. Either this government is incompetent—that is all we can see it as—or it has intentionally misled the Australian people on this issue. Either way, Australians have been let down by the Abbott government. Mr Abbott went on to say, 'A serious country deserves an adult government.' I am still waiting to see either an adult government or the coalition taking government seriously. 'Elect the coalition and you'll have a grown-up, adult government that thinks before it acts.' Well, knights and dames—need I go on? I am gobsmacked by that in itself. They have to tell people, 'We're going to be an adult government.' They have to tell them they are going to be serious. Quite frankly, they have been anything but. If the display over the past two years is a serious attempt at governing, I would hate to see what this government looks like—like sand, the highly orchestrated management smoke-and-mirrors game being run through the Prime Minister's office. To be fair—the coalition wants me to be a little fair—all the blame cannot be laid at the feet of those opposite. After all, they are only doing what they are told to do by the PMO, quite frankly. But that is another problem.


It has failed to pass its budgets. The first budget—what a doozy. The government has only passed about half of the measures it announced in its first budget and it is still trying, badly, to talk to the crossbenchers—maybe talk to the opposition—but it seems almost impossible for this government to talk to anybody but itself. When only half of its first budget has passed, how does the government expect to pass the current budget? Does Treasury assume that the budget will be passed? I think the root of their problem—if I could give them a small piece of advice, but I doubt they will listen—is that the government simply cannot deal with the crossbench senators. Its only tactic seems to be, at least from as far back as I am, either to bully or to try to blackmail senators into some sort of position. But they seem completely incapable of having a negotiation, having a proper discourse with both the opposition and the crossbenchers. I think the root of their problem is that they just do not know how to negotiate. They are too busy and have been too used to having a silver spoon in their mouth and expecting the world to bow to them upon any wish that they have. What they— (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-09-08,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:09):  When I first read today's MPI talking about broken promises, slogans, dysfunction and division, I actually thought that the opposition were putting up an MPI about themselves. So I am delighted to talk about the achievements of the first two years of the Abbott government. I am a very proud member of this government and the governance team. Despite what those opposite have said, what we are delivering is good government. A good government is one that delivers in that national interest and takes the tough decisions that are needed. This government has achieved a lot over the first two years. I could not possibly list them all, so I have just gone through—and it did not take me any time at all—and found the first top 50 achievements and decisions of this government. We have not just talked about it, we have not had endless inquiries, we have not deferred things off past the forward estimates, we have not prepared complex programs on the back of a coaster; we have done things properly and we have done a lot in this country.


What did we inherit? I went back and had a quick look at what we inherited and what Labor's idea of a good government is. Labor's idea, clearly, of a good government is record deficits, massive debt, the world's biggest carbon tax, which actually did not work; many more people unemployed; NBN project delays and cost blow-outs; cost of living on the increase; billions of dollars of taxpayer money wasted on pink batts and school halls; grocery watches and fuel choices—the debacles go on and on. Illegal boat arrivals were out of control; they had lost control of our borders. Education standards slipped significantly under Labor, and health services got more expensive. To add insult to injury—to all of that—despite their absolute promise, defence spending was gutted. That is the standard that we heard Senator Ludwig refer to just then. That is what Labor think is good government.


Let me go through a few of the achievements of this government in two very short years. First, on the economy, we abolished the carbon tax, saving Australian families at least $550 a year and taking a yoke off small business and large business, which ultimately creates more jobs. That is No. 1. No. 2: we abolished the minerals resource rent tax, which again, I know from my own state, would have been an absolute disaster. We have conducted a commission of audit, which conducted the most comprehensive review of government spending in a generation to highlight waste and areas of unsustainable spending, which we are now addressing for the first time in history. Those opposite did not do that. We are stopping Labor's proposed bank deposits tax which, again, was regressive, unnecessary and very punitive. No. 5: despite the rhetoric from those opposite, labour force participation is increasing—to the point where we have now created over 335,000 jobs. We have actually created 335,000 jobs, and the participation rate—particularly amongst women, which is fabulous—is increasing. There is more to be done but I reckon that in two years that is good government. Those are a few things on the economy.


What have we done for Australian business and trade in two short years? Unlike those opposite, who did not conclude any free trade agreements, in just over the first 12 months we finalised three free trade agreements with major trading partners covering over 50 per cent of our exports—Korea, Japan and China—and we are currently in negotiation with India for a fourth. That is an enormous achievement. That is what good government looks like: looking towards the economy of the future and where we can create and sustain jobs into the future. We have cut tax for small business. That is No. 7—I am only up to seven so far of 50. This is a government which has been consistently open for business, delivering the biggest tax cut in history for small business. That is what good government looks like. We have introduced the instant asset write-off for small business, which means that all small businesses can now invest for jobs and for growth for their future. We have introduced the red tape reduction programme with repeal days. So far, what have we done? We have cut $2.45 billion in red tape for business. This has exceeded the red-tape reduction target by nearly half a billion dollars over two years. We have exceeded what our already ambitious targets were two years ago. Most importantly, for jobs in the future, we have granted over $1 trillion worth of major project environmental approvals so that businesses can get on with creating prosperity, future wealth and, critically, jobs. That is only No. 10—and that is only in two years.


What else have we done in infrastructure? We have invested heavily in infrastructure. We have not just talked about it. We have not just made promises about new roads and other major infrastructure. We have invested. We have handed down a $50 billion infrastructure package, which is the single largest infrastructure package in Australia's history. That in itself is good government, and that is amazing progress in two years. What else have we done? We have taken another really tough decision on a second airport for Sydney at Badgerys Creek, something that the previous government was completely incapable of doing. Why? Because it was a bit of a tough decision. At No. 13 of my top 50 achievements of this government is that we are building the roads of the future.


On border protection, we have stopped the boats. Fifty thousand people came here under the previous government. They lost control of the borders. Twelve hundred people died under the Labor and Greens policies which they supported in government. Not a single person has died since we stopped the boats. We have created the Border Force, which is a wonderful improvement for the protection of our country's borders. We are combatting home-grown extremism. We are establishing a victims of terrorism compensation scheme. We have reintroduced temporary protection visas. Again, these are just a few of our many achievements in border protection and national security.


What did the previous government do on the environment apart from introducing a carbon tax which, as we have seen, did not even work? We are taking direct action. We are planting trees. We are looking after the environment. We have thousands of people across the country working on the environment. 



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  You may laugh, but 'direct action' means just that. We are not just talking about protecting the environment; we are getting out and protecting the environment. Not only are we planting trees and rehabilitating saline farmlands; we are protecting the Great Barrier Reef. We are doing all of that and still cutting carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030. We are not just talking about it; we are doing it.


Our achievements in education are numerous, but the thing I am particularly proud of, as is the foreign minister, is the New Colombo Plan. What have we done in two short years? By the end of 2016 over 10,000 Australian students will have studied in the Asia-Pacific region. That was not done by those who talk about education over on the other side. It was done by this side, by the government.


Defence is something that I am extremely passionate about, particularly as I had to suffer through the broken promises working up at Russell offices when we were promised that there would be no funding cuts. The other side said, 'If you make the Strategic Reform Program reforms, you will get the money back.' Guess what? It was another broken promise by those opposite. The legacy is going to take at least a decade to fix.


The government has conducted the First principles review of Defence, which has universal support and is now being implemented. We have commissioned a white paper, which is the most comprehensive in living memory. It is the first one, unlike those from those opposite, that is fully costed. It will be absolutely fully costed, including the force structure review. Again, this is something those opposite were completely incapable of doing. In my book, that is good government. 


We have initiated a competitive evaluation process for Australia's Future Submarine program. We have three potential bidders in the process that is now underway. The previous government did not commission a single vessel in six years. In six years they did not commission a single vessel, which has resulted in the valley of death that we have been talking about. This government has funded it and we are now making it a reality. We have also brought forward—and funded—the Future Frigates program by three years. Those opposite did nothing. We are. We have also brought forward the Pacific patrol boat tenders. We are also starting to remediate the issues caused by those opposite in the air warfare destroyer program to make sure that it can be delivered. We have invested in the joint strike fighter. We have also, wonderfully, reinstated the ADF gap year program. 


That is 32 actual delivered achievements of this government. What is No. 33? For regional and northern Australia, we have delivered the White paper on developing northern Australia, which we know will result in a complete transformation of the society, future jobs and growth of our north. We have committed to funding northern Australia through $5 billion of investment in the region. We have implemented a comprehensive drought relief package. We have released the agricultural competitiveness white paper. We have also recommenced the live export of sheep, cattle and goats to Bahrain— (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2015-09-08,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:19):  I rise to today to speak on the matter of public importance—that is, the long record of the Abbott government's broken promises. There are many of them I could list. For example, there was the slashing of the renewable energy target when this government promised it would leave it alone. There were the cuts to health, with billions of dollars ripped out of our hospital system when the Prime Minister said he would not cut health care. He was on a unity ticket on Gonski funding, and what did we see? The Gonski reforms have been undermined. There were the cuts to the ABC and the SBS. The list goes on and on.


The truth is that it is not just these broken promises that concern me. If I am being really honest with myself, if this government decided that it would not scrap the most important and effective climate change laws anywhere in the country despite its promise to do so, I would welcome it. If it decided to leave the mining tax alone, I would welcome it. For me it is not really the issue of the broken promises, although that is part of it. It is what lies underneath them. What lies underneath is this very cruel, brutal, dog-eat-dog, job-destroying agenda. That is what is at the heart of this government.


There was also an element of cowardice there because, like with all bullies, when it came to showing a bit of mettle in the lead up to the election, the then Leader of the Opposition could not do it. The coalition could not put this agenda out in front of the Australian people for them to make a legitimate choice. They did not have the courage to stand up and say, 'This is what we stand for. We want the Australian public to vote for it.' They did not do that because they know that what they stand for is deeply unpopular with the Australian people.


Some analysts have said they have a communication problem and are unable to communicate their vision. I disagree completely. It is not the issue of communication that is the problem; it is the product itself. You know what they say about communication in advertising: it just helps you realise you have a bad product a little more quickly. That is the issue with this government. When faced with the biggest challenge of our generation—climate change—what is their response? 'Let's abolish these incredibly effective and important laws and let's start paying polluters to pollute.' Even worse, 'Let's destroy the Renewable Energy Target,' which is the vehicle to create jobs and industry in the 21st century Australian economy. When it comes to health, 'Let's dismantle the most effective thing we have in terms of providing health care'—that is, universal health care and Medicare—'and let's put in co-payments to make people pay more for their health care. Let's follow the two-tiered US model.' There is income support: 'If you are down on your luck, tough luck. We're going to remove income support from you.' The list goes on and on. We have a budget crisis. What is the response? 'I know: tax cuts. We'll fix the budget by cutting taxes.' Not only is their agenda brutal and cruel, it is fiscally irresponsible. The one decent idea that mob had was paid parental leave and they scrapped it.


So, here we are two years on. I remember the times when we would see members of this government standing up and throwing buckets over the then Labor government with exactly the same sorts of matters of public importance. I feel like I have entered a time machine and we have gone back a couple of years. The truth is that we need to have an adult conversation about the needs of the nation. The needs of the nation require us to make some tough decisions—some tough economic decisions—if we are to achieve a balanced budget over the economic cycle. We do need to tackle the issue of raising revenue. Superannuation tax concessions, multinational tax avoidance and tackling the issue of housing affordability through changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing—those are the sorts of discussions that we need to have in this place. How do we build on the institutions that we already know are working? Health care and education—how do we make them stronger and how do we improve them, rather than: how do we tear them down? Unfortunately, this government has shown that it is just not up to the task. In a few short months, the Australian community will be able to make a choice. They know what this government now stands for and I am sure they will make the right choice. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:25):  I too rise to make a contribution to the matter of public importance: the Abbott government's second anniversary of broken promises, slogans, dysfunction and division. Before the last federal election in 2013, the Prime Minister said that he wanted to be known as the Prime Minister who keeps commitments. Here we are today and the reality of the coalition's two years in government could not be more stark. That commitment by the Prime Minister is in tatters. From the very start of this federal government, they started to break promises. They broke the promise that they made to Australian pensioners, they broke the promise that they made to Australian families and they broke the promise that they made to the institutions of the ABC and SBS. They went about breaking nearly every promise that they made to Australians.


Just after the federal election in 2013, I went to a forum that was being presented by Ms Macklin. One of the participants at that forum said, 'I voted for Mr Abbott because he said that he would not cut pensions, and I'm here today because that promise has been broken and I am fearful of what will happen to me.' That is what that Tasmanian said—a Tasmanian who lives in Mr Nikolic's electorate of Bass, who is a member of parliament that did not stand up to the Prime Minister and say, 'Hang on, you said there would be no cuts to pensions. You said that you would not cut pensions, and here we are trying to take money from pensioners who really already struggle to make ends meet.' That is the government that we have here today.


The government is so driven by out-of-date ideology and controlled by vested interests that it has come to stand for nothing but cuts and broken promises. This is a government so focused on itself that it is devoid of any real vision for the nation. The division that now grips Mr Abbott's cabinet and the caucus room has left this government paralysed. It has no legislative agenda and no policy for the future; just a growing list of leadership contenders and, I might add, a growing list of cabinet leakers. Perhaps I should say that there is also a growing dinner card for Mr Murdoch.


Let's see what this government has achieved. We see for the first time in over 20 years more than 800,000 Australians out of work, with unemployment increasing from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent now. You will not hear that in the contributions from those opposite. They do not talk about the 800,000 Australians out of work, they do not talk about the unemployment rate now and they do not talk about the youth unemployment rate. Tasmanian senators in this chamber know that the youth unemployment rate in some parts of Tasmania is over 20 per cent. Shame on those opposite.


They also do not talk about economic growth, which has been below trend in every quarter under this government. You will not hear them talking about that in their contributions here today. Of course, they do not talk about the living pressures on ordinary Australian families. They do not talk about the fact that they want to take away from those families over $6,000— (Time expired)

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2015-09-08,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:30):  For two days in a row now I have had to whip out my driver's licence and have a look at my date of birth, because the opportunity that the Labor Party gave us yesterday and again today looks like a gift! I could not have written this matter of public importance better myself if I had wanted to tailor it around the performance of the Abbott coalition government. 


Let me deal with them one at a time. I will start with the broken promises. I will do a little comparative here, using exactly the same words, so there is no confusion. 'There will be no carbon tax under my government': Gillard. 'There will be no carbon tax under my government': Prime Minister Abbott. Go left or right; go whichever way you like: only one of them was telling the truth. Only one of them kept their promise; the other one broke their promise, and that would be your mob—the Labor-Greens coalition. If we want to talk about broken promises, let us talk about the 70-odd occasions that your Treasurer indicated that we would create a surplus. How many surpluses did we get under Labor? That would be none. So I was delighted when I saw the opportunity to talk about broken promises.


I have a very limited period of time in which to get through this and so much to say, so let me now go to the slogans. I will run through our slogans: 'I'm going to be an infrastructure Prime Minister'—that is a slogan; that was a pearl. 




Senator Reynolds:
  How much?




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  $50 billion, I think, Senator, has been the investment to date—something like seven times the Snowy River scheme. In relation to my home state, I see there are some other senators from Queensland here, and no doubt when they make their contributions today they will acknowledge the coalition government's investment in my state: $6.7 billion on the Bruce Highway. And of course there is our magnificent range crossing, which takes me up to my lovely place at home on those few occasions I get there each month. So I am going to go with that. That is a big green tick on that slogan—we have an infrastructure Prime Minister. 


'We are going to arrest the decline in the budget.' That decline would be the structural deficits that were put in place and were going to continue, in the forward estimates under Labor, to take us to nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars in deficits. We have not heard the word 'trillion' here; we are in the phase between billions and hundreds of billions. We would have had deficits of $0.7 trillion. 


'We are going to stop the boats.' That is what we said. It is not about stopping the boats—I love the words of former Prime Minister John Howard: 'We will determine who comes to our nation and on what terms they arrive.' That does not reflect on any part of the policy other than to say, 'We will have secure borders.' Australia is blessed in the world with having some ability—a better ability than most—to manage our borders. They are not particularly porous. As a result, there is a slogan: 'We will stop the boats.' 


Another slogan: we said we would restore the live export trade. Think about that. Your mob brought the live animal export trade to a standstill, sending tens of thousands of families in my home state and across northern Australia into bankruptcy, in effect. They have never recovered. Third and fourth generation farming families, grazing families, ended up going to the wall. 


I am pleased to see that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—obviously she has been watching me on the television—has come down to pick up a few points. I will go steady so that you can take some notes, Senator Wong. You raised the issue of jobs. We said we would create more jobs. Indeed, in just under two years we created 335,000 jobs. That is 335,000 more people in work in this country than was the case when we took office. 


I will stay around agriculture, because it is one of my favourite subjects. We have free trade agreements with Japan and Korea and of course the pending free trade agreement with China. I predicted yesterday that the effecting legislation for that agreement will pass through this place when Labor finds a way to roll itself over and look like it has not capitulated. It will create tens and tens of thousands more jobs around this nation. Those opposite want to talk about jobs and the FTA, but it is about two bob's worth of jobs that they think are going to be taken under some anomaly in legislation introduced by the Labor Party during their term.


One of my all-time favourites is the reduction in energy costs for small businesses across the nation and some big industries. It got right into our households and it arrested to a certain extent the decline that was happening in manufacturing under Labor. It has allowed people to get on with their businesses and to get them back into a profitable form, where they employ more people. It is right of Labor to raise the topic of jobs. Historically they were the party for jobs, job seekers and workers. I think it is fast evolving not just that the coalition have the reputation of being good economic managers—and I thank those opposite for raising the opportunity to discuss that—but that we are the party for the workers. We are the ones who are creating jobs and giving people a future, growing wealth and getting their personal circumstances into shape. This was a wonderful opportunity for you to raise these matters.


My final bit is about dysfunction and division; in three words: Rudd, Gillard, Rudd. You want to talk about dysfunction and division? Rudd, Gillard, Rudd—three prime ministers in 20 minutes. The ink was not even dry on the letterheads around there—but fortunately, as a savings measure, you were able to whip out the couple of thousand letterheads that were left, and put the Gillard ones in storage, in case we had another turnaround. And of course you did have one more attempt at that; we all know that. You had more attempts at elections. You had more elections over there than they have at my bowls club.


So I want to thank you. You are not even listening to me, ladies. I am genuine in my appreciation of you for having picked the topics of broken promises, slogans, dysfunction and division. Those were perfect topics for us to talk about the failures of the Labor Party during their six-year term.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:38):  Unfortunately, I only have five minutes to talk about the MPI today. Tony Abbott has said so many stupid and insulting things and his government has implemented so many bad policies that it is really hard to know where to start. But I will kick off with my home state of Queensland.


Is Queensland better off under the Abbott government? I believe the answer is no. Has the Abbott government done anything positive for Queensland? Again, I believe the answer is no. Do they have any ideas about how to help Queensland moving forward? Sadly, the answer is no. Queensland has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and is experiencing one of the worst droughts on record, and yet the government has done absolutely nothing—



Senator O'Sullivan interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, you have just had your full eight minutes to make your point. Senator Lazarus has a right to be heard in silence. Thank you.




Senator LAZARUS:
  Queensland has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and is experiencing one of the worst droughts on record, and yet the Abbott government has done absolutely nothing to address these issues.


We need infrastructure projects—improved roads, rail and public utilities. We need jobs, growth and economic expansion. We need increased tourism, regional development and consumer and business confidence. We need clean, local, reliable, renewable energy, more investment in clean energy and cuts to power bills.


But, despite this, what has the Abbott government given us? I have jotted down a few things. It has given us: the continued abuse of human rights by deliberately thwarting marriage equality in Australia; a cut in Australia's carbon emissions reduction target; a cut to Australia's renewable energy target, so that we are now the only country in the world to reduce an RET, and I think that is pretty embarrassing; a spend of $20 million on an advertising campaign to sell its free trade agreement with China, the signing of which allows companies that have a 15 per cent Chinese investor to import 100 per cent overseas workers, undermines Australians' safety and environmental standards and allows companies to sue the Australian government; luxury chopper rides to party fundraisers on the public purse; a dramatic increase in the cost of divorce for women across the country by increasing the cost of Family Court fees from $845 to $1,200; the establishment of a wind farm commissioner—because apparently wind turbines have been known to upset cows in some remote parts of Australia—even though coal seam gas mining is destroying land, farms, water and lives across rural and regional Queensland; cuts to the pension for low and middle income earners without giving them any time to plan or prepare for those cuts; cuts to arts funding by slashing the Australia Council's budget and setting up a 'George Brandis slush fund' for the minister's pet projects; the spending of millions on a widespread advertising campaign to sell their intergenerational report, which is discredited by the celebrity scientist who they paid to sell it; the failure to act on allegations of physical and sexual abuse of asylum seekers on Nauru, despite knowing about it for over a year; threats to sack 1,700 people from research jobs if the Senate did not pass their deregulation bill; multiple attempts to cut funding to the higher education sector and increase the cost of degrees for Australians; the defence of their decision to hold an International Women's Day lunch at a club that only accepts male members; attempts to bully the Human Rights Commission's president into quitting because she questioned the government's treatment of asylum seekers; the bungled tendering process for submarine building in Australia; the awarding of a knighthood to Prince Philip on Australia Day; the abolition of Australia's only National Water Commission, which was responsible for overseeing the management of water across the country; the disbanding of numerous key advisory bodies and councils across the country; cuts to the CSIRO's funding, resulting in mass job losses across the research sector; the statement that coal is good for humanity, made only because they donate large sums of money to the Liberal Party; the scuttling of a proposal from Indigenous leaders for constitutional recognition of first Australians; the gouging of millions of dollars from programs for first Australians across this country; and the statement, as to first Australians, that living in a remote community is 'a lifestyle choice'!


I could go on, but I have run out of time. What has the Abbott government done for Queensland and Australia? Absolutely nothing. All I can say is: bring on the next election. Queensland needs change.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:43):  As Senator Lazarus so rightly put it, where do you start? When the Abbott government was elected two years ago, we were told: 'The adults are back in charge.' Well, this government has just turned two, and it sure is acting its age! I should know this, Mr Acting Deputy President, because, as you know, I spent over a decade in the early childhood area, and I have seen temper tantrums and I have seen tears and I have seen all sorts of spoilt little activities there. And can I say: those on that side just embody two-year-old temper tantrums.


What we have seen in two years is a catalogue of dysfunction and division, broken promises and excuses, and absolutely no sense of confidence that this government knows what direction it is heading in. The last two years have clearly demonstrated that this government had a plan for getting into government—we all know that—but they had no plan for governing once they got there, and they still do not.


The Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, has shown that he is big on three-word slogans, yet very short on any of the 'real solutions' his party promised. We all remember that famous pledge in an SBS television interview the day before the election when he said there would be:


No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


That was the biggest 10-second fib we have ever heard. Following the election, Mr Abbott set about breaking every single one off those promises.


The litany of broken promises from this Prime Minister, and this government, belies something else that Mr Abbott said before the election. He promised a 'no surprises, no excuses government' because 'you are sick of nasty surprises and lame excuses'. What has transpired over the last two years has led the Australian people to seriously question the honesty of the man who occupies the prime ministership and the ministers who support him.


Let's have a look at some of the other promises that were made and compare them to what has transpired over the last two years of this shambolic government. In a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia in February 2013, then opposition leader Tony Abbott said that following a change of government there would be an instantaneous adrenalin charge in our community. Yet, under this government, annual growth has been trending downwards and is now at a paltry two per cent. Prior to the election, the Liberals promised that they would create one million jobs in five years and two million jobs in 10 years. What has happened? Unemployment is now at a 13-year high of 6.3 per cent and, for the first time in over two decades, more than 800,000 Australians are unemployed. This is not surprising when Mr Abbott and his ministers have been doing everything they can to drive automotive and shipbuilding jobs offshore.


In regard to taxation, Mr Abbott said before the election that:


Taxes will always be lower under a Coalition government.


In March 2012 he said:


What you'll get under us are tax cuts with no new taxes.


After coming to government, they have introduced 17 new or increased taxes and charges, including an increase in petrol taxes and a GP tax, which parliament would not pass, being brought in via the back door. And now government ministers are hinting at increases to the GST despite unequivocally ruling it out before the last election. Australia's tax-to-GDP ratio is 22.3 percent—higher than it ever was under the former Labor government—and the budget papers show it is expected to rise every year over the forward estimates.


Despite the Abbott government's tax grab, they have still made savage cuts to essential public services. The government's first budget included $80 billion in cuts to health and education—$57 billion was cut by tearing up Labor's health and hospitals agreements with the states. Their plan to plug the hole left by their cuts to universities is to charge students $100,000 to get a degree.


As a member of the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network, I cannot stand up here today and let the Abbott government's record on the NBN go without comment. I have been over this in more detail in recent speeches, but I will just say that the government promised their NBN would be fast, affordable and sooner. Instead, the rollout of the NBN has slowed to a crawl, the cost has blown out to almost double at $56 billion and most Australians will get a network that can barely cope with the speeds many are demanding now let alone the speeds they will demand in 10 or 20 years time. While Mr Turnbull promised that the NBN would reach every Australian home by 2016, the government's second-rate network will not even reach half of all premises by mid-2017. (Time expired)

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:48):  I am grateful for the opportunity to rise directly after Senator Bilyk because her contribution highlighted the very political nature of this MPI and the fact that so many things in Australia that are important, whether that be health, defence or other things, are completely reduced to slogans by the opposition with, importantly, a complete lack of facts. 


Let me take a couple of things that were just mentioned. There was a claim that the Abbott government had done all it could to drive shipbuilding offshore. The Australian people known by now, because it has been in the media so much, that the reason we are facing the valley of death is that the Labor Party in six years of government signed no contracts to start building ships.



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator FAWCETT:
  Senator Gallacher, a colleague from South Australia who I have great respect for, sighs at that, but he needs to own up to the fact that his side of politics made no commitments for new shipbuilding jobs. They have even come out with the farcical excuse that the reason they did not need to sign any contracts was that shipyards were working at capacity under Labor. Well, guess who commissioned those projects? They were commissioned by the Howard government. Defence has consistently said that, to avoid the valley of death, decisions would have had to have been made in the 2011-12 time frame. That was under the Labor government. Since it is only a month since this government made an announcement of $89 billion for naval shipbuilding programs—including bringing forward the offshore patrol vessels and future frigates to have a continuous build, which is something that people have been calling for in this country for well over a decade—you can see that those claims are purely political and not based on any fact. 


The second claim that was made just then in that contribution was that the Abbott government cut funding to health. That has been a line that has been run by the Labor Party ever since the election. But, if you look at the facts—and I bring here facts from South Australia, which is my state—you will see that in 2013-14 hospital services funding was $983.3 million and public health funding was $23.1 million. So there was a total of just over $1 billion coming from the federal government. In the 2014-15 budget there was $1.053 million for hospital services and $24.3 million for public health—so a total of $1.07 billion. The figure for 2017-18 in the forward estimates is $2.188 billion. So the facts completely undermine the political argument the ALP are running with these claims that they are making.


The Australian public know that a number of the promises made by this government have been delivered and delivered effectively. We need look no further than to things such as abolishing the carbon tax. Not only did we say that we would abolish the carbon tax, but we said we would have a scheme to reduce emissions that would be more effective. When we look at the first of the emissions reduction fund auctions, we see that 47 million tonnes of abatement were achieved at an average price of around $13.95. Let's compare that with the carbon tax: at most, modelling shows it helped reduce emissions by less than 12 million tonnes, but it cost $15.4 billion. That means it is around $1300 per tonne in effect—some 93 times more expensive. It also had an impact not only on households—calculated at just over $550 on average per household—but also, and importantly, on the viability of our manufacturing industry, which goes to the heart of job opportunities for young Australians, and particularly those in a state like South Australia. Not only has this government followed through with its promise to get rid of the carbon tax, but it has made good on its commitment to put in place a scheme that will provide more emissions abatement at a better price without those negative impacts on the economy.


We have also seen the promise of getting control over our borders. That has had the benefits of stopping the people smuggling business and of preventing people drowning at sea. Yes, there are the cost savings, but there is also the human element. One of the things that people constantly talk to me about when it comes to border protection is: 'We don't like the thought of children being in detention.' Can I tell you that, when the Howard government left office, there were no children in detention, but under the policies of the ALP, which threw open our borders, there were over 1900 children in detention in July 2013. Within a year and a half of this government coming to office and putting in place our border protection policies, not only have we regained control of the borders and broken the people smuggling model, but we have reduced the number of children in detention down to the low hundreds. That is a fantastic outcome from a humanitarian perspective. 


For those people who say that this government has made promises and has been chaotic, I ask them to look at some of the signature policies. The last area I will talk about is Defence. The Secretary of Defence made the comment that under the last government, not only did the goal posts move, but they were torn down and burnt—used for firewood—because of the budgetary damage done to the Defence department. This government has put us back on a track to achieving two per cent over the decade. We have started to stabilise the management of Defence with the First Principles Review; we have made the commitment I talked about before for sustainable shipbuilding. On those issues that are important to Australians—the economy, national defence and things like the environment—this government has followed through with its promises and good management to achieve real outcomes that impact Australians.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:55):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance before us today on the Abbott government's second anniversary of broken promises, slogans, dysfunction and division. I want to start with some of the slogans—not all of them, because there are enough of them to fill a book. Remember 'We are on a unity ticket with Gonski'? Who could forget that before the election? 'It doesn't matter who you vote for, we are on this unity ticket on Gonski.' Well, that all fell apart. What about the classic, 'Coal is good for humanity'? Where did that get us? Absolutely nowhere. What about that other classic, 'People have a right to be bigots'? Where has that got us? There was a complete backdown, as there should have been, on those outrageous changes to the Racial Discrimination Act. What about the promises, and indeed the signs and all the commitments, that subs would be built in South Australia? Remember that? They tried to deny it, but we all heard it and we saw the signs—the truth was out there.


What about that absolute insult to people, who find themselves unemployed, and  particularly young people in Mandurah—14.6 per cent is the unemployment rate in the seat of Canning. They do nothing about it and in fact they insult people by coming up with titles like 'lifters and leaners'. Remember 'lifters and leaners'? It is not only Labor that is saying that. Lenore Taylor just a few days ago had a classic in The Guardian: 


Two years in and the Abbott government remains a clamour of battle slogans in search of a policy purpose.


Everyone says that this government is absolutely incapable of good government and good policy and that it is living in some parallel universe. 


All this from the Prime Minister, the bloke who in January knighted Prince Philip. For many Australians that was the end of it; it made us an absolute joke. What about climate change? Under Labor Australia was the world leader in the area of climate change, but now we are an embarrassment. We are chugging along at the bottom of the pile and so much so that President Obama tells us what an embarrassment we are. There is still no science around Direct Action—no scientist has come out to say, 'Good on you, Abbott government, what a great policy.' Why? Because it is just a joke. 


What did we see in February? We saw that bungled attempt at changing the prime minister—we will have this kind of leadership battle where many of his ministers and some of the backbench desert him—but somehow he survived and what did he promise? He promised good government. We are still waiting. Two years in, and we are still waiting on good government. The only thing the Prime Minister really cares about is his own job. We saw all those rumours come out of cabinet last week. We saw all those lines coming out of cabinet: 'What we've gotta say, folks, is we're all on message. We're all singing Kombaya and we all have to say what a good government we are.' Fancy somebody writing lines saying: 'Just tell people we're a good government.' Good governments have actions and words, but we have seen none of that from the Abbott government. We certainly have not seen any action. 


What about working people? We have seen an unprecedented attack on working people in this country—whether it is their trade unions or their rates of pay. We have seen those opposite clamour to say penalty rates should somehow be taken away. Penalty rates make up 30 per cent of the take-home pay of workers. What do those opposite say? 'Get rid of them.' 


They are about reducing the pay of workers by 30 per cent without a blink of their eyes. They think it is a fair thing to take penalty rates off aged-care workers, off hospitality workers, and off cleaners who clean this building late at night or early in the morning. They think it is fair to say to them, 'We are going to take 30 per cent of your pay'. 


Well, Australians are no longer fooled, and the big test before us right now is the Canning by-election. ChAFTA is running hot there. They know it and so do we, because every day in this place we have these ridiculous Dorothy Dixer questions about how good it is. The people of Canning are concerned about their jobs, and that is the truth. If those opposite bothered to get out there, if they bothered to drive south of the river, they would hear that for themselves on the doorsteps of voters in Canning. The facade of the Abbott government is well and truly over; people know that it is nothing but a bad government.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:00):  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this MPI today. One thing that we do know after two years of the Abbott government is that, no matter what area you look at across public administration or national affairs, the Abbott government has either created turbulence or systematically gone out to have fights. This is in almost in every single area when you look across the board—whether it be attacking pensioners or people on disability pensions; whether it is attacking their own public servants through outrageous wage offers and cuts to conditions; whether it is attacks on women who are accessing paid parental leave; whether it is looking at what they said prior to the election and what they actually delivered after the election. 


In almost every area you go to, you can see what they said before the election and then Tony Abbott's own words: 'Measure us by what we do.' The people of Australia are measuring you by the actions you take—actions like saying one thing before an election, then getting in and fragmenting the social compact that exists across Australia, and actions like creating fights and instability in almost every area of public administration. 


Look at health; look at industrial relations; look at the ABC and SBS; look at education—look at all of these important areas. Before the election they said: 'There will be no cuts. There will be no changes. We are on a unity ticket'. Then, after the election, in the first budget—who will forget the 2014-15 budget?—no-one was left untouched by that budget. That was when the cuts came, and that is when the true colours of this government were displayed in hundreds of papers, and they cannot avoid that now. They tried to cover up a bit of it in 2015-16 budget, but the damage was done. 


If we look at the area of science, there is a classic quote from Tony Abbott:


I’m pleased to pledge the incoming Government to continue to support science to the fullest extent possible.


… … …


… I’d say to all of you, please, judge us by our performance.


Well, let's have a look: $115 million cut from CSIRO; $300 million from the Sustainable Research Excellence fund; $75 million from the ARC; $107 million from the CRC; $28 million cut from ANSTO; $16 million from Geoscience Australia; $120 million from Defence Science and Technology Organisation; 1,400 jobs gone from CSIRO, and 200 more to come because NICTA, which has also been defunded, is forced to merge with CSIRO just to continue its very existence. 


Canberra is the jurisdiction that I have the privilege of serving and have served for many years at a local level. We always see Senator Seselja's mug on TV here, smiling happily behind Tony Abbott when he does his press here in Canberra. So let's have a look at what Canberra can be proud of: 8,000 job cuts, constant attacks on the integrity of the public service, cuts to health, cuts to education, cuts to community organisations and too many others for me to name in the next one minute and 30 seconds. 


There has been $26 million taken from the University of Canberra to establish a centre for quality teaching to actually learn and understand exactly the benefits of needs-based education funding. That is just gone—awarded under one government, cut-up under the next—but not before a recruitment exercise had started. There have been cuts to all of the national institutions. They have all been cut—a bit of a saving here, a bit of a saving there. 


Let's look at the Tony Abbott propaganda document that was released yesterday, 'Sticking to our plan'—and didn't everyone look happy about that in question time today? On the infrastructure page it tells us about all the infrastructure that has been delivered. When we look at the summary of major infrastructure, all of the states and all of the territories are there—except the ACT. And there was Senator Seselja, smiling and nodding behind Tony Abbott as they released this document yesterday, but there was not one cent for the ACT outlined in this document. 


Yet the ribbon-cutting continues. We have seen Senator Seselja snip the Majura Parkway, the Bowen underpass and even hospital beds in the cancer centre. It was all funded under a federal Labor government and has not one thing to do with the Liberal Party, and yet there he is, cutting the ribbon, getting his mug on TV and taking credit. All this is happening at the same time that Canberra is being savaged by this government—without any advocacy from the government side of the chamber to stand up for Canberra and the proud city that we are—and he should be ashamed.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-08,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (18:05):  I rise to continue remarks that were interrupted by question time earlier today. To recap in simple terms, a few years ago the then Labor government made a decision to take money away from people, and the bill before the chamber today, the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015, returns that money to people and returns us to the default position where people can expect that they will not have money taken from their bank account before it is inactive for a period of seven years. As I indicated in my earlier remarks, that had been the record and the policy of the Commonwealth government from 1911 through to 2012. Over that period, it was always the case that you had seven years before unclaimed moneys would be claimed by the government. A couple of years ago, the then Labor government, in a desperate and ultimately futile attempt to reach a budget target, decided to reach into the piggy banks of every Australian household and take that money off them earlier, changing that policy of 101 years. This bill helps change that back.


It was a policy for 101 years, almost the entire period of the Commonwealth government, a time in which we had the two world wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War and two Olympic Games in Australia. It was a consistent policy over that entire time frame. But then, suddenly, the world's greatest Treasurer, and the world's greatest finance minister, said a few years ago: 'It may have been be policy for more than 100 years, but I think it is wrong and we should take that money back from people after three years not seven years.' Unfortunately, the world's greatest Treasurer got that wrong two years ago and the government has now got it right in returning our position back to the default position, which is that people can expect to have their money in the bank for at least seven years before it is deemed to be unclaimed money and taken by the government.


The scope of the change was quite significant. It was not simply an administrative change of going from seven to three years; there was a substantial amount of money put at risk with this change. In 2013, the year after that the decision was made, $550 million in unclaimed moneys was taken by the federal government. That was the year after Mr Swan, as Treasurer, changed the law that had existed for 101 years. In 2012, the year before that change, there was only $70 million in unclaimed moneys. So it went from $70 million a year to $550 million a year. You can see why the Labor Party saw this as a juicy target. They were struggling to keep any kind of control over the budget and to keep consistency in the promises they were making to people to balance the budget at the time. So they saw half a billion dollars sitting in bank accounts, which people expected was their money, and they took that money. That is literally what they did. They took $500 million that was additional to what would normally be claimed—or, to be precise, $480 million—and transferred it to the government to help build their budget bottom line. What kind of government does that overnight? Even if you thought seven years was too long and it should be three, four, or five, you would think you would take a little longer, not just make that change overnight, within a year, and suddenly go from taking a $70 million a year in unclaimed moneys to $550 million. But it was certainly not out of step with the aptitude and approach of the Rudd-Gillard government. Unfortunately, this government has had to spend a lot of time fixing up the mistakes and missteps of the former government—and this is another one that is being fixed.


This bill will reverse the policy of taking people's money after three years and go back to seven years. As I said before, the Labor Party were caught red handed in this wild spending spree smashing the piggy banks of people all around the country. They were caught red handed and they have now fessed up to it. My understanding is that they are going to support this bill. That is great, and I compliment them for that. But the best thing to do when you realise have done something wrong—and I have certainly done many wrong things in my life—is to admit it and make amends for it. And it is good to see that the Labor Party are finally making amends for this.


But I suppose there is some silver lining as well to what happened a few years ago. Perhaps it is a case of 'no bad deed going unrewarded', because this bill now makes improvements, I believe, in regard to the policies on unclaimed moneys. As I said, it has been consistent for a long time to claim those moneys after a seven-year period. But this bill would extend some exemptions to certain accounts such that the moneys in those accounts will not be claimed by the government even after seven years. I think that is a positive development. For example, funds in children's accounts will be exempt from this legislation. Of course, many Australians seek to put savings into a child's account for their future and put it in their trust. Sometimes, activities in those counts may be understandably low, because they might not receive any additional funds or, indeed, have any activity for a period of seven years or more. Notwithstanding that, the parents or guardians would still expect that money to be available for the child once they turn 18 or become responsible for their own financial affairs. In recognition of that fact, the government has made a decision not to punish parents or other Australians who have not realised that there is that seven-year period. So children's accounts will be exempted in this bill, and I think that is a very positive change.


Similarly, bank accounts denominated in foreign currency will also be exempted. This is to reflect the fact that foreign currency accounts are usually used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex international business transactions. There are only a small number of these accounts in the country. In the government's view, it would be an unnecessary and unreasonable impost of red tape to expose those accounts to this particular legislative framework, so they will be exempted as well.


There are a number of other changes that will also improve the operation of this legislation. The government has made a decision to no longer publish ASIC's Unclaimed Money gazettes. While there have been some concerns that this may make it harder for people to reclaim their unclaimed moneys, ASIC already provides MoneySmart, an online resource for reuniting account holders with their accounts. Anyone listening who feels they may have unclaimed money can go to www.moneysmart.gov.au to try and find it. This particular change, in conjunction with stricter controls on access to information about unclaimed moneys, will help to protect Australians with unclaimed accounts from exploitation. In my view, that is another positive change in this piece of legislation. This bill implements a number of privacy protections and secrecy provisions to limit the access to this information to those people who truly need it.


At the moment, a freedom of information request to ASIC can result in the personal information of Australians with unclaimed accounts being published. That information can include the account holder's name, their last known address and the amount of money unclaimed. The Australian Information Commissioner has raised concerns that this level of information could enable identity theft. Apparently, there are reports that some unscrupulous businesses are using such information to charge fees as high as 25 per cent to reunite people with their own money. The government believes that behaviour should not be accepted, or at least should not be encouraged and supported, through the provision of information to people who do not own the account. This bill will ensure that future FOI requests in regards to unclaimed moneys will only reveal details to the individual whose account it is. To receive these details through an FOI request in the future, the actual individual who owns the account would have had to have made that request. That change will help ensure that people's private details do, indeed, remain private.


The government will also ensure that it is easier to keep accounts active by making it easier for people to demonstrate or qualify for an active account so that their account is not unclaimed. All they will need to do in the future is check their account online or over the phone for an account balance. That simple check will trigger the account to remain active and it would not be subject to unclaimed moneys legislation.


Taken in combination, these changes will I believe make the framework that has existed for over a century stronger. They will make it more responsive to the particular uses that Australian consumers make of their bank accounts, particularly by exempting children's savings accounts. While it is unfortunate that the former Labor government decided to change the more-than-a-century-old framework in this field, I believe that, when this bill passes, we will have a stronger unclaimed moneys framework, and one that is more responsive to consumers' needs.


It is also the case that the changes will help reduce regulatory burden on the sector. Having to claim money within a three-year time limit rather than a seven-year time limit may raise more money for the government, but it does impose a burden on the financial sector. Going back to the previous regime will help remove that burden. It is estimated that that will save the wider economy $36 million a year. Of course, that includes not just the burden placed on banks and life insurers who have to transfer this money to the government but also the burden placed on Australians themselves who will less frequently have to check and try to track down the moneys that may be unclaimed.


That saving of red tape and the reduction of the regulatory burden is a core commitment and a core value of this government. We should be a government that seeks to walk softly for business. We have a need for regulation in many areas, and this, indeed, is an example of where there is a need for some form of regulation. But we should seek to minimise its impost on businesses, particularly small businesses, and, of course, we should seek to ensure that regulation does not unduly restrict the development of our economy, the creation of jobs and the creation of a more wealthy and prosperous community. This is just one small element of the government's regulatory reduction agenda. We have made it easier for large projects to be approved in this country. Indeed, there has been more than $700 million worth of projects approved since this government came to power. We have reduced regulation of the farm sector, particularly around the approval of chemicals and pesticides, which was becoming increasingly burdensome for that sector. Added up, these changes make a big difference.


The government is also now progressing further reforms to make it easier to get projects like the Adani coalmine in Central Queensland, near where I live, across the line. This project has the potential to deliver 10,000 jobs to Central Queensland, which is half the size of the NBN, in terms of value, just in Central Queensland. It is something that we need to do. We should have done it years ago. It has taken us five years to say yes or no. We need to reduce that regulatory burden to make it easier for people to invest in our country.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-09-08,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (18:20):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015. This is a very important bill for the savers and the taxpayers of Australia. Under the previous Labor government, over $550 million was raided from 156,000 accounts after Bill Shorten, the then responsible minister, reduced this inactive period for bank accounts from seven years to three years. Effectively, it was the greatest period of bank robbery since Ned Kelly was fandangling around the Victorian bush. This is a good bill because it is on the side of Australian taxpayers and Australian savers. No government should be taking the savings of Australians after such a small period as three years. Returning it to seven years is, I think, an appropriate balance for the taxpayers and savers of Australia.


In May 2014, the government released a discussion paper on potential changes to the unclaimed moneys regime. It requested comments in relation to three particular options. The first option was retaining the status quo of three years that had been brought in by Labor—and that huge cash grab of half a billion dollars in one year alone that I mentioned before. The second option was increasing the period of inactivity to five years. The third option was to return it to a period of seven years. This particular discussion paper also included comments and discussion on related issues, including whether foreign currency accounts should be captured and balancing the privacy requirements with the requirement to publish information on unclaimed moneys and other administrative matters.


In November 2014 the financial system inquiry discussed unclaimed moneys in an appendix to its final report. That report stated:


At present, bank accounts and life insurance policies are deemed to be unclaimed monies and transferred to Government if they are inactive for three years. The present position was changed in 2012, from a longstanding arrangement that required an inactive period of seven years.


The Australian Bankers’ Association estimates that reverting to seven years would halve the number of claims. The Inquiry believes Government should act to ensure bank accounts and life insurance policies are deemed unclaimed after seven years of inactivity and that these monies should be held in a separate trust account.


The final report recommended that the government should define bank accounts and life insurance policies as unclaimed moneys if they are inactive for seven years. So, in the 2015-16 budget the government announced that effective from 31 December 2015 it would make a number of changes to the unclaimed moneys provisions in the Banking Act 1959 and the Life Insurance Act. The Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 will amend the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to specify that funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies cannot be deemed to be unclaimed and therefore transferred to the Commonwealth until they have been inactive for a period of seven years.


The bill will also introduce secrecy provisions into the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to ensure that even under a freedom of information request the particulars of the amount of unclaimed money or the person to whom the money is payable cannot be released to anyone other than the account holder or an agent acting on their behalf. This bill also amends the Banking Act to exempt funds held in foreign currency from the unclaimed money provisions; to exempt funds held by or on behalf of an individual under the age of 18 from unclaimed moneys provisions; to ensure that if an account holder or their agent notifies their financial institution that they would like their account to remain active at any time prior to its transfer to the Commonwealth that this account does not have to be transferred; and to remove the requirement to publish an unclaimed moneys gazette while still ensuring that the Treasurer can make the details of those with unclaimed accounts publicly available in such a manner as the Treasurer determines.


Even though the matter is quite simple in terms of what the government is trying to achieve here—that is, returning the period of inactivity from three years to seven years before the government can get their grubby fingers on the money and the savings of Australian taxpayers—it is actually quite a complex matter. I think it is worthwhile going into some detail of the terms of particular provisions of what the government is attempting to achieve. This bill makes amendments to the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to give effect to the unclaimed moneys measures announced in this year's budget. The bill extends from three years to seven years the period of inactivity required before funds from what are called authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs—I do not want to get caught up in the big words—and life insurance provider accounts and life insurance amounts can be transferred to the Commonwealth. As such, accounts held by ADIs and life insurance providers will have to be inactive for a period of seven years before they are deemed to be unclaimed moneys and transferred to the Commonwealth. The bill exempts ADI accounts created for children and those that are held in a foreign currency from the unclaimed moneys provisions. It will also stop ADI accounts from being transferred to the Commonwealth where the account holder provides notification that the account should be treated as active after the account is assessed as unclaimed money at the end of the calendar year but before it is transferred to the Commonwealth.


The bill also promotes and protects the privacy of individuals who have accounts with unclaimed moneys by removing the requirement for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC, to publish details of unclaimed moneys in the annual unclaimed moneys gazette, introducing a secrecy provision to prevent access to information on unclaimed moneys via the Freedom of Information Act and making consequential amendments to the FOI Act to restrict access to information about unclaimed moneys under freedom of information requests. Chapter 1 of the bill, which is an amendment to the Banking Act 1959, will amend the Banking Act to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by ADIs. Currently ADIs are required to assess all accounts to determine whether they consist of unclaimed moneys by 31 December each year and transfer any that do to the Commonwealth by 31 March the following year. An account held by an ADI consists of unclaimed moneys if, in the previous three years, there have been no transactions in the account other than interest or charges and the account holder has not satisfied the notification requirements by, for example, checking their account balance online or on the phone or specifically advising their bank that they would like the account to remain active.


Evidence suggests that many of the accounts that are declared unclaimed and transferred to the Commonwealth are effectively active, as the account holder remains aware of them. For example, around 15 per cent of unclaimed funds transferred from ADIs are reclaimed in the same year that they are transferred to the Commonwealth. Approximately 50 per cent of all funds transferred to the Commonwealth as unclaimed moneys are reclaimed within two years. The proportion of effectively active accounts that are transferred to the Commonwealth each year under the current provisions—that is, the three-year period for inactive accounts—increases the regulatory burden of the unclaimed moneys provisions for ADIs but also, and I think more importantly, for account holders—that is, the taxpayers and the savers of Australia who have put the money away for a rainy day but wake up one day to find that someone, 'Big Brother' or 'Big Sister' down in Canberra, has swiped their account. ADIs have to assess and transfer all accounts with unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth even though many of the accounts are still effectively active. Once these accounts have been transferred, account holders have to complete the necessary paperwork and verify their details in order to reclaim their accounts.


To minimise the number of effectively active accounts that are transferred to the Commonwealth, regulation 20A of the Banking Regulations enables account holders to notify their ADI that an account should be treated as active. If notification is provided prior to 31 December—that is, when ADIs have to assess accounts as unclaimed moneys—then the account does not have to be transferred to the Commonwealth. If, however, the account holder provides notification after the account is assessed as unclaimed money on 31 December but before the ADI transfers the sum of money to the Commonwealth, then the amount must still be transferred. This is inconsistent with the treatment of accounts where the account holder satisfies the activity requirements, such as completing a transaction, after the account has been deemed to be unclaimed but before the funds are transferred to the Commonwealth, as these accounts do not have to be transferred to the Commonwealth.


The unclaimed money provisions currently apply to foreign currency accounts and children's accounts. The application of the unclaimed money provisions to these accounts does not align with how they are used by the community. Foreign currency accounts are generally used by consumers who are a little bit more sophisticated in relation to the settlement of their business transactions in relation to foreign currencies. Transferring these accounts to the Commonwealth under the unclaimed money provisions requires the account to be converted into Australian dollars, potentially exposing the account holder to exchange rate fluctuations. Given this risk and the fact that these accounts are used by such sophisticated consumers who are likely to know of these accounts, it is not appropriate to transfer them to the Commonwealth under the provisions. Likewise, children's accounts are generally established for long periods so that the money can be set aside in a high-interest account for a child to access on, for example, their 18th birthday. Transferring these accounts to the Commonwealth may result in some children losing out on higher interest rates because accounts transferred to the Commonwealth will only accrue interest at the rate of the consumer price index. 


Details of unclaimed moneys held by the Commonwealth must be published annually in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's unclaimed money gazette. Information on unclaimed moneys is also released under the Freedom of Information Act and is published on the ASIC website. Details of unclaimed moneys are also searchable online via the ASIC MoneySmart website. The level of information available has created the opportunity for groups to approach account holders offering to reunite them with their account for a fee. Account holders can reclaim their money from the government at no charge. The level of information could also potentially be used for identity theft.


The new law amends the Banking Act to extend the unclaimed moneys period from three years to seven years. The new law also provides that ADI accounts created for children and those with foreign currency accounts are exempt from the unclaimed moneys provisions. The new law stops ADI accounts being transferred to the Commonwealth where the account holder provides notification that the account should be treated as active after the account is assessed as unclaimed moneys at the end of the calendar year but before it is transferred to the Commonwealth. The new law amends the Banking Act to remove the requirements for ASIC to publish details of unclaimed moneys in the unclaimed money gazette and introduces a secrecy provision to prevent access to information on unclaimed moneys via the FOI Act. The Treasurer will retain the ability to publish information on unclaimed moneys, such as on the ASIC's MoneySmart website.


Chapter 2 of the bill will provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by life insurance providers. Currently life insurance providers are required to assess all accounts to determine if they consist of unclaimed moneys by 31 December each year and, similar to those with ADIs, transfer any such funds to the Commonwealth by 31 March of the following year. An account held by a life insurance provider consists of unclaimed moneys if there have been no transactions in the account other than interest or charges in the previous three years. Many of the accounts that are transferred to the Commonwealth are still effectively active, as the account holder, similar to those with ADIs, remains aware of them. Around nine per cent of life insurance accounts are reclaimed in the same year as they were transferred to the Commonwealth, and 50 per cent of all funds transferred are reclaimed within two years. 


The high proportion of effectively active accounts that are transferred to and reclaimed from the Commonwealth creates a regulatory burden for life insurance providers and account holders. Life insurance providers have to assess and transfer all accounts with unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth even though the accounts may still be effectively active. Once these accounts are transferred, account holders have to complete the necessary paperwork and verify their details in order to reclaim their accounts. Information on any unclaimed moneys is released under the Freedom of Information Act and is published on the ASIC website. Details of unclaimed money are also available to search online via the ASIC MoneySmart website. This level of information that has been available has created the opportunity for groups to approach account holders offering to reunite them with their account for a fee, similar to those under ADIs. But account holders can reclaim their money from the government at no charge. The level of information could also potentially be used for identity theft. In summary, this new law amends the Life Insurance Act to introduce new secrecy provisions and to extend the unclaimed moneys provision from three years to seven years from 31 December 2015. 


We should consider how this has come about. It was an act of the previous Labor government, back in 2012, to reduce the period for unclaimed moneys to be transferred to the Commonwealth from seven years to three years. In 2012-13, the federal government was able to pilfer from Australian taxpayers and Australian savers a sum of over half a billion dollars.


When the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity before funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies could be transferred, the value of unclaimed money transferred to ASIC grew more than eightfold in a single year. Much of this money, however, was not truly unclaimed and the previous government's changes left many Australian families in a position of financial distress. It also imposed a large red-tape cost on industry which, first, had to transfer accounts to and then reclaim them from ASIC on behalf of their customers, often in the same year. This situation must not continue. It had a particular impact on the savings accounts of elderly Australians who had worked for decades to put money away for a rainy day or put money away for their children and grandchildren. They suddenly woke up one day and found that the people in Canberra had got their grubby fingers all over their savings. It is a shameful period in how we look after people who work to save money for the greater benefit of Australia.


In order to protect these account holders and industry, this bill returns the required period of inactivity before funds can be transferred from bank accounts or life insurance policies to seven years—that is, once they are truly unclaimed. A seven-year period had been in existence for a considerable amount of time. People knew that they had seven years. Reducing it—

  Come on, fire up!




Senator McGRATH:
  Do you want me to fire up? I am happy to fire up. I was going to take a gentle path, but if you want me to fire up I am more than happy to fire up. You know that. I am easily provoked.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator McGrath, address the chair.




Senator McGRATH:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think this is a very good bill because it returns the savings of Australians to them and returns the period of inactivity of bank accounts before they can be taken from three years to seven years. The government of Australia should be helping people save money, not taking it from their bank accounts like some nefarious Ned Kelly.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (18:40):  It is a pleasure and a privilege to follow Senator McGrath in this debate—a great senator from the great state of Queensland. In my remarks I want to do a number of things. I want to talk a bit about an aspect of history relating to the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015. It goes back to the period when I was Assistant Treasurer. I went on a radio program—I think it was on 2GB—and was being interviewed by Jason Morrison. I went on to talk about some legislative issues current at the time, but he immediately got into me on the issue of unclaimed moneys and the fact that in 2012 the former government had reduced the period before funds could be transferred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission from seven years to three years, which had resulted in a large number of effectively active accounts being transferred to ASIC, and that left many Australians financially stressed. I was quite surprised at the strength of his feeling on this subject. It registered with me. It was also raised in the coalition party room and the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, undertook to examine the matter. This bill is the fruit of that consideration. I commend the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, for following through with this particular bill.


When you have worked in government over a long period, as I have, you come across a lot of savings options. I suppose you could get to the point where you sometimes think that one savings option is as good as another, but you must never underestimate the public reaction to these things. There is no doubt that this particular measure struck a chord with a lot of people, and that of course was then reflected in the comments of media commentators, such as Jason Morrison and others. So, in one sense, you could say that this is the Jason Morrison bill. I am sure he will be chuffed that I say that about him. I do not think he is working in media any longer, but that shows the influence that people can have in setting some of these agendas, and I recognise his contribution on this particular bill.


This bill does a number of things. It implements a decision in the 2015-16 budget that, effective from 31 December this year, there would be a number of changes to the unclaimed moneys provisions in the Banking Act 1959 and the Life Insurance Act 1995. The bill amends the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to specify that funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies cannot be deemed to be unclaimed and therefore be transferred to the Commonwealth until they have been inactive for at least seven years. The bill will also introduce secrecy provisions into the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to ensure that, even under a freedom of information request, the particulars of the amount of unclaimed money or the person to whom the money is payable cannot be released to anyone other than the account holder or an agent acting on their behalf.


The bill also amends the Banking Act to exempt funds held in a foreign currency from the unclaimed moneys provisions. It exempts funds held by or on behalf of an individual under the age of 18 from the unclaimed moneys provisions. It ensures that, if an account holder or their agent notifies an approved deposit-taking institution, or ADI, any time prior to the funds being transferred to the Commonwealth that they would like their account to remain active, the account does not have to be transferred. It removes the requirement to publish an unclaimed moneys gazette while still ensuring that the Treasurer can make the details of those unclaimed accounts publicly available in such a manner as the Treasurer determines.


The unclaimed moneys provisions exist to protect Australians' forgotten savings and life insurance policies from being eroded by fees and charges over time. So the public policy intent behind the original measures is fair enough and sensible. After an account has been inactive for seven years, the funds in that account will be transferred to the government, where they will grow at the rate of the consumer price index, tax-free. No matter what, these funds continue to belong to their rightful owner and can be reclaimed at any time through contact with either ASIC or their financial institution. There is no fee charged for this service.


As I alluded to earlier, Australia has had provisions to effect the transfer of unclaimed funds to the government since at least the introduction of the Commonwealth Bank Act in 1911. Between 1911 and 2012 accounts must have been inactive for at least seven years before accounts could be transferred. In late 2012 the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity to three years. This resulted in half a billion dollars from thousands of accounts—that in many cases their owners were aware of—being transferred to the Commonwealth. This placed many Australians in a position of financial distress. Returning the required period of inactivity to seven years is expected to reduce the number of accounts transferred to the government each year by up to 50 per cent and reduce the regulatory burden on the community by $36 million each year. As I noted earlier, the changes are due to take effect from 31 December 2015. This means that no funds should be assessed as unclaimed until at least 2019 and no unclaimed funds should be transferred to the government until at least 2020. 


There are, as I mentioned earlier, a number of exemptions. For example, many Australians set money aside for their children's future and trust that this money will continue to grow in value and be available for the children when, say, they turn 18. In recognition of this fact and to reward, not punish, those Australians working hard to contribute to their family's future, funds from children's accounts will never be transferred to the government. This is sensible. People putting the money away—normally the parents or perhaps the grandparents—clearly have a stake or an interest in those funds being properly invested and growing in value over time and therefore they are likely to keep an eye on those accounts. It is not a matter in such cases, I believe, of people potentially forgetting that those accounts exist. So this is a sensible provision for exemption.


Why is the government exempting foreign currency accounts from the unclaimed moneys provisions? Again, this is a sensible change. Accounts in a foreign currency are primarily used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex international transactions. Not only does transferring these accounts to the government potentially disrupt these processes; it also exposes the account holder to a loss, as their funds must be converted to Australian dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. So, as I said before, this was initially a budget savings measure, but we have to have equity and equity involves taking due account of the needs of the community, and the community have spoken loudly on this measure.


Finally, may I say that the red tape agenda is served by this bill as well, with a regulatory saving of $36 million per year. The federal government has shown its commitment to its deregulation agenda by the fact that it is prepared to incur a fiscal cost to reduce the fiscal balance by $158 million over four years from 2015-16 to implement this commitment. That shows genuine commitment to the regulatory process. On that basis, I complete my remarks.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (18:48):  While I think that a lot of this bill is worthy and warrants the discussion of the Senate and that parts of this measure are a step in the right direction, it worries me that this type of banking reform is a priority for the government when so much of the banking reform that needs to happen in this country is not being undertaken. To start my remarks, I want to briefly touch on the issue at hand, which is how a government can best deal with unclaimed moneys. 


The Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 largely reverses the measure introduced by the previous Labor government in 2012, and this is really about extending the period in which people can claim unclaimed moneys. There has been an extensive process of consultation and discussion. The government has said that this is somewhat of a priority and it has used this opportunity to bring this bill forward. Let us not kid ourselves: this has a considerable direct cost to the budget of $285 million over the next four years, from 2015-16.


When it comes to banking reform, my worry is that the government is choosing to undertake this kind of measure, whereas I believe that banking reform is needed in the area of credit cards, where the government has been very slow and very inactive. We now have a situation where there is $51.5 billion worth of credit card debt in this country, with 33.1 billion of that accruing interest. What does this mean? There has been a 47 per cent increase in credit card balances over the last 10 years. One and a half times the amount of credit card debt exists right now than existed a decade ago. The problem is that a select group of people are being artificially hurt by all of this, and they are the ones who are being hurt the most. According to a submission made by the Reserve Bank of Australia to a Senate inquiry into this issue, 27 per cent of people do not pay off their cards, and the number of cards itself is at the extraordinary level of 16 million. There is now more than one credit card for every person in this country who is eligible to have a card.


You could ask the question: 'There is $33 billion of credit card debt, and it's accruing interest; who's actually paying?' because you get out there and there are these fantastic products that look like they are at eight per cent or nine per cent, and credit cards that are not just the cards with the higher rates at 19 per cent to 22 per cent. Here are the facts. The people who are paying interest on credit cards are paying an average spread of 14¾ per cent, while across cards as a whole the spread is nine per cent. What do I mean by that? It is the gap between what it costs to borrow money and what it costs the bank to actually get the money. The cash rate at the moment is two per cent. The cash rate has continuously fallen over the past five years. Credit card interest rates have not fallen. And not only have they not fallen, but the people who are actually paying the interest—the people in the debt trap situation—are those on the higher rate cards. On average, they are paying 5¾ per cent higher than the average cards that are available.


You ask yourself: 'How has this industry been allowed to perform the way it is? How has this been allowed to occur?' And don't get me wrong—I think this is an issue that has grown and is actually becoming a bipartisan issue. As much as I would love to say that everything was rosy under the previous governments and that this government has failed to act—and this government has failed to act—I think that, while we took some steps in the last government, in hindsight there were more steps that we should have taken, and they are the steps we should be looking at taking now.


I just want to touch on some of these figures, just to understand how profitable an industry this is. There is $8½ billion worth of revenue generated by the credit card industry—$8½ billion—and $1.4 billion of that comes from fees. The average fee on credit cards, per card, for every person is $90. It is $90 on average you are paying in fees, either directly or indirectly. The reality is: most people are paying fees without realising they are paying fees. There is $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion that has developed through this entire process of interchange—the inter-merchant fees. And there is $5.4 billion that comes from interest.


Of course the cost of borrowing money in unsecured credit is always going to be more than the cost of lending it, and it is always going to have a reasonable mark-up. That is an understandable development. What I cannot understand, and what no-one has been able to explain to me or to our committee in our inquiry is: why is that gap now at a record level? Why is it that, in the past five years, as interest rates on loans for houses and every other thing have fallen in line with, or at least in relation to, the falling cash rate, credit card rates have remained stubbornly high? Frankly, I think it demonstrates perhaps a failure in this market.


There are those in the industry who will talk to you about just how many different products are out there. And it is half true. There are lots of different cards. There are not a lot of different products. You can get a lot of different cards with different kinds of rates and slightly different variations in what they are offering, but they are not fundamentally different products. If you want to shake up this market, you have to open the doors and allow in some fundamentally new products. I think there is a series of big ideas that need to be explored and which we are exploring through this process.


Firstly, we should be looking at the portability of credit card numbers. What does that mean? That means allowing people to take their credit card numbers with them in the same way as you can take your mobile phone number. Ten years ago we had this same problem in the mobile phone market. It used to be that you would go out there and you would buy a Vodaphone phone or an Optus phone or a Telstra phone and, when you did that, you had that number and that number was stuck with that company and you could not move it. To create more competition and to give consumers more power, one of the big reforms we did was to turn it around and allow consumers to have the power to take their mobile phone number with them. I think that is a big idea we should be looking at in the credit card space.


Secondly, I think we should have a discussion about what should be the maximum amount of interest payable on one sum of money. What I mean is this: if I have $1,000 worth of credit card debt then, surely, once I have paid $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 or maybe even $20,000 of interest on that one amount of money, it should be able to be written off. The idea that you can be in perpetual debt for the rest of your life because of one sum of money, regardless of how many times you have paid it off, is one that needs to change.


Thirdly, I think we need to be looking at putting some kind of floor on minimum repayments. Take credit card debt, and the minimum repayments that are structured over 33 years—or whatever figure the bank chooses. The ASIC requirement is simply that the bank itself is able to determine whether or not you have the capacity to pay. What worries me is where you have such fluid rules and the bank is able to make these decisions. Let us not kid ourselves: the perfect credit card customer is somebody who is too indebted to pay off the principal but so responsible that they are always going to be paying off the interest; that is the perfect credit card customer. And I think there needs to be some more rules. You should have to demonstrate a capacity to pay it back in three or five years—and that is what the British model has moved towards—before they actually lend you that money.


Fourthly—and, again, I am trying to look for some very practical things that we can look at doing—I actually think we need to be freeing up this market more. In some areas it has been overregulated, and I think we have to look at opportunities for new and different types of innovative lending. Things like the peer-to-peer models are exciting, and I think we actually have too much regulation in this space, on the evidence that I have seen to date—too much regulation to allow these new kinds of innovative lending platforms to be able to grow.


Finally, I think we do have to look at how advertising takes place, and what different types of advertising are to be allowed in this credit card space. So I think we need to be looking at practical, reasonable reforms in this area that will shake up the industry.


As to the specifics of the bill at hand—the specifics of what we are talking about here, which is a bill relating to unclaimed money—I think they demonstrate just the enormous amount of reforms that have to take place. And let us be clear: these are not simple reforms; they do have consequences. What is a reasonable proposal to stop situations by allowing a bit more flexibility in terms of the time period for claiming money does have other consequences. It has budget consequences.


We are also looking at things such as credit card reform, and that comes with consequences too. I want to put on the record what is perhaps one of the most legitimate concerns people have about enacting bold credit card reform, and that is that there is a danger of driving people out of the credit card market and into the payday lending, Cash Converters type of market. One of the things we have to be very careful of when we are looking at these kinds of reforms and changes is that we are not driving and pushing people into what I would deem as more dangerous, riskier types of products.


Massive reform is needed. Big changes need to take place. The statistics here are really borne out when you realise that the amount of non-performing loans in the credit card space is actually fairly small. When you consider that you are dealing with unsecured credit, you are only talking about two to 2½ per cent of credit card debt that is not repaid and not able to be reclaimed. So we are not talking about a huge amount of money, but nonetheless you still have that situation where the rates are going up.


We need to look at reforms in this sector as a whole that allow a lot more movement and a lot more flexibility. It is a true statistic that in Australia you are more likely to leave your spouse than you are to change your bank. I think a little bit more flexibility in that space, a little bit more movement and a little bit more opportunity to have people be able to change from one institution to another will lead to better banking outcomes. Perhaps in other circumstances it has not led to better outcomes, but I think in the banking space it certainly can!


In looking at this Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 the point I am trying to stress today to this chamber is that we cannot look at it in isolation. We cannot have the government say that this one piece of banking reform—and it is a fairly minor piece—is a big deal and a big priority when there are so many other spaces that can be looked at and need to be looked at. I have touched on the credit card space already, but I think that of banking as a whole we really need to be asking ourselves, 'How do we create a more competitive environment? How do we create an environment where there are better options out there for consumers?'


One of the things that worries me is that in the last round of estimates we had a discussion with the head of the ACCC, who was coming before us to give evidence, about the issue of competition within the banking sector. He made the quite honest, certainly accurate and, for me, perhaps a little bit startling revelation that price gouging is permitted and allowed, and what we have is perhaps a lot of price gouging. That does not mean that it is anti-competitive. What it does mean, as I see it, is that we need to be changing the rules to create more competition and to create more of that kind of competitive tension. We have $50 billion of credit card debt, $33 billion of it is accruing interest and consumers out there are suffering. I think people forget that there are real people out there who have found themselves caught in these types of debt traps and situations where they cannot get out. What worries me is that in so many instances credit card debt is behaving like a new form of payday lending. It is behaving as a type of money that people go to when they get desperate, when they have no other options and when there is no other place to go. As a result, they find themselves caught in these traps. Once you are in these traps, getting out of them is so, so difficult.


There are reforms that can take place. There are reforms that should take place. There are reforms that I think can be achieved in a very, very bipartisan way. I want to acknowledge some of the language from the Treasurer in this space because I think it has been the right language and quite strong. This process really began at around the time of the last round of estimates when the representatives and in some cases the heads of four different regulatory agencies—Treasury, the ACCC, ASIC and APRA—came to estimates and said that they could not explain why credit card rates are so high. They could not explain why it is so sticky. They could not explain why this gap between the cash rate and the interest being charged has come to the level that it has.


In response to that, the Treasurer set up a process where, as I understand it, he formally referred some of these matters to be looked at by the Council of Financial Regulators. I think that is a step in the right direction. I think the Treasurer should be congratulated for doing that. I also think that the work the committee is doing in this space is quite strong and will be able to assist with that. Part of the problem and part of the challenge from a regulatory framework is that you have four different agencies all responsible for different parts. ASIC is responsible for the consumers. APRA is responsible for the overall banking industry. Treasury is responsible for policy. The Reserve Bank is responsible for payments.


With the brief period of time that I have remaining I want to touch on the process that is being undertaken by the RBA at the moment. The Reserve Bank's Payments System Board, frankly, in my opinion, needs to be opened up, it needs to be more transparent and it needs to be giving the rest of us a lot more information about how they behave and what they do. When you have the other board of the Reserve Bank—the board that sets interest rates—coming out with minutes and detailed decisions and then you have the Payments Systems Board, the second board of the Reserve Bank, operating in a much more secretive environment that concerns me.


I have said this before and I will say this again: I know that there is a process going on regarding payments to the Reserve Bank. They are taking a longer process then we are taking through our Senate inquiry. I think it would be appropriate if they held off on making their recommendations to allow this public debate, especially on complicated issues such as interchange fees, to happen and to take on board the views of the Senate and the parliament through our committee process before they come to their decisions. I think that would be a sensible and appropriate way of having the parliamentary process feed into the processes that are being taken by them.


There is a big issue of credit cards out there. Today we are talking about a side issue, an amendment of the banking laws. There are some good parts to the legislation and there are consequences to this legislation. The point I want to stress is that this is not something that we can or should do in isolation. When we are talking about banking reform, we are talking about the big bits of banking reform and the big changes that need to take place. I really want to stress that one of the big changes that we can and should make is in the area of credit cards. Too many people are suffering, and there has been too much pain. Frankly, we have a banking sector that in the credit card space has not had the type of scrutiny and the type of competition it should have had. The reforms are simple, but there is no right-left solution to this. The solution is not simply more regulation or no regulation. In some areas I think that removing regulation is going to create a more competitive banking environment, and in other areas we should be looking at legislative changes. To quote the great Tony Blair: 'What matters is what works.' We have to be able to look at a package of reforms and a package of ideas that are going to work. We know what works when consumers get the best outcome. Currently, consumers are not getting the outcomes they need.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (19:08):  I rise also to speak in support of the bill before this chamber and I note the important intent behind this bill, which is, quite simply, the protection of consumers. We need always to be looking at the interaction between consumers, the financial products that are on the market and the financial institutions which of those products. 


In government we looked carefully at the costs that were accruing to consumers from inactive accounts—from those accounts which were sitting idle, accruing fees and seeing balances whittled away. The government has reviewed this and has come to the view that it would be preferable, on balance, to link the period before account transfer is triggered to seven years. Labor supports that proposal. The Australian Bankers Association has indicated that this would reduce the administration costs, the marketing costs and their complaints handling costs. Where we can get a good outcome for the industry and a good outcome for consumers, Labor is happy to support sensible proposals for reform.


As my colleague, Senator Dastyari, has pointed out, it is important to think carefully about the broader context in which consumers interact with the finance system. One of the observations I would make from my brief period on the Economics Committee is that it has become very clear to me that finance products are different from many other products which consumers might consider. By their nature, they are significantly more complex and, in particular, they are products which operate over time. For that reason consumers often find themselves experiencing significant difficulties in evaluating what benefits a particular product might confer upon them when compared to other products and what the best product for them and their family might be. There is, of course, a school of thought that says, 'Well, buyer, beware. It is up to consumers to make their own decisions.' We live in a society where consumers' ability to allocate the resources to the products and services that they desire is the foundation for efficient resource allocation and the best outcomes for society. That analysis is one that is broadly supported by both sides of this chamber, but we need to recognise that humans find in many cases difficulties and challenges. 


We know more and more about human psychology and the challenges that individual consumers might have in making certain kinds of decisions. One of the things that has been drawn to our attention repeatedly in recent weeks on the Economics Committee is the significance of behavioural economics in explaining some of the odd things we start to see in financial markets, particularly when we are looking at retail products for ordinary households and for mum and dad consumers. Senator Dastyari spoke briefly about the credit card situation and the way that insights from behavioural economics manifest themselves in what has been described by a number of stakeholders as a failure of competition in that market. It is puzzling because a rational consumer would observe that they are currently paying very high rates on a particular credit card and that rational consumer might perhaps seek out alternative products which offer a better return on their investment and a better outcome for their family. But, for a range of reasons, that does not seem to happen in this particular market. Behavioural economics offers some explanations about why some consumers might not make good decisions in those circumstances. 


Behavioural economics speaks to us about optimism bias—the idea in this case that, when people are evaluating products and rates, they do not consider rates carefully because they imagine themselves to be the kind of person who always pays their credit card debts off on time and thus will be the kind of person who never pays interest on any of their borrowings. But, of course, that optimism is misplaced. Many of the people who believe that to be so about themselves, who want to believe the best about themselves, in fact find that that optimism is misplaced; they do not pay off all of their debt each month and they do find themselves paying interest rates, sometimes very high interest rates. 


It is related to another characteristic which is, of course, imperfect self-control. We know why people spend very large amounts of money on advertising, not just in the finance sector but in the retail sector more generally, and that is because it works. As humans we are most susceptible to many kinds of behavioural pushes and nudges that draw us to make decisions about enhancing our immediate wellbeing, even though it may not be in our long-term interest. That imperfect self-control, of course, leads to many people who have easy access to credit living beyond their means, accruing debts—in some cases modest, in other cases catastrophically large—which they are not able to pay off in the period required to avoid interest repayments. Again, people who find themselves in this situation will not be maximising the benefits for their family, despite the fact that they believe themselves to be making best efforts to do so.


There is another category of human failing that influences these markets also, and that is quite simply the transaction costs associated with acquiring information necessary to make good decisions. In the finance sector, where the information and the products themselves are already confusing—not least because they operate over time—the ability to acquire information that is useful to you as a consumer to make good decisions is sometimes dependent on an investment of a very large period of time and intellectual energy. To be honest, I know that in my family there is quite a lot going on. There are kids, there are bills, there is work, there is social life and, of course, for all of us in this chamber there are the political organisations that we belong to and the organisations in the community that we seek to support. In that context, spending the time to seek out information about the range of products that might be on the market, comparing them and making an evaluation about the extent to which they are suitable for you or your family, is an investment of time that many people find difficult to make. 


One of the recommendations that we are seeing coming through very strongly from the Senate inquiry process is about the simplification of the information available to consumers when they are choosing products and making sure that comparing apples with apples is something that is simple to do, and making sure that people's eyes are drawn to the right thing when they are choosing a financial product, the thing that is most in their interest as consumers. What we do know from survey information is that, when people are making decisions about what products to choose, they are often focusing on entirely the wrong thing. They are looking at how it is going to go in terms of rewards points; they are considering whether or not it is a product that is sitting with their existing financial institution. They are, in most instances, not looking at the rate of interest payable and they are certainly not looking at the fine print about the penalty interest rates that might apply should they find themselves in financial difficulty. One of the things that we see in terms of recommendations are about greater information and better information to be made available to consumers by the providers of retail products.


Senator Dastyari spoke about the human costs of the failures of competition in this sector and the market failures which are delivering suboptimal outcomes for society. Some of the evidence that we have heard in the credit card inquiry, in the managed investment products inquiry, have been shocking indeed. I will admit that I have been close to tears hearing stories from some individuals whose lives have been comprehensively turned upside down by interactions with institutions and financial advisers who have served them poorly and served the interests of them and their families very poorly.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (18:05):  I rise to continue remarks that were interrupted by question time earlier today. To recap in simple terms, a few years ago the then Labor government made a decision to take money away from people, and the bill before the chamber today, the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015, returns that money to people and returns us to the default position where people can expect that they will not have money taken from their bank account before it is inactive for a period of seven years. As I indicated in my earlier remarks, that had been the record and the policy of the Commonwealth government from 1911 through to 2012. Over that period, it was always the case that you had seven years before unclaimed moneys would be claimed by the government. A couple of years ago, the then Labor government, in a desperate and ultimately futile attempt to reach a budget target, decided to reach into the piggy banks of every Australian household and take that money off them earlier, changing that policy of 101 years. This bill helps change that back.


It was a policy for 101 years, almost the entire period of the Commonwealth government, a time in which we had the two world wars, the Great Depression, the Cold War and two Olympic Games in Australia. It was a consistent policy over that entire time frame. But then, suddenly, the world's greatest Treasurer, and the world's greatest finance minister, said a few years ago: 'It may have been be policy for more than 100 years, but I think it is wrong and we should take that money back from people after three years not seven years.' Unfortunately, the world's greatest Treasurer got that wrong two years ago and the government has now got it right in returning our position back to the default position, which is that people can expect to have their money in the bank for at least seven years before it is deemed to be unclaimed money and taken by the government.


The scope of the change was quite significant. It was not simply an administrative change of going from seven to three years; there was a substantial amount of money put at risk with this change. In 2013, the year after that the decision was made, $550 million in unclaimed moneys was taken by the federal government. That was the year after Mr Swan, as Treasurer, changed the law that had existed for 101 years. In 2012, the year before that change, there was only $70 million in unclaimed moneys. So it went from $70 million a year to $550 million a year. You can see why the Labor Party saw this as a juicy target. They were struggling to keep any kind of control over the budget and to keep consistency in the promises they were making to people to balance the budget at the time. So they saw half a billion dollars sitting in bank accounts, which people expected was their money, and they took that money. That is literally what they did. They took $500 million that was additional to what would normally be claimed—or, to be precise, $480 million—and transferred it to the government to help build their budget bottom line. What kind of government does that overnight? Even if you thought seven years was too long and it should be three, four, or five, you would think you would take a little longer, not just make that change overnight, within a year, and suddenly go from taking a $70 million a year in unclaimed moneys to $550 million. But it was certainly not out of step with the aptitude and approach of the Rudd-Gillard government. Unfortunately, this government has had to spend a lot of time fixing up the mistakes and missteps of the former government—and this is another one that is being fixed.


This bill will reverse the policy of taking people's money after three years and go back to seven years. As I said before, the Labor Party were caught red handed in this wild spending spree smashing the piggy banks of people all around the country. They were caught red handed and they have now fessed up to it. My understanding is that they are going to support this bill. That is great, and I compliment them for that. But the best thing to do when you realise have done something wrong—and I have certainly done many wrong things in my life—is to admit it and make amends for it. And it is good to see that the Labor Party are finally making amends for this.


But I suppose there is some silver lining as well to what happened a few years ago. Perhaps it is a case of 'no bad deed going unrewarded', because this bill now makes improvements, I believe, in regard to the policies on unclaimed moneys. As I said, it has been consistent for a long time to claim those moneys after a seven-year period. But this bill would extend some exemptions to certain accounts such that the moneys in those accounts will not be claimed by the government even after seven years. I think that is a positive development. For example, funds in children's accounts will be exempt from this legislation. Of course, many Australians seek to put savings into a child's account for their future and put it in their trust. Sometimes, activities in those counts may be understandably low, because they might not receive any additional funds or, indeed, have any activity for a period of seven years or more. Notwithstanding that, the parents or guardians would still expect that money to be available for the child once they turn 18 or become responsible for their own financial affairs. In recognition of that fact, the government has made a decision not to punish parents or other Australians who have not realised that there is that seven-year period. So children's accounts will be exempted in this bill, and I think that is a very positive change.


Similarly, bank accounts denominated in foreign currency will also be exempted. This is to reflect the fact that foreign currency accounts are usually used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex international business transactions. There are only a small number of these accounts in the country. In the government's view, it would be an unnecessary and unreasonable impost of red tape to expose those accounts to this particular legislative framework, so they will be exempted as well.


There are a number of other changes that will also improve the operation of this legislation. The government has made a decision to no longer publish ASIC's Unclaimed Money gazettes. While there have been some concerns that this may make it harder for people to reclaim their unclaimed moneys, ASIC already provides MoneySmart, an online resource for reuniting account holders with their accounts. Anyone listening who feels they may have unclaimed money can go to www.moneysmart.gov.au to try and find it. This particular change, in conjunction with stricter controls on access to information about unclaimed moneys, will help to protect Australians with unclaimed accounts from exploitation. In my view, that is another positive change in this piece of legislation. This bill implements a number of privacy protections and secrecy provisions to limit the access to this information to those people who truly need it.


At the moment, a freedom of information request to ASIC can result in the personal information of Australians with unclaimed accounts being published. That information can include the account holder's name, their last known address and the amount of money unclaimed. The Australian Information Commissioner has raised concerns that this level of information could enable identity theft. Apparently, there are reports that some unscrupulous businesses are using such information to charge fees as high as 25 per cent to reunite people with their own money. The government believes that behaviour should not be accepted, or at least should not be encouraged and supported, through the provision of information to people who do not own the account. This bill will ensure that future FOI requests in regards to unclaimed moneys will only reveal details to the individual whose account it is. To receive these details through an FOI request in the future, the actual individual who owns the account would have had to have made that request. That change will help ensure that people's private details do, indeed, remain private.


The government will also ensure that it is easier to keep accounts active by making it easier for people to demonstrate or qualify for an active account so that their account is not unclaimed. All they will need to do in the future is check their account online or over the phone for an account balance. That simple check will trigger the account to remain active and it would not be subject to unclaimed moneys legislation.


Taken in combination, these changes will I believe make the framework that has existed for over a century stronger. They will make it more responsive to the particular uses that Australian consumers make of their bank accounts, particularly by exempting children's savings accounts. While it is unfortunate that the former Labor government decided to change the more-than-a-century-old framework in this field, I believe that, when this bill passes, we will have a stronger unclaimed moneys framework, and one that is more responsive to consumers' needs.


It is also the case that the changes will help reduce regulatory burden on the sector. Having to claim money within a three-year time limit rather than a seven-year time limit may raise more money for the government, but it does impose a burden on the financial sector. Going back to the previous regime will help remove that burden. It is estimated that that will save the wider economy $36 million a year. Of course, that includes not just the burden placed on banks and life insurers who have to transfer this money to the government but also the burden placed on Australians themselves who will less frequently have to check and try to track down the moneys that may be unclaimed.


That saving of red tape and the reduction of the regulatory burden is a core commitment and a core value of this government. We should be a government that seeks to walk softly for business. We have a need for regulation in many areas, and this, indeed, is an example of where there is a need for some form of regulation. But we should seek to minimise its impost on businesses, particularly small businesses, and, of course, we should seek to ensure that regulation does not unduly restrict the development of our economy, the creation of jobs and the creation of a more wealthy and prosperous community. This is just one small element of the government's regulatory reduction agenda. We have made it easier for large projects to be approved in this country. Indeed, there has been more than $700 million worth of projects approved since this government came to power. We have reduced regulation of the farm sector, particularly around the approval of chemicals and pesticides, which was becoming increasingly burdensome for that sector. Added up, these changes make a big difference.


The government is also now progressing further reforms to make it easier to get projects like the Adani coalmine in Central Queensland, near where I live, across the line. This project has the potential to deliver 10,000 jobs to Central Queensland, which is half the size of the NBN, in terms of value, just in Central Queensland. It is something that we need to do. We should have done it years ago. It has taken us five years to say yes or no. We need to reduce that regulatory burden to make it easier for people to invest in our country.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (18:20):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015. This is a very important bill for the savers and the taxpayers of Australia. Under the previous Labor government, over $550 million was raided from 156,000 accounts after Bill Shorten, the then responsible minister, reduced this inactive period for bank accounts from seven years to three years. Effectively, it was the greatest period of bank robbery since Ned Kelly was fandangling around the Victorian bush. This is a good bill because it is on the side of Australian taxpayers and Australian savers. No government should be taking the savings of Australians after such a small period as three years. Returning it to seven years is, I think, an appropriate balance for the taxpayers and savers of Australia.


In May 2014, the government released a discussion paper on potential changes to the unclaimed moneys regime. It requested comments in relation to three particular options. The first option was retaining the status quo of three years that had been brought in by Labor—and that huge cash grab of half a billion dollars in one year alone that I mentioned before. The second option was increasing the period of inactivity to five years. The third option was to return it to a period of seven years. This particular discussion paper also included comments and discussion on related issues, including whether foreign currency accounts should be captured and balancing the privacy requirements with the requirement to publish information on unclaimed moneys and other administrative matters.


In November 2014 the financial system inquiry discussed unclaimed moneys in an appendix to its final report. That report stated:


At present, bank accounts and life insurance policies are deemed to be unclaimed monies and transferred to Government if they are inactive for three years. The present position was changed in 2012, from a longstanding arrangement that required an inactive period of seven years.


The Australian Bankers’ Association estimates that reverting to seven years would halve the number of claims. The Inquiry believes Government should act to ensure bank accounts and life insurance policies are deemed unclaimed after seven years of inactivity and that these monies should be held in a separate trust account.


The final report recommended that the government should define bank accounts and life insurance policies as unclaimed moneys if they are inactive for seven years. So, in the 2015-16 budget the government announced that effective from 31 December 2015 it would make a number of changes to the unclaimed moneys provisions in the Banking Act 1959 and the Life Insurance Act. The Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 will amend the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to specify that funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies cannot be deemed to be unclaimed and therefore transferred to the Commonwealth until they have been inactive for a period of seven years.


The bill will also introduce secrecy provisions into the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to ensure that even under a freedom of information request the particulars of the amount of unclaimed money or the person to whom the money is payable cannot be released to anyone other than the account holder or an agent acting on their behalf. This bill also amends the Banking Act to exempt funds held in foreign currency from the unclaimed money provisions; to exempt funds held by or on behalf of an individual under the age of 18 from unclaimed moneys provisions; to ensure that if an account holder or their agent notifies their financial institution that they would like their account to remain active at any time prior to its transfer to the Commonwealth that this account does not have to be transferred; and to remove the requirement to publish an unclaimed moneys gazette while still ensuring that the Treasurer can make the details of those with unclaimed accounts publicly available in such a manner as the Treasurer determines.


Even though the matter is quite simple in terms of what the government is trying to achieve here—that is, returning the period of inactivity from three years to seven years before the government can get their grubby fingers on the money and the savings of Australian taxpayers—it is actually quite a complex matter. I think it is worthwhile going into some detail of the terms of particular provisions of what the government is attempting to achieve. This bill makes amendments to the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to give effect to the unclaimed moneys measures announced in this year's budget. The bill extends from three years to seven years the period of inactivity required before funds from what are called authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs—I do not want to get caught up in the big words—and life insurance provider accounts and life insurance amounts can be transferred to the Commonwealth. As such, accounts held by ADIs and life insurance providers will have to be inactive for a period of seven years before they are deemed to be unclaimed moneys and transferred to the Commonwealth. The bill exempts ADI accounts created for children and those that are held in a foreign currency from the unclaimed moneys provisions. It will also stop ADI accounts from being transferred to the Commonwealth where the account holder provides notification that the account should be treated as active after the account is assessed as unclaimed money at the end of the calendar year but before it is transferred to the Commonwealth.


The bill also promotes and protects the privacy of individuals who have accounts with unclaimed moneys by removing the requirement for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC, to publish details of unclaimed moneys in the annual unclaimed moneys gazette, introducing a secrecy provision to prevent access to information on unclaimed moneys via the Freedom of Information Act and making consequential amendments to the FOI Act to restrict access to information about unclaimed moneys under freedom of information requests. Chapter 1 of the bill, which is an amendment to the Banking Act 1959, will amend the Banking Act to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by ADIs. Currently ADIs are required to assess all accounts to determine whether they consist of unclaimed moneys by 31 December each year and transfer any that do to the Commonwealth by 31 March the following year. An account held by an ADI consists of unclaimed moneys if, in the previous three years, there have been no transactions in the account other than interest or charges and the account holder has not satisfied the notification requirements by, for example, checking their account balance online or on the phone or specifically advising their bank that they would like the account to remain active.


Evidence suggests that many of the accounts that are declared unclaimed and transferred to the Commonwealth are effectively active, as the account holder remains aware of them. For example, around 15 per cent of unclaimed funds transferred from ADIs are reclaimed in the same year that they are transferred to the Commonwealth. Approximately 50 per cent of all funds transferred to the Commonwealth as unclaimed moneys are reclaimed within two years. The proportion of effectively active accounts that are transferred to the Commonwealth each year under the current provisions—that is, the three-year period for inactive accounts—increases the regulatory burden of the unclaimed moneys provisions for ADIs but also, and I think more importantly, for account holders—that is, the taxpayers and the savers of Australia who have put the money away for a rainy day but wake up one day to find that someone, 'Big Brother' or 'Big Sister' down in Canberra, has swiped their account. ADIs have to assess and transfer all accounts with unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth even though many of the accounts are still effectively active. Once these accounts have been transferred, account holders have to complete the necessary paperwork and verify their details in order to reclaim their accounts.


To minimise the number of effectively active accounts that are transferred to the Commonwealth, regulation 20A of the Banking Regulations enables account holders to notify their ADI that an account should be treated as active. If notification is provided prior to 31 December—that is, when ADIs have to assess accounts as unclaimed moneys—then the account does not have to be transferred to the Commonwealth. If, however, the account holder provides notification after the account is assessed as unclaimed money on 31 December but before the ADI transfers the sum of money to the Commonwealth, then the amount must still be transferred. This is inconsistent with the treatment of accounts where the account holder satisfies the activity requirements, such as completing a transaction, after the account has been deemed to be unclaimed but before the funds are transferred to the Commonwealth, as these accounts do not have to be transferred to the Commonwealth.


The unclaimed money provisions currently apply to foreign currency accounts and children's accounts. The application of the unclaimed money provisions to these accounts does not align with how they are used by the community. Foreign currency accounts are generally used by consumers who are a little bit more sophisticated in relation to the settlement of their business transactions in relation to foreign currencies. Transferring these accounts to the Commonwealth under the unclaimed money provisions requires the account to be converted into Australian dollars, potentially exposing the account holder to exchange rate fluctuations. Given this risk and the fact that these accounts are used by such sophisticated consumers who are likely to know of these accounts, it is not appropriate to transfer them to the Commonwealth under the provisions. Likewise, children's accounts are generally established for long periods so that the money can be set aside in a high-interest account for a child to access on, for example, their 18th birthday. Transferring these accounts to the Commonwealth may result in some children losing out on higher interest rates because accounts transferred to the Commonwealth will only accrue interest at the rate of the consumer price index. 


Details of unclaimed moneys held by the Commonwealth must be published annually in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's unclaimed money gazette. Information on unclaimed moneys is also released under the Freedom of Information Act and is published on the ASIC website. Details of unclaimed moneys are also searchable online via the ASIC MoneySmart website. The level of information available has created the opportunity for groups to approach account holders offering to reunite them with their account for a fee. Account holders can reclaim their money from the government at no charge. The level of information could also potentially be used for identity theft.


The new law amends the Banking Act to extend the unclaimed moneys period from three years to seven years. The new law also provides that ADI accounts created for children and those with foreign currency accounts are exempt from the unclaimed moneys provisions. The new law stops ADI accounts being transferred to the Commonwealth where the account holder provides notification that the account should be treated as active after the account is assessed as unclaimed moneys at the end of the calendar year but before it is transferred to the Commonwealth. The new law amends the Banking Act to remove the requirements for ASIC to publish details of unclaimed moneys in the unclaimed money gazette and introduces a secrecy provision to prevent access to information on unclaimed moneys via the FOI Act. The Treasurer will retain the ability to publish information on unclaimed moneys, such as on the ASIC's MoneySmart website.


Chapter 2 of the bill will provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by life insurance providers. Currently life insurance providers are required to assess all accounts to determine if they consist of unclaimed moneys by 31 December each year and, similar to those with ADIs, transfer any such funds to the Commonwealth by 31 March of the following year. An account held by a life insurance provider consists of unclaimed moneys if there have been no transactions in the account other than interest or charges in the previous three years. Many of the accounts that are transferred to the Commonwealth are still effectively active, as the account holder, similar to those with ADIs, remains aware of them. Around nine per cent of life insurance accounts are reclaimed in the same year as they were transferred to the Commonwealth, and 50 per cent of all funds transferred are reclaimed within two years. 


The high proportion of effectively active accounts that are transferred to and reclaimed from the Commonwealth creates a regulatory burden for life insurance providers and account holders. Life insurance providers have to assess and transfer all accounts with unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth even though the accounts may still be effectively active. Once these accounts are transferred, account holders have to complete the necessary paperwork and verify their details in order to reclaim their accounts. Information on any unclaimed moneys is released under the Freedom of Information Act and is published on the ASIC website. Details of unclaimed money are also available to search online via the ASIC MoneySmart website. This level of information that has been available has created the opportunity for groups to approach account holders offering to reunite them with their account for a fee, similar to those under ADIs. But account holders can reclaim their money from the government at no charge. The level of information could also potentially be used for identity theft. In summary, this new law amends the Life Insurance Act to introduce new secrecy provisions and to extend the unclaimed moneys provision from three years to seven years from 31 December 2015. 


We should consider how this has come about. It was an act of the previous Labor government, back in 2012, to reduce the period for unclaimed moneys to be transferred to the Commonwealth from seven years to three years. In 2012-13, the federal government was able to pilfer from Australian taxpayers and Australian savers a sum of over half a billion dollars.


When the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity before funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies could be transferred, the value of unclaimed money transferred to ASIC grew more than eightfold in a single year. Much of this money, however, was not truly unclaimed and the previous government's changes left many Australian families in a position of financial distress. It also imposed a large red-tape cost on industry which, first, had to transfer accounts to and then reclaim them from ASIC on behalf of their customers, often in the same year. This situation must not continue. It had a particular impact on the savings accounts of elderly Australians who had worked for decades to put money away for a rainy day or put money away for their children and grandchildren. They suddenly woke up one day and found that the people in Canberra had got their grubby fingers all over their savings. It is a shameful period in how we look after people who work to save money for the greater benefit of Australia.


In order to protect these account holders and industry, this bill returns the required period of inactivity before funds can be transferred from bank accounts or life insurance policies to seven years—that is, once they are truly unclaimed. A seven-year period had been in existence for a considerable amount of time. People knew that they had seven years. Reducing it—

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator McGrath, address the chair.




Senator McGRATH:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think this is a very good bill because it returns the savings of Australians to them and returns the period of inactivity of bank accounts before they can be taken from three years to seven years. The government of Australia should be helping people save money, not taking it from their bank accounts like some nefarious Ned Kelly.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (18:40):  It is a pleasure and a privilege to follow Senator McGrath in this debate—a great senator from the great state of Queensland. In my remarks I want to do a number of things. I want to talk a bit about an aspect of history relating to the Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015. It goes back to the period when I was Assistant Treasurer. I went on a radio program—I think it was on 2GB—and was being interviewed by Jason Morrison. I went on to talk about some legislative issues current at the time, but he immediately got into me on the issue of unclaimed moneys and the fact that in 2012 the former government had reduced the period before funds could be transferred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission from seven years to three years, which had resulted in a large number of effectively active accounts being transferred to ASIC, and that left many Australians financially stressed. I was quite surprised at the strength of his feeling on this subject. It registered with me. It was also raised in the coalition party room and the Treasurer, Joe Hockey, undertook to examine the matter. This bill is the fruit of that consideration. I commend the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, for following through with this particular bill.


When you have worked in government over a long period, as I have, you come across a lot of savings options. I suppose you could get to the point where you sometimes think that one savings option is as good as another, but you must never underestimate the public reaction to these things. There is no doubt that this particular measure struck a chord with a lot of people, and that of course was then reflected in the comments of media commentators, such as Jason Morrison and others. So, in one sense, you could say that this is the Jason Morrison bill. I am sure he will be chuffed that I say that about him. I do not think he is working in media any longer, but that shows the influence that people can have in setting some of these agendas, and I recognise his contribution on this particular bill.


This bill does a number of things. It implements a decision in the 2015-16 budget that, effective from 31 December this year, there would be a number of changes to the unclaimed moneys provisions in the Banking Act 1959 and the Life Insurance Act 1995. The bill amends the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to specify that funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies cannot be deemed to be unclaimed and therefore be transferred to the Commonwealth until they have been inactive for at least seven years. The bill will also introduce secrecy provisions into the Banking Act and the Life Insurance Act to ensure that, even under a freedom of information request, the particulars of the amount of unclaimed money or the person to whom the money is payable cannot be released to anyone other than the account holder or an agent acting on their behalf.


The bill also amends the Banking Act to exempt funds held in a foreign currency from the unclaimed moneys provisions. It exempts funds held by or on behalf of an individual under the age of 18 from the unclaimed moneys provisions. It ensures that, if an account holder or their agent notifies an approved deposit-taking institution, or ADI, any time prior to the funds being transferred to the Commonwealth that they would like their account to remain active, the account does not have to be transferred. It removes the requirement to publish an unclaimed moneys gazette while still ensuring that the Treasurer can make the details of those unclaimed accounts publicly available in such a manner as the Treasurer determines.


The unclaimed moneys provisions exist to protect Australians' forgotten savings and life insurance policies from being eroded by fees and charges over time. So the public policy intent behind the original measures is fair enough and sensible. After an account has been inactive for seven years, the funds in that account will be transferred to the government, where they will grow at the rate of the consumer price index, tax-free. No matter what, these funds continue to belong to their rightful owner and can be reclaimed at any time through contact with either ASIC or their financial institution. There is no fee charged for this service.


As I alluded to earlier, Australia has had provisions to effect the transfer of unclaimed funds to the government since at least the introduction of the Commonwealth Bank Act in 1911. Between 1911 and 2012 accounts must have been inactive for at least seven years before accounts could be transferred. In late 2012 the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity to three years. This resulted in half a billion dollars from thousands of accounts—that in many cases their owners were aware of—being transferred to the Commonwealth. This placed many Australians in a position of financial distress. Returning the required period of inactivity to seven years is expected to reduce the number of accounts transferred to the government each year by up to 50 per cent and reduce the regulatory burden on the community by $36 million each year. As I noted earlier, the changes are due to take effect from 31 December 2015. This means that no funds should be assessed as unclaimed until at least 2019 and no unclaimed funds should be transferred to the government until at least 2020. 


There are, as I mentioned earlier, a number of exemptions. For example, many Australians set money aside for their children's future and trust that this money will continue to grow in value and be available for the children when, say, they turn 18. In recognition of this fact and to reward, not punish, those Australians working hard to contribute to their family's future, funds from children's accounts will never be transferred to the government. This is sensible. People putting the money away—normally the parents or perhaps the grandparents—clearly have a stake or an interest in those funds being properly invested and growing in value over time and therefore they are likely to keep an eye on those accounts. It is not a matter in such cases, I believe, of people potentially forgetting that those accounts exist. So this is a sensible provision for exemption.


Why is the government exempting foreign currency accounts from the unclaimed moneys provisions? Again, this is a sensible change. Accounts in a foreign currency are primarily used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex international transactions. Not only does transferring these accounts to the government potentially disrupt these processes; it also exposes the account holder to a loss, as their funds must be converted to Australian dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. So, as I said before, this was initially a budget savings measure, but we have to have equity and equity involves taking due account of the needs of the community, and the community have spoken loudly on this measure.


Finally, may I say that the red tape agenda is served by this bill as well, with a regulatory saving of $36 million per year. The federal government has shown its commitment to its deregulation agenda by the fact that it is prepared to incur a fiscal cost to reduce the fiscal balance by $158 million over four years from 2015-16 to implement this commitment. That shows genuine commitment to the regulatory process. On that basis, I complete my remarks.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (18:48):  While I think that a lot of this bill is worthy and warrants the discussion of the Senate and that parts of this measure are a step in the right direction, it worries me that this type of banking reform is a priority for the government when so much of the banking reform that needs to happen in this country is not being undertaken. To start my remarks, I want to briefly touch on the issue at hand, which is how a government can best deal with unclaimed moneys. 


The Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 largely reverses the measure introduced by the previous Labor government in 2012, and this is really about extending the period in which people can claim unclaimed moneys. There has been an extensive process of consultation and discussion. The government has said that this is somewhat of a priority and it has used this opportunity to bring this bill forward. Let us not kid ourselves: this has a considerable direct cost to the budget of $285 million over the next four years, from 2015-16.


When it comes to banking reform, my worry is that the government is choosing to undertake this kind of measure, whereas I believe that banking reform is needed in the area of credit cards, where the government has been very slow and very inactive. We now have a situation where there is $51.5 billion worth of credit card debt in this country, with 33.1 billion of that accruing interest. What does this mean? There has been a 47 per cent increase in credit card balances over the last 10 years. One and a half times the amount of credit card debt exists right now than existed a decade ago. The problem is that a select group of people are being artificially hurt by all of this, and they are the ones who are being hurt the most. According to a submission made by the Reserve Bank of Australia to a Senate inquiry into this issue, 27 per cent of people do not pay off their cards, and the number of cards itself is at the extraordinary level of 16 million. There is now more than one credit card for every person in this country who is eligible to have a card.


You could ask the question: 'There is $33 billion of credit card debt, and it's accruing interest; who's actually paying?' because you get out there and there are these fantastic products that look like they are at eight per cent or nine per cent, and credit cards that are not just the cards with the higher rates at 19 per cent to 22 per cent. Here are the facts. The people who are paying interest on credit cards are paying an average spread of 14¾ per cent, while across cards as a whole the spread is nine per cent. What do I mean by that? It is the gap between what it costs to borrow money and what it costs the bank to actually get the money. The cash rate at the moment is two per cent. The cash rate has continuously fallen over the past five years. Credit card interest rates have not fallen. And not only have they not fallen, but the people who are actually paying the interest—the people in the debt trap situation—are those on the higher rate cards. On average, they are paying 5¾ per cent higher than the average cards that are available.


You ask yourself: 'How has this industry been allowed to perform the way it is? How has this been allowed to occur?' And don't get me wrong—I think this is an issue that has grown and is actually becoming a bipartisan issue. As much as I would love to say that everything was rosy under the previous governments and that this government has failed to act—and this government has failed to act—I think that, while we took some steps in the last government, in hindsight there were more steps that we should have taken, and they are the steps we should be looking at taking now.


I just want to touch on some of these figures, just to understand how profitable an industry this is. There is $8½ billion worth of revenue generated by the credit card industry—$8½ billion—and $1.4 billion of that comes from fees. The average fee on credit cards, per card, for every person is $90. It is $90 on average you are paying in fees, either directly or indirectly. The reality is: most people are paying fees without realising they are paying fees. There is $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion that has developed through this entire process of interchange—the inter-merchant fees. And there is $5.4 billion that comes from interest.


Of course the cost of borrowing money in unsecured credit is always going to be more than the cost of lending it, and it is always going to have a reasonable mark-up. That is an understandable development. What I cannot understand, and what no-one has been able to explain to me or to our committee in our inquiry is: why is that gap now at a record level? Why is it that, in the past five years, as interest rates on loans for houses and every other thing have fallen in line with, or at least in relation to, the falling cash rate, credit card rates have remained stubbornly high? Frankly, I think it demonstrates perhaps a failure in this market.


There are those in the industry who will talk to you about just how many different products are out there. And it is half true. There are lots of different cards. There are not a lot of different products. You can get a lot of different cards with different kinds of rates and slightly different variations in what they are offering, but they are not fundamentally different products. If you want to shake up this market, you have to open the doors and allow in some fundamentally new products. I think there is a series of big ideas that need to be explored and which we are exploring through this process.


Firstly, we should be looking at the portability of credit card numbers. What does that mean? That means allowing people to take their credit card numbers with them in the same way as you can take your mobile phone number. Ten years ago we had this same problem in the mobile phone market. It used to be that you would go out there and you would buy a Vodaphone phone or an Optus phone or a Telstra phone and, when you did that, you had that number and that number was stuck with that company and you could not move it. To create more competition and to give consumers more power, one of the big reforms we did was to turn it around and allow consumers to have the power to take their mobile phone number with them. I think that is a big idea we should be looking at in the credit card space.


Secondly, I think we should have a discussion about what should be the maximum amount of interest payable on one sum of money. What I mean is this: if I have $1,000 worth of credit card debt then, surely, once I have paid $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 or maybe even $20,000 of interest on that one amount of money, it should be able to be written off. The idea that you can be in perpetual debt for the rest of your life because of one sum of money, regardless of how many times you have paid it off, is one that needs to change.


Thirdly, I think we need to be looking at putting some kind of floor on minimum repayments. Take credit card debt, and the minimum repayments that are structured over 33 years—or whatever figure the bank chooses. The ASIC requirement is simply that the bank itself is able to determine whether or not you have the capacity to pay. What worries me is where you have such fluid rules and the bank is able to make these decisions. Let us not kid ourselves: the perfect credit card customer is somebody who is too indebted to pay off the principal but so responsible that they are always going to be paying off the interest; that is the perfect credit card customer. And I think there needs to be some more rules. You should have to demonstrate a capacity to pay it back in three or five years—and that is what the British model has moved towards—before they actually lend you that money.


Fourthly—and, again, I am trying to look for some very practical things that we can look at doing—I actually think we need to be freeing up this market more. In some areas it has been overregulated, and I think we have to look at opportunities for new and different types of innovative lending. Things like the peer-to-peer models are exciting, and I think we actually have too much regulation in this space, on the evidence that I have seen to date—too much regulation to allow these new kinds of innovative lending platforms to be able to grow.


Finally, I think we do have to look at how advertising takes place, and what different types of advertising are to be allowed in this credit card space. So I think we need to be looking at practical, reasonable reforms in this area that will shake up the industry.


As to the specifics of the bill at hand—the specifics of what we are talking about here, which is a bill relating to unclaimed money—I think they demonstrate just the enormous amount of reforms that have to take place. And let us be clear: these are not simple reforms; they do have consequences. What is a reasonable proposal to stop situations by allowing a bit more flexibility in terms of the time period for claiming money does have other consequences. It has budget consequences.


We are also looking at things such as credit card reform, and that comes with consequences too. I want to put on the record what is perhaps one of the most legitimate concerns people have about enacting bold credit card reform, and that is that there is a danger of driving people out of the credit card market and into the payday lending, Cash Converters type of market. One of the things we have to be very careful of when we are looking at these kinds of reforms and changes is that we are not driving and pushing people into what I would deem as more dangerous, riskier types of products.


Massive reform is needed. Big changes need to take place. The statistics here are really borne out when you realise that the amount of non-performing loans in the credit card space is actually fairly small. When you consider that you are dealing with unsecured credit, you are only talking about two to 2½ per cent of credit card debt that is not repaid and not able to be reclaimed. So we are not talking about a huge amount of money, but nonetheless you still have that situation where the rates are going up.


We need to look at reforms in this sector as a whole that allow a lot more movement and a lot more flexibility. It is a true statistic that in Australia you are more likely to leave your spouse than you are to change your bank. I think a little bit more flexibility in that space, a little bit more movement and a little bit more opportunity to have people be able to change from one institution to another will lead to better banking outcomes. Perhaps in other circumstances it has not led to better outcomes, but I think in the banking space it certainly can!


In looking at this Banking Laws Amendment (Unclaimed Money) Bill 2015 the point I am trying to stress today to this chamber is that we cannot look at it in isolation. We cannot have the government say that this one piece of banking reform—and it is a fairly minor piece—is a big deal and a big priority when there are so many other spaces that can be looked at and need to be looked at. I have touched on the credit card space already, but I think that of banking as a whole we really need to be asking ourselves, 'How do we create a more competitive environment? How do we create an environment where there are better options out there for consumers?'


One of the things that worries me is that in the last round of estimates we had a discussion with the head of the ACCC, who was coming before us to give evidence, about the issue of competition within the banking sector. He made the quite honest, certainly accurate and, for me, perhaps a little bit startling revelation that price gouging is permitted and allowed, and what we have is perhaps a lot of price gouging. That does not mean that it is anti-competitive. What it does mean, as I see it, is that we need to be changing the rules to create more competition and to create more of that kind of competitive tension. We have $50 billion of credit card debt, $33 billion of it is accruing interest and consumers out there are suffering. I think people forget that there are real people out there who have found themselves caught in these types of debt traps and situations where they cannot get out. What worries me is that in so many instances credit card debt is behaving like a new form of payday lending. It is behaving as a type of money that people go to when they get desperate, when they have no other options and when there is no other place to go. As a result, they find themselves caught in these traps. Once you are in these traps, getting out of them is so, so difficult.


There are reforms that can take place. There are reforms that should take place. There are reforms that I think can be achieved in a very, very bipartisan way. I want to acknowledge some of the language from the Treasurer in this space because I think it has been the right language and quite strong. This process really began at around the time of the last round of estimates when the representatives and in some cases the heads of four different regulatory agencies—Treasury, the ACCC, ASIC and APRA—came to estimates and said that they could not explain why credit card rates are so high. They could not explain why it is so sticky. They could not explain why this gap between the cash rate and the interest being charged has come to the level that it has.


In response to that, the Treasurer set up a process where, as I understand it, he formally referred some of these matters to be looked at by the Council of Financial Regulators. I think that is a step in the right direction. I think the Treasurer should be congratulated for doing that. I also think that the work the committee is doing in this space is quite strong and will be able to assist with that. Part of the problem and part of the challenge from a regulatory framework is that you have four different agencies all responsible for different parts. ASIC is responsible for the consumers. APRA is responsible for the overall banking industry. Treasury is responsible for policy. The Reserve Bank is responsible for payments.


With the brief period of time that I have remaining I want to touch on the process that is being undertaken by the RBA at the moment. The Reserve Bank's Payments System Board, frankly, in my opinion, needs to be opened up, it needs to be more transparent and it needs to be giving the rest of us a lot more information about how they behave and what they do. When you have the other board of the Reserve Bank—the board that sets interest rates—coming out with minutes and detailed decisions and then you have the Payments Systems Board, the second board of the Reserve Bank, operating in a much more secretive environment that concerns me.


I have said this before and I will say this again: I know that there is a process going on regarding payments to the Reserve Bank. They are taking a longer process then we are taking through our Senate inquiry. I think it would be appropriate if they held off on making their recommendations to allow this public debate, especially on complicated issues such as interchange fees, to happen and to take on board the views of the Senate and the parliament through our committee process before they come to their decisions. I think that would be a sensible and appropriate way of having the parliamentary process feed into the processes that are being taken by them.


There is a big issue of credit cards out there. Today we are talking about a side issue, an amendment of the banking laws. There are some good parts to the legislation and there are consequences to this legislation. The point I want to stress is that this is not something that we can or should do in isolation. When we are talking about banking reform, we are talking about the big bits of banking reform and the big changes that need to take place. I really want to stress that one of the big changes that we can and should make is in the area of credit cards. Too many people are suffering, and there has been too much pain. Frankly, we have a banking sector that in the credit card space has not had the type of scrutiny and the type of competition it should have had. The reforms are simple, but there is no right-left solution to this. The solution is not simply more regulation or no regulation. In some areas I think that removing regulation is going to create a more competitive banking environment, and in other areas we should be looking at legislative changes. To quote the great Tony Blair: 'What matters is what works.' We have to be able to look at a package of reforms and a package of ideas that are going to work. We know what works when consumers get the best outcome. Currently, consumers are not getting the outcomes they need.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-09-08,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (19:08):  I rise also to speak in support of the bill before this chamber and I note the important intent behind this bill, which is, quite simply, the protection of consumers. We need always to be looking at the interaction between consumers, the financial products that are on the market and the financial institutions which of those products. 


In government we looked carefully at the costs that were accruing to consumers from inactive accounts—from those accounts which were sitting idle, accruing fees and seeing balances whittled away. The government has reviewed this and has come to the view that it would be preferable, on balance, to link the period before account transfer is triggered to seven years. Labor supports that proposal. The Australian Bankers Association has indicated that this would reduce the administration costs, the marketing costs and their complaints handling costs. Where we can get a good outcome for the industry and a good outcome for consumers, Labor is happy to support sensible proposals for reform.


As my colleague, Senator Dastyari, has pointed out, it is important to think carefully about the broader context in which consumers interact with the finance system. One of the observations I would make from my brief period on the Economics Committee is that it has become very clear to me that finance products are different from many other products which consumers might consider. By their nature, they are significantly more complex and, in particular, they are products which operate over time. For that reason consumers often find themselves experiencing significant difficulties in evaluating what benefits a particular product might confer upon them when compared to other products and what the best product for them and their family might be. There is, of course, a school of thought that says, 'Well, buyer, beware. It is up to consumers to make their own decisions.' We live in a society where consumers' ability to allocate the resources to the products and services that they desire is the foundation for efficient resource allocation and the best outcomes for society. That analysis is one that is broadly supported by both sides of this chamber, but we need to recognise that humans find in many cases difficulties and challenges. 


We know more and more about human psychology and the challenges that individual consumers might have in making certain kinds of decisions. One of the things that has been drawn to our attention repeatedly in recent weeks on the Economics Committee is the significance of behavioural economics in explaining some of the odd things we start to see in financial markets, particularly when we are looking at retail products for ordinary households and for mum and dad consumers. Senator Dastyari spoke briefly about the credit card situation and the way that insights from behavioural economics manifest themselves in what has been described by a number of stakeholders as a failure of competition in that market. It is puzzling because a rational consumer would observe that they are currently paying very high rates on a particular credit card and that rational consumer might perhaps seek out alternative products which offer a better return on their investment and a better outcome for their family. But, for a range of reasons, that does not seem to happen in this particular market. Behavioural economics offers some explanations about why some consumers might not make good decisions in those circumstances. 


Behavioural economics speaks to us about optimism bias—the idea in this case that, when people are evaluating products and rates, they do not consider rates carefully because they imagine themselves to be the kind of person who always pays their credit card debts off on time and thus will be the kind of person who never pays interest on any of their borrowings. But, of course, that optimism is misplaced. Many of the people who believe that to be so about themselves, who want to believe the best about themselves, in fact find that that optimism is misplaced; they do not pay off all of their debt each month and they do find themselves paying interest rates, sometimes very high interest rates. 


It is related to another characteristic which is, of course, imperfect self-control. We know why people spend very large amounts of money on advertising, not just in the finance sector but in the retail sector more generally, and that is because it works. As humans we are most susceptible to many kinds of behavioural pushes and nudges that draw us to make decisions about enhancing our immediate wellbeing, even though it may not be in our long-term interest. That imperfect self-control, of course, leads to many people who have easy access to credit living beyond their means, accruing debts—in some cases modest, in other cases catastrophically large—which they are not able to pay off in the period required to avoid interest repayments. Again, people who find themselves in this situation will not be maximising the benefits for their family, despite the fact that they believe themselves to be making best efforts to do so.


There is another category of human failing that influences these markets also, and that is quite simply the transaction costs associated with acquiring information necessary to make good decisions. In the finance sector, where the information and the products themselves are already confusing—not least because they operate over time—the ability to acquire information that is useful to you as a consumer to make good decisions is sometimes dependent on an investment of a very large period of time and intellectual energy. To be honest, I know that in my family there is quite a lot going on. There are kids, there are bills, there is work, there is social life and, of course, for all of us in this chamber there are the political organisations that we belong to and the organisations in the community that we seek to support. In that context, spending the time to seek out information about the range of products that might be on the market, comparing them and making an evaluation about the extent to which they are suitable for you or your family, is an investment of time that many people find difficult to make. 


One of the recommendations that we are seeing coming through very strongly from the Senate inquiry process is about the simplification of the information available to consumers when they are choosing products and making sure that comparing apples with apples is something that is simple to do, and making sure that people's eyes are drawn to the right thing when they are choosing a financial product, the thing that is most in their interest as consumers. What we do know from survey information is that, when people are making decisions about what products to choose, they are often focusing on entirely the wrong thing. They are looking at how it is going to go in terms of rewards points; they are considering whether or not it is a product that is sitting with their existing financial institution. They are, in most instances, not looking at the rate of interest payable and they are certainly not looking at the fine print about the penalty interest rates that might apply should they find themselves in financial difficulty. One of the things that we see in terms of recommendations are about greater information and better information to be made available to consumers by the providers of retail products.


Senator Dastyari spoke about the human costs of the failures of competition in this sector and the market failures which are delivering suboptimal outcomes for society. Some of the evidence that we have heard in the credit card inquiry, in the managed investment products inquiry, have been shocking indeed. I will admit that I have been close to tears hearing stories from some individuals whose lives have been comprehensively turned upside down by interactions with institutions and financial advisers who have served them poorly and served the interests of them and their families very poorly.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (19:20):  Mr Acting Deputy President, it may come as a shock to you, or perhaps it would not, that everything that is said in this chamber is not necessarily true or correct. It would not be a shock to you. I heard your explanation today about how you were being misquoted again. I just want to refer to Senator Lazarus: on Wednesday, 19 August, during statements by senators, he used his time to criticise the government for not doing anything for the sugar industry.


Following the 2013 election, I became Nationals duty senator for the electorate of Richmond. On one of my visits to the electorate in August last year it was suggested by the President of the Tweed Heads Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Matthew Fraser, that I needed to talk to the Tweed River Canegrowers Association about some looming problems they and their Queensland counterparts were facing. So that meeting was arranged, and I met with Dave Bartlett and other growers at the Condong Mill office at Murwillumbah and they explained how their industry works. It was clear their future was uncertain because of the looming dominance of big companies like Wilmar and the likely effect on grower returns. As I listened, I was wondering where the Labor member for Richmond, Justine Elliott, was. Surely she should have been in there fighting for this industry, but she was nowhere to be seen.


On return to parliament, I spoke with my Queensland Nationals colleague, Senator O'Sullivan, and he too was aware of the issues in his state, so we co-sponsored a Senate inquiry into the sugar industry that handed down its report on 24 June. I do not propose to go into the details of that report here because it is all on Hansard, but the committee recommended a mandatory code of conduct be adopted and that millers need to come to the table in good faith in negotiations with the growers.


At the same time as that inquiry was going on, an LNP committee headed by the member for Dawson, Mr George Christensen, handed down a code of conduct for the sugar industry. The purpose of that code is to regulate the conduct of sugar millers, sugar port owners and cane producers to ensure fair and transparent access to sugar-milling services, to ensure choice regarding marketing services and to provide for mechanisms to negotiate disputes. The code states that a sugar miller must enter into a cane supply agreement, or enter into negotiations about the terms of a cane supply agreement, with a cane producer if the cane producer has applied to the sugar miller to enter into a cane supply agreement. It makes clear that a sugar miller and a cane producer must at all times deal with each other in good faith, and if there is a dispute it would go to an independent arbitrator. I congratulate the member for Dawson and his colleagues on the enormous amount of work they put into developing this code.


On 19 August, Senator Lazarus came in here grandstanding, saying he was going to be the champion of the Queensland sugar industry—right!—despite playing no part in the inquiry which was trying to find a solution. Did Senator Lazarus make a submission to the inquiry?




Senator O'Sullivan:
  No.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Not at all. Did he attend any of the three hearings? 




Senator O'Sullivan:
  He did not.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  No, he did not, Senator O'Sullivan. Why hasn't he spoken on the Senate committee report? He has had plenty of opportunity to do so. The self-declared champion of the sugar industry has not fired a shot. Senators Sterle and Bullock travelled all the way from Western Australia for the hearings in February. I travelled from northern New South Wales. Senators O'Sullivan, Canavan and Macdonald came from various parts of Queensland. But Senator Lazarus could not even step out his front door! I am sure the senators who took part in the inquiry are, like me, disgusted by his comments after all the hard work we put in over the weeks of the hearings. A check of Hansard reveals that, before Senator Lazarus's speech on 19 August, he had only mentioned the sugar industry once in his 15 months here. That was in his maiden speech. That is how much of a champion he is of the Queensland sugar industry! We met with the cane growers. I had them in my office. We took evidence from them at Murwillumbah, Mackay and Townsville. We heard about their problems, we questioned the millers and so on.


Between the time Senator Lazarus became an independent on 15 March this year and these sittings, he has voted in divisions 21 times with the government, 40 times with the opposition and 51 times with the Greens. As for his opening remarks in his speech on 19 August that the Abbott government has no regard for industry or jobs, we know where he stands on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement because he was one of the speakers trotted out by the Electrical Trades Union at a rally in Brisbane in July. Maybe Senator Lazarus is interested in learning that the signing of the Japan-Australia Free Trade Agreement has resulted in the doubling of exports of mangoes in the first three months of the year. Tell the growers around Mareeba, Burdekin, Rockhampton and Bundaberg that that is not good news! 


The truth has to be spoken here. Senator Lazarus has not stuck up for the people who elected him. He was elected as a conservative, not as a left-wing socialist Green—which is what his votes in this place are showing—and he ought to look at the people who voted him in. (Time expired)
