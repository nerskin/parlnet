Archives Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1998 No.273
2 December 1998
Senator the Hon Richard Alston
Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts

CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Archives Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1998 No.273, which amend the Principal Regulations with respect to the charges which may be made for copying and discretionary services.
The Explanatory Statement indicates that, in relation to most matters, the charges set out in the Schedule substituted by these regulations have increased. That Statement also observes that there has been no change to the charges made for training courses, the reason being that `these are already high in comparison with the prevailing prices in the market'. Presumably, the Archives is able to charge above market rates for its training sessions because it is a monopoly supplier. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to why, if the charge for training sessions is currently high, this opportunity was not taken to reduce the level of charges for them.
Yours sincerely

Dear Bill
Thank you for your letter of 2 December 1998 to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon Richard Alston, seeking the reasons why charges for the training courses set out in the Schedule to the Archives Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1998 No. 273 were not reduced. Senator Alston has passed your letter to me for reply as Minister responsible in the new Government.
I am advised by the National Archives that the Explanatory Statement to the regulations was inadvertently incorrectly worded. The statement that 
 charges ""are already high in comparison with the prevailing prices in the market"" is in fact not the situation in relation to the current market in the private sector.
When the Archives established fees for discretionary services in 1990 it was decided to include a fee for the training of private sector consultants. This followed a number of instances where companies contracting to Commonwealth agencies had sought to attend Archives training courses which are intended primarily to train Commonwealth agency staff. The fee set was the maximum rate that could be charged, even though it was then only partial cost recovery. Private sector training companies in fact charge rates generally much higher for records-related training courses than those charged by the Archives.
The Archives has followed a policy of discounting the charge where private sector contractors are to do records-related work for Commonwealth agencies. This is because the Archives is concerned to ensure that the work is done for Commonwealth agencies by adequately trained personnel; the Archives has assured me that this discounting will continue.
During 1999 the Archives intends to introduce a new suite of training courses. It may be that provision of these courses is outsourced. It was therefore decided not to alter the training course charges stated in the Regulation at this time, but to continue the discount policy and consider the matter in the light of new arrangements and to propose appropriate amendments to the Regulations at that time.
I trust that this explanation satisfies the Committee's concerns on this matter.
Kind Regards

Childcare Assistance Immunisation Requirements IMCA/12G/98/3, made under section 12H of the  Child Care Act 1972
2 December 1998
Senator the Hon Jocelyn Newman
Minister for Family and Community Services
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Childcare Assistance Immunisation Requirements IMCA/12G/98/3 made under s.12H of the Child Care Act 1972 , which will, in some circumstances, allow more time for parents to comply with the immunisation requirements of that Act before they lose their eligibility to Childcare Assistance.
The Explanatory Statement advises that on 6 January 1999 Centrelink will write to parents of 
 children under seven not shown as being immunised advising them of the link between Childcare Assistance and immunisation. Section 12G of the enabling Act indicates that the link there referred to is established only when the Secretary to the Department is satisfied as to various matters. However, it does readily appear from the legislation whether a parent has a right of review of an adverse decision by the Secretary and whether, if there is such a right, the parent is to be informed of it.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice.
Yours sincerely

Dear Bill
Thank you for your letter of 2 December 1998 concerning the link between eligibility for Childcare Assistance and immunisation. I apologise for the delay in replying.
A decision that Childcare Assistance is not payable to a child who does not satisfy the immunisation requirements in section 12H of the Child Care Act 1972  (the Act) is made under section 12G of that Act. Under this current Act, a parent who has received an adverse decision from the Secretary has no right of review.
It is envisaged that there will be review rights for parents in relation to the link between the proposed Child Care Benefit and immunisation in the proposed Family Assistance Act, expected to be in effect from 1 July 2000.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
I refer to the Health Insurance (1998-99 General Medical Services Table) Regulations 1998, Statu 
 tory Rules 1998 No.301, which set out the table of fees for general medical services applicable for the year from 1 November 1998.
The copy of the regulations received by the Committee listed the fee for item 319 of the Table as `71', although a slip attached to the front of the regulations substituted `71' with `$132.65'. The Committee would appreciate your assurance that the version of the regulations made by the Governor-General had the correct figure in the fee column against item 319.

Thank you for your letter of 2 December 1998 concerning Health Insurance (1998-99 General Medical Services Table) Regulations 1998, Statutory Rules 1998 No. 301.
The Regulations signed by the Governor-General on 27 October 1998 contained the correct fee of $132.65.
The Attorney-General's Department has advised that the error was a typographical error that occurred between the original document being signed and the Regulations being printed for general distribution by the Government printer. As the error was detected before the Regulations were distributed and the size of the Regulations meant it was not practicable to reprint them before distribution, the Regulations were distributed with a correction slip.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-11,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion standing in the name of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Faulkner moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 131. 

This item before us today relates to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] , which is and will be in need of major surgery. The Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee is dealing with a piece of legislation which basically replaces some eight pieces of Commonwealth legislation.
There are real concerns in the community about this legislation. There are concerns on a whole range of levels. There are concerns about lack of consultation as to the bill. Witness after witness before the Senate environment committee indicated they had not been consulted or there was inadequate consultation. There is real concern as to lack of certainty in the framework that will be part of the legislation. There is concern that so much is being left to regulations and bilateral agreements that, when the Senate is asked to agree to this legislation, this Senate will not be in a position to understand what it is really agreeing to. There is real concern as to lack of detail in the bill itself.
This concern is widespread. It covers all stakeholders. Let us not delude ourselves when we address this particular topic. This bill could lead to a long debate and already I think potential amendments range to some 200, if not more, in number. So it will be a complicated process that the Senate will have to go through. We believe that, if we can have extra time in the committee to work out some of the amendments and some of the concerns, that will facilitate the debate in this place.
As I said, there is widespread concern. One of the issues raised before the committee was, for instance, the idea of having a round table of all stakeholders to see whether we can come to some agreement between the stakeholders with interest in this legislation. I think those who addressed that issue embrace the concept of a round table as a constructive way to go. In the last day or so we have had letters from a whole range of groups saying they would like to see the legislation proceed, but as recently as only a week ago we had a whole range of submissions from the industry sector concerned about no consultation, no 
 certainty and lack of detail in the framework. It was only a few weeks ago, for instance, that the Director of the Australian Industry Group, Mr Mark Fogarty, said that the bill was archaic. He said that it would be immediately unworkable and it had drafting errors. He said it would introduce uncertainty and that it would be unwise and unworkable to proceed with the legislation at this particular time. He was not the only one.
The Minerals Council of Australia, again just a couple of weeks ago, said that industry is of the strong view that the major bilateral agreements should be in place before the new legislation comes into effect and that all regulations must be produced and debated contemporaneously with the legislation. They went on to say that industry is of the opinion that a thorough reframing and rewrite of the bill will be necessary.
The Environmental Defender's Office, the peak group in drafting the environmental group's response to this legislation, urges the Senate to allow the public and the parliament adequate time to debate the bill. They recommend the legislation should not proceed until further draft regulations and bilateral agreements are made available. Even the National Farmers Federation said that the bill should be submitted to parliament only following the successful negotiation of bilateral agreements and should be accompanied by the regulations and admin orders. They said that the government's approach to consultation with stakeholders on the new package has been disappointing and has led to considerable concern.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as well have wide-ranging concerns. Indigenous stakeholders have not been consulted. To the extent that they have been, they have been betrayed. The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies said just a couple of weeks ago, `We are concerned that, should the bill be enacted prior to finalisation of bilateral arrangements, the result is likely to be widespread duplication in environmental processes.'
—We would be happy to give you the suspension.
—If you are happy to give a suspension, why am I speaking?
Senator Hill interjecting—
—Thanks, Senator Hill, but I think it is important to put this on the record since you are going to argue about it. In the last 24 hours, we have had correspondence from a range of industry groups, and what they have said in the last 24 hours is totally different from what they have been saying for a number of months by way of submissions to the Senate committee and by way of verbal submissions as well. We think it is important to get the extra three or four weeks and have a round table discussion so we can try to overcome some of the problems that are in the legislation before we get to the floor of this chamber because we understand that between now and 1 July we are going to be hard-pressed with a lot of other legislation as well.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,6,1

That—
(a)	 the Senate notes that a number of organisations, in submissions to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999], have raised concerns over the Government's lack of consultation and undue haste in relation to the proposed environmental legislation; and
(b)	 the time for presentation of the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 
 Bill 1998 [1999] be extended to 27 April 1999 to allow for further consultation.
As I was saying earlier, there are concerns about this legislation in the community and amongst all stakeholders. It is a concern that I detailed in the previous five-minute contribution that I made, and it is a concern that continues until this very day. We even had representations yesterday from the traditional owners of Uluru, who are concerned about how this bill will change the arrangements they have in respect of their ongoing relationship with the land at Uluru. They are one, but it is quite evident from the comments I read out earlier that the concern is that this legislation does traverse the whole range of stakeholders from industry to the National Farmers Federation, the seafood council, the mining industry and all the environmental groups.
I do not need to repeat what I said earlier, but I do say at this stage again that this is not simple legislation. This is not legislation that one can anticipate going through this House in quick time. It is legislation that does supplant some eight pieces of federal environmental law. It is legislation which has led to concern across, at least, environmental groups that the government is about curtailing its involvement from a national level in the environment. It is legislation which will need detailed consideration.
There are legal issues and issues of ministerial discretion and accountability. There are issues going to the ambit of the legislation. As I said earlier, I would be very surprised if a bill like this did not attract at least some 200 amendments in this place. Obviously it would facilitate the passage of the legislation and consideration of it if we had the extra time to consider it in committee.
—Would you put your amendments in the committee, which was the original desire of this committee system?
—The amendments are being evolved. As you know from your period in opposition, as the committee hears more and more evidence, it can either finetune or develop amendments. That is exactly the way the process was used by you when you were in opposition. It is the way that we also use it and have used it in opposition here.
For instance, if you look at the Wik debate, amendments were being evolved in consultation with government, without consultation with government and in consultation with a whole range of groups. As Senator Minchin will tell you—if you take the time out to talk to him—that process is extremely important. We are looking towards having a comprehensive process.
At present, the reporting date is 22 March, but only four or five days before the reporting date we will be getting evidence for the first time formally from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Just a few days before that reporting date, we will be up in Darwin getting evidence from stakeholders there. At the end of this week, we will be hearing evidence in Adelaide. We are rushing three days of hearings—Darwin, Adelaide and Melbourne—over the next week with quite important stakeholders with important submissions to consider, and we are giving the committee and the secretariat, particularly the committee members, very little time to digest the submissions of those groups.
You could say that we have had some of the submissions in writing, but in this particular process as groups look closer and closer at the legislation—not just the environment groups but industry groups as well—they are finding there is a need for further examination and amendment. Let us not proceed with haste. We do have time available to us. If Senator Hill would consider this soberly, he would probably recognise that the proposal put up by the opposition today is one of merit because it would facilitate the process in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,6,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-11,"—For many groups in the community, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999]  has been brought on with unseemly haste. In many cases, if bills are brought in just before a Christmas break, groups who are mostly based on volunteers have a great deal of difficulty in complying with the requirements of getting fully researched and properly documented submissions together during the Christmas break. It is almost impossible. Now those groups are beginning to get their sub 
 missions together and there is a great deal of rush. Of course, if the original timetable was applied, they would already have to have those done. Many people are suspicious of a government which makes claims about a major change to environment policy and then actually tries to engineer a situation where there is not sufficient time for those claims to be tested.
I have sat in on some hearings by phone on this piece of legislation, but I was at the Perth hearing when representatives from a wide range of groups within the mining industry gave evidence. A number of those people at the table said that they felt that they had not been properly consulted, that they believed there ought to be extra time and that they were not in favour of the bill coming on at the time it was scheduled.
I stopped for a minute and said, `Can I get this clear? Is this the view of all of the groups represented here today?' Of course, we are talking about a large industry in Western Australia, the mining industry. I will not say that every single miner in Western Australia was represented, but I have to say that a fair chunk of the Western Australian mining industry was represented at that table. I said, `Can I be quite clear here of what is being asked? You believe that the bill is being rushed on too quickly, you would like proper consultation and this bill needs more time to be properly debated within the community?' And they said, `Yes, Senator.' They made it quite clear that that was what they were saying.
I guess what I would like to know is what the government have been saying to those groups in the last few days. What have the government been saying to industry? The government have been saying quite clearly since last year that they are going to promise a bill which will bring better environmental outcomes to Australia. Are the government frightened that, if they test that thesis, their statements will fall apart? Are they telling the mining industry that, if the bill gets looked at too closely, there is going to be growing community pressure to make the changes which most people believe are absolutely 
 necessary to even get close to the government's statements of their aims for this bill?
Is it the case that this bill does not stand up to scrutiny? I would put it to you that that is what the government are currently saying to these groups—that, if they do not go now, there might be some chance of changing the bill to make it more protective of the environment. Heavens, we can't have that! The rush is on to stop the community from looking at things too closely and enabling the support for those necessary amendments to build.
I am concerned about the sudden change of mind considering, as I said, the evidence could not have been clearer from those groups that I was able to listen to in the committee. We had Aboriginal groups, we had environment groups, we had industry groups and, in particular, we had mining groups saying exactly the same thing—`Too rushed. Not enough consultation. This doesn't need to be put through this quickly. Let's put the bill off.' I would like to know what has happened in the meantime, and I guess I am looking forward to hearing the government's explanation of what they have been saying, the line they have been putting to those particular groups in the last few days.
I believe the community deserves the extra time that is necessary. I believe these issues are not side issues, they are not peripheral issues; they are mainstream issues in today's community and I believe they deserve to be looked at properly. I support the motion to give longer time for consideration of this bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,6,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-03-11,"—I would very much like to oppose this motion. The core of the argument for the extension of time is that there has not been adequate time for consultation. But any review of the process that has been gone through shows that that argument simply does not stand up to any kind of examination.
First, the review of Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities for the environment preceded the reform of Commonwealth environment legislation and culminated in the heads of agreement on Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities for the environment endorsed in principle by COAG on 7 November 1997. Consultation with key non- 
 government organisations was an important aspect of the review process and, as far back as mid-December 1996, the working group conducting the review sought the views of over 50 key non-government organisations on a consultation paper. The working group requested that submissions be lodged by 21 February 1997—I repeat: 1997—and a number of organisations were granted additional time to prepare and lodge their submissions.
The working group developed a consultation paper in February 1998—more than a year ago—and over 5,000 copies of that paper were distributed to interested government and non-government organisations. The consultation paper was also made available electronically on the Internet. Both the minister and the officials of the department held discussions with key interest groups, and there have been no privileged negotiations with industry or any other group in this process. In other words, for something like 2½ years, the issues which this bill is about have been going through a process of discussion with the key interested parties. The claim that there has not been adequate public consultation really cannot be sustained.
The second issue is whether or not the committee has had sufficient time to consider submissions and think about the issues. The original closure date for the committee's hearings was 21 September 1998, and members of the committee have had access to 601 submissions. So, in effect, for some five months, the members of the committee have had time to consider the submissions of industry groups, indigenous groups and environmental groups. I would have thought that gave plenty of time for members of the committee and those in this place interested in environmental issues to think through the points made by the various groups that made submissions.
Lastly, there is the issue of whether the submitters have had adequate time to present their evidence to the committee. The committee sought to hold hearings in every capital city, and we still have to do Adelaide, Darwin and Melbourne. Nevertheless, a large number of submissions have been made by industry groups, indigenous groups and environmental 
 groups. One thing that is clear is that there are no new issues being raised. The issues are very repetitious. Senator Faulkner knows about repetition because it is his way of getting a point across. The points are getting across because the same points are coming through in submission after submission. So I think it can be said that all the issues are on the table. There are, it would seem, no new issues to come from any of those three major groups.
Senator Bolkus made particular mention of the Australian Conservation Foundation. We recognise that the Australian Conservation Foundation, obviously, are a major group in this debate. But to say that, because they are not going to be heard until 18 March means their point of view will not be heard, is another example of something that does not stand up to examination, because the ACF have already put their issues to the committee. This is the case because the ACF was a major contributor to the submission of the Environmental Defender's Office. The Environmental Defender's Office made a global submission—which is known as submission No. 15—on behalf of various groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation.
The Environmental Defender's Office has been heard in Sydney on 4 February and in Canberra on 4 March. As well, the Environmental Defender's Office will be heard again in Adelaide under the name of the Urban Ecology Group on 12 March, and in Darwin as the Northern Territory branch of the Environmental Defender's Office on 17 March. I repeat that in all these cases the groups have referred to the one submission—that is, submission No. 15—and the Australian Conservation Foundation was a major contributor to that submission. In other words, the arguments of the ACF have been heard time and time again, and to argue that they will not be heard until 15 March is just not true.
 Furthermore, earlier this week I asked the secretary of the committee to contact the ACF in Melbourne to provide an additional submission if they had any further issues to be raised. It is pretty clear that there has been a full and proper process, that the committee has had adequate time to consider all the 
 issues and that there is no reason at all to delay this bill coming into the Senate.
Senator Bolkus has referred to groups such as the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Seafood Industry Council, the National Farmers Federation and various other groups that he says want a delay, and Senator Margetts also referred to them. Yet, strangely enough, there are copies of letters that I have in my possession, which have been passed on to me through the office of the minister, addressed to Senator Bolkus. In these letters the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the Australian Seafood Industry Council, the National Farmers Federation, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Business Council of Australia all say that they do not want this bill to be delayed and they want this matter to come into the Senate so that, through the Senate process, the amendments which may be necessary can be considered in the committee stage and the debate of the bill can go on.
The indigenous group which Senator Bolkus mentioned yesterday, the Uluru group, are due to see the committee on Friday. I met them yesterday. The issues they have raised are already in a submission. We have already heard indigenous groups in Sydney and in Perth and, again, the broad issues are the same. So there is nothing new or different which the Uluru group or the Northern Land Council are likely to present to the committee.
 It seems to me that there is no case whatsoever for delaying the debate of this bill. There has been adequate consultation. The issues are all on the table. Many of the groups which Senator Bolkus claims—and Senator Margetts said—did not wish the bill to proceed at this time have now written in and, quite to the contrary, have said they want the bill to go ahead and for the process of Senate debate to begin.
 I would urge colleagues in the Senate to see Senator Bolkus's motion as being a motion put up for perhaps different reasons than those stated. It certainly is not put up because there has been lack of consultation or lack of time to consider the issues before the committee. I would urge you to reject this motion.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-11,"—The Australian Greens support this motion. I am amazed that the government feels that it is adequate for the peak environment group, the Australian Conservation Foundation, to be heard before this committee four days before the report is tabled in this place. Those of us who have been involved in committees—and that is all of us—will know that that essentially means there will be a draft of what is going to be brought before this chamber written before the major Australian conservation group has been heard. That is tokenism of the worst kind.
To hear Senator Eggleston say, `Well, the Australian Conservation Foundation has fed into the Environmental Defender's Office. They have contributed to their submission. That should be enough,' is patronising to the environment movement in this country and, in particular, patronising to the Australian Conservation Foundation. You not only have to hear what the peak environment groups have to say but also have to be earnest in deliberating and considering their contribution.
 After all, we are seeing in this legislation a major reversal of the process of the Commonwealth taking responsibility for the national environment. What we are seeing is a transfer back to the states of the bad old days pre-1970 when the great environmental repository and heritage of Australia was at the mercy of maverick state governments, and in particular the inability of state governments to do the right thing when they came under pressure from major resource extractors.
This is historic stuff. This is the worst reversal of Australia's environmental heritage against the wishes of the Australian people for half a century. This, together with the legislation to implement regional forest agreements, is about the Commonwealth walking out on its environmental responsibilities for this nation. We have a committee procedure which is to allow conservation groups in particular, as I see it, to be able to deliberate adequately, to relate to the wider community and to feed back into this chamber through the committee system. But the peak environment group, the Australian Conservation Foundation, is to be 
 heard four days before a report is tabled in this place. That is not good enough. That is tokenism.
The government might believe that that is the right thing to do at the behest of the resource extractors—not least the mining industry, which has apparently changed its position overnight as far as wanting an extension of hearing time for itself. It has suddenly fallen into line with the government's wish to have this matter brought to an early close without adequate community consultation and time so that the government can facilitate getting this legislation through before there has been proper debate with the community representatives.
The committee itself has not seen the bilateral agreements between the states and the Commonwealth which are going to facilitate this legislation. The committee has not seen the regulations which are attendant on this legislation. I cannot understand how Senator Eggleston or the minister can say that it is adequate or proper procedure for a committee of the Senate to report back to the Senate having not seen those regulations and those agreements—much less the people appearing before that committee having seen them. They are vital to an adequate assessment of the impact of this historic legislation on the way in which this nation deals with its environment.
I reiterate that this legislation is a major reversal, back to the bad old days when the Commonwealth shared its responsibility not for regional issues but for the national environment, including its global responsibilities for such things as world heritage. The right way to go with this legislation is to expand and tighten up on the Commonwealth responsibilities so that, like other nations around the world, the national parliament and the national government are able to respond in this fast moving world to their environmental responsibilities. But that is not what is happening here. The Commonwealth is divesting itself of the legislation which gives it the power to implement, oversee and fulfil those obligations to the nation's environment.
It may be thought that the environment does not matter or, worse still, that the environment 
 is a difficulty which needs to be put aside by the Howard government. If that is its thinking, it is completely out of kilter with what the Australian people are thinking. The polls still show that Australians are more alert, aware and concerned about the environment as a people than the peoples of any other country on the face of the planet, including Germany. Moreover, the polling shows that young Australians consistently put at the top of their concerns fears for the environment. We must factor that in. Young Australians are alert to the fact that environmental degradation in this country and around the world is accelerating at a time when we know it is damaging not only to our future but also to our current living circumstances, our sense of security and our economic and employment prospects into the future. All those things are interrelated.
A survey last year by the Melbourne Herald-Sun tried to find out what it is that worries young people. This is related to the increasing rates of suicide, despair and cynicism amongst young Australians. It found that at the top of the list of concerns of these young Australians is the environment. They do not mean concern about some pictorial representation of the environment. Young Australians are very literate about the impact on the future of such things as global warming, deforestation, the loss of some 50 species to extinction around the world every day due to resource extraction and plunder, an expanding population and, in particular, loss of forests.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on relevance. Bearing in mind the huge amount of work that the Senate has to do, I draw your attention to the fact that Senator Brown's current line of argument is not specifically addressing the proposal by Senator Bolkus.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it indeed is, as you would have followed during my argument.
—I have another appointment.
—It is not a point of order that Senator Harradine has appoint 
 ments. If Senator Harradine wants to keep his appointments, he is able to do so, but he should not try to truncate this debate or the contribution of other senators because of his personal circumstances.
—On the point of order: I thought Senator Brown had made his point rather convincingly. He was drifting off the particular point at this stage. I do not know whether it is within his intentions to wind up pretty quickly. I would anticipate that, having made those points very well and succinctly, going to a vote might be the most advantageous thing to do.
—Relevance is important in debates. I would ask that Senator Brown relate his remarks to the argument for the extension of time for the committee report and not to the debate on the issue and the legislation itself.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As you would have noted from my contribution, that is exactly what I have been doing. This is an extremely important issue. It is one that needs to be given time, and adequate community consultation needs to be brought into it. It does not need to be dismissed by forcing it to a reporting date which is not consistent with the importance of the issue. For those reasons, I support the motion. It is an extremely important motion. It is important that the community and the groups involved have the time to deliberate and to contribute adequately. That is not allowed under the terms of the reporting time that currently prevail.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1999-03-11,"—The Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998  gives effect 
 to the Farm Business Improvement Program, or FarmBis, announced in September 1997 as part of the government's Agriculture—Advancing Australia package. This so-called AAA package includes a range of measures to help Australian farmers get on the front foot and stay there.
These measures include farm management deposits, which encourage farmers to invest up to $300,000 to allow for economic and seasonal downturns; a revamped drought and emergency assistance program; farmer access to a wider range of welfare assistance; an opportunity for farmers to access the pension and retire, handing on the farm to the next generation—this addresses the often difficult topic of family farm succession; and a new emphasis on training and business skills through the Farm Business Improvement Program, which is what this legislation is about. FarmBis has been designed to help all those involved in farming, including employees, to build on their existing skills, improving profitability, sustainability and competitiveness.
Research conducted by the National Farmers Federation has shown that there are strong links between education and training and the levels of productivity. Profitability and innovation achieved by individual farmers require these sorts of initiatives. Australian farmers do have a culture of continuous improvement, evidenced by the popularity, amongst other things, of farm field days—the Henty days, the Mudgee small farm field days and, of course, Gunnedah's very well attended Agquip. Farmers embrace new ideas like whole of farm management planning, which is one of the things that is becoming more and more popular.
The FarmBis scheme will operate for three years from the 1998-99 financial year at a cost of $50 million. It was developed following the findings of the McColl report and extensive consultation with the states, territories and farmer groups. It replaces the Rural Adjustment Scheme. FarmBis's emphasis is on delivering training tailored to the needs of local farmers. Consequently, assistance under FarmBis will be taken from the direct financial contribution towards the cost of training 
 activities. Activities to be supported include farm performance benchmarking, skills development such as rural leadership, quality assurance, risk management, marketing, natural resource management and farm business, and financial planning and advice.
Convenience is also an important factor, a point made repeatedly during the consultations throughout the program's development. The average farmer in my home state of New South Wales does not have time to pore over books, journals and computer programs—no farmer does. Nor does he or she have hours of free time to travel off-farm for courses and seminars. Through FarmBis, the coalition is promoting continuous learning by making training much more accessible. The pressure will be on training providers—either private or state agencies—to better meet the needs of farmers. We expect that state agencies, industry, local farmers and community groups will work together to achieve that goal.
Local coordinators will take responsibility for the further development of farmers in their area who want to take part in activities under the FarmBis framework. This bill funds activities on two levels—a state component and a national component. The state component will fund state training priorities as determined by state planning groups. Funding will be shared on a fifty-fifty basis between the Commonwealth and the state. The national component will fund cross-border projects and national industry initiatives—examples include the national pig industry initiative and the chicken meat benchmarking study.
This is a practical bill which has the best interests of the people on Australia's 145,000-odd farming enterprises at heart. It acknowledges the differing needs of farmers in each of the states and territories and acknowledges that ongoing training for farmers is vital. But it must be structured carefully to ensure participation by farmers of all different categories and varieties. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-11,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we do not oppose the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 . Senator Sandy Macdonald has detailed many of the 
 elements and objectives of the bill, which is to introduce FarmBis or, more correctly, the Farm Business Improvement Program. Whilst I do not wish to take issue with most of what Senator Macdonald said because, as I said, we do support the legislation, I did note that he referred to the AAA package as the `so-called AAA package'. I am not sure whether that was a Freudian slip, but I think it was quite an accurate description because there are many aspects of the so-called AAA package announced by the former minister that we do not agree with.
In other cases, aspects of the AAA package are simply a repackaging of programs that were already in place under the previous Labor government. Certainly, introduction of the FarmBis program is a welcome initiative and we are happy to support it. Its objective of improving the managerial skills and other skills of farmers through education and learning activities is certainly meritorious.
The opposition notes that the farming sector has been undergoing ongoing structural adjustment over many years, whether it has been under previous Labor governments, previous Liberal governments or this government. That is a response to changes in the international competitive environment for rural commodities and also a response to the need to endeavour to improve the productivity and, therefore, the profitability of Australian farming. When we were in government, we were very keen to promote that and assist wherever possible. Therefore, when legislation is introduced by this government that has that objective and can help to achieve those aims, we are happy to support it.
We do not take the approach of making the crass observation that, simply because some members of the government happen to be farmers, they have a vested interest in this. Rather, we note that they are here representing a very important constituency, the farming community of this country—just as it is the case that there may be former trade union officials in the parliament who represent, in part, the interests of many hundreds of thousands of Australian employees, including, dare I say it, employees in rural and regional Australia. I know we have a fair bit of busi 
 ness to deal with in this period of debate on non-controversial legislation, so I will leave my remarks there and indicate that the opposition supports passage of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-11,"—The amendments proposed in the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998  give effect to the government's announcement in September 1997 to introduce the Farm Business Improvement Program, known as FarmBis. The objective of the scheme is to increase farmers' participation in learning activities, with the aim of improving the performance of their business. This program picks up where the former Labor government left off in that regard. The scheme is based on a cooperative arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states. The majority of funds are to be allocated through state based components to finance state, industry and community agreed priorities in relation to training and education.
I asked a question on notice about this program on 10 December last year and I recently received an answer. I was advised that the Commonwealth was still in negotiation with two states—Tasmania and Queensland—about the terms of the FarmBis agreement; that is, even though this program was announced in September 1997, the details have still not been settled.
The government had actually made funding available for the so-called Agriculture—Advancing Australia package, which incorporates FarmBis, in the May budget of that year. Senators would recall that in the previous budget, the 1996 budget, the government ripped funding out of a whole range of programs that provided assistance to people living in regional and rural Australia. For example, the Rural Communities Access Program, the Rural Telecommunications Upgrade Program, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Reserve Fund and the Agribusiness Program all lost their funding.
In those budget papers, under the heading `Purpose', it stated that the cuts were to contribute to `meeting the government's fiscal target'. This was, of course, at the expense of the fiscal targets many farmers and others living in regional Australia had set them 
 selves—and their target was to try to survive. In the following budget, the government put some of those funds back into programs with different names but similar objectives. Here we are in March 1999 still trying to get the enabling legislation through the parliament and still trying to get an agreement with the states to implement these new arrangements.
The tortured process followed in relation to this program has been a feature of the management of the primary industry portfolio and now the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio since March 1996. One of the Howard government's first actions when it won office three years ago was to hold a rural summit. The then minister, Minister Anderson, brought the rural community together to develop an action plan. This program, and the AAA package more generally, flowed from that process. When the Prime Minister launched that package in September 1997, he said that it would `provide the rural community with the new start, the fresh and positive start that so many are looking for'. It has done no such thing.
At the National Press Club four weeks ago, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, announced a major initiative for the bush. He said he was going to call a summit. He said he was going to draw together business and community leaders from across the nation and he was going to ask them to help the bush. This proves that the government have failed the bush badly. They have no clear vision for rural Australia, and that has been reflected in the adhocery that has plagued the administration of this portfolio right from the beginning.
The government have pulled sensible and effective programs apart, only to attempt to rebuild them later. They were obsessed with free trade—an obsession that has at times clouded their judgment as to what is good policy for regional Australia—and now we are back to the beginning. It seems we are going to have a rural summit to sort out what we need to do to save the bush.
This failure has added to the burden for many Australians living in rural areas. It has been reflected in many votes of no confidence in Mr Anderson and calls from key organisa 
 tions for his resignation as minister, and it has also badly damaged the National Party. This damage has been reflected not only in the rise of One Nation but also at the cabinet table in Canberra. The most recent example is the failure of the then minister, Mr Anderson, to gain cabinet endorsement for his plan for the future of the wool stockpile. He took a unified industry position to the cabinet room, and it and he were thrown out. Mr Anderson said in July 1996 that he belonged on the land and he would return to it. I suspect that this will happen sooner rather than later and that Minister Anderson will never lead the National Party.",SENATE,<title>RURAL ADJUSTMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-03-11,"—Before I sum up the points on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 , the FarmBis legislation, I have some information for Senator O'Brien. In a further response to your question on notice, the Tasmanian agreement on FarmBis has been signed off and the Queensland agreement is very close. I hope that clears up that misconception.
Senator Forshaw also commented that the AAA package carried on many of the supposed improvements made by the previous Labor government. I make no such qualification. The AAA package, which is Agriculture—Advancing Australia, is significantly different from anything that has been done before. Not only has this government introduced the Farm Family Restart Scheme to enable those families who wish to leave the farm in a dignified manner to do so; we have also extended pension eligibility to farmers and we have extended exceptional circumstances. We have not only introduced this legislation, the FarmBis legislation, but last week at the Wimmera field days I launched farm management deposits, which are a significant improvement on the previous IED and FMB schemes.
In response to your point, Senator O'Brien, the rural summit of 1996 mentioned by Minister Anderson not only brought forward the packages that I have just mentioned but also introduced a first in that it ultimately set up the Consultative Rural Finance Forum, 
 which I chair and which is a forum which meets four times a year, enabling farmers to understand better how banks work and banks to understand better how farmers work. That has never been attempted before. On that forum we have representatives of the leading banks, we have rural counsellors and we have representatives of farming organisations; and that will, I hope, significantly extend farmers' and banks' knowledge of each other's operations.
As Senator Sandy Macdonald remarked, the introduction of the Farm Business Improvement Program under this legislation represents a significant shift in government assistance towards the farm sector in helping it adjust to the challenge that it faces. Senator Macdonald detailed that farmers will be encouraged to expand their range of management skills, seek farm business and financial planning advice, undertake farm performance benchmarking, implement quality assurance programs and invest in stronger risk management programs and natural resource management. All of this is vital to the continuing viability of agriculture in Australia if it is to continue to be competitive on world markets, which is where our future lies.
This program involves $50 million of Commonwealth funding over three years and it represents an integral part of this government's past and ongoing support for the rural sector and farmers throughout Australia, a group of which I am proud to have been one. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-11,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I will be extremely brief on this matter. The amend

There are also a number of more general amendments to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the act. There are a number of changes including some changes which might be described as administrative. Over 30 peak organisations were consulted at a forum for stakeholders regarding problems with the current regulation of complementary medicine, and I believe that the outcome of this legislation satisfies the concerns of industry.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-11,"—I would like to thank honourable senators for their cooperation with this legislation, the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . The second reading of this particular bill was given here on 17 February this year and that followed very comprehensive and extensive negotiations with a lot of people and parties over the previous two or three months. It is important to recognise that this is significant legislation and is a major advance in the delivery of health care in Australia.
The reform of complementary medicine regulation has involved considerable negotiation and hard work on the part of many groups and individuals, and I would also thank the various political parties who have negotiated with us in recent days and have participated in comprehensive briefings. I trust that all of their issues have been properly addressed.
I would like particularly to pay tribute to the Complementary Health Care Council and the Proprietary Medicine Association of Australia for their commitment and contribution to this ongoing reform process. I am happy to reassure senators, in response to their representations, that the definition of `mainstream media' contained in the bill is the same as that currently included in the Therapeutic Goods Regulations.
The term `mainstream' is intended to encompass only mediums of mass communi 
 cation, for example, national or regional newspapers or magazines. The term `mainstream' is not intended to apply to internal industry or organisation publications such as newsletters or bulletins for practitioners or targeted organisation membership.
The reform package continues, and I can assure parliament that departmental officers have been actively consulting interested parties about the new regulations which arise from this legislation and the other complementary reforms.
I would also like to assure senators that it is the government's intention that the regulations will be agreed and ready for making at or shortly after the date of entry into force of those amendments in the act. I am also aware that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee addressed various issues relating to advice in their Alert Digest No. 3 of 1999. I have written today to the chairman of that committee, Senator Barney Cooney, addressing the issues that were raised and the advice that was sought. I am pleased to table a copy of that letter in association with this legislation. These reforms have been a long time in coming. With the help from various areas that has been received, I believe that we are striking the right balance between the needs of industry and the interests of consumers.

The amendments reflect agreed solutions to issues encountered by the industry, government and community stakeholders. The decision to implement these solutions through legislation was taken following dialogue with industry and consultation with the Office of Regulation and Review. I would like to compliment the Senate and I thank senators for their contributions.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-11,"—The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 amends some five acts that deal with the rural sector. The first act I refer to in terms of amendments contained within this bill is the Agriculture and Veterinary Chemicals Administration Act 1992. The purpose of the amendment to that act is to ensure that Australia meets its obligations under the World Trade Agreement, article 39(3). The amendment ensures that we comply with the requirements of the TRIPS Agreement. The TRIPS Agreement is an agreement which in turn requires Australia to provide protection from unfair commercial use of data obtained during the evaluation of new agricultural and veterinary products. The amendment ensures that such data will not be available to commercial competitors for a period of five years without the approval of the originator of the data. We do not oppose that proposed amendment.
The second act is the Dairy Produce Act 1986. Briefly, the amendments here are to allow the Australian Dairy Corporation to make payments to dairy farmers and manufacturers in Victoria who were affected by and suffered some financial loss during the Victorian gas crisis last year. The Senate will be aware that this morning Senator O'Brien from the opposition moved that the Senate rural and regional affairs committee conduct an inquiry into aspects of the dairy industry, and that inquiry—which I do not wish to canvass at the moment—will provide an opportunity for the Senate committee to look at a whole range of issues that affect dairy farmers, in particular their financial position. We support this amendment because it does ensure that dairy farmers and manufacturers who suffered some financial loss during that crisis last year, because of levy payments that they still had to make on milk that ultimately was not available for consumption, will be given some redress in that regard.
The third act that is amended is the Export Control Act 1982. The amendments simply seek to clarify the power of the secretary to approve and administer quality and safety assurance arrangements for the production of prescribed goods for export. It also makes some amendments relating to the enforcement powers for the entry and search of premises or vehicles and for copying or seizure of evidence relating to export control matters. Of course, under the Export Control Act, the primary purpose in this regard is that the regulatory controls are necessary to ensure that prescribed goods for export are fit for human consumption.
The bill amends the Imported Food Control Act 1992. That act provides for the inspection and control of food imported into Australia and operates in conjunction with the Quarantine Act 1908.
The final act amended by this bill is the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994. The amendment is a technical amendment intended to streamline procedures under that act. The opposition does not oppose passage of the legislation, which will give effect to amendments to each of those corresponding acts that I have referred to.",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-03-11,"—The Australian Labor Party is proud to have introduced the original legislation in 1990 that resulted in the establishment of ASDA—the Australian Sports Drug Agency. At that stage the establishment of ASDA signalled the first time in the world that a drug agency had been established under government legislation. Labor's goal in establishing ASDA was to ensure that Australian athletes were able to perform and compete in an environment untainted by banned substances.
The use of illegal performance enhancing drugs has serious repercussions, as we have witnessed in both international and domestic sporting competitions. When Labor established ASDA, one of the key aims was to act as a deterrent to any athlete who might consider using prohibited substances. To achieve this goal, ASDA implemented a variety of strategies based on policy advice, education, advocacy and deterrence.
In 1996-97, ASDA performed a record number of anti-doping tests. Their success in preventing the use of illegal substances in sport is such that ASDA estimate that 99 per cent of athletes have been deterred from participating in banned doping practices since their programs began. In fact, ASDA has not had a single legal challenge against its testing program.
Since Labor created ASDA it has proven itself to be worthy of the exceptional interna 
 tional reputation it has gained, and ASDA's stated vision of being the leading drugs testing agency in the world is commendable and totally supported by the Labor Party. So too is ASDA's strategy to make its anti-doping programs available to both elite and non-elite athletes, and its role in education and policy advocacy is having a positive influence on young sports participants, who can now compete in the knowledge that every avenue is being pursued in their efforts against doping in sport.
The opposition is committed to seeing ASDA maintain its enviable reputation and will, therefore, be supporting this legislation. However, we do have several concerns that I wish to comment on. First, this legislation brings into effect two key objectives that were identified as part of the review of the principal act conducted in 1997. These objectives are: an increase in the flexibility of the agency in response to drug testing and procedural and policy requirements, and the continued protection of the rights of athletes to natural justice and privacy. The 1997 independent review of the principal act outlined the need for a comprehensive review of the legislation to enable ASDA to adequately meet the policy needs of international sporting federations and national sporting organisations in relation to the provision of drug testing services. However, only the test of time will tell us if the legislation provides effectively for that. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech into Hansard for the purposes of saving time.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The IOC World Conference on Drugs in Sport was held in Lausanne, in February of this year. It failed to come up with a uniform stance on the imposition of penalties for the use of performance enhancing substances.
This resulted from FIFA, the international soccer body, and the International Cycling Federation vetoing harsher penalties for the use of prohibited substances for performance enhancing purposes.
This was a very disappointing outcome, considering that the summit was pushing only for a 2-year ban.
As I have stated on numerous occasions, Australia is a world leader in anti-doping technology. The 
 key to this is a process which involves independent investigation undertaken by ASDA, separate and transparent testing of samples through the Sydney based Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, and a process of information dissemination which directly engages with the athlete.
Given Australia's hosting of the next Olympics, and our excellent international reputation for being outspoken on drugs in sport, it was both disappointing and demoralising that the Minister for Sport failed to attend the conference proceedings.
The IOC is in need of an unambiguous position on the use of drugs in sport and the Australian Government should be doing its utmost to ensure that all practicable support is provided.
The ASDA Amendment Bill  appears to be more directed towards some operational changes and the addition of new committees, rather than the comprehensive reforms which would enact the changes required for ASDA to continue to be at the forefront of antidoping agencies world wide.
What this Bill seeks to do is to move operational and other provisions currently in the principal act to subordinate legislation. This Bill will result in the establishment of an Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee, known as ASDMAC.
However it still allows the Australian Sports Drug Agency to provide services which test for the presence of substances that may affect competitors' judgement or safety.
As the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee's primary functions will be to provide expert medical advice with respect to athletes, members will have to be professional appointees.
This particular aspect of the Bill raises some concerns over the powers given to the Minister over appointments and dismissals of ASDMAC members.
While it is necessary for there to be provisions within the legislation for members of Government boards to be dismissed, Labor does have some concerns about whether this method of appointments and dismissals of ASDMAC members might become politicised.
Although this issue is `concerning' it is by no means concerning enough for the Opposition to seek amendments to this Bill.
Instead, the Opposition can only hope that the Minister will exercise these powers with due diligence and only on the most sound and serious advice to ensure that ASDMAC members are immune from the politics of sports doping.
The second concern that I wish to bring to the Senate's attention is the fact that there is no new funding allocated to ASDA to facilitate the administration of ASDMAC. 

As such, its running costs in the first year must be absorbed into ASDA's core budget.
Considering the budget cutbacks that the Coalition has imposed on Australian sporting organisations, the lack of any additional financial commitment to ASDA is disappointing.
In this situation, the Government must  ensure that the additional budgetary pressures do not compromise the other essential functions of the Agency.
We would not like to see a situation in which ASDA's ability to continue testing national and international competitors is in any way undermined because of stretched resources.
On a more positive note, what this Bill will do is establish a mechanism for the exchange of information between the Australian Customs Service and ASDA for the purposes of assisting with the Agency's testing program and activities.
The Opposition is therefore eagerly awaiting the necessary complementary customs legislation to ensure that it is both adequate and competent.
It must be noted that the Government intends to increase the level of administrative and coordination support that the Australian Customs Service provides to ASDA in relation to the illegal importation of banned sports drugs.
Given this, the Government must also address the issue of resourcing and ensure that Customs officials are provided with adequate training with respect to sports drugs.
I note that this Bill provides a legislative framework for State and Territory Governments to enact complementary legislation that will enable ASDA to undertake drug testing on State level competitors.
Whilst this is a positive step towards uniform anti-doping procedures within Australia, at both National and State levels and across most sports, it should be noted that this Bill alone will not achieve this due to a requirement for State initiated complementary legislation.
The Government must therefore ensure that it proactively encourages States to engage in a State-testing regime under ASDA.
If it is found to be cost prohibitive for States and their sporting bodies to participate, given the lack of funds available to the smaller states in particular, then the Government should provide financial support.
However, Government support for state based drug testing should not stop there.
Australian scientists from Queensland are currently leading the way in the development of the first known detection test for human growth hormones in athletes. Associate Professor Ross Cuneo and Senior Research Scientist Jennifer Wallace, along 
 with Professor Rob Baxter from the University of Sydney, are part of an international team that announced a landmark breakthrough in the fight against performance enhancing drugs in February this year.
This scientific research and its application both nationally and internationally, will go a long way to ensuring that the sporting world is free from drug cheats.
The sporting community can be more confident that the best efforts are being made to ensure that sport is safe and clean.
As revolutionary as this new technology is, it is even more impressive given the fact that the scientists have received little Government support.
Labor will support the passage of the ASDA Bill through the Senate.
Whilst the Opposition has several concerns with this legislation they are not significant enough to amend the Bill.
As such the Government should accept this as an act of good faith on behalf of the Labor Party and that the opposition will closely monitor its implementation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-11,"—This is an issue I think has all-chamber support, that is, we must do everything we possibly can to make sure that drugs do not find their way into sporting competitions in Australia. The premier weapon that we are using is the Australian Sports Drug Agency.
These amendments today are basically another step in the fight against drug taking in sport, but we do have a number of concerns. The first is in respect of the funding for the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee, which the amendments establish. We hope that annual funding is going to be automatic, that there will be a space in the budget and indeed that this will be taken up in the 1999-2000 budget, because it is imperative that the amendments do not create additional budgetary pressure on the Sports Drug Agency itself.
We welcome the continued protection of athletes rights in this legislation. As a former phys. ed. teacher I can say that I, amongst many, recognise the importance of encouraging young people—and, indeed, the not so young—to take part in sport. Australians are notorious for their interest in watching sport 
 and we can only hope that we can actually get more of them out there doing something.
It is the importance that we place on sport in this country that has given the impetus for us to really strengthen and support ASDA and to encourage them to maintain a first-class reputation in the fight against drugs in sport. But it is necessary to remain ever vigilant. The Sydney 2000 Olympics provide an ideal opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to this, to renew people's faith in the sporting ideals of fair play and success, and to ensure that is gained through hard work and training, not through any enhanced performance from drug taking.
Surveys tell us that the vast majority of athletes, of coaches and of Australians generally support what is being done. So it is very important that we do not unintentionally undermine our current drug testing regime. There will always be unscrupulous individuals out there and, unfortunately, coaches too who will take opportunities if we leave a door even slightly ajar. It is imperative that ASDA has adequate funding to enable testing to have the maximum chance of detecting drug cheats. As we watch the development of further testing for the new varieties of drugs that are appearing, it looks as if future testing is going to be even more expensive than some of the current testing regimes, particularly as we move in to try and track down some of the hormonal products being used, the blood doping, et cetera, which are very difficult at the moment for us to detect. Looking across the new range of drugs, including the human growth hormone, EPO and the growth factors, it seems they are each going to require a specific test. That, in itself, is going to lead to additional costs.
It is against this background that we are introducing these amendments today. ASDA provides government funded testing for both in and out of competition situations. There are arguments that the out of competition testing, the random testing, is the most likely to detect those people who are trying to cheat and is therefore the most cost effective. However, there needs to be an adequate level of each type of testing in the armoury of ASDA and, of course, of the national sporting organisa 
 tions to deter actual and potential drug cheats, to allow for the testing of world record performances and also for us to comply with our international obligations in this area.
One of our major concerns is that over the last 18 months there has been a move to increase the level of user pays within the government funded competition drug testing program—that is the in competition part of it. We want to put our very real concerns on the record about where we are going now. It has been made quite clear to us by a number of national sporting organisations that this move to user pays in the in competition testing is going to be detrimental to sports drug testing efforts overall. National sporting organisations which host international events are contractually bound to provide the drug testing. Now that they are bound to find the cost of half of that testing we need to look very carefully at what that is doing to the viability of holding international events in this country.
My final comments are directed at another specific area of concern the Democrats have with the legislation. The amendments provide for the formation of a foundation that will raise money for the support of the agency's research and education and information dissemination functions. The amendments provide the agency with two new functions that will enable it to `collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information about the use of drugs in sport', which will aid in its sports drug education function, and to `conduct research relating to the use of drugs in sport' and disseminate the results of that research.
We are concerned that any foundation established could threaten the independence and integrity of the agency or may well be a precursor for subsequent governments to eventually privatise the functions of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. I think it is timely here for us to remind ourselves of what ASDA's mission is. It is `to provide an independent, high quality and accessible anti-doping program to enable Australian sport to deter athletes from banned doping practices'. Indeed, the Australian Olympic Committee states that the success of ASDA has been largely due to its independence from sporting 
 organisations. It is widely recognised as being impartial and effective in fulfilling its role in testing Australian athletes without fear or favour. No sport is exempted. In summary, the Democrats do not want to see this independence threatened by inadequate funding, by the overemphasis on user pays or by the move towards a privatised agency.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1

Australia then will be well prepared for the challenges of the 2000 Olympics and beyond. I commend the bill to the House.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-03-11,"—The opposition is happy to support this non-controversial legislation as a step in the right direction on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill 1998  broadens the definition of a vehicle standard used in the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to include standards for energy saving, creates the position of Associate Administrator under the act and restores some provisions removed or affected by previous amendments.
I would like to comment extremely briefly on the first purpose of the bill which I mentioned—that is, the broadening of the definition of motor vehicle standards. It is an offence to sell or manufacture a car that does not comply with regulations made under this act. The purpose of the standard for energy saving will be to provide consumers with comparisons about fuel consumption, the idea being that making this information available will be a discipline measure on car manufacturers to reduce fuel consumption and therefore car energy consumption.
The opposition supports this measure. We support the extension of a principle already applied to many whitegoods which enables consumers to look at a product and compare an apple with an apple and determine whether in fact it is value for money or to make assessments based on energy saving. We in the opposition think this idea can in fact be taken further and that this requirement could be extended to the advertising of vehicles, as the shadow minister for transport has suggested in the other place. We believe this would help to impose further discipline on manufac 
 turers whose advertising, quite frankly, sometimes has very little to do with cars. We make this suggestion to the government as something perhaps worth thinking about.
Cars are the major culprit for transport industry greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. While transport is responsible for less than one-fifth of the greenhouse gas emissions, it is clear that we must address the problem and this is, as far as the opposition is concerned, another step in doing that. In conclusion, I wish to restate the opposition's support for the bill and particularly the initiative on fuel consumption labelling.",SENATE,<title>MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-11,"—The National Measurement Amendment (Utility Meters) Bill 1998  is intended to provide mandatory requirements for specified utility meters as recommended by the Review of Australia's Standards and Conformance Infrastructure—the Kean review.
The bill provides for mandatory pattern approval of meter designs to ensure conformance to acceptable standards and the verification of production meters to ensure that each meter conforms to the pattern and operates within the permissible error range. It also provides an auditing scheme for these verified meters. 
In addition, the bill creates an enforcement regime, with provisions dealing with the appointment of authorised officers and powers and obligations of those particular officers. It also includes warrant issuing provisions and search and seizure powers.
The bill addresses a number of longstanding consumer concerns about the accuracy and the quality of water, electricity and gas meters. We believe this is becoming more and more important as we witness the continuing privatisation of utilities by states and territories. Deregulation of utilities by governments also makes the external supervision of utility metering quite desirable.
The bill is also intended to provide conformity in the utility meter market nationally. These goals, of course, we consider in line with the Democrats' concerns regarding consumer affairs and trade policy. However, the bill provides only for testing and approval at the time of manufacture. By agreement, filled re-verification of meters will still be a matter for utility authorities. The Commonwealth, of course, has constitutional power over weights and measures.
There are slight increases in costs to both the utility meter manufacturers and to the National Standards Commission, which will coordinate this new system. However, there is one concern which I will address briefly—that is, the increasing moves to give law enforcement powers to organisations outside traditional law enforcement structures.
In this piece of legislation, division 5 provides enforcement and monitoring powers. Certainly, I and my colleagues remain a little curious as to why these powers need to be elaborated in bills such as this, resulting in almost a proliferation of law enforcement mechanisms. It would seem far more reasonable not to slip extra implementations through in otherwise non-controversial legislation.
The powers themselves are not particularly controversial. I guess in many respects they are similar in many ways to those provided in the area of taxation. The Democrats have weighed up this case. We consider they are appropriate in this circumstance, but we certainly want to put on record our concerns about the proliferation of such power.
I also wish to add a reminder that we will monitor the use of these powers and will move to amend them if we detect any abuse. In the case of this bill, our concerns are outweighed by the improvements for consumers and better regulation of the national and international market for utility meters.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT (UTILITY METERS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-11,"—They say things are often slow in politics. This bill came out of the recommendations of the Kean review, a review I established and commissioned in 1994-95 when I was the minister responsible for the National Standards Commission and metrology policy for the Australian government.
While I was minister it became clear to me, after advice from a lot of industry groups, that Australian industry was being penalised by the lack of a national measurement or metrology policy. We have discovered that, despite the Constitution giving the federal government power over weights and measures, it being clearly a federal responsibility, most issues dealing with weights and measures, or measurement and standards issues, were left to be dealt with by the states. As a result, Australia has penalised itself consistently throughout this century by not adopting national legislation on measurement, standards or the use of metrology—an obscure word which often some people think means meteorology. Metrology is the word to describe the whole policy in this area.
I congratulate Bruce Kean, a former chief executive of the Boral company, for the enthusiastic way he and his committee, over a period of nearly 18 months, conducted the inquiry and made extensive recommendations. I am pleased to say that, after the change of government, the new government basically accepted the thrust of the major recommendations. This legislation is a result of one of those recommendations in the Kean report:
The National Measurement Act be amended to provide for mandatory requirements for specified utility meters and legal measuring instruments and that these requirements be based on those adopted by the International Organisation of Legal Metrology.
This is one of the recommendations and I hope that the minister responsible, Senator 
 Minchin, is able to implement the rest of the recommendations of the Kean report in a speedy and timely manner.
We do need to have a national metrology policy run by the Australian government. We should not leave it to the states, either by accident or design, because we will not get the benefits of having the efficiency for manufacturers, industry and consumers of national standards for measurement in this country in all their variations.
The Kean report found that metrology impacts on the Australian economy in respect of goods and services traded and measured by instruments to the tune of around $140 billion every year. That just shows you the size of the problem and shows that, if you do not have an efficient metrology policy, you will not end up having efficient industry. You will make yourself less competitive internationally.
I note that there was some controversy. Some states dislike giving up weights and measures and handing them over to the federal government because state ministers for consumer affairs believe that they ought to be running those arrangements. In the long term all of those issues should be transferred to the federal government, as the Constitution requires. Weights and measures are in the federal Constitution as a federal responsibility. There can be no argument, and not even the most fervent states righter I ever came across disagreed with the view that, if the federal government chose to take full control of weights and measures, those powers and activities would be transferred to the federal government.
This is a matter of economic efficiency for the country, for industry, so that you do not end up with six states and two territories having different standards on measurements and so that when an industry is trying to find a measuring instrument it does not have to design it eight different ways to account for state and territory differences. We found that every year in Australia literally tens of thousands of utility meters have to be produced, and each state had a different standard. This meant that even the manufacturers—and I think Email was one of them—complained that, if they could have one standard for 
 utility meters for the whole of Australia, they would then be able to make them competitively and actually export them.
It seemed to me the case was incontrovertible; there could be no argument. But you could not imagine the stupidity of some people who argued state rights on this, to the detriment of our Australian industry. The second reading speech and those of other speakers, including that of my colleague Martyn Evans, the shadow science minister, made that point.
Now that we are moving into privatised electricity and water services and there is competition and you have different companies competing to provide the service, it is absolutely essential that everybody has trust that the meter which measures the electricity or the water being provided is absolutely accurate. Evidence was given to the Kean review that some of these utility meters were up to 40 per cent out in their accuracy in measuring the amount of water or the amount of electricity, particularly water. As Senator Stott Despoja said, this is a consumer issue. It is also an industry issue. I am delighted that, although it has been 4½ years since the Kean report came down, the government has put this legislation through the parliament.
I conclude by saying that the opposition has great pleasure in supporting the legislation. It came from an initiative we started in government. All I can say is that I hope that the minister responsible for metrology policy, who I believe is Senator Minchin, gets on with checking that all the rest of the recommendations of the Kean review are being implemented, to the benefit of Australian industry and Australian consumers.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL MEASUREMENT AMENDMENT (UTILITY METERS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-11,"—In commencing my contribution on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1998 and the General Interest Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998 , I would indicate that the Labor opposition will be supporting this legislation, which amounts to the fifth omnibus tax bill for 1998. It covers areas relating to reforming the tax penalty arrangements, the alteration of aligned remittance dates, the introduction of running balance accounts and tax avoidance—foreign tax credit schemes.
The first three proposals are all related, as together they allow a significant streamlining and simplification of the administration and compliance—and I will have a little more to say about the administration and compliance—with taxpayer, and especially employer, obligations under taxation law. The tax office will, as a result of this legislation, become more efficient and effective in collecting outstanding tax debts, and tax compliance will be much simpler for employers.
While these initiatives are being undertaken in the preparation for the introduction of the goods and services tax—and I stress that there is no doubt that one of the central tenets of this legislation is the preparation of the introduction of the goods and services tax—they are, in their own right, significant and worthy. Therefore, the opposition supports them. These initiatives, Labor believes, prove the election position that Labor took, that significant administrative and compliance simplification is possible without a goods and services tax.
On the issue of compliance and administrative issues relating to the wholesale sales tax that is being replaced by a goods and services tax, Labor observes that what is known as the ANTS document, the government's tax propo 
 sals, on page 8, says that the current tax system is ineffective and provides a crumbling base from which to deliver the necessary revenue to fund essential government services. It goes on to say that the indirect tax base would continue to decline, rates would need to be increased again, and this debilitating cycle would continue.
There is a range of mantras that have been uttered, assertions made, by the government—the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer—the head of Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, and a range of other people who have put submissions to, for example, the select committee considering Australia's new tax system, that the tax system is broken. That is an assertion that Labor strongly rejects, at least in the context of the wholesale sales tax.
Let us look at the ANTS document. It is interesting that the revenue measures table in relation to the wholesale sales tax abolition, which appears on page 33, in part proves our case. The estimated loss of revenue as a result of the GST replacing the WST—in part, at least, in the name of administrative efficiency—in 2000-01 is $15.3 billion; in 2001-02, $17.75 billion; and in 2002-03, $18.75 billion. In other words, the revenue that is being forgone as a result of the replacement of the WST by the GST is increasing. What is interesting also in the ANTS document is that there is no data or analysis in respect of the continual assertions made that the revenue from the WST is collapsing or has collapsed.
It is interesting in this context to look at the definition of the words `broke' and `broken' in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. The word `broke' is defined as `without money, penniless, ruined, bankrupt'. In respect of `broken', the definition is `financially ruined, bankrupt'. I think in the context of the current policy debate about tax reform, those definitions in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary would be in accord with the common understanding in the general community of the meaning of the words `broke' and `broken'.
It is also interesting to note that, in the recent modelling that was provided to the Senate select committee from two sources, Professor Dixon and Professor Murphy, certainly Professor Dixon seriously questioned 
 the assertions that are made that the revenue from the wholesale sales tax is declining. He provided long-run estimates of the impact of retaining the current tax system, particularly the wholesale sales tax system. I will speak more about that on another occasion.
I want to conclude my remarks by pointing to a recent press release put out on 4 February 1999 by the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr John Fahey. Again, this relates to the issue of the revenue being generated from the current tax system, and I refer here to the Commonwealth government's statement of financial transactions—CFT—of December 1998. In this press release, I think Minister Fahey quite rightly and proudly points to revenue collections for the cumulative six months to December 1998-99 compared with the revenue collections for the six-month period up to 1997-98. He indicates that total revenue collections were up 10.3 per cent.
It is more interesting to look at the breakdown of revenue collections for that six-month period. As I said earlier, we have had the continual assertion that the wholesale sales tax system is broke or broken. What do we see in the revenue collections put out in this press release? The collections of the wholesale sales tax in that six-month period went up—and I stress `went up'—by some 9.1 per cent over the previous six months. That is hardly evidence that the wholesale sales tax system, at least in terms of revenue collection, is broke or broken.
What was even more interesting was that, on the same day that Minister Fahey put out this press release—I do not know the location—the Treasurer, Mr Costello, was continuing to assert in public statements that the tax system was broken. I think his words were that anyone who asserted the tax system was not broken must be living on another planet. I do not know what planet Mr Fahey was on that day. On the one hand, you had Mr Fahey boasting about the increase in revenue collections—including an increase in wholesale sales tax collection of 9.1 per cent—and on the same day, you had the Treasurer, Mr Costello, continuing to assert that the tax system is broke or broken.
I also do not know what planet this government is on because they continue—and there are a range of other materials that we will refer to at another time—to tell us that the wholesale sales tax system is broke or broken, when clearly in terms of revenue collection it is not. We had a 9.1 per cent increase in revenue collection of wholesale sales tax and there is a range of other evidence on this issue. As I say, we will be referring to it at another time.
To conclude my remarks, I reiterate that the Labor opposition does support this omnibus tax bill, even though, certainly in our view, it is being presented, at least in part, in preparation for the introduction of the GST. The reforms in their own right are significant and worthy and are indicative of the approach to taxation reform that the Labor opposition took to the last election. We believe they should be supported for that reason but certainly not on the basis of the continually misleading claims that are made about the current status of the tax system in this country.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1

I also have some additional information to a question I took from Senator Jacinta Collins a while ago. I apologise for it being late. I seek leave to have the answers incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—
QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE—9 March 1999
Naval Ammunition Facility: Twofold Bay, New South Wales
Senator BROWN:  My question goes to the minister representing the Minister for Defence. Firstly as a preamble, the naval armaments complex has moved out of Sydney following a decision in 1994 that that would happen by the Olympic year for reasons of safety. Port Wilson in Victoria was chosen with Port Alma near Rockhampton chosen as an option. Twofold Bay at Eden was dismissed for reasons of public safety and cost. Has the government now decided to go ahead with part of that complex at Twofold Bay? If so, is there to be a waiver on public safety due to this facility being so close to town and people in that region? Can the Minister say what public consultations have been undertaken and how much the public, including 
 local residents, have been taken into account in making this decision?
Supplementary Question: If this project is to go ahead, is the 700 metre jetty to be built at East Twofold Bay to be in part funded by $8 million of Commonwealth and State money otherwise earmarked for restructuring the forest industry, on the basis that there will be whole-log; exports off this wharf when it is not being used for Navy purposes without downstream processing of those logs, as was the aim of the Regional Forest Agreement?
Senator NEWMAN:  On 9 March 1999, I answered part of Senator Brown's question and undertook to provide additional information, where it was available, from the Minister for Defence.
It have subsequently been advised by the Minister for Defence that feasibility studies on a proposed Navy Ammunitioning Facility at Twofold Bay were conducted by Defence in the latter half of 1998. These studies indicated that the facility could be constructed to comply with the NATO storage and safeguarding requirements without the need of a Public Risk Waiver.
Defence has consulted widely with all stakeholders in the Twofold Bay area including State and Local government bodies, commercial/business interests and the Eden Aboriginal Land Council. Since the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works' public hearing in April 1998, Defence conducted public and private briefings in August 1998 and February 1999. Notification of these briefings was provided in the local newspaper and they were well attended by the local community.
Defence intends to continue to brief all stakeholders on the proposal as it is developed for referral to Parliament during late 1999.
The proposal will also be subject to environmental assessment and stakeholders, community and interested parties will have the opportunity to comment in the normal way.
Defence will completely fund the development of the Navy Ammunitioning, facility.
QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE OF 10 DECEMBER 1998 FROM SENATOR JACINTA COLLINS ON CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY STAFF IDENTIFICATION POLICY
On 10 December 1998, Senator Collins asked the following question without notice:
""Is the minister aware that, notwithstanding the assurances she gave the Senate yesterday, Child Support Agency senior management personnel have only recently told staff not to be `paranoid' about their personal safety concerns about having to disclose their names to disgruntled clients? Is the minister aware that Child Support Agency staff are 
 still being told by senior management that they are in fact still obliged to provide their full name to clients and will be sacked if they do not? How does the minister explain this inconsistency between the supposed guidelines she referred to yesterday and what is actually going on in the agency?""
The answer is:
I am informed that it is not true that senior management personnel of the Child Support agency were telling staff ""not to be `paranoid' about their personal safety concerns about having to disclose their full names to disgruntled clients"". I am further informed that senior CSA management were not telling staff that they ""are in fact still obliged to give their full name to clients and will be sacked if they do not"".
As I previously indicated in my answer to Senator Collins' question without notice of 3 December 1998 (which I tabled on 9 December 1998), while the CSA encourages its staff to give their full names to clients, it acknowledges that this is an issue for some staff. Staff are not required to provide their personal details. The only requirement is for them to provide, as a minimum, their first name, site location and the 131 272 number as a contact number.
In my answer, I also pointed out that the CSA's Staff Identification Policy and Guidelines provide for the use of alternative forms of identification on occasions when a staff member has a genuinely held concern that their full name could compromise their safety. I am assured that these guidelines are readily available to all CSA staff.

That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services (Senator Ian Macdonald), no later than 5 pm on Thursday, 11 March 1999, the following document:  

The Hawke report on the structural review of Airservices Australia which was given to the Minister for Transport (Mr Anderson).
Madam President, Dr Hawke is the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Regional Services. I am advised by the Department of Transport and Regional Services that there is no document that is correctly described as the `Hawke report on the structural review of Airservices Australia.'
Consultation with Senator Woodley's office has established that the document that is the intended subject matter of the order is a report completed by the then Department of Transport of Regional Development in March 1998. The former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, instructed the then Department of Transport and Regional Development to prepare the document for the purposes of cabinet deliberation.
It is a document that has underpinned confidential cabinet deliberations and relates to a subject that is still under government consideration.

I indicate from the opposition's perspective that we do not accept the reason given by the government that it was prepared in terms of a cabinet deliberation that is still under 
 consideration. We also will not accept the same explanation when we are sure that it will be provided in relation to the report that we will be seeking in the next sitting week, which is the Hawke report into the reviews, roles and responsibilities of CASA, BASI and Airservices Australia.
To reiterate some comments I made this morning, half of the problem with what is going on with regard to air safety at the moment is the shroud of secrecy that is surrounding it. I do not think the government's inactivity in relation to the tabling of these requested reports is helping one iota.

That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bolkus today, relating to uranium mining.
Today we had it confirmed that the government is becoming more and more desperate in respect of its case and its positioning on the proposed mine at Kakadu. On 29 January this year the minister wrote to the World Heritage Committee on this issue. Let us make no mistake about what the minister and the government asked the World Heritage Committee to do. They have asked for an unravelling of the convention. In essence they want to replace the independent existing mechanisms for review with their own judges. They have sought to nobble the jury of judges who will make a decision in respect of Kakadu. In doing so they reflect their desperation on the issue and in doing so they seek to undermine the convention and its mechanisms in total.
The minister wrote on 29 January to ICOMOS in Paris. In his letter he contested the view that there should be any concern with respect to mining at Kakadu, contrary of course to expert advice domestically and 
 internationally. He went on to ask the IUCN, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, and the International Council on Monuments and Sites to rule themselves out from their traditional, accepted, legal role as independent arbiters in the system, a role that has been accepted by the world community for decades, a role that has been accepted by Australia for decades.
This minister, on behalf of this government, seeks to replace those internationally respected institutions and to choose his own judges, to choose his own expert panel. The request essentially was that this government was prepared to nominate alternative mechanisms to the ones listed in the convention that are listed and accepted by the world community. What did the minister write? He wrote to this internationally respected body and said, `We have a list of suitable experts. We have our own list of suitable experts to replace yours, to replace the world's, to replace those institutions that have conducted this role, performed this function and been accepted to perform this function for as long as the convention has been in place.' What did the minister ask the committee to allow these hand-picked experts of the Australian government's nomination to do? He asked them to undertake a review of Australia's submission. Fancy trying to get away with something as rich as this, Senator Hill.
—Address the chair please, Senator Bolkus.
—You want to replace the institutions enshrined in the convention. You do not want them to make an assessment on your position because you do not like what they are saying. What do you want to do with them? You want to replace them with your own hand-picked nominees. Not only is this rich, it reflects the depths of despair of this government and it reflects the degree of sleazy international deals that this government wants to indulge in. We saw great evidence of that just a few weeks ago when the parliament was confronted with a document from within Senator Hill's own department. That document basically detailed the international lobbying exercise that the government was prepared to embark upon. We see it again 
 today—no respect for the institutions, no respect for the mechanisms, but at the same time subverting the internationally accepted convention and its processes.
What we have on view for the rest of the world to see is a minister who does not accept the umpire's ruling, a minister who is prepared to indulge in personal attacks on those individuals who are part of the international structure, a government prepared to denigrate the independent status of ICOMOS and IUCN and a government that wants to pick its own umpires. You cannot get away with nobbling the court of world opinion.
This is made more disgraceful by the fact that we are talking here about a government not being prepared to protect a world heritage area. Senator Hill says there has been mining going on there for 18 years, but he knows full well that the nature of the location and the dimensions of what is being proposed here are different from what has been going on there for quite some time.
—This new one is a little mine.
—You know the impact on the cultural sites and the impact on the environment. You know what you are talking about here is an abdication of responsibility on your part as well because you have watered down those 77 conditions that your department urged you to accept, and that is also known by the world community. I regret that we have had to do this today, but once again we see a government that is not prepared to meet its international and national responsibilities. Unfortunately, I think this minister has been caught in a hot spot in respect of it.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-03-11,"—That was a pitiful contribution from Senator Bolkus. At least he could have put a bit of heart into it. I know it is Thursday and honourable senators are looking forward to going home, but at least some enthusiasm for the task demonstrated in taking note of answers given during question time would have been of help. However, I do understand the embarrassment of the ALP in relation to this matter.
—Embarrassment?
—Embarrassment of the ALP. For 13 years the Labor Party was in government in this country and for 13 years the huge Ranger uranium mine operated in the vicinity of the Kakadu National Park.
—If you don't know the difference, you ought to resign.
—I do know the difference, Senator Bolkus. An open-cut mine with all the processing involved operated for 13 years. How often did the Labor Party say that that mine threatened the world heritage values of Kakadu? How often? Not once. They said that mine could be operated in a way that is compatible with the world heritage values. But out of government a new mine is proposed, a much smaller mine—22 hectares is all that the footprint is, Senator Bolkus—without processing, because it is proposed that processing be done at Ranger. It is an underground mine with technology that is 20 years more advanced than Ranger and suddenly up pops Senator Bolkus saying, `This is a threat to the whole of the Kakadu National Park'—that huge national park, one of the largest in the world. Senator Bolkus says that this 22-hectare footprint is a threat to Kakadu and that the whole of the world heritage area should be put on the endangered list. What a joke!
The Jabiluka mine is not even in the world heritage area. Senator Bolkus, in an appalling bit of diplomacy, instead of playing the political game within Australia, decided he would write to the international body to condemn the Australian government. He did not have the nerve to come into this place to attack this government. He did not even put out a press release when he issued this letter. In the dead of night he wrote to the World Heritage Committee.
—On a point of order, Deputy President: as the minister knows full well, we actually circulated the letter very widely and that is how he got a copy of it. If he wants to keep on misleading and misrepresenting the opposition's position, he can do that and I will seek leave to correct the record. But the minister ought to get back to the issue and he ought to become relevant.
—Order! Senator Bolkus, there is no point of order.
—He did not put out the letter widely; we got it from Kyoto. He put it out in the dead of night. He believed that he could undermine the position of the Australian government by going to this overseas body rather than by coming in here and taking us on publicly. Why wouldn't he take us on publicly? Because it is so embarrassing to the ALP after supporting the Ranger mine for 13 years in office.
It is true that we are concerned about the integrity of the world heritage system. We do believe that this mission that was sent to Australia has undermined the integrity of that system. Did that mission look at the three years of detailed assessment that had taken place under Australian law in relation to the Jabiluka mine? Did it look at the 77 conditions that were attached to it? Of course it did not. It prejudged the issue largely on the basis of wanting to expand the international law in relation to what the chairman referred to as living culture.
In fact, a majority of the committee were not even of the view of the purport of the final recommendations. So, between the draft recommendations and the final recommendations, the chairman, who was an international lawyer, got his way and had the opportunity to present the argument in Kyoto that this whole park should be put on the endangered list. The only redeeming feature was that at least the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto said that the Australian view should be heard and deferred the matter for six months for further consideration. In the meantime, Australia is preparing the extra assessments that will be necessary for presentation in June.
All we ask for is an objective and fair hearing because on any objective and fair hearing what will be taken into account will be the views of the Supervising Scientist, the Australian government authority, which has supervised the Ranger mine for the last 18 years and has demonstrated that you can conduct uranium mining in the vicinity of that world heritage area without any environmental damage at all. It will give us the opportunity to properly put before the committee the 
 three years of assessment that took place in relation to the Jabiluka prospect. Provided that we get a fair and objective hearing when this is reconsidered in Paris in June, there is no doubt that this park will not be put on the endangered list.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-03-11,"—It is typical that all the Minister for the Environment and Heritage can do is attack the opposition over Ranger but, whether the minister likes it or not, the mining of uranium at Jabiluka has now become a matter of great international importance. Here in Australia the issue is not just about the environmental consequences of putting a mine in the heart of Kakadu National Park and a world heritage area but also about our relations with indigenous traditional owners of this country generally and the Mirrar people in particular, who do not want to see this mine on their land. It is also about the integrity of the World Heritage Bureau and of ICOMOS.
It is also about a huge amount of taxpayers' money being squandered on defending the indefensible on the world stage, and over the past week this issue has also become one of accountability and the ability of the Senate to scrutinise the actions of the executive. A great deal is at risk here, all for the sake of a uranium mine which even the miners are getting less and less interested in pursuing.
Uranium is in plentiful supply, and there must be easier ways of making a living than picking a fight with the majority of Australians, who do not want Jabiluka to go ahead. This is all for the sake of a nuclear industry which is also on the decline, which cannot deal with its dangerous waste and which is already pointing the finger at Australia as a potential dumping ground for that waste.
On Monday this week, the parliament asked that all government documents from October last year relating to Jabiluka be tabled in the Senate. Senator Hill tabled 44 documents and a tabling statement in which he said he was:
. . . not tabling certain documents dealing with Australia's relations with other members of the World Heritage Committee and certain internal advice provided to me by my portfolio. The release of such documents could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the international relations of the Commonwealth, or they are internal working docu 
 ments the release of which would be contrary to the public interest, or they are subject to legal professional privilege.
Of course, the minister and perhaps senior bureaucrats in this department who have determined that this is the case are effectively shutting the Senate out of any reasonable access to the documents. They are documents which, I might say, are crucial to understanding whether or not the government is using inappropriate and nasty tactics and wasting $1 million of taxpayers' money in supporting this mine, interfering with ICOMOS and, in stopping the World Heritage Bureau, putting Kakadu on the endangered list.
So that we might be in a better position to judge Senator Hill's assertions, I asked the minister on Tuesday to provide a full list of documents which were withheld, together with a short description and his grounds for refusing to hand them over. He provided that list yesterday, a very short list of 13 documents. Of course, these were not all the documents, only the ones the department had put forward. It would be impossible to determine whether the withholding of documents is justified from these descriptions, even if we accept that the stated reasons are proper grounds for the secrecy.
Very significantly, the minister dropped as one of his original reasons for refusal the ground of legal professional privilege. Perhaps he had to drop this excuse because, in the meantime, he had professional legal advice on the matter. Advice from the Clerk of the Senate to the Democrats would suggest that this was indeed a wise move on the part of the minister. That advice stated:
The mere fact that documents are the subject of legal professional privilege is not a ground in itself for their non-production; usually the claim rests on apprehended prejudice to parties in potential litigation. The cost of searching for supporting documentation may be outweighed by the public interest in the matter concerned.
It is clear that the minister provided his grounds for not complying with the Senate's order and then he changed the grounds, without explanation, to other grounds. This would suggest to us that the grounds are, and always were, a construct—if the grounds do not turn out to be legitimate, change them to 
 some which might be. There is no way that shifting grounds should be accepted by the parliament, in my view, a parliament which prides itself on its ability to scrutinise the workings of the executive.
But, leaving aside questions of what are and what are not proper grounds for refusal to disclose, the question that remains is: how do we know the minister is telling the truth? Yesterday I offered the minister a compromise: appoint an independent person acceptable to both sides of parliament to examine the documents and verify or otherwise the legitimacy of those claims. It is only then that we will know what level of interference there is in ICOMOS and whether this government is really sending bureaucrats around the world with the truth and the facts—as the minister so often likes to say—or whether this is an exercise in inappropriate and subversive pressure on member countries.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1999-03-11,"—It is interesting to see that Senator Bolkus has to rely on the Democrats, and whoever might come after them, to support his taking note of answers debate today in the Senate, rather than his Labor colleagues. There is obviously a good reason for that and the reason is that when you look at the facts—
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I draw your attention to the standing orders that require senators to be truthful in their responses. In the Procedure Committee last night, there was a discussion about ensuring that the Democrats and the Greens were provided with an opportunity during the period of taking note to give their views, and that is what is happening today. The proposition that Senator Chapman has put is totally factually incorrect.
—There is no point of order.
—Madam Deputy President, if you believe that, you will believe anything. This debate is about the World Heritage Committee report on Kakadu and the proposed new mining venture which will operate there. The World Heritage Committee came here and visited for a few days and then went away and made a negative report about 
 the proposed Jabiluka mine. I prefer to put my faith in the report of the Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling, which did not spend just a few days examining Kakadu and the Ranger mine and the issues surrounding uranium mining in the Northern Territory but in fact spent a year investigating uranium mining in Australia. A major part of that inquiry was the Ranger mine, the Jabiluka mine, and its impact on the Northern Territory and environmental matters.
I want to quote from the committee report, but I should add, in light of Senator Bolkus's speech to take note of answers, that the report was supported not just by government senators but by the two Labor Party senators who were members of that committee. The committee produced an excellent report, notwithstanding attempts by the Democrats and the Greens to frustrate the outcome of that report. The report stated:
The Committee has concluded that the principal finding of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry [the Fox Report] has been vindicated by two decades' experience. Fox stated that:
The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium mines.
Further, the committee found:
This major finding of the Fox Report remains valid as the foundation for policy on the mining and milling of uranium in Australia.
We found that, on the basis of the evidence received by the committee, the uranium mining and milling industry will be sufficiently viable financially to be able to meet its environmental health, safety and security responsibilities fully.
As I said, that report was written after a year's inquiry—not just after a few days, as we have experienced with the world heritage report. They came here, had a quick look and then went off and wrote a negative report on uranium mining in Australia. Our committee report was based not only on the submissions we received and the public hearings we conducted but on the detailed research which the committee undertook and which added to the store of knowledge on uranium mining in Australia. On the basis of that, there can be no validity in the opposition to uranium 
 mining in Kakadu which has been put forward by the world heritage report.
It is worth noting the environmental impact of uranium mining at the Ranger operation. Evidence provided to the committee by the then Supervising Scientist, Barry Carbon, was that:
There has been no deleterious effect on the local river system from activities at Ranger.
He also said:
The Ranger tailings storage system has operated satisfactorily in containing the tailings, and it has caused no environmental degradation.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Seepage from the tailings dam was overestimated by the Fox inquiry, as were the transport of heavy metals in groundwater and the environmentally vitiating effects of seepage. No environmental effects are observable. A management regime was able to be developed to allow performance well within the expectations outlined by the inquiry.
In other words, the Fox inquiry expected there might be some minor environmental damage caused by Ranger, but even that was not realised. There has been no environmental damage arising from the activities of that mine whatsoever.
Yet we now have a further mine proposed, the Jabiluka mine, which is an underground mine—compared with the surface mine of Ranger—and which will have even less capacity to cause damage than the Ranger mine. So there is absolutely no case for banning mining in this particular project. There is absolutely no danger posed to the environment. The work of the World Heritage Committee is extremely questionable on that basis and on the basis of the work that has just been done by that committee.
Australia has the most regulated and controlled uranium mining of any country in the world. It is the safest and surest in terms of environmental impact and in terms of meeting our national obligations. No case can be made against it.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-11,"—It is interesting to follow Senator Chapman because I was on that same committee, and the Greens and the Democrats did indeed find a lot to be concerned about in relation to the outcomes. We did write dis 
 senting reports, and the dissenting reports make a much better read than the majority report. They were actually put together much better.
I would like to read from the proceedings of the World Heritage Committee at Kyoto last year, just to put in context what the minister has been saying and what the opposition have been saying about the government's endless attempts to frustrate the reports of this bureau. The proceedings read:
The Chairperson outlined a brief chronology concerning the preparation of the report. He noted that the mission was originally scheduled for 4 to 10 October 1998, had been indefinitely postponed by the Minister for the Environment, Australia—
that is Senator Hill—
in September and then rescheduled for 26 October to 1 November 1998. He noted that the first draft of the report was prepared on 1 November 1998, the second on 16 November and the final comments were received on 23 November and were immediately incorporated and the final report sent to the Australian authorities on 24 November. He informed the Bureau that the Terms of Reference had foreseen the preparation of a report over a period of a full month but that this had not been possible because of the postponement of the mission.
What we are hearing here is that the government of Australia, who knew well what the deadlines were for the reporting of this report, made a complaint to this chamber that they had not been given enough time to look at the report before it was released. The reading of the proceedings in Kyoto will tell you that the issue was not an unwillingness by the bureau to share their information but that they were put into an almost impossible position by this government and this minister. The document goes on:
The Chairperson informed the Bureau that he had received a request from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in Australia dated 24 November 1998 that `the item be withdrawn from the agenda of the Bureau and Committee'.
So here we have it: the idea of postponing, indefinite delay, stop them from coming, blah blah, was basically to stop them from giving a report. How dare this minister come into this chamber and talk about his complaints about the bureau when he did everything he 
 could to make it almost impossible for them to report. I will continue the quote:
His request refers to the lateness of receipt of the report which he regarded as making it now `physically impossible for the Australian Government to read and reach a considered view on the report' prior to the Bureau and Committee sessions.
The Chairperson referred to his reply to the Minister's letter in which he stated `it is imperative that the mission fulfils its mandate by presenting the Bureau with the report which was requested last June'.
The chairperson noted that the mission had met the minister and the Secretary to Environment Australia in Canberra briefings and the document goes on:
. . . he had also reminded Senator Hill that he himself had asked for the delay in the mission being fielded and noted `this certainly made the preparation of the report much more difficult time-wise . . . '
All of this was put to the bureau. The members of the bureau considered the evidence they had seen. They considered the urgency of the issue in relation to the threat to the world heritage values of Kakadu. Given that a representative from Australia was given the right to speak at this time, to put the case of the Australian government to stall the whole process and take it off the agenda, all in all, the members carefully considered the situation and decided that they needed to hear the report.
The actions of the Australian government have been shameful on this issue. I hope that the world community will continue to put appropriate pressure on the Australian government to remove its proverbial digit and to make sure that it sees that the issues of world heritage—at the very least—have to be taken seriously and it can no longer fiddle, fool and sham on this matter.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-03-11,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Defence on progress on the implementation of the Defence Reform Program and I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Today I wish to inform the House of progress to date on implementation of the Defence Reform Program.
One of the central priorities of the Government since its election to office in 1996 has been to maintain the real value of the Defence Budget.
That commitment continues.
But the Government has always realised that even more needs to be done.
We believe we have an obligation to ensure that the resources allocated to Defence are well managed and properly focused on the delivery of defence capability.
It was for this reason that the Government announced the Defence Efficiency Review in October 1996. The Review confirmed the pressing need for major structural reform to refocus the Defence organisation on to its core obligation of providing combat capability.
The Government's view was that there was a real requirement to improve the readiness of the Australian Defence Force and its capacity to respond to more current needs.
The Defence Reform Program, which was announced in April 1997, was designed to remedy the shortcomings identified by the Defence Efficiency Review.
The Defence Reform Program is an extensive and ambitious program of major cultural and management change across all parts of Defence.
Its end objective is to improve the readiness of the ADF and to provide an increased range of options to respond to current and emerging developments.
There is no doubt the need for these reforms is very real. The scale is very challenging.
As the new Minister for Defence, I have been very pleased to see the strong and widespread commitment within Defence to meet this challenge.
It is important to recall the key objectives of the Defence Reform Program. The objectives are:
.	 Firstly, to maximise the focus of the Defence organisation and its resources on the achievement of the Defence Mission, that is ""to prevent or defeat the use of armed force against Australia and its interests"".
.	 Secondly, to have a Defence organisation organised for war and adapted for peace with a clear command and management structure and better long term planning and decision making.
.	 Thirdly, to increase the efficiency of support and administrative functions. 

.	 Finally and most importantly, to maximise the resources available to sustain and enhance the Defence Force's operational capabilities.
At maturity, the Program will make available up to $1 billion per annum as well as some $500 million in one-off gains from asset sales and inventory reductions.
Most importantly, all these funds are earmarked for re-investment in combat capability and operational readiness.
As a result of the Program, a greater proportion of the Defence Force will be employed directly in combat and combat support roles.
As we adjust the size and structure of our permanent forces, we expect the proportion of our full time personnel in combat and combat related roles to rise to 65% by early next century.
This will mean that the ADF will have 32,500 personnel in combat and combat support units out of a total full time force of 50,000—an historically high proportion.
A key objective of the Program has been to make substantial additional funds available for investment in important aspects of the Defence Force's operational capability and levels of preparedness. I am able to report to the House today significant progress in achieving this objective.
By the end of this financial year, more than $280 million per annum in continuing efficiency gains will have been achieved. This is $30 million more than originally planned. In addition, one-off gains of $52 million have already been realised from asset sales.
As a result of this success, an additional $271 million has been allocated this year for investment in capability and operational readiness improvements. The balance of the available funds has been used to meet one-off transition costs relating to personnel entitlements and the Commercial Support Program.
This year the Army has been allocated $43 million to fund an additional 1,000 regular personnel in infantry, special forces and combat support roles.
Amphibious transport capability is being strengthened. This year, $39 million has been allocated to retain HMAS Tobruk in service and to provide funds for modifications to the large landing ships HMAS Kanimbla and Manoora.
Other Naval capabilities are also being enhanced. $66 million is being spent on additional costs associated with the introduction into service and operation of the new ANZAC frigates and their helicopters as well as for the new coastal minehunters.
Long standing shortfalls in logistic support for existing capabilities are being remedied. $104 
 million has been made available for ammunition for training purposes, combat clothing, new combat rations and increased funding for spares and maintenance for frigates, patrol boats and Air Force and Navy aircraft.
I am pleased to announce that as part of the initial benefits of the Defence Reform Program, we are now in a position where the resources already available to Defence can support an increase in the level of preparedness of a range of land force units and supporting air and naval elements.
In line with the Government's overall priorities for Defence, we have decided that additional force elements up to the equivalent of a second brigade sized group, with supporting air and naval units are to be brought to the same degree of readiness as the Ready Deployment Force in Townsville.
Defence planning has commenced with the aim of achieving this objective by 30 June this year.
This will mean that by June 1999 we will have forces of up to two brigade or task force size groups, with associated naval and air elements which can be ready to be deployed in 28 days.
This is the first occasion in over two decades that Australia has had the equivalent of two brigades at this level of readiness.
The Government believes it is important to have the maximum flexibility and the options necessary to respond to contingencies at short notice. Such measures are both prudent and appropriate.
Australia has recently faced a number of contingencies, including responding to Iraq's refusal to comply with UN requirements to destroy its chemical and biological weapons capability, peace-monitoring in Bougainville, disaster relief in Papua New Guinea and drought relief in Irian Jaya.
Further contingencies could arise in our region, including in East Timor.
In relation to East Timor, the Government's position remains that the Indonesian Government and the East Timorese have the primary responsibility to agree on an orderly and peaceful transition whether it be to autonomy or independence. Such an outcome would reduce potential peacekeeping needs.
Let me make it clear that the Government believes that it is premature to make any decision about ADF involvement in any peacekeeping role in East Timor at this stage.
The Government's responsibility, and our intention, is to be in a position to be able to respond effectively to a considerable range of possibilities.
In the light of the range of contingencies facing us, it is only prudent to ensure that appropriate planning and readiness steps are put into place. The 
 Defence Reform Program has strengthened our capacity to take such steps.
The improvements in capability and readiness I have outlined are clear evidence of the effectiveness of the Defence Reform Program. The benefits of these reforms will increase further as the program matures.
Our commitment is to build a sharper, more combat focussed, better equipped and more mobile and operationally ready Defence Force- the precise priority we believe Australians expect.
Central to all of this is the contribution of our service men and women. No one who has seen our people in action, on operations or disaster relief, can fail to be proud of the professionalism and dedication of our young men and women.
On my own visits to defence units around Australia and to our deployed forces on Bougainville and Malaysia, I have been impressed by the quality and commitment of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.
I am conscious too of the special and important contribution made by the families of our soldiers, sailors and airmen. Their ongoing support is vital.
In conclusion, as Minister for Defence, I reaffirm this Government's commitment to Defence reform and to the provision of a modern and responsive Defence Force capable of protecting Australia's interests.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Defence Reform Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,25,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-03-11,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Committee on Publications on its inquiry into the future of the Parliamentary Papers Series and seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Government Response to Recommendations of the Joint Committee on Publications contained in its Report:
FUTURE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS SERIES
The Joint Committee reported on the future of the parliamentary papers series in December 1997. On 10 November 1998, the Presiding Officers responded to recommendations 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and noted recommendations 2, 3 and 9.
The Government's response to recommendations 2, 3, and 9 is as follows. 

Recommendation 2
Ministers should ensure that agencies for which they have responsibility fulfil the obligation to produce sufficient copies of documents for the parliamentary papers series. A report identifying those agencies which default should be tabled in each House every twelve months.
Response
The Government notes that in tabling the report, the Chairman of the Committee indicated that the Committee had written to ministers to remind them of agencies' obligations and proposed to present a report to the Parliament every 12 months identifying any agencies that are in default.
The Government accepts this recommendation. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wrote to all secretaries of departments and heads of agencies in March 1998 about their responsibility to provide copies of tabled reports for inclusion in the parliamentary papers series.
In March 1998, AusInfo, a new unit within the Department of Finance and Administration which superseded the Australian Government Publishing Service, initiated meetings with representatives of the parliamentary departments and the new owner of the operations of the former Government Printing Office, to ensure that effective management of the parliamentary papers series continued.
Recommendation 3
Government agencies producing parliamentary papers should publish the documents electronically as well as in print. The Committee intends regularly to monitor developments in this area and will report on progress in twelve months' time.
Where agencies do not produce these documents electronically, the reason for not so doing should be advised to the Minister in the letter of transmittal accompanying the document. 
Response
Increasing numbers of documents are being published electronically. AusInfo is developing guidelines for Commonwealth information published in electronic formats, which are intended to be released in early 1999. AusInfo has issued a newsletter on guidelines and best practice for Commonwealth information published in electronic formats.
The issue of explaining non-publication by electronic means in the letter of transmittal will be examined in the revision of the Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Reports  co-ordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
Recommendation 9
Ministers should ensure that agencies for which they have responsibility fulfil their statutory obligation under the provisions of the Copyright 
 Act 1968 to deposit a copy of their publications with the National Library of Australia.
Response
The National Library of Australia is a recipient of deposit copies of government publications under the Commonwealth Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes. AusInfo wrote to all secretaries of departments and heads of agencies in March 1998 reminding them of the need to provide deposit copies for the schemes.
AusInfo followed-up with distribution of a guideline on the schemes in July 1998.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Publications Committee</title>,Committees,26,1

The Government notes that in tabling the report, the Chairman of the Committee indicated that the Committee had written to ministers to remind them of agencies' obligations and proposed to present a report to the Parliament every 12 months identifying any agencies that are in default.
The Government accepts this recommendation. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wrote to all secretaries of departments and heads of agencies in March 1998 about their responsibility to provide copies of tabled reports for inclusion in the parliamentary papers series.
In March 1998, AusInfo, a new unit within the Department of Finance and Administration which superseded the Australian Government Publishing Service, initiated meetings with representatives of the parliamentary departments and the new owner of the operations of the former Government Printing Office, to ensure that effective management of the parliamentary papers series continued.
Recommendation 3
Government agencies producing parliamentary papers should publish the documents electronically as well as in print. The Committee intends regularly to monitor developments in this area and will report on progress in twelve months' time.
Where agencies do not produce these documents electronically, the reason for not so doing should be advised to the Minister in the letter of transmittal accompanying the document. 
Response
Increasing numbers of documents are being published electronically. AusInfo is developing guidelines for Commonwealth information published in electronic formats, which are intended to be released in early 1999. AusInfo has issued a newsletter on guidelines and best practice for Commonwealth information published in electronic formats.
The issue of explaining non-publication by electronic means in the letter of transmittal will be examined in the revision of the Guidelines for the Preparation of Annual Reports  co-ordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
Recommendation 9
Ministers should ensure that agencies for which they have responsibility fulfil their statutory obligation under the provisions of the Copyright 
 Act 1968 to deposit a copy of their publications with the National Library of Australia.
Response
The National Library of Australia is a recipient of deposit copies of government publications under the Commonwealth Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes. AusInfo wrote to all secretaries of departments and heads of agencies in March 1998 reminding them of the need to provide deposit copies for the schemes.
AusInfo followed-up with distribution of a guideline on the schemes in July 1998.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,26,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-11,"—I rise to speak tonight slightly earlier than I expected. I will start by voicing a few words of congratulations to the Prime Minister for the wisdom and maturity he showed in appointing an ambassador who is 
 proud of his relationship with another man and for recognising that person's abilities regardless of criticism that others in the community have made about that person's pride in their relationship.
As was reported in the media recently, Australia's new ambassador to Denmark recently presented his same-sex partner to the Queen of Denmark, which is particularly appropriate because in 1989 Denmark became the first country in the world to allow civil marriages between homosexuals. I gather from the newspapers that Mr Howard would have been well aware of the ambassador's sexual orientation as he had been an adviser in the Prime Minister's office prior to taking up his diplomatic appointment last month. While the ambassador's sexuality per se is largely irrelevant, with the level of homophobia that still exists in places in the Australian community this type of proud public display of a relationship is very welcome.
The next step is for the equal rights that have been granted to senior public servants, especially those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to be extended to include all Commonwealth employees. The Australian Council for Lesbian and Gay Rights has called for spousal rights to be extended to all Commonwealth public servants in same-sex relationships, including members of the defence forces and the Australian Federal Police.
Most gay and lesbian employees of the Commonwealth do not have the same rights as their heterosexual colleagues in areas like relocation allowances, family leave and other employment conditions. With the exception of limited protection against unfair dismissal for federal employees on the grounds of sexual orientation—measures which do not apply to state based employees—federal legislation in Australia prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexuality or transgender identity is notably lacking.
Recently, in my home state of Queensland, the Minister for Family Services, Anna Bligh, has been urged by many in the community to honour her promise to rewrite the Domestic Violence Act to cover same-sex couples, their families and children. Western Australia is the 
 only state with absolutely no equal opportunity legislation offering any sort of protection for sexual minorities. The Democrats have been seeking support for the Sexuality Discrimination Bill, which my WA state based colleague Helen Hodgson introduced in the Western Australian state parliament in 1997. The bill seeks to equalise the age of consent at 16 for everyone, to amend the Equal Opportunity Act to include sexuality and transgendered identity in its protections and to repeal the homophobic preamble and the proselytising clause of the 1990 decriminalisation law.
In New South Wales, before the 1995 election, the Labor government promised to introduce in its first term legislation to recognise same-sex relationships. It failed to do so. Last June, Democrat MP Elizabeth Kirby introduced a private member's bill—the De Facto Relationships Amendment Bill—into the upper house to try to redress this failure on the part of the Labor government. I am proud of the efforts of the Democrats over many years in fighting for inclusion and recognition of same-sex couples in legislation, but we are quite happy, indeed keen, to share that limelight with as many others as possible who support our moves in this area.
I speak as the Democrat spokesperson for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. This can be a bit of a mouthful, so sometimes use the abbreviation of `spokesperson on sexuality'. In human sexuality, there are more variations in identity than there are labels, and the community has been quite ingenious in reclaiming words like `queer'. Homer J. Simpson spoke for ignorance based homophobes everywhere when he complained about the appropriation of that word. He said, `You can't use that word. That's our word for making fun of you.'
I note that I have been outed by the Melbourne Star Observer in their Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras coverage as a `heterosexual Queenslander'. As the saying goes, we're not all straight in the sunshine state. Like that other purple aficionado, Tinky Winky, I prefer not to comment on speculation about sexuality and sexual orientation. Nonetheless, I will be proud to retain the role of spokesperson on 
 gay and lesbian issues when senator-elect Brian Greig enters the Senate in July—only the second openly gay man to serve in this chamber. He is not, despite the inevitable focus on his history as a gay activist, a single-issue senator.
The substantive matter I wish to speak on tonight is the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade held in Sydney on 26 February. This was the 21st anniversary of the original civil rights demonstration. In 1978 many of those who marched were beaten and arrested. Fifty-three were charged and their names were published on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald, which led to many losing their jobs. It is a shame in 1999 that John Howard as PM still will not send a message of support or goodwill for this enormous, diverse and creative community event.
Again unfortunately from Queensland, the Family Council of Queensland, which claims to have 50,000 members, put out a public call threatening to boycott major companies and asked them to explain why they were advertising in the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras guidebook. Let me give them a hint. Qantas alone earns $1.5 million from international visitors and the mardi gras attracts more international and interstate visitors than any other cultural festival in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth or Adelaide. But it is not just about money. Indeed, that is one of the least important aspects.
The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is not just the parade, which I was thrilled to participate again in this year along with over 2,000 other people and with 600,000-plus people watching on the streets, many more people watching the TV coverage, 350 media personnel and an Internet live netcast, which this year received 50,000 hits from over 100 countries. The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is not just the party later and it is not just Fair Day on Valentine's Day. Nor is it just the Mardi Gras swimming carnival or the other public exhibitions and performances which major museums, theatres, concert halls, pubs and playhouses participate in. There is not time here to describe the scope of this month-long festival which attracts thousands of tourists and millions of tourist dollars to Australia and sends a vital 
 message to the world that Australia is a diverse, tolerant and occasionally glamorous community.
It is a shame that the Prime Minister wants no part of it—not that I think the mardi gras suffers from lacking the PM's stamp of approval. I think it is a shame because I imagine the Prime Minister has never attended a Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade and I think he would personally benefit from the joyful, proud and vibrant atmosphere of that occasion. For some years now the Australian Democrats have participated in this event. My federal parliamentary colleague Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, my state college in New South Wales Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, the two WA Democrats I have mentioned just before, Helen Hodgson and Brian Greig, myself and well over 100 Democrat members took part on the night. It was also pleasing to see the participation of Clover Moore, an Independent member in New South Wales, who has well represented the inner city community electorate of Bligh and been a strong supporter, defender and promoter of gay rights. The inclusion of friends, relatives, colleagues and groups such as the Uniting Church, the New South Wales Police Force and the Australian Democrats is important in showing that gays and lesbians and those who support them are citizens, workers, parents, old, young, different races, disabled—in short, representative of the Australian community as a whole—as well as showing some glitter, glamour, fit and fabulous, half-naked gyraters who usually make the news.
Fortunately, Premier Bob Carr and opposition leader Kerry Chikarovski were present only in the form of a reversible effigy—a timely pre-election condemnation of the failure by New South Wales political leaders to address the issue of legal recognition for same-sex couples. There were also representatives from religious groups such as the Quakers, the Metropolitan Community Church and Jewish groups. Appropriately in the Interna 
 tional Year of Older Persons there were many older people marching. There was the usual humour and satire and it was all round a very colourful and uplifting experience.
There was a sizeable remembrance contingent which honoured the memory of those who have died and paid tribute to those living with, or affected by, HIV. There were quilt panels commemorating lost loved ones. The National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research staged a fully costumed battle between the virus, protease inhibitors and T-cells. One of the most poignant moments of the night emerged in the tribute to the former South Australian Premier Don Dunstan, who passed away with cancer a month ago. He was a hero to many, including many in the gay and lesbian community, for his progressive advocacy of rights for homosexuals. His long-standing partner was present and I certainly send sincere condolences to him for his loss.
I congratulate and thank the organisers, the police on crowd control and the 1,300 volunteer officials who lined the parade route helping to control the crowds of around 600,000. There was only one arrest, which is 52 fewer than 22 years ago, so we are making some progress. The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade is infused with an atmosphere of friendliness, humour, pride and humanity. I feel genuinely sorry for everyone who was not there, but I feel particularly sad for those—like the Prime Minister—who were not there because they are under the mistaken belief that there is something wrong with it.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras</title>,Adjournment,33,1
